Once again ( here , here and here ) the situation is tense around the Lal Masjid in Pakistan ’s capital , Islamabad .
More tense than it has been before .
So tense , in fact , that it seems like a real battle this time .
Fire has been exchanged , one soldier of the Pakistan Rangers has been killed and a number of madrassah students wounded .
According to The News :
A Rangers man was killed and two wounded in shootout between Lal Masjid students and Rangers .
The incident caused tension in the locality in Islamabad resulting in closure of shopping centres and shops .
The incident also caused traffic jam in the area .
Federal Minister of Interior Aftab Sherpao has demanded the mosque administration to hand over persons involved in the firing over the law enforcement agencies to authorities .
A girl and several security men have been wounded in the firing incident , which were transferred to hospital .
Emergency has been declared and alert announced at all hospitals in the federal capital .
An official of Rangers talking to the media has said that the students of Lal Masjid started the firing .
Talking to Geo News Federal Minister of Interior Aftab Sherpao has said the government does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want bloodshed but it would not tolerate such incidents of lawlessness .
He demanded hand over of the people involved in the incident to the authorities .
Dawn ’s breaking news adds :
A soldier was killed and at least a dozen people were injured in clashes between security forces and students from IslamabadÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Laal Masjid Tuesday , officials said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ One Ranger is dead , Ã¢â‚¬ ?
Colonel Mashallah from the paramilitary Rangers force told AFP outside the Laal Masjid in Islamabad .
Two policemen were also wounded .
An AFP correspondent saw eight injured girls at a local hospital who were brought in from the seminary attached to the mosque , four of whom were unconscious .
Officials said more were coming in .
An AP story published in USA Today adds more :
Shooting broke out at a radical mosque in Pakistan ’s capital Tuesday after militant students clashed with security forces deployed to contain their activities .
One paramilitary soldier shot in the clash died later in hospital , doctors said .
Reporters also saw several female students being taken to a hospital , apparently suffering from the effects of tear gas fired by police .
The battle broke out after male and female students from the mosque , some of them armed with guns or wooden poles , rushed toward a police checkpoint near the Lal Masjid , or Red Mosque , in Islamabad .
Police fired tear gas to hold them back and , as the students retreated , an Associated Press photographer saw at least four male students , some of them masked , fire shots toward the checkpoint some 200 yards away .
Gunfire was also heard from the police position .
A man used the mosque ’s loudspeakers to order suicide bombers to get into position .
“ They have attacked our mosque , the time for sacrifice has come , ” the man said .
An hour later , dozens of students were patrolling the area around the mosque , and sporadic shots were still heard .
There was no sign of police moving in on the mosque …
Hundreds of police and paramilitary rangers have taken up position near the mosque in recent days .
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf said last week that he was ready to raid the mosque , but warned that suicide bombers from a militant group linked to al - Qaeda had slipped into the building .
By way of context , note this from today ’s Dawn ( written before this current incident ) :
In a bid to tighten noose around the Lal Masjid administration , the government on Monday reinforced the Rangers force deployed near the mosque with another two wings , each with 500 personnel and lodged them in apartments recently vacated by the Punjab Constabulary near Aabpara .
A senior security official , however , told Dawn that the government had no intention of conducting any raid on the mosque and its seminaries .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ But the forces deployed near the mosque will take stern action against Lal Masjid students if they take law in their own hands or attack any massage centre or CDs shop , Ã¢â‚¬ ?
he added .
The official said the number of Rangers deployed near the mosque had now gone up to 1,500 and they were being supported by 500 police commandos .
… Sources said that Lal Masjid also had reinforced its brigade by calling more activists from other areas and seminaries .
The sources said they had reports that the Lal Masjid brigade had advanced weapons , wireless systems and special masks to be used in the event of a gas attack …
Meanwhile , the local administration has directed government offices and other people to vacate all buildings close to Lal Masjid and the building of the environment ministry has already been vacated for the safety of its employees .
Both the security forces and the Lal Masjid brigade have taken positions and made bunkers .
The mosqueÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s students have also blocked a road with electricity poles .
All of this protends that the ‘ battle for Lal Masjid ’ may already have begun .
The folks in the mosque seem more eager to fight than the government .
The government also has much more to loose , especially with its domestic and international popularity being as shaky as it is today .
The folks at Lal Masjid and its two affiliate madrassahs – Hafsa and Faridia – will declare victory no matter what happens .
One hopes that whatever happens will happen with no more bloodshed than has already happened .
One hopes , of course .
But oneis not really hopeful .
Khuda khair karey !

Pro-war group launches $ 15 million ad blitz
A new group , Freedom ’s Watch , is launching Wednesday with a $ 15 million , five - week campaign of TV , radio and Web ads featuring military veterans that is aimed at retaining support in Congress for President Bush ’s “ surge ” policy on Iraq .
" For those who believe in peace through strength , the cavalry is coming , " said former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer , who is a founding board member of the group .

The big ad buy , funded by high - profile Republicans who were aides and supporters of President Bush , reflects a furious public relations battle that will unfold as Congress debates the crucial progress report by Gen.
David Petraeus , which is due Sept. 15 .
“ There was a large vacuum on the conservative side , ” said Bradley A. Blakeman , who is president and chief executive officer of Freedom ’s Watch .
“ People decided that the time has come to fight back .
This is a grass - roots campaign aimed at ensuring that Congress continues to fully fund the troops with the ultimate goal of victory in the war on terror . ”
The opening ad , by Jamestown Associates of New Jersey , shows a military veteran saying : “ Congress was right to vote to fight terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I re-enlisted after Sept. 11 because I do n’t want my sons to see what I saw .
I want them to be free and safe .
I know what I lost .
I also know that if we pull out now , everything I ’ve given and the sacrifices will mean nothing .
They attacked us , and they will again .
They wo n’t stop in Iraq .
We are winning on the ground and making real progress .
It ’s no time to quit .
It ’s no time for politics . ”
Organizers said the ads will run on Fox News Channel , CNN and elsewhere , with radio versions airing nationally during the conservative talk shows of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity .
Americans Against Escalation in Iraq – formed by the Service Employees International Union , MoveOn.org Political Action , the Center for American Progress Action Fund and other liberal and progressive organizations – struck back immediately with a statement denouncing Freedom ’s Watch as a “ White House P.R. front group ” and an “ attack group . ”
The two groups will be squaring off for months to come .
Americans Against Escalation in Iraq says on its website : “ Many of the organizations coming together to lead Americans Against Escalation in Iraq are those that successfully mounted a national campaign in 2005 to defeat President Bush 's effort to privatize Social Security .
Using that same campaign model , these organizations are joining with more traditional anti-war forces , veterans and students to mount this campaign because the stakes are so high and because the future of a generation of Americans is on the line . ”
Freedom's Watch aims to do for the GOP what the MoveOn political action organizations have done for Democrats .
Blakeman , who was a member the White House senior staff in Bush ’s first term , said Freedom ’s Watch is designed as “ a never - ending campaign – a stable , credible voice of reason on generational issues that wo n’t rise and fall with election cycles . ”
The board consists of Blakeman ; Fleischer ; Mel Sembler , a Florida Republican who was Bush ’s ambassador to Italy ; William P. Weidner , president and chief operating officer of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. ; and Matt Brooks , executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition .
The donors include Sembler ; Anthony Gioia , a Buffalo businessman who was Bush ’s ambassador to Malta ; Kevin Moley , who was Bush ’s ambassador to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Geneva ; Howard Leach , a former Republican National Committee finance chairman who was Bush ’s ambassador to France ; Dr. John Templeton of Pennsylvania , chairman and president of the John Templeton Foundation ; Ed Snider , chairman of Comcast Spectacor , the huge Philadelphia sports and entertainment firm ; Sheldon Adelson , chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corp . and ranked by Forbes magazine as the third - wealthiest American ; and Richard Fox , who is chairman of the Jewish Policy Center and was Pennsylvania State Chairman of the Reagan / Bush campaign in 1980 .
Blakeman said the ads are meant to “ communicate to the American people , to Congress and to the world that there ’s another side to the story , and that America should not and must not surrender , because appeasement does n’t work . ”
“ There ’s a significant voice out there that believes that , but it was n’t breaking through organizationally or in the media , ” he said .
Details of the new group 's ad buy reveal a sophisticated plan for pressuring vulnerable members of Congress to stick with the administration .
Opponents of the war say they have uncovered Freedom ’s Watch buys in 33 television markets , from Albuquerque , N.M. , to Bangor , Maine , to Little Rock , Ark .
In many cases , according to the opponents ’ tally , the advertisements will air in the districts or home states of Republican incumbents who have wavered in their support for the administration on Iraq .
The two biggest expenditures appeared to be in Philadelphia and Washington .
There are smaller ad buys in places like Bend , Ore. Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore. ) , who faces a tough race , was among the first GOP senators to call for an end to the war .
Blakeman would not confirm the buys , calling the list “ propaganda by our enemies . "
The tally found that the group will air ads in states like Kentucky , where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has become a top Democratic target , and in Maine , where Republican Sen .
Susan Collins is locked in a tough reelection race and has taken heat for her stance on the war .
Other advertising buys have targeted moderate Republican districts like those of Reps. Jim Ramstad of Minnesota and Vernon J. Ehlers of Michigan .
Freedom ’s
Watch has a few full - time employees and is hiring more , and plans to open an office in the Chinatown area of Washington around Labor Day .
The group is organized under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the tax code , meaning that it can lobby on issues but cannot expressly advocate for specific candidates .
Its stated mission is “ to ensure a strong national defense and a powerful effort to confront and defeat global terrorism . ”
The Politico ’s Martin Kady II contributed to this report .

In recent years , the US Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) has struggled to handle the massive deluge of patent applications filed by major technology firms .
The volume and complexity of the patent filings exceeds the limits of the USPTO 's resources and manpower , leading to long delays and inadequate review .
Patent litigation is slowly strangling the technology industry and the USPTO 's inability to handle its workload definitely is n't helping .
In response to the immediate need for reform , the USPTO is experimenting with a new way to make the patent review process more efficient and transparent : imitate the Wikipedia model and leverage the Internet hive mind .
The USPTO is collaborating with the New York Law School 's Institute for Information Law and Policy to implement a pilot program that uses Internet crowdsourcing to evaluate patent applications .
Created to facilitate the pilot program , the Peer - to - Patent web site encourages participants to review and discuss patent applications , research prior art , and rate submissions posted by other users .
Approximately 250 technology patent applications that relate to topics like computer architecture , software , and information security will be reviewed during the pilot program .
The site launched late last month with patents applications filed by Intel , IBM , and Red Hat .
An announcement issued today by the New York Law School reveals that over 1,000 public peer reviewers have already participated in the Peer - to - Patent program .
Three new patent applications have been added to the lineup , including a patent filed by Microsoft that covers a mechanism for allowing content creators and distributors to cash in on off - line transfers of digital media .
" We 're thrilled with the support and open approach shown by Microsoft , Intel , and so many other companies , " says Beth Noveck , the director of the New York Law School 's Institute for Information Law and Policy .
" In particular , we expect significant interest in Microsoft 's application , as it relates to an important topic in the online world , digital rights management . "
The Peer - to - Patent web site also gained several new features this week , including broader support for e-mail and RSS notification , automatic hyperlinking of URLs included in comments , and support for longer comments .
Tech industry heavyweights like Microsoft , IBM , and Intel have acknowledged the need for reform .
In recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearings evaluating proposed patent reforms , a coalition of technology companies including Microsoft , Apple , Cisco , and Intel jointly called for Congress to pass the Patent Reform Act .
IBM , which already voluntarily publishes all of its patent applications for public review , seems to think that legislative reform is necessary but insufficient .
Published earlier this year , a BusinessWeek article written David Kappos — IBM vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property law — argues that collaboration and consensus is the key to solving the patent problem .
" Consensus must underpin action , " says Kappos .
" For while the Supreme Court can adjudicate , Congress legislate , and the USPTO and private sector innovate , we wo n't have broad progress until all parties work with one another , with the right balance , moderation , and the greater good at heart . "
Perhaps the Peer - to - Patent pilot program is the first step towards building that collaboration .
Brain areas that control attention were thinnest in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) who carried a particular version of a gene in a study by the National Institutes of Health's ( NIH ) National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) .
However , the areas , on the right side of the brain 's outer mantle , or cortex , normalized in thickness during the teen years in these children , coinciding with clinical improvement .
Although this particular gene version increased risk for ADHD , it also predicted better clinical outcomes and higher IQ than two other common versions of the same gene in youth with ADHD .
" Since this gene version had similar structural effects in healthy children as in children with the disorder , our findings suggest that ADHD is at the far end of a continuum of normal traits , " said Philip Shaw , M.D. , NIMH Child Psychiatry Branch , who led the research .
" ADHD likely stems from interactions between several such genes and non-genetic factors . "
Shaw , Judith Rapoport M.D. , and colleagues report on their magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study in the August 2007 Archives of General Psychiatry .
" This study provides us with a first glimpse of how variation in a specific gene influences both brain development and clinical prognosis in ADHD , " said NIMH Director Thomas R. Insel , M.D .
When the NIMH researchers first reported last year that normalization of right cortex thickening was associated with better clinical outcomes in ADHD , there were few hints of a genetic connection .
Yet evidence from several previous studies led them to suspect involvement of an ADHD - implicated version of a gene that codes for a receptor protein that binds to the brain chemical messenger dopamine .
advertisement
This version of the dopamine D4 receptor gene , called the 7 - repeat variant , accounts for about 30 percent of the genetic risk for ADHD , making it by far the strongest candidate gene implicated in the disorder .
It 's called the 7 - repeat because it contains the same repeating sequence in its genetic code seven times .
Everyone inherits two copies of the D4 receptor gene , one from each parent , so some people have two copies of the same version while others may carry two different versions .
For the current study , the researchers scanned and determined the D4 gene types of 105 children with ADHD and 103 healthy controls and re-scanned them through their teen years .
They found that nearly one - fourth of youth with ADHD and in about one - sixth of the healthy controls had at least one copy of the 7 - repeat version .
Nearly two thirds of the ADHD youth and three - fourths of the healthy controls had the most common 4 - repeat version ; fewer than one - tenth in each group had a 2 - repeat version .
While the 7 - repeat version was linked to thinner attention - controlling cortex in both ADHD and healthy subjects , it appeared to confer advantage only among youth with ADHD .
For example , participants with ADHD who lacked at least one copy of this 7 - repeat variant had significantly lower IQs , and more than half of them still had pronounced ADHD symptoms when followed - up about six years later , compared to only 21 percent of those with at least one copy of the 7 - repeat variant .
There was also a trend toward better overall functioning among those with at least one copy of the 7 - repeat variant at follow - up .
The MRI scans revealed that 7 - repeat carriers with ADHD started out with the thinnest cortex areas important for controlling attention ( right orbitofrontal and posterior parieto - occipital ) .
The next thinnest were children with ADHD who did not have the 7 - repeat version , followed by healthy children with the 7 - repeat .
Healthy children lacking the 7 - repeat had the thickest cortex , but this did not appear to affect their IQ .
However , the researchers note that other studies have found correlations between cortex thickness and certain measures of memory and intelligence .
In 7 - repeat carriers with ADHD , the attention - controlling areas thickened to normal by age 16 ( see time - lapse image below ) .
Gene variants of two other dopamine system components showed few such anatomic correlates , confirming that the findings were specific to the D4 receptor gene .
" Some genes have a good side , even though they 're linked to disorder , " said Shaw , who noted that other traits linked to the 7 - repeat version , such as novelty seeking and impulsiveness , might confer advantage in some settings .
" Evidence suggests that the 7 - repeat may be a relatively new variant that may have been favored through evolution because such traits proved adaptive for survival . "
The researchers are following up with studies on the relationship between cortex thickness and cognitive features of ADHD , such as working memory and the ability to inhibit responses .
Also participating in the research were : Jay Giedd , Michele Gornick , Jason Lerch , Anjene Addington , Jeffrey Seal , Deanna Greenstein , Wendy Sharp , NIMH ; Alan Evans , McGill University ; F.Xavier Castellanos , New York University .
Paper Publishes Larry Craig 's Voicemail to his Lawyer
Bump and Update : Check out the voicemail Sen. Larry Craig left for his lawyer Billy Martin " on a stranger 's phone " minutes before his resignation speech .
Roll Call obtained the voicemail after it was offered for sale and refused by the Idaho Statesman .
McJoan at Daily Kos posts the entire transcript .
Update : Here 's the audio of the call from Roll Call .
Sounds more like an answering machine than a voicemail to me , although I do n't know it makes a difference .
This story keeps getting weirder by the hour .
" Yes , Billy , this is Larry Craig calling .
You can reach me on my cell .
Arlen Specter is now willing to come out in my defense , arguing that it appears by all that he knows that I have been railroaded and all that .
" Having all of that , we have reshaped my statement a little bit to say it is my intent to resign on Sept. 30 .
I think it is important for you to make as bold a statement as you are comfortable with this afternoon , and I would hope you could make it in front of the cameras .
" I think it would help drive the story that I ’m willing to fight , that I ’ve got quality people out there fighting in my defense , and that this thing could take a new turn or a new shape , it has that potential .
Anyway , give me a buzz or give Mike a buzz on that .
We ’re headed to my press conference now .
" Thank you .
Bye . "
Dan Whiting , confirms the voice is Craig's .
Here 's the statement Billy Martin released Saturday .
So who did Craig call ?
Did someone close to Martin sell him out or did he really dial the wrong number ?
I wonder what the recorded message said on the phone Craig left the voice - mail on .
He 's not stupid .
If it was " Hi , this is John , please leave me a message " he would n't have left that message .
Something had to indicate to Craig he was calling Billy Martin .
No way would Billy Martin have leaked the message .
So , who is Roll Call protecting ?
My theory is below .

Part of The Simpsons ' greatness is a willingness to find the humour in absolutely everything — including science .

The Simpsons Movie comes out this week — is there much science in it ?
The crisis that precipitates the plot is environmental — Lisa 's trying to warn the town about it and she gives a lecture entitled ' An Irritating Truth ' .
She 's often the voice for the writers , even though she 's eight years old a lot of us identify with her .
But she 's also depicted as socially unpopular , and is not always listened to .
As writers do you set out to satirize public attitudes to science ?
Our general agenda is to show both sides of an issue and to let the viewer make up his or her own mind .
In my lifetime I 've seen science viewed as the saviour for everything , but now it 's almost come full circle , because nothing can completely solve everyone 's problems , and the disappointment when that happens is extreme .
So now people are casting scientists as villains and not listening to them , which I think is tragic .
But we make fun of everything , so if a scientist appears on the show we make fun of them too .
Generally our depiction of scientists is that they 're insular and have bad social lives , and say things in an obscure fashion that is n't always comprehensible to the layman .
From my limited experience in the scientific world I would n't say it 's completely off the mark .
One episode in which the show does take sides is the one in which Lisa protests against creationism in her school .
Stephen Hawking has featured as a guest character on The Simpsons .
Credit : S. CRASTO / AP
What we say is that there are conservatives , like Pope John Paul II , who believe in the theory of evolution , and that it 's far from a liberal theory : it 's scientific , it 's as close to a fact as can be .
We did say that Flanders , who opposed the teaching of evolution , is sincere in his beliefs .
We tried to take his emotions seriously .
What 's really funny is that they had a debate here between the Republican candidates [ for the presidential nomination ] , and the moderator said “ so , which of you believe in evolution ? ”
And you could see a couple sort of raising their hands and then changing their minds , and I 'm going “ how can you not be sure whether you think that 's true or not ?
It 's not a matter of opinion . ”
You 've had several famous scientists , including Stephen Hawking and Stephen Jay Gould , as guest stars on the show .
People seem thrilled that we 've had Stephen Hawking on the show , and no one could be more thrilled than I .
Although one joke that reflects the attitude of the public to science is when he appeared in front of the people of Springfield and told them what they should do , and Homer said , “ Yeah , Larry Flynt is right ! ”
Do you have a dream scientific guest who you 'd love to have on the show ?
Living or dead , it would be Isaac Newton .
But living would be a tough question .
Fifty years ago , Albert Einstein was the epitome of a scientist as far as the public were concerned , and was regarded as a hero .
But there is n't anybody comparable today .
I think it shows how science has been made by some to appear in a more ambiguous light .
The Simpsons also boasts staggeringly obscure mathematical references .
One that always makes me laugh is in a recent episode in which Homer and Marge are at a baseball game where the public has to guess the attendance , and each of the options is a different mathematical irregularity — one 's a perfect number , one 's a sum of four squares .
They 're all in the thousands and they 're numbers that nobody except a mathematician would , at face value , recognize as anything unusual , but if you 're really sharp you 'll pick it up .
I love the fact that we can throw that sort of thing in .
My favourite mathematical reference on the show was when we did an episode where Apu was a witness in a courtroom and the lawyer asked if he had a good memory .
He said , yes I do , I 've memorized pi to one million decimal places , and Homer said “ mmm ... pi ” and started drooling .
We did call Caltech [ the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena ] to check that whatever we said the millionth decimal place was was correct .
My favourite mathematical equation is eiπ + 1 = 0 , and we threw that into one episode even though not all of our audience would necessarily understand it .
In one episode Professor Frink shocks a lecture theatre into silence by shouting “ Pi is exactly three ! ”
One thing I always thought was funny was that in the 1890s , I believe , the state of Indiana declared that the value of pi was 22/ 7 .
I mean , it 's just ... the idea that you could change a mathematical concept to suit a legislative whim is nutty .
So is there a formula for writing good jokes ?
I look at comedy writing mathematically , it 's sort of like a proof in which you 're trying to find the ideal punchline for a setup , and when you get it it 's a very elegant feeling .
It 's a little like the feeling I used to get on completing a proof when I was doing maths at college .
Several Simpsons writers have backgrounds in maths and science .
Are you a bunch of geeks at heart ?
When we 're alone we talk about maths [ chuckles ] , but we 've learned that there 's a wider world , so we do n't always expose others to it , and we do it in a subtle way .
Do you ever regret not pursuing your mathematical studies ?
I would n't have been among the top people in my field ; there were guys I knew in maths who were just the best .
I do n't know if I would ever have achieved what they did , so I 'm very happy doing what I 'm doing .
And what does Nature have to do to get a mention on The Simpsons ?
We should mention Nature !
There 's still time , we 're only 400 episodes young ... ( see Box )
Box 1 : “ In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics ” The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons , as chosen by Nature 's editorial staff “ Bart 's comet ” :
After sabotaging a weather balloon , Bart accidentally discovers a comet about to hit Springfield .
Deep impact miraculously avoided , bartender
Moe comes up with a new form of planetary defence : “ Let 's go burn down the observatory so this will never happen again . ”
Inherit my shorts :
In the episode “ The Monkey Suit , ” the Simpsons ' pious next door neighbour Ned Flanders is flabbergasted that the science museum 's exhibit on the origins of man both highlights evolution and makes light of creationism — and , to top it all , has a unisex bathroom .
Professor Frink divides the circumference by the diameter .

In a Halloween episode two - dimensional Homer travels to the third dimension , which looks a lot like “ that movie Tron ” , but with more equations .
Writer David X. Cohen was responsible for the funniest and geekiest : 178212 + 184112 = 192212 , an incorrect disproof of Fermat 's last theorem produced by a computer program Cohen wrote for the purpose .
“ Bye bye nerdie ” : Lisa isolates the element in nerd sweat that makes them irresistible targets for bullies .
She presents her data at a conference with luminaries including former surgeon general C. Everett Koop , a scene in which we find the true purpose of a science pole .
Better living through chemistry : “ Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones , car batteries , handguns and many things made of zinc , ” says Jimmy , a character in an educational film .
When confronted with a world without zinc he attempts suicide but fails , as his zinc - free gun cannot work .
Piltdown angel :
In “ Lisa the Skeptic ” an almost complete human skeleton with angel 's wings pits science — Lisa and guest star Stephen Jay Gould — against faith , as defended by Ned Flanders : “ Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends .
Well I say that there are some things we do n't want to know .
Important things ! ”
Trips to Stockholm :
In another Halloween episode , chemistry Nobel prizewinner Dudley Herschbach appears on the show to present Professor Frink with a Nobel prize of his own .
Herschbach won the prize for crossed - molecular - beam techniques with which to study in detail the dynamics of chemical reactions .
Frink is rewarded for reanimating his dead father .
Forensics files : DNA evidence in “ Who Shot Mr. Burns ” correctly identifies the assailant as a member of the Simpson family ( Maggie , the baby , as it turned out ) .

The road to dominion
The greatest ascents all began the same way : by laying the first stone .
From there it 's entirely in your hands .
Expand your reach until that first settlement in the shade of a tree becomes an empire on which the sun never sets .
Explore the world and find oases of wealth .
And , ultimately , eliminate all those trying to get in your way .
The fruits of your labor will show with each building , each soldier and each advance that makes your civilization flourish .
What do you do when the FBI raids your home and finds porn all over your PC ?
One man , who had his home computer seized by the bureau , has decided that his best course of action is to sue the companies that failed to keep that data private for him .
This week , Michael Alan Crooker filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts Supreme Court alleging that Microsoft falsely claimed that its products would keep his information secure .
In 2004 , Crooker had his home raided by agents based on reports that he owned bomb - making materials .
Agents eventually discovered " laboratory devices , apparent IEDs , fermenting castor beans , chemicals and chemical equipment appropriate for the processing of castor beans into ricin , and what appeared to be ricin and ricin precursors in various stages of development , indicating that Crooker was successfully manufacturing ricin . "
Unsurprisingly , the FBI confiscated his home PC as part of the process .
While Crooker did have an encryption mechanism installed to keep his porn , ballistics recipes , and data safe , the FBI 's Cryptologic and Electronic Analysis group were able to break through the Compaq DriveLock security layer with help from Hewlett - Packard .
The agents found a wide array of files ranging from home sex videos to cached pornographic web pages , eventually embarrassing Crooker and leading to this lawsuit .
In the lawsuit , Crooker argues that Internet Explorer was set to delete his browsing history after five days , but the software failed to do so .
" Any day beyond those parameters is supposed to be permanently deleted and is not supposed to be recoverable , " he said .
While Crooker 's claim against Internet Explorer may be valid , the bigger problem seems to be that Circuit City assured him when he purchased the PC in 2004 that Windows XP , Internet Explorer , and a barrage of other security products would keep his information totally secure .
A lawsuit filed by Crooker against Hewlett - Packard was thrown out in May 2006 due to Crooker 's inability to file the correct papers and pay a $ 250 filing fee .
In the lawsuit against Microsoft , Crooker states that he has already reached settlement with both Circuit City and Hewlett - Packard .
Crooker is seeking US $ 200,000 in compensatory and punitive damages from Microsoft .
According to AMD ’s review of the Fallout 4 VR , this is a revolutionary product that will completely change the rules of the game .
The team at AMD seems to be particularly excited about this installment , and they even called it “ the Mario and Sonic ” of the VR games .
What Is Fallout 4 VR ?
In case you have n’t heard about it , the Fallout 4 VR is a version of the Fallout 4 game that had been announced for the HTC Vive last year .
However , we did n’t get the chance to see any footage of it as yet .
Roy Taylor , who is the corporate vice president at AMD , has seen the footage , and from what he says , he is truly believing in its potential .
MCV reported that he declared this installment to be an industry changer and that it will change the way in which we perceive VR .
Moreover , Taylor compared it with the famous games Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog , in the sense that both of them have been essential for the way in which consoles initially developed .
At the same time , they influenced lots of other games that came after them , each for its own type of console .
Naturally , there ’s a lot of talking about the upcoming Fallout 4 VR game , since it is supposedly going to be the first rich VR game that can keep you entertained for hours in a row .
If indeed the developers at Bethesda are preparing something unique and revolutionary , then we can already bet that the cynical users will soon cross to the other side as soon as the product will be released .
Thankfully , Pete Hines from Bethesda announced that the game will be present at the E3 conference held by the developers this year .
MAY 31 -- If federal prosecutors get their way , Uncle Sam will one day own the web site pissedonpornstars.com .
That 's because Paul Little - - described as a ' Hollywood director and producer ' in a Department of Justice press release -- has been indicted on federal obscenity counts .
The 50 - year - old Little , who uses the handle ' Max Hardcore , ' was named in a ten - count indictment charging him with transporting obscene matter via mail and computer .
A copy of the indictment , which was filed in Tampa , Florida and unsealed yesterday , can be found below .
As described in the DOJ release , Little ( pictured right ) is a 'nationally - known director , producer , and star of films featuring acts such as anal penetration , urination , insertion of an entire hand into a vagina or anus , vomiting , and severe violence ' towards female performers .
The government seeks forfeiture of Little 's web sites , maxhardcore.com , catalinaxx.com , and pissedonpornstars.com , and several films referred to in the indictment .

A century - old dream of neuroscientists to visualize a memory has been fulfilled , as University of California , Irvine researchers , using newly developing microscopic techniques , have captured first - time images of the changes in brain cell connections following a common form of learning .
Detailed in today ’s issue of the Journal of Neuroscience , the study shows that synaptic connections in a region of rats ’ brains critical to learning change shape when the rodents learn to navigate a new , complex environment .
In turn , when drugs are administered that block these changes , the rats do n’t learn , confirming the essential role the shape change plays in the production of stable memory .
“ This is the first time anyone has seen the physical substrate , the ‘ face , ’ of newly encoded memory .
We have cleared a hurdle that once seemed insurmountable , ” said Gary Lynch , professor of psychiatry and human behavior at UC Irvine and leader of one of the two research teams involved in the studies .
The new behavioral experiments followed a series of recent discoveries by the UC Irvine group concerning the synaptic changes responsible for long - term potentiation ( LTP ) , a physiological effect closely related to memory storage .
Those studies used brain slices from rats , maintained alive in experimental chambers , to identify chemical markers for synapses that had recently experienced the LTP effect .
The new study used live animals .
Working with advanced microscopic techniques called restorative deconvolution microscopy , the UC Irvine team found that the LTP - related markers appear during learning and are associated with expanded synapses in the hippocampus .
Because the size of a synapse relates to its effectiveness in transmitting messages between neurons , the new results indicate that learning improves communication between particular groups of brain cells .
The findings open the way for one of the great objectives of the life sciences : mapping the distribution of memory across brain regions .
The quest for the location of memory traces , or “ engrams ” as they are often called , preoccupied researchers for much of the 20th century but failed because there was no way to tag synapses modified by recent learning .
The new results from the UC Irvine studies remove this obstacle .
UC Irvine researchers will shortly set up a consortium of laboratories directed at producing the first maps of memory .

( CNN ) -- Most Iranians support nuclear inspections , a democratic government and normal relations with the United States , a poll by a U.S. - based organization has found .
A majority said President Ahmadinejad has not kept his promise to " put oil money on the table of the people . "
Terror Free Tomorrow found 80 percent of Iranians support full inspections and a guarantee not to develop nuclear weapons in return for aid from other countries .
Slightly more than half , however , said they still favor the development of nuclear weapons and think the country would be safer with them .
Developing the weapons is considered a " very important " priority for just 29 percent of those polled .
But when presented with an option to give up nuclear weapons development in return for outside aid , only 17 percent still supported nuclear weapons development .
The economy is more important to Iranians than developing nuclear weapons .
Eighty - eight percent said they want economic improvement to be the government 's top priority .
The poll also found 56 percent think President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has failed to keep his campaign promise to " put oil money on the table of the people themselves . "
Additionally , 61 percent of those interviewed " were willing to tell our pollsters over the phone that they oppose the current Iranian system of government , where the Supreme Leader rules according to religious principles and cannot be chosen or replaced by direct vote of the people . "
Instead , 79 percent support a democratic system in which leaders are elected through free , direct elections .
And while nearly two - thirds support financial assistance for opposition groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah , 55 percent of Iranians support recognizing Israel and Palestine as independent states in exchange for normal relations with the United States .
Terror Free Tomorrow , which has prominent Democrats and Republicans on its advisory board , conducted interviews in Farsi with 1,000 Iranians by telephone last month .
The sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
" Face - to - face interviewing in Iran can be difficult for interviewers who risk possible prosecution and imprisonment .
The last poll to ask similar controversial questions was conducted in September 2002 by Abbas Abdi inside Iran , who was imprisoned as a result , " Terror Free Tomorrow said in its report on the poll .
The group said its interviews , about evenly split between men and women , were " proportionally distributed according to the population covering all 30 provinces of Iran . "
The group 's advisory board includes Sen.
John McCain , R - Arizona , and the co-chairs of the 9 - 11 commission , Lee Hamilton , a Democrat , and Tom Kean , a Republican .
The group says it was also chosen as a participant in the 2006 Clinton Global Initiative .

Frances Lawrence said she felt " utterly devastated "
Frances Lawrence
Frances Lawrence said she had been told Learco Chindamo would be deported to Italy , where his father was from .
The government said it would challenge " robustly " the decision to allow Chindamo , who stabbed Mr Lawrence in 1995 when he was 15 , to stay in the UK .
The 26 - year - old is serving a life sentence for the 1995 killing .
His lawyers argued that deporting him to Italy , where he was born , would breach his human rights .
The ruling allowing him to stay in the UK was made by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal .
Utterly devastated
Chindamo , who was jailed for life in 1996 with a minimum 12 - year term , could be released early next year if the Parole Board decides it is safe to do so .
Justice Secretary Jack Straw confirmed the government would be taking the case to appeal and spoke to Mrs Lawrence on Tuesday to arrange a face - to - face meeting in the next few days .
Mrs Lawrence told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme : " I did n't anticipate that I would feel so utterly devastated as I felt .
" I think that within the confines of the law Mr Chindamo has the same rights as , for instance , my son whose father he killed .
Learco Chindamo came to the UK when he was six
Case study : Deportation law Profile of a teacher killer
" But what I do n't understand and what makes me so depressed is how the Human Rights Act , which was set up ... in order to be an exemplar to show how human beings should live together fairly and equally and kindly , and now it 's allowed someone who destroyed a life to pick and choose how he wants to live his . "
The human rights lawyer David Enright said on under the current rules , it was very difficult for people to be deported from one EU country to another .
Chindamo came to the UK when he was six .
His father is Italian , his mother is from the Philippines and he has an Italian passport .
Mr Enright also dismissed the government 's protests as " posturing " , saying it had accepted the 2006 European Commission regulation into British law .
" ( This ) said that any EU national who had lived in the UK , even in prison , for more than 10 years , could only be removed from Britain on imperative grounds of national security - which clearly would not include Mr Chindamo or anyone like him , " he added .
What about the rights of Mrs Lawrence or the victim ?
Tory leader David Cameron
Mrs Lawrence said she was upset by comments made by Chindamo 's defence .
" I was incensed by Mr Chindamo 's lawyer .
I do n't want his sympathy , which I find hypocritical , or his condescension .
" This lawyer does n't know me and yet he 's implying that I 'm a small - minded person , that I care only about my own feelings , and not about the wider picture . "
She also spoke about the issue of forgiving Chindamo .
" This is really difficult but I think I 've probably always forgiven Chindamo but it 's the dealing with it that 's so difficult . "
Conservative leader David Cameron called for the Human Rights
Act to be scrapped .
Speaking on BBC Radio WM , he said : " He [ Chindamo ] is someone who has been found guilty of murder and should be deported back to his country ... what about the rights of Mrs Lawrence or the victim ?
" The fact that the Human Rights Act means he can not be deported flies in the face of common sense . "
Chindamo was told the news at the weekend and was said to be " pleased " because his " family and life were in the UK " .

When Willie Nelson 's bus was searched on Monday in Breaux Bridge , LA on Interstate 10 , a " routine traffic stop " turned into a drug bust .
Louisiana state troopers found more than a pound and a half of marijuana ( 0.7 kg ) and more than three ounces ( 91 grams ) of psilocibin mushrooms .
The 73 - year - old Nelson 's was traveling west after performing at the Hank Williams tribute concert in Montgomery , AL on what would have been Williams ' 85th birthday .
The day before he headlined the Austin City Limits festival .
The online Post Chronicle reports : " Our friends TMZ.com spoke with a spokesperson for the Louisiana State Police who said , ' The tour bus was stopped on a common interstate vehicle inspection , and when the trooper approached the bus door a strong odor of marijuana was detected .
The occupants were not brought to jail because it was not accepting [ inmates ] on misdemeanor charges .
'" The 73 - year - old Nelson ( pictured above ) was charged with possession of both substances as were his older sister Bobbie Nelson , 75 ; Tony Sizemore , 59 ; Gates Morre , 54 ; and David Anderson , 50 .
One of Nelson 's recent albums , , featured a pot -leaf on the cover .
The country singer is on the Advisory Board to NORML .
Allen St. Pierre , NORML 's executive director , stated : “ This effort is a tremendous waste of criminal justice resources that diverts law enforcement personnel away from focusing on serious and violent crime , including the war on terrorism .
"

Today is second day of my OpenMoko 2007.2 testing .
I do it as part of my work for OpenedHand and this gives me possibility to discuss bugs with applications authors before reporting to get some details .
Flashing
I flashed u-boot from 2007.08 snapshot release , self - built kernel 2.6.22.5 and openmoko - devel - image from yesterday ( also self - built ) .
Had to connect Neo1973 to other computer as my desktop refused to flash with DFU - util ( laptop did not had such problems ) .
I did not had a problem with Neo connected via USB Hub .
System start
Start of phone is nice — first you get full screen OpenMoko logo , then few kernel messages ( about 10 lines ) and psplash starts so all messages are hidden .
When X11 starts there is another full screen OpenMoko logo with text informing that UI is starting .
Then OpenMoko - Today2 is started .
BTW — to get back to Today you only need to press AUX button .
Today
OM 2007.2 Today
OM 2007.2 Today — launcher
OM 2007.2 Today — running tasks
Today screen gives access to Dialer , Contacts , Messages ( not installed as there is no version for OM 2007.2 ) , Calendar ( which icon is missing — reported as bug # 830 ) .
Second tab works as application launcher — with kinematic scrolling , selecting group to display , filtering — useful and nice looking .
3rd tab allow to switch between running applications ( also possible with tap - n - hold on titlebar ) , force close of all ( with confirmation ) or close selected one ( but no confirmation so bug # 818 reported ) .
Another problem is that most of icons as shown as default ones — reported as bug # 837 .
Those which are shown properly ( “ Save screenshot ” on screenshot ) gets wrong size — bug # 838 .
Dialer
Next tested application was Dialer .
I was able to make few calls from and to phone but did not checked voice quality .
There is no history of calls currently — bug # 839 .
I also spotted two other bugs ( # 814 and # 819 ) but they are solved now .
OM 2007.2 Dialer
OM 2007.2 Dialer — call history
Contacts
Finally time comes for Contacts application .
I did not used it before so it was something new for me ( Dialer and Today were first OM 2007.2 apps ) .
Core functionality listed in OpenMoko wiki works .
OM 2007.2 Contacts — contacts list
OM 2007.2 Contacts — view of contact
OM 2007.2 Contacts — edit of contact
OM 2007.2 Contacts — communication history
Entered first contact using “ New ” button ( top right one ) .
Wrote fullname , organization , phone number , emails and pressed ‘!’ button ( top left one ) .
Then I switched into list ( first tab ) and there was no entries .
When I added second entry then first one was visible will fullname and second was empty .
When I selected first one then fullname from second one appeared .
It looks like refresh of list is needed after edit is done .
Reported as bug # 815 .
I had few contacts so it is time to check does filtering works .
MokoSearchBar functionality works like it should but there is no information that view is filtered so I posted bug # 829 .
Also widget does not looks so nice so I posted another bug — it was # 835 .
Like in Dialer there is no history of communication ( calls , messages , mails ) yet so 3rd tab is useless now — bug # 843 .
Groups
OM 2007.2 Contacts — groups view
OM 2007.2 Contacts — adding group
OM 2007.2 Contacts — groups view with too many groups
Last tab is group view .
This also needs some work done .
There is no way to remove ( bug # 822 ) or edit ( bug # 825 ) group .
Adding new one use requester instead of making it inline like it is in edition of contact ( bug # 824 ) .
And there is a problem when there are too many groups — they overlaps with bottom tabs ( bug # 821 ) .
During testing of groups I spotted another theme bug — selected checkboxes are not styled like unselected are — bug # 823 reported .
Dates
OpenMoko Dates is not yet ready for testing so I will not write about it .
According to posts on Chris blog it looks more and more interesting .
Opinion
We 've heard it before - more troops will win the war
OF COURSE , Gen .
David Petraeus predicts success in the Iraq war .
What wonders could n't generals achieve with more troops and more time ?
The battle is always going well until it is lost , and then they blame defeat on the politicians and the public .
There 's no shortage of retired generals who will tell you we could have won in Vietnam , if only we had sent more troops , or bombed the dikes in the North , or been willing to kill more than the 3.4 million Vietnamese who died along with 59,000 American soldiers .
Instead , the politicians and public , led by that bleeding heart President Richard Nixon , lost the will to win .
Thus , the dominos fell to communism , and Red China and Red Vietnam now rule the world by dint of military force .
Have you been to Wal - Mart lately ?
The triumph of communism is total .
Once again , we have a general repeatedly promising to save Western civilization by turning the corner in yet another intractable and unnecessary foreign war .
Back on Sept. 26 , 2004 , in the weeks before the midterm congressional elections , Petraeus took to the op - ed page of the Washington Post to make sure the voters did n't vote wrong .
Despite appearances , he claimed the war in Iraq was going very well : " I see tangible progress .
Iraqi security elements are being rebuilt from the ground up , " Petraeus wrote .
" The institutions that oversee them are being re-established from the top down .
And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward , leading their country and their security forces courageously ... there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security , something they are keen to do . "
So keen , it makes one 's heart swell .
So keen that three years later , after the expenditure of $ 450 billion more in taxpayer funds , and more U.S. troops in proportion to the Iraqi population than , at the height of the Vietnam War , we had in Vietnam , the good general now insists it would be disastrous to even think about bringing any American troops home before next summer .
That 's at least another $ 150 billion and many more Iraqi and U.S. lives wasted .
But wait - Ryan C. Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , also testified before Congress this week with Petraeus , and he has more good news about what he still celebrates as the " liberation of Iraq . "
Remember that Bush administration promise that the oil - rich Iraqis would pick up the check for the cost of their liberation ?
Well , Crocker is bullish on that front : the Iraqi economy is on schedule to grow by 6 percent , according to his testimony .
Perhaps he is referring to the additional money dumped into Iraq 's economy by American taxpayers chipping in for the surge .
He certainly was n't basing his estimate on any improvement in Iraqi oil production or any other economic component .
As the International Monetary Fund reported last month in its annual review of Iraq 's economy , " Economic growth has been slower than expected at the time of the last ( review ) mainly because the expected expansion of oil production has failed to materialize . "
In case you have n't noticed , oil is the Iraqi economy , yet a recent GAO report stated an additional $ 57 billion in U.S. tax dollars will be needed to bring oil and electricity production to the level where it can satisfy Iraq 's domestic demand by the year 2015 .
Ambassador Crocker actually had the nerve to compare the bloody religious fratricide in Iraq , which our inane invasion unleashed , to the American battle over state 's rights , once again reducing the complexities of world history to an easily understood but totally irrelevant example from the American experience .
In that case , a better analogy might have been made to the American Indian wars , given that the only thing the United States has been able to do effectively in Iraq is unleash superior firepower .
At the current rate , Iraq will be liberated when there are no Iraqis .
Perhaps that is why this week 's ABC / BBC poll shows that 70 percent of Iraqis believe security has deteriorated since the surge and that 60 percent believe attacks on U.S. forces are justified .
And 93 percent of Sunnis , whom the general and ambassador claim are joining our side , want to see us dead .
As for optimism , only 29 percent of Iraqis now think the situation will get better , as opposed to 64 percent who shared that optimism before the surge - which almost 70 percent of Iraqis believe has " hampered conditions for political dialogue , reconstruction and economic development . "
So , ambassadors and generals lie .
Get used to it .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government needs to hire up to 193,000 employees in the next two years and will face a difficult task competing with the private sector for qualified employees , according to a report released by a nonprofit group on Tuesday
“ We have a lot of work to do , ” said Max Stier , president of the Partnership for Public Service .
“ This is a true war for talent . ”
Budgetary constraints could also make it difficult for agencies to hire the employees they need , the group said .
“ These are agencies ’ projections about what they need to get their jobs done , so one would hope they ’ll get the funding to accomplish that , ” Stier said .
With around 480,000 federal employees expected to retire or resign in the next five years , the need for new federal workers is pressing , according to the report .
The survey of 34 federal agencies , covering almost 99 percent of the federal workforce , found that the government needs to add up to 193,000 “ mission - critical ” jobs through 2009 .
Nearly 63,000 of those are positions related to security and law enforcement , and more than 83,000 are in agencies responsible for protecting the United States , such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense .
“ We are engaged in a war on terror , and that war on terror requires feet on the ground , ” Stier said .
But the need for talented workers is n’t just confined to the area of security .
The hiring projections spread across the industries , covering 2,400 job classifications , and hitting every state and nearly every country in the world .
Eighty - five percent were outside of the Washington metropolitan area .
Not only will the government need to step up recruitment to fill entry - level positions , it will also need to increasingly look outside its own ranks and turn to current retirees to fill more senior posts .
“ You can not look at these hiring numbers and think that the government is going to succeed in its talent needs unless it sources very creatively , ” Stier said .
“ Many folks retire with many , many useful years of work left in them . ”

Prices have continued to drop substantially this year .
According to the research firm iSuppli , the average retail price of 42 - inch HDTVs — one of the most popular sizes this year — has declined to $ 1,522 from $ 1,844 last Christmas , an 18 percent drop .
Prices will continue to fall , industry analysts say , because the retailers are powerless to prevent the declines .
Not only is retail competition fierce , but flat - panel TV manufacturers , especially the Taiwanese contract manufacturers , continue to build new plants and expand production , which has created a glut in panels .
The price promotions by the minor makers propelled Vizio from the No. 4 L.C.D. television maker in the American market in the first quarter of 2007 to the best - selling maker in the second quarter of 2007 .
“ Half the reason that consumers buy our sets is because of lower prices , ” said William Wang , Vizio ’s chief executive .
“ But our goal was never to compete on price only .
We have a great product . ”
While this is great news for consumers , it is not what retailers want to hear .
The impact of the low , sometimes negative , profit margins has been devastating to many of them .
For example , Tweeter increased its unit sales of televisions during last year ’s Christmas selling season by 15 percent over the previous Christmas .
Profit margin in the video category , said Mr. McGuire , was “ down substantially on a year - over - year basis due to the intense competition in the category ” and in June , the company sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court .
It was sold in July to Schultze Asset Management , an equity buyout firm .
Other chains were affected as well .
At Circuit City , video sales dropped from 42 percent of overall sales in 2006 , to 39 percent in its first quarter , ended May 31 .
To cut costs , the company laid off some of its higher - paid veterans in sales .
“ In some cases those people were not any more productive than lower - paid people , ” said Bill Cimino , a Circuit City spokesman .
Last night I met a script supervisor .
She works with directors to make sure a movie has the right continuity , and one scene fits the next .
It ’s a fascinating job , hobnobbing with top directors , writers , and celebrities .
No two assignments are the same .
How do you get that kind of career ?
She earned a degree in anthropology and just “ fell into it ” through a series of events .
I know the feeling .
I majored in economics , got an MBA , worked at a bank , then a phone company , and became a cartoonist .
For every person who studies something specific , such as the law or medicine , and actually ended up in that sort of career , I think there are five who let chance pick their careers .
That works out more often than you ’d think , but you ca n’t recommend it as a career strategy .
Instead , I recommend a general formula for success .
Allow me to explain .
If you want an average successful life , it does n’t take much planning .
Just stay out of trouble , go to school , and apply for jobs you might like .
But if you want something extraordinary , you have two paths :
1. Become the best at one specific thing .
2. Become very good ( top 25 % ) at two or more things .
The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility .
Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album .
I do n’t recommend anyone even try .
The second strategy is fairly easy .
Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25 % with some effort .
In my case , I can draw better than most people , but I ’m hardly an artist .
And I ’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big , but I ’m funnier than most people .
The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes .
It ’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare .
And when you add in my business background , suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it .
I always advise young people to become good public speakers ( top 25 % ) .
Anyone can do it with practice .
If you add that talent to any other , suddenly you ’re the boss of the people who have only one skill .
Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree , law degree , medical degree , science degree , or whatever .
Suddenly you ’re in charge , or maybe you ’re starting your own company using your combined knowledge .
Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable .
You make yourself rare by combining two or more “ pretty goods ” until no one else has your mix .
I did n’t spend much time with the script supervisor , but it was obvious that her verbal / writing skills were in the top tier as well as her people skills .
I ’m guessing she also has a high attention to detail , and perhaps a few other skills in the mix .
Probably none of those skills are best in the world , but together they make a strong package .
Apparently she ’s been in high demand for decades .
At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication , either written or verbal .
And it could be as simple as learning how to sell more effectively than 75 % of the world .
That ’s one .
Now add to that whatever your passion is , and you have two , because that ’s the thing you ’ll easily put enough energy into to reach the top 25 % .
If you have an aptitude for a third skill , perhaps business or public speaking , develop that too .
It sounds like generic advice , but you ’d be hard pressed to find any successful person who did n’t have about three skills in the top 25 % .
What are your three ?

With unbelievable restraint , Captain Eric Moody addressed British Airways flight 009 as his Boeing 747 drifted inexorably down towards the Indian Ocean .
Displaying the stiff - upper - lip spirit that built an empire , he uttered the words that are every air passenger 's worst nightmare : ' Ladies and gentlemen , this is your captain speaking .
We have a small problem .
All four engines have stopped .
We are doing our damnedest to get it under control .
I trust you are not in too much distress . '

• BA strike called off at eleventh - hour
• Stowaway dies on LA flight from London
Minutes before , while cruising at ten kilometres above the sea , Captain Moody had instructed his first officer to send a Mayday call to ground control in nearby Indonesia .
The date was June 24 , 1982 , and this extraordinary flight has since gone down in aviation history .
As a new TV documentary investigating the socalled ' Jakarta Incident ' makes clear , nothing was quite as one might expect that terrible night .
Incredibly , passengers and crew reacted to the captain 's cataclysmic announcement not with screams and hysteria , but with an extraordinary calm as the realisation that they were almost certainly sinking to their deaths hit home .
Looking out of the aircraft windows , they could see that their plane was coated in an eerie white light and that the engines were on fire , with great jets of flame trailing into the sky .
The cabin was now filled with a thick , sulphuric smoke , and the mighty jet bucked up and down as if it were a piece of flotsam adrift on stormy seas .
Mothers moved to comfort their children , husbands reached for their wives ' hands , and air hostesses worked their way down the cabin , teaming solo passengers with a companion to accompany them into the darkest of nights .
Hours before , the BA scheduled flight had taken off from Heathrow Airport .
After the long check - in , the 263 passengers settled into their seats , ordered drinks from the cabin crew , and prepared for the flight which would take them to New Zealand via India , Malaysia and Australia .
At the very back of the enormous jet , Betty Tootell made sure her 80 - year - old mother , Phyl , was comfortable , and then began to read the Jane Austen novel she had bought for the journey .
Brought up in Britain , the pair had emigrated to New Zealand three years earlier , and were returning after a summer holiday in suburban London .
Seated in front of her , James Ferguson was on his way back from a trip to the Holy Land , and was looking forward to getting home .
Some rows ahead , Charles Capewell sat with his two young boys , Chas , ten , and Stephen , seven .
In a few hours , the family expected to be reunited with their mother in Perth , Australia .
On the flight deck , the crew were fresh and alert .
They had taken control at the last stopover in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia .
Captain Moody had had his first taste of flying at the age of 16 , when he took a gliding lesson .
He was one of the first pilots ever trained on the Boeing 747 .
First officer Roger Greaves had been a co-pilot for more than six years , and Barry Townley - Freeman was flight engineer .
As the jet flew over the Indonesian city of Jakarta , it was cruising at more than 36,000ft and had been in the air for an hour - and - a - half .
Expecting an easy flight , Captain Moody checked his weather radar , which showed smooth sailing for the next 300 miles .
Assured that all was well , he asked Greaves to take charge while he took a break and stretched his legs .
In the cabin , chief steward Graham Skinner had observed excessive smoke in the air .
Back in 1982 , it was still legal to smoke on jets , and he was concerned it may have been a smouldering cigarette .
In the cockpit , the flight took an unsettling turn .
First Officer Greaves said : ' Barry and I were just sitting there minding the shop , pitch dark night , of course , and then we started to get these pinpricks of light on the windscreen . '
His engineer , Townley - Freeman , asked whether it could be St Elmo 's Fire - a natural phenomenon sometimes seen when planes fly through highly charged electric thunderclouds .
The only thing was , there were no thunderclouds that night .
The radar showed a clear sky .
Alarmed by this turn of events , the two men were further disturbed to see , with the help of their landing lights , a thin layer of cloud surrounding their plane .
Back in the cabin , a shudder of turbulence shook passengers as they slept .
Breaking off from her book , Betty Tootell glanced to her left , where she had a clear view of the port wing .
' To my surprise , it was covered in a brilliant , shimmering light , ' she recalls .
' I carried on reading , but I found that I kept reading the same paragraph over and over .
I then noticed that thick smoke was pouring into the cabin through the vents above the windows .
I did n't know what was happening .'
Neither did the crew .
They decided it was time to call their captain back to the controls .
' The smoke filling the plane smelt like a sulphuric , electrical smell , ' recalls Moody .
' I went on the flight deck expecting to hear that we had some electrical smoke from the aircraft . '
Suddenly , Greaves said : ' Oh my Lord .
Look at engine four !
It 's lit up somehow . '
The captain was distracted , however : he had just noticed that the engine on his side was illuminated .
Ahead of them , they appeared to be flying into a sheet of brilliant white light , and the temperature within the aircraft began to soar .
Twenty - five years on , Skinner describes the scene : ' It got really , really hot , ' he says .
' You were perspiring , drenched in sweat .
The acrid smoke filling the cabin was at the back of your throat , up your nose , in your eyes - your eyes were running . '
Most of the passengers now realised that this was no regular flight .
Charles Capewell told his young sons to close the blind on his porthole , and affected an air of calm as his blood ran cold .
He says : ' As young as they were , they knew we were in bad , bad trouble and they looked at me as if to say : " Well , what do we do now , Dad ? " '
In the absence of an explanation , the cabin crew stowed away loose items in a bustle of efficiency , offering blind reassurance to passengers in an attempt to stop the air of latent panic igniting .
Chief steward Skinner explains : ' If I was misleading them , then that was for a reason , because I did n't want them to get as upset as I felt .
' I just could n't believe what was happening , and yet I was chatting to the passengers , saying : " Nothing to worry about .
It 's just a little hiccup . " '
By now , the passengers could see the extent of the problem with their own eyes , however .
Betty Tootell says : ' There were huge flames coming out of all four engines .
You were plagued by questions :
Are we going to burn to death ?
Are we going to choke to death on the smoke ?
What 's causing it ?
What are they going to do about it ?'
As the fire engulfed the engines , one of them revved loudly and failed .
Recalling the drill he was taught as a young pilot , Captain Moody began to shut it down .
Next , engine two failed .
Then the unthinkable happened .
The engineer delivered the death knell : all four engines had failed .
In the cabin , the most ominous sound of all filled the air : a rumbling , grating noise almost like a cement mixer , followed by total silence .
Flight 009 had entered that nameless void .
It was falling from the sky .
Passenger Charles Capewell says : ' The quietness was unbelievable .
It seemed eerie and surreal , as if we were suspended in space .
All we could feel was this quietness and the whimpering from the few people who were really upset . '
So what passes through the human mind as you stare death in the face ?
The passengers of Flight 009 offer a unique glimpse .
Tootell , who has written a book , All Four Engines Have Failed , on passengers ' response to their neardeath experiences , recalls : ' The atmosphere in the cabin was very tense and very quiet .
At first , it was raw fear and disbelief , and then after a while it turned to acceptance .
We knew we were going to die . '
In the cockpit , the crew fought to control the giant glider that the 747 had become .
Greaves radioed a Mayday warning to Jakarta control .
Initially , they failed to understand the message - seemingly unable to comprehend such a catastrophe .
He repeated the warning , in the international format drilled into every flight crew : ' Mayday , Mayday .
Jakarta control .
Speedbird nine .
We have lost all four engines .
Repeat , all four engines .
Now descending through flight level 3 - 5 - 0 . '
Even without its engines , a 747 can travel forward ten miles for every 1,000 ft it falls in altitude .
With no power , flight 009 had begun a long , excruciatingly slow fall .
The crew realised they had less than half an hour before they hit the sea .
Moody says : ' When all engines stop , you go into automatic mode .
Obviously , we had practised this on the simulator many , many times . '
He began the standard engine restart drill , and decided to turn the crippled craft back towards the closest airport , just outside Jakarta - but a quick calculation told him that they would not make it without at least one functioning engine .
As pressure within the cabin fell , oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling - an automatic emergency measure to make up for the lack of air .
But some did not work .
Moody took drastic action : to prevent his passengers dying of oxygen starvation , he went into a nosedive , dropping 6,000 ft in one minute , to an altitude where there was enough oxygen in the outside atmosphere to fill the cabin once more .
And quite unexpectedly , this action almost certainly saved the lives of every person on board .
Suddenly , engine four roared back into life .
As the plane fell past 13,000 ft , another engine came back into action , followed by the other two .
The crew were euphoric , though when one of the four engines failed again , their fears continued .
With three engines operational , the plane closed in on the airport .
But its problems were far from over .
Moody could see nothing outside - the windshield glass had been damaged .
Landing equipment on the ground which could help them was not working , and the crew had to land the plane manually .
With consummate skill , the pilot guided the aircraft to a perfect landing .
' The airplane seemed to kiss the earth , ' recalls Moody .
' It was beautiful . '
Safely on the ground , passengers hugged each other and applauded the crew .
But what had happened ?
How had all four engines failed ?
The result of a forensic investigation into the incident was to change pilot training around the world .
Engineers at Rolls - Royce found that the engines had seized up because the plane had flown through a cloud of volcanic ash .
There had been an eruption of the Mount Galunggung volcano southeast of Jakarta that day .
Wind had blown a cloud of ash into the path of the plane and the finely ground particles of rock had sandblasted the aircraft and choked its engines .
The volcanic cloud did not show up on the radar because it was composed of very dry material , unlike weather systems which are detected by their water particles .
By dropping into clear , denser air , the crew 's efforts to restart the engines paid off , as the volcanic material was blown free .
Tom Casadevall , director of the U.S. Geological Survey , says : ' We 've incorporated this learning into training .
Pilots now know to look for signs including the odour of sulphur in the cabin and frictional electrification on the leading edges . '
In the months following their brush with death , the crew of flight BA 009 were showered with awards and commendations .
With passengers , they formed the Galunggung gliding club , which enables survivors to stay in touch to this day .
And there was one happy postscript .
Now 81 , Betty Tootell went on to marry James Ferguson , the man who sat in the row in front of her .
' Life is full of surprises , ' she says , from her home near Auckland , New Zealand .
' James and I married 13 years ago and we feel we 're still on honeymoon .
That night , I learned to count every day as a bonus . '
A minority of people with autism have one or more extraordinary intellectual talents , such as the rapid ability to calculate the day of the week for a given date , or to count large numbers of discrete objects almost instantaneously - they 're often called ' autistic savants ' or ' idiot savants ' .
Now Allan Snyder and colleagues have shown that by placing a pulsing magnet over a specific area of the brain , these kind of abilities can , to some extent , be induced in people who are n't autistic ...
... The researchers think that by temporarily inhibiting activity in the left anterior temporal cortex , the TMS allowed the brain 's number estimator to act on raw sensory data , without it having already been automatically grouped together into patterns or shapes .
In other words , they believe it caused the ' normal ' brain to function more like an autistic ' savant ' brain .
We argue that it removes our unconscious tendency to group discrete elements into meaningful patterns , like grouping stars into constellations , which would normally interfere with accurate estimation , the researchers said .
By inhibiting networks involved in concepts , we may facilitate conscious access to literal details , leading to savant - like skills .
- BPS Digest
People with autism seem not to daydream in the way that other people do .
When the minds of non-autistic people are " idle " , a network within the brain involved in social and emotional thought is , in fact , active .
People often drift into daydreams at these times , but when we have to concentrate on a task , we suppress daydreaming .
A team from the University of California at San Diego used functional MRI to show that while this network is more active in non-autistic people when their brains are resting than carrying out a cognitive test , there is no difference between the active and resting brains of people with autism .
" The absence of this activity in autism might mean that they have a different sort of internal thought , " says co-author Daniel Kennedy . -
A recent forum post on this topic
The twins live exclusively in a thought - world of numbers .
They have no interest in the stars shining , or the hearts of men .
And yet numbers for them , I believe , are not ' just ' numbers , but significances , signifiers whose ' significand ' is the world .
They do not approach numbers lightly , as most calculators do .
They are not interested in , have no capacity for , cannot comprehend , calculations .
They are , rather , serene contemplators of number - and approach numbers with a sense of reverence and awe .
Numbers for them are holy , fraught with significance ...
... such an arithmetic , in minds like the twins ' , could be dynamic and almost alive - globular clusters and nebulae of numbers whorling and evolving in an ever expanding mental sky ... - link
Once again , it is the restrictive capacity of the human brain , rather than its ability to augment a world from nothing , which has captured the science headlines .
The valve of consciousness , in the experiment mentioned above , has been loosened somewhat , bringing the flood of reality closer to the brink of its perceiver .
Is it possible that by studying autism , and other such neurological ' disorders ' , the boundaries of the human can be better mapped out ?
There is more to us than sheer consciousness :
Whole worlds ebb out from our conscious and subconscious minds .
How strong is the dam which stems the tide ?
In his classic book of neurological investigations , ' The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat ' , Oliver Sacks tells us a story of two of his patients , twins labeled with the idiom of the day as ' idiot savants ' .
Their infamy stretched far out from Sacks ' examination room , into a society fascinated by the bizarre , the unique and indefinable ( their story , along with that of another famous autistic Kim Peek , is said to have influenced the movie Rain Man ) .
The twins lived a life of numbers , intrigued by infinities , playing with primes , all the while reveling in their personal universe together , as if conspirators in a mathematical mystery the rest of us would never comprehend .
In pondering their mystique Sacks gilds their tale with melancholy :
By instilling such mysterious ' powers ' on the minds of healthy people perhaps we are diminishing exactly what it is we are trying to understand .
The world of chaos , ever multiplying changes of form and void , appears to be stemmed from bursting in by the vagaries of our consciousness , yet this is no mere ' dulling down ' of reality .
By controlling our perceptions our brains allow new landscapes of thought to be painted as inner worlds .
The twin savants in Sacks ' tale may be able to dance amongst the base forms of existence , but to them a poem in 5 - 7 - 5 structure is devoid of beauty , a musical composition in 2 / 4 time is a mere collection of patterns which they revel in factoring .
Perhaps in restricting the objective world the human mind is capable of enriching the inner subjective self , and in doing so , places forever hidden from view the original source of our greatest accomplishments .
The subjective selfhood is not about to be seen on an MRI scan or by flashing a TMS wand over our scalps , yet perhaps it is in this abstract realm where we most differ from the autism ' sufferer ' .
Our " unconscious tendency to group discrete elements into meaningful patterns " is where art is born .
In those mental " networks involved in concepts " the seeds of civilisation were grown .
Restriction is the key to complexity .
We should not look upon the autistic as tools with which to better understand ourselves - both our worlds are as distinctly complex and abstractly real as each other ; both our realities are valid universes we have barely begun to explore .

There ’s a JavaScript feature that I feel needs much more attention : Native JSON support in browsers .
It ’s something that should be a JavaScript language feature and yet no browser , or standards body , has defined , specified , or implemented what exactly it is , or should be .
On top of this , it is one of the most ( implicitly ) requested language additions .
A recent ticket was opened for the Gecko engine , requesting a form of native JavaScript ( de -) serialization whose API is based upon an implementation by Douglas Crockford .
In effect , you ’d be getting two additions to the JavaScript language : A .toJSONString ( ) method on all objects ( which will serialize that object to a string representation of itself ) and a .parseJSON ( ) method on all strings ( which is responsible for deserializing a string representation of a JSON object ) .
I ’d like to try and make the case for why I feel that native JSON support should standardized and made part of the JavaScript language .
1 ) The recommended implementation is considered harmful .
There are , currently , two popular means of transferring and deserializing JSON data .
Each has their own advantages , and disadvantages .
The two methods are :
An implementation of JSON deserialization , by Douglas Crockford ( which uses a JSON string , transferred using an XMLHttpRequest ) .
And JSONP , which adds JavaScript markup around simple JSON data and is transferred ( and deserialized ) by injecting a < script > element into a document .
Currently , Crockford ’s json.js is the recommend means of deserializing JSON data .
This has been discussed extensively elsewhere .
Currently , json.js is better at keeping malicious code from being executed on the client ( JSONP has no such protection ) , and thus , is recommend for most use cases .
However , json.js has taken two serious blows lately , which has moved it from being “ recommend ” to “ harmful ” :
It ’s possible to covertly extract data from json.js - deserialized JSON data .
Joe Walker recently exposed a vulnerability which allows malicious users to covertly extract information from JSON strings that are deserialized using JavaScript ’s eval ( ) statement .
json.js currently makes use of eval ( ) , making it vulnerable to this particular attack .
This vulnerability has been discussed elsewhere too .
In order to fix this , json.js would need to use an alternative means of parsing and serializing the JSON - formatted string – a means that would considerably slower than the extremely - fast eval ( ) statement .
It breaks the browser ’s native for .. in method of iterating over object properties .
At this point , its pretty safe to say that that extending Object .
prototype is considered harmful – and many users agree .
Extending an Object ’s prototype is generally considered reasonable for personal situations , but for a publicly available , and highly recommended , script like json.js , it demands that it behave in a user - conscious manner .
Some attempts were recently made at cleaning up how json.js behaved , but thus far , no considerable effort has been made to provide an alternative means of deserializing JSON strings , that does n’t break a JavaScript engine ’s native behavior .
Summary :
By adding support for JSON within a browser both of these issues will be completely circumvented ( malicious users wo n’t be able to extract data from a JSON structure , nor will the parseJSON and toJSONString methods be able to break for .. in loops ) .
2 ) The recommend method of deserialization does n’t scale .
Let ’s start by looking at the two most popular methods of transferring JSON data ( JSONP and an XMLHttpRequest transferring plain JSON ) , along with using an XMLHttpRequest to transfer some XML data ( just for fun ) .
I ’ve set up a series of tests that we can use to analyze the speed and efficiency of traditional JSON ( using json.js ) , JSONP , and XML .
I made 3 sets of files each containing a set of data records .
As a base , I used some XML data from W3Schools .
In the end , I came up with a total of 24 test files , each with a different number of records , in each specified format .
All of these get referenced from my mini test suites ( one for each data type ) : JSON , JSONP , XML
These suites default to requesting the 50 - record file 100 times , and taking an average reading .
To get a reading on a different recordset , visit the file with the number of records in the URL , e.g. : json.html?400 .
Please do n’t run this on my server , it ’ll make it cry .
Instead , all of the test data and files can be downloaded here .
Note : I ’ve only run these tests in Firefox , so caveat emptor .
Data Records by Time ( in seconds )
Right off the bat , we can see two things :
Transferring and de-serializing JSON data scales better than doing the same for equivalent XML data .
JSONP scales better than the ( more secure ) XHR - requested , json.js - deserialized , JSON method .
Looking at the numbers for the recommended means of transferring JSON data , we do n’t get a full picture .
Where are the scalability issues coming from ?
Maybe XMLHttpRequests do n’t scale so well ?
( Which would also help to explain the numbers for the XML transfers . )
To resolve this , let ’s break down the numbers for JSON into time spent processing and time spent transferring the data .
Data Records by Time ( in seconds )
Here is where we see the major numbers come out .
We can see that the processing time increases at a pace slightly less than O ( n ) time .
This might be fine for most cases , however we can clearly see ( from the previous chart ) that JSONP is fully capable of faster parsing times .
Additionally , the processing time that json.js takes is completely blocking – no other operation is able to take place when the deserialization is taking place .
When running the test suites you ’ll find that when the high ( 200 - 1600 ) record sets are processed your browser will stall ( and if you ’re on a mac , you ’ll get the spinner of death ) .
By passing this complete operation off to the browser you ’ll avoid all of these complications .
Summary
By adding native JSON support within a browser you would have the blazing speed and scalability of JSONP , without adding any significant overhead .
Side Discussion :
In addition to studying the scalability of transferring JSON data , I ’ve also looked at the overhead costs of pushing JSON data into an HTML structure ( especially when compared to XML - formatted data ) .
Currently , some browsers have a native means of processing and converting XML data structures on the fly , using XSLT .
XSLT is an incredibly powerful templating language and is more than capable of transforming any XML structure into an appropriate XHTML data structure .
However , for JSON data , no killer - templating system exists .
I ’ve used JSONT extensively but , in reality , it does n’t hold a candle to XSLT .
( Both in terms of features and speed . )
I have two test suites one for JSONP + JSONT and another for XML + XSLT .
You can download the full suite here .
Data Records by Time ( in seconds )
You can see that , even with the extra speed advantages of JSONP , all of that lead is blown away by the incredibly slow nature of JSONT .
Unfortunately , the situation is n’t as clear - cut here as it was comparing JSONP and json.js , considering that JSONT is hardly a worthy replacement to XSLT .
Summary :
In order for JSON to be , at all , competitive with XML / XSLT , there has to be a native means of transforming JSON data structures into strings ( or DOM fragments ) , that can then be injected into an HTML document .
3 ) Upcoming standards imply its existance .
There are two upcoming standards that require some form of JavaScript object serialization ( either explicitly , or implicitly ) .
The first , JSONRequest , ( unsurprisingly , also from Douglas Crockford ) is a means of securely transferring JSON data cross -domain .
However , in order to implement this feature , some form of native JSON deserialization will be need to be implemented within the browser .
I know that Mozilla is considering implementing this feature , as is Microsoft , in Internet Explorer .
Hopefully , this will mean that the two biggest browsers will have an implementation out quite soon .
The second is the new DOM Storage standard introduced by the WHATWG .
While this feature does not require a form of JavaScript object serialization , it does only allow data to be stored as strings ( and in order to make the most efficient use of that storage area , a form of object serialization will be needed ) .
However , the fact that two upcoming pseudo - standards need some form of object serialization requires us to re-examine the proposed API .
It is imperative that it be rock - solid before being implemented in multiple platforms .
Here is the ( rough ) current API proposed by Crockford ’s json.js :
Object.prototype.toJSONString
var foo = { test : true , sample : " string " } ; foo.toJSONString ( ) ; >> '{ " test " : true , " sample " : " string " } '
Array.prototype.toJSONString
var foo = [ true , " string " , 5 ] ; foo.toJSONString ( ) ; >> '[ true , " string " , 5 ] '
Boolean.prototype.toJSONString
String.prototype.toJSONString
Number.prototype.toJSONString
5.toJSONString ( ) ; >> ' 5 ' " test " .toJSONString ( ) ; >> '" test " ' true.toJSONString ( ) ; >> ' true '
However , there ’s still a lot of ambiguity in this particular API – especially when it comes to aspects of the language that are n’t perfectly serializable .
Function and RegExp
Note that the parseJSON method ( rightfully ) balks at extracting a Function or a RegExp :
" function ( ) {}" .parseJSON ( ) ; ERROR : parseJSON : undefined
" /foo/ " .parseJSON ( ) ; ERROR : parseJSON : undefined
While it happily serializes either using toJSONString ( ) ( with varying results ) :
function test ( ) {} test.toJSONString ( ) >> " {" prototype " : {} } "
/foo/.toJSONString ( ) >> " { } "
null
Also , note that while parsing a serialized ‘ null ’ gives you the correct value back :
" null " .parseJSON ( ) >>
null
it is unable to convert a null into its serialized form :
var foo = null ; foo.toJSONString ( ) ERROR : foo has no properties
A very important point needs to be made here :
Some form of definition and specification should be made regarding this language addition .
And soon .
Even if it ’s nothing other than defining that the above behavior is correct – that should be specified somewhere for all browser developers to follow .
Summary :
The current , recommended , implementation of JSON parsing and serialization is harmful and slow .
Additionally , upcoming standards imply that a native JSON ( de - ) serializer already exists .
Therefore , browsers should be seriously looking at defining a standard for native JSON support , and upon completion implement it quickly and broadly .
To get the ball rolling , I recommend that you vote up the Mozilla ticket on the implementation , to try and get some critical eyes looking at this feature , making sure that it ’s completely examined and thought through ; and included in a browser as soon as possible .

I have a theory that you can predict how happy people are – and perhaps how successful – by their ability to tolerate imperfection .
The Golden Happiness Ratio is about 4/5 ths right , also known as “ good enough . ”
Once you achieve about 80 % rightness , any extra effort is rarely worth the effort .
People who ca n’t stop until they get to 100 % are usually stressed to the point where they can barely function .
And do n’t expect them to do much multitasking .
People who are happy with results much below 80 % right are usually serial losers .
Those are the people who show up for work when it “ feels right . ”
They generally have money problems , which lead to social problems .
I consider myself the master of the 80 % rule .
Everything I do is shoddy by most people ’s standards .
For some reason this does not bother me as much as you might think .
I have a high tolerance for imperfection .
I consider it a key to my success .
For example , it might surprise you to know I ’m a better artist than my comic strip indicates – about 20 % better .
But to reach that level consistently would double my workload and give me little in return .
The art in Dilbert is , roughly speaking , “ good enough . ”
And the lack of complexity arguably adds something in the “ x - factor ” category .
When I started this blog , I announced that I was n’t going to put any real effort into my grammar , spelling or factual accuracy .
For every person bothered by those imperfections , there ’s another who appreciates the rawness of it .
I could double my effort to get that extra 20 % of quality , but it would n’t buy me anything .
Today is another perfect example .
This blog entry is about 80 % of where I think it could be .
I could work for another hour to get it up to 85 % , but it ’s Sunday morning and my family has awakened .
They beckon .
I declare this Sunday blog post “ good enough . ”

Former Federal Reserve official Bill Dudley claims the Federal Reserve bases its policies solely on an objective evaluation of economic conditions .
This is an example of a so - called noble lie — a fiction told by elites to the masses supposedly for the people ’s own good , but really designed to maintain popular support for policies that benefit the elites .
Dudley ’s noble lie is designed to bolster a rapidly ( and deservedly ) eroding trust in the Federal Reserve .
The truth is the Federal Reserve has always been influenced by , and has always tried to influence , politics .

Twenty years on , I am handing over a secret to its rightful owner .
I ca n’t bear to carry it around anymore .
In the late fall of 1983 , professor Harold Bloom did something banal , human , and destructive :
He put his hand on a student ’s inner thigh — a student whom he was tasked with teaching and grading .
The student was me , a 20 - year - old senior at Yale .
Here is why I am telling this story now : I began , nearly a year ago , to try — privately — to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort were n’t still occurring .
I expected Yale to be responsive .
After nine months and many calls and e-mails , I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact — as secretive as a Masonic lodge .
How did this all begin ?
For years now ,
Yale has been contacting me :
Would I come speak at a celebration of women at Yale ?
Would I be in a film about Jewish graduates ?
Would I be interviewed for the alumni magazine ?
I have usually declined , for a reason that I explain to my ( mostly female ) college audiences :
The institution is not accountable when it comes to the equality of women .
I explain that I was the object of an unwanted sexual advance from a professor at Yale — and that his advances seemed to be part of an open secret .
I tell them that I had believed that many Yale decision - makers had known about his relations with students , and nothing I was aware of had happened to stop it .
Where is the professor now ?
they ask .
He is still there , I explain : famous , productive , revered .
I describe what the transgression did to me — devastated my sense of being valuable to Yale as a student , rather than as a pawn of powerful men .
Then , heartbreakingly , a young woman will ask : “ Did you tell ? ”
I answer her honestly : “ No . I did nothing . ”
“ Have you never named the guy , all these years on ? ”
“ No , ” I answer .
“ Never . ”
“ But , ” she will ask hesitantly , “ do n’t you have an obligation to protect other women students who might be targets now ? ”
“ Yes , ” I answer .
“ I do have that obligation .
I have not lived up to it .
I have not been brave enough . ”
And then there is always , among those young , hopeful women , a long , sad silence .
After such speeches , a young woman will come up to me — in Texas , in Indiana , in Chicago — in tears :
My music professor is harassing me , she ’ll say .
I tried to tell the grievance board , but they told me it is my word against his , and that there is no point in pursuing it .
I know I wo n’t get a job if I do anything about it .
My lit professor made a pass at me ; he is grading my senior thesis .
My female adviser basically told me to drop it if I want to graduate ; to switch classes ; to start all over with another subject .
My lab instructor keeps putting his hands on my body , and his mentor is on the grievance committee .
I ca n’t sleep .
What should I do ?
I am ashamed of what I tell them : that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true .
Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence .
One , I recall , was drummed out of the school by peer pressure .
Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling .
Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight ; grants dried up , letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming .
No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them .
Usually , the key decision - makers in the college or university — especially if it was a private university — joined forces to , in effect , collude with the faculty member accused ; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university , and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women .
The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum , but damage control .
Finally , last summer , I could no longer bear my own collusive silence .
Yale had reached out to me once again .
The Office of Development had assigned an alumna to cultivate me :
She sent a flattering letter inviting me to join a group of women to raise money for Yale .
I wrote my own letter back to Charles Pagnam , vice - president of development .
I could not join such an effort because I had been sexually encroached upon at Yale twenty years ago , I explained .
The professor involved was still a very visible presence on campus .
I wrote that I did not know what steps
Yale had taken to protect students , and I wanted to know about the effectiveness of the grievance procedures now .
I asked for a private meeting .
I heard nothing .
Weeks later , I called Pagnam , told my story to his staff , and re-sent the letter .
Again , no response .
More waiting .
I called the dean of Yale College , Richard Brodhead .
He took my call right away .
I told him I was calling because I was sexually encroached upon twenty years ago by someone on his faculty , and I wanted to set up a confidential meeting to address it .
I wanted to be sure , I said , that Yale ’s grievance procedures are now strong .
Brodhead seemed to know who I was talking about .
He implied the man in question was not well .
“ I do n’t think you understand why I am calling , ” I said .
“ I do n’t want to bring a lawsuit against Yale or Harold Bloom .
I do n’t want the meeting , or this experience , to be public .
I simply need to know that the institution is accountable . ”
“ I ’ll get back to you , ” he said .
He did n’t .
After months of silence , I called Pagnam again , determined to reach him .
I was starting to feel like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction .
One assistant responded brightly : “ You should try the Women ’s Studies Program ! ”
It was now about six months since I had first sought a response from Yale .
To my amazement , I was facing a blank wall .
I was also in a state of spiritual discomfort .
Keeping bad secrets hurts .
Is a one - time sexual encroachment by Harold Bloom , two decades ago , a major secret or a minor one ?
Minor , when it comes to a practical effect on my life ; I have obviously survived .
This is the argument often made against accusers in sexual - harassment cases : Look , no big deal , you ’re fine .
My career was fine ; my soul was not fine .
I had an obligation to protect others from which I had run away .
Every Yom Kippur , Jewish tradition requires a strict spiritual inventory .
You are n’t supposed to just sit around feeling guilty , but to take action in the real world to set things right .
We pray , “ Ashamnu .
Bagadnu .
We have acted shamefully … behaved wickedly . ”
The sin of omission is as serious as the sin of commission .
Every year , I wonder about the young women who might have suffered because I was too scared to tell the truth to the people whose job it is to make sure the institution is clean .
I am not at peace when the sun sets and the Book of Life is sealed : I always see that soft spot of complicity .

Finally I left another message saying I had been trying for months to get an off - the - record meeting on this issue .
I was getting no response .
And if I kept getting no answer , I would have no compunction about raising this issue in the Yale Daily News .
I was promptly called back , by Nina Glickson , assistant to the president .
I explained once again why I was calling .
“ Unfortunately for you , Naomi , the statute of limitations has passed ” was the first thing she said .
“ I know that .
I do n’t want money or a lawsuit or to make this public … ” I began again , going through my litany : I wanted to be sure the grievance process was effective .
Her empathetic cooing suggested that Yale might have finally sensed something potentially awkward taking shape .
“ I ’ll get back to you , ” she promised .
She did not do so .
Five months later , having called again and yet again , she informed me that President Levin still hoped to speak to me .
In fact , he had referred the matter to Brodhead .
What decade do they think they are living in ?
I wondered .
Surely you did not dismiss angry alumnae , let alone journalists calling to follow up on sexual misconduct , in the post - Clinton , post - Tailhook , post–Air Force Academy world of 2004 .
Then , Pagnam called .
I explained what had happened to me .
I offered to meet , look at the grievance procedures , and , if I felt they were adequate , help , as Yale had requested , with fund - raising .
“ What outcome do you want ? ” he asked .
I explained that in a transparent , accountable institution , it is Yale ’s job to have crafted a standard response to complaints of this kind , not mine .
“ I ’ll get back to you , ” said Pagnam .
It was the last I heard from him .
What actually happened in late fall , 1983 ?
I was a senior , majoring in English .
Harold Bloom was one of Yale ’s most illustrious professors .
Most of my friends in the Literature department were his acolytes , clustering around him at office hours for his bon mots about Pater and Wilde .
He called students , male and female both , “ my dear ” and “ my child . ”
Beautiful , brilliant students surrounded him .
He was a vortex of power and intellectual charisma .
I , personally , was at once drawn to him intellectually and slightly scared of him .
I had audited a famous course he taught , and he had reached out to me then and invited me to talk with him .
Since he was so intellectually selective , I was “ sick with excitement ” at the prospect , as I wrote in an account — details changed to disguise his identity — in one of my books , Promiscuities .
His aura was compelling — and intimidating .
Lit majors who surrounded him were also chatting with Jacques Derrida and throwing around words like jouissance ; English majors like me were poring over Beowulf and using words like index .
But my trusted senior adviser , the poet John Hollander , liked my poetry ; and based on that work , he urged me to take an independent study in the fall with professor Bloom , who was a friend .
Bloom agreed to meet with me weekly .
At my adviser ’s suggestion , he wrote me a letter of reference for my Rhodes Scholarship application .
Then I could not get a meeting with him .
The semester was slipping away .
When I saw him on campus , he would promise to go over my poetry manuscript “ over a glass of Amontillado . ”
I ’d heard that some faculty met with students at Mory ’s , and that Bloom drank often with his male students there .
I also knew that there was an atmosphere at Yale in which female students were expected to be sociable with male professors .
I had discussed with my friends the pressure to be charming but still seen as serious .
Finally , Bloom suggested that he come to the house I shared with one of his editorial assistants and her boyfriend .
At dinnertime .
I agreed .
The four of us ate a meal .
He had , as promised , brought a bottle of Amontillado , which he drank continually .
I also drank .
We had set out candles — a grown - up occasion .
The others eventually left and — finally !
— I thought we could discuss my poetry manuscript .
I set it between us .
He did not open it .
He did not look at it .
He leaned toward me and put his face inches from mine .
“ You have the aura of election upon you , ” he breathed .
I hoped he was talking about my poetry .
I moved back and took the manuscript and turned it around so he could read .
The next thing I knew , his heavy , boneless hand was hot on my thigh .
I lurched away .
“ This is not what I meant , ” I stammered .
The whole thing had suddenly taken on the quality of a bad horror film .
The floor spun .
By now my back was against the sink , which was as far away as I could get .
He moved toward me .
I turned away from him toward the sink and found myself vomiting .
Bloom disappeared .
When he reemerged — from the bedroom with his coat — a moment later , I was still frozen , my back against the sink .
He said : “ You are a deeply troubled girl . ”
Then he went to the table , took the rest of his sherry , corked the bottle , and left .
Is that all ?
yes — that ’s all .
But the encroachment , the transgression — those words are so much more accurate , emotionally as well as legally , than “ harassment ” — had effects that went deep .
What Harold Bloom ’s hand on his student ’s thigh set off was not a sexual crisis .
I was sexually active — and not even especially modest .
An unwanted hand on a thigh from a date was nothing .
Nor was it an emotional crisis .
I was n’t that vulnerable .
What it set off was a moral crisis , shaking my confidence in the institution I was in .
I wanted to go to the Grievance Board .
The semester was passing , but I was terrified of being in a room alone again with Bloom .
Still , I needed to know what to do about the rest of the term .
Some women friends , however , persuaded me not to speak to anyone official about what had happened .
It was one of those perfect blue days in autumn ; the sun was still strong ; we were with our books on the Cross Campus grass .
I told my story .
Someone said she had heard things about Bloom and other students , and that administrators had heard about it as well .
But the university saw him as untouchable , my friends warned .
Do n’t do it .
Were these rumors accurate ?
It matters .
A professor of mine at the time told me last month that “ professors and graduate students within the department gossiped that Bloom was romantically and sexually involved with one or more of his graduate students .
The irony is that whether or not that was true , in a specific case , it affected how professors viewed female graduate students ’ work . ”
Another woman , who was then a graduate student and is now a tenured professor of literature , confirmed , “ It was known ; it was in the air . ”
What did we have to go on in 1983 but rumor ?
In the absence of transparent procedures , decoding the right rumors was how you survived .
One friend reminded me of a young woman who had been assaulted by a graduate student and , she said , had gone to the grievance committee .
The grad student ’s male mentors , my friend said , defended the man , explaining that he was under pressure and just stealing a kiss .
The woman ’s complaint would jeopardize a young man ’s entire future career , they had protested .
The woman had had a breakdown and left campus , we ’d heard .
If I had come from wealth , perhaps I would have had the confidence to speak out .
But my father at that time made $ 35,000 a year ;
Yale cost $ 13,000 .
My mother had lost her job .
My parents were going deeply into debt .
If I was going to grad school , it would have to be on a scholarship ; even to finish college , I needed to be in the good graces of the faculty and the financial - aid office .
I wanted to tell Patricia Pierce , my residential college dean .
She had called me in because I was spiraling downward ; I had gotten a C- , a D , and an F , and was put on academic probation .
My confidence shaken , I failed in my effort to win the Rhodes Scholarship at the end of the term .
When Pierce asked me what was wrong , I felt it was not safe to tell .
I had also heard that a secretary in the Women ’s & Gender Studies Program , worried about the safety of female students , had posted on her door a handmade sign about a “ guilty ” ruling from the Grievance Board in a case of a professor harassing a student .
Pierce , I ’d heard , had run down the hall and torn it off , saying “ You ca n’t do that ! ”
Pierce , now dean of the School of Management , e-mailed me to say , “ I have no recollection of the incident . ”
When I described to my parents what had happened , they had gone to a friend of theirs , a scholar of Middle Eastern literature , who was close to Bloom .
“ You were outraged ; you felt violated , ” my mother , Deborah Wolf , recalled recently .
They begged him to speak with Bloom and ask him to leave me alone .
“ He refused , ” my mother said .
“ He said it would be awkward .
We felt so helpless .
We had no power to protect you . ”
( My roommate , now an editor , who asked not to be named — “ I ’m still terrified , ” she confessed — said : “ We knew something had happened that night .
You were really nervous ; you were anxious for the rest of the semester . ” )
I longed to go to my thesis adviser .
But John Hollander was Bloom ’s close friend .
Harold Bloom never met with me again that semester .
Not knowing what to do about my grade , I went to his department mailbox and dropped off the collection of poems I had tried to show him at our dinner .
I never heard back from him .
When I got my grades for a class he had never taught me , he had given me a B .
Once you have been sexually encroached upon by a professor , your faith in your work corrodes .
If the administration knew and did nothing — because the teacher was valuable to them — they had made a conscious calculation about his and our respective futures :
It was okay to do nothing because I — and other young women who could be expected to remain silent — would never be worth what someone like Bloom was worth .
After months of futile calls to Yale , I began to understand why there had been so much silence on their end of the phone :
Even though I was n’t asking for legal redress , what I was reporting to Yale raised major legal issues .
According to equal - opportunity law , if administrators know of a faculty member ’s tendency to approach students sexually , and do not take sufficient action , the university may then be responsible for condoning a hostile environment .
If a member of faculty does reward a student who agreed to sleep with him or her with a plum job , or downgrade students who reject advances , that can be considered “ quid pro quo , ” one of the definitions of actionable sexual harassment .
If there is a pattern of concealing and covering up instances of sexual harassment and even sexual assault , or acts of retaliation against students who complain , then a university can be charged with having failed to take corrective action .
Still getting nowhere with Yale authorities , I called around to see if someone else could reassure me so I could drop the matter .
Linda Anderson , a brave senior administrative assistant in the Women ’s & Gender Studies Program ( the one who had posted the sign two decades ago ) , told me that the issue was far from settled .
As I started to investigate further , several women willing to tell me their stories came forward .
They were a distinguished group , including a lawyer , a college dean , and a chaplain .
What made their stories even more disturbing was that as early as 1980 Yale had already assured a court in Alexander v.
Yale that it had adopted effective procedures for managing harassment complaints .
The case had been brought by five Yale women , alleging sexual harassment .
All their claims were dismissed .
But the court took “ important … note ” of these measures .
Then , more women began to call me , several of whom had followed the university ’s grievance procedures and were dismayed with what they felt to be bureaucratic stonewalling , and even the use of the procedures to protect faculty and the university at the student ’s expense .
Deborah Amory was the first to talk .
In 1985 , when she was 23 , Amory , now a dean at a SUNY campus , was a senior in the Scholar of the House Program .
She was at a program dinner at Mory ’s , seated next to a faculty member .
He got drunk and put his hand on her leg .
She was startled — another student asked her later if she was okay .
She excused herself to get away from him .
When she returned , he leered at her and said , “ It ’s okay .
I talked to your family , and they say it ’s fine . ”
Amory immediately told the head of the program what had happened ; he said he was shocked , but did nothing further .
Amory filed a grievance .
She , too , like me , went into an academic tailspin .
“ It is a miracle that I finished my thesis , ” she said .
When the grievance committee made its judgment , she was told that “ I had been right in considering his behavior inappropriate . ”
When she asked what the sanctions were , she was told no one would tell her .
She was also forbidden to see a copy of the report .
“ The secrecy around the sanctions was more traumatic than the original event , ” she told me .
“ I just understood that students were not safe and the university was not accountable . ”
Another gutsy secretary mailed Amory a copy of the committee ’s findings ;
Amory recalls that the document suggested the faculty member get alcohol counseling , and to stay away from students when he was drinking .
There was no mention of professional consequences .
I had assumed that such cases were all in the distant past , but then I received a call from a lawyer called Cynthia Powell .
In 1992 , she was an American Studies graduate student and a law student .
Powell says that one of her tenured professors assaulted her sexually .
The professor asked her to dinner , she said , with himself and a dean .
At the last minute , she was told the dean could not come .
After dinner , he insisted they have a drink at his pied - à - terre nearby , and she had one glass of wine .
He started making advances ; she resisted , saying “ No , no ” several times , but then started experiencing blackouts .
When she regained intermittent consciousness , she says , he had removed her clothes and penetrated her .
Deeply traumatized , Powell had her bruises documented at the hospital .
She also called the police , but was made to feel there would be no point in bringing a criminal charge against someone she knew .
“ But I filed a grievance at Yale .
Immediately , they brought in the university ’s counsel .
I was not allowed to have a lawyer there .
Because I am an attorney , I understand that their principal concern was litigation .
Their attorney said to me several times :
‘ We are really glad you are not going to make a crusade about this . ’
“ The committee said he was tenured , so they could n’t just terminate him .
Off the record , the university ’s attorney told me they wanted quietly to push him out .
I did n’t know why it had to be ‘ quietly . ’
“ They said he ’d been ‘ careless , ’ ‘ reckless . ’
They did n’t want to use the word rape . ”
Powell says she was never given a copy of the report and was able to read it only by going to a specified room where it was kept in a drawer .
A few months later , the professor resigned and was promptly hired by another university .
According to Powell , Yale offered her $ 30,000 , which she rejected .
In 1996 , the Yale Daily News reported that the Grievance Board had found that assistant math professor Jay Jorgenson had consensual sex with a freshman whom he was grading .
The board recommended that Jorgenson not teach undergraduates that term .
But Dean Brodhead allowed him to continue teaching because , as he told the Yale Daily News , he “ did n’t think it would be possible to find a replacement that quickly . ”
( The paper also reported that the head of the math department said no one had ever called to ask if there was someone else to teach the course . )
Until this point ,
Yale had informally discouraged sexual relationships between faculty and students , but after the Jorgenson case , which generated a lot of publicity , the university deemed such relationships a conflict of interest and decided to take a firmer stand :
The Guide for Faculty , Students and Staff states clearly : “ No teacher shall have a sexual relationship with a student over whom he or she has direct supervisory responsibilities . ”
Another
Yale alumna alerted me to the Kelly case , which was more serious .
In 1999 , Kathryn Kelly brought a civil action under Title IX against Yale , accusing it of “ inadequately responding to her complaints regarding an incident of alleged sexual assault ” by another student , Robert Nolan , who lived in the same dormitory .
After the assault , Kelly immediately filed a grievance , which eventually resulted in Nolan ’s being required to take a leave of absence until Kelly ’s expected graduation .
But Kelly claimed that in the aftermath of the assault , the college was too slow to respond to her concerns — not least that she was living in the same place as , and attending a class with , her attacker .
She also alleged that , in an open forum to discuss the attack with students , Dean Richard Wood defamed her by telling those gathered that what Nolan had done was “ not legal rape . ”
Kelly was so distraught that she dropped out of her courses and eventually finished her studies late .
In March 2003 , Judge Janet Hall permitted the matter to proceed to a trial , stating that a jury could find that “ Yale ’s failure to provide Kelly with accommodations , either academic , or residential , immediately following Nolan ’s assault of her , was clearly unreasonable given all the circumstances of which it was aware . ”
Six months later , Yale settled for an undisclosed sum .
Stephanie Urie , a former graduate student at the Divinity School and now a hospice chaplain , filed her lawsuit against Yale just last month .
Her most alarming allegation was that from 1997 onward , the Divinity School faculty had knowledge that the Reverend Gilbert Bond , an associate professor at the Divinity School and Urie ’s mentor , “ had engaged in gender discrimination and sexual harassment towards female students ” but that they had failed to take “ reasonable action to prevent the recurrence of gender discrimination and sexual harassment . ”
She also claimed Yale failed to protect her from Bond after she filed a grievance .
Bond denied the allegations to the Yale Daily News and also stated he was not her mentor , and a spokesman for Yale , Tom Conroy , said : “ We do n’t believe the allegations against Yale are supported by the facts and we trust that will be the judgment . ”
According to Urie ’s complaint , Bond took “ advantage of the trust he had gained from her as her YDS mentor … and engaged in coercive sexual relations ” with her and then “ repeatedly engaged in intimidating behavior . ”
When Urie filed her grievance , she claims , the academic dean of the Divinity School , David Bartlett , requested she write a statement that she learned was later shown to Bond .
But Bond ’s own statement , in contrast , was never disclosed to Urie .
She explained to Bartlett that , as cited in the complaint , she had a “ justifiable fear ” of Bond when she used the library or went to Divinity School events .
The dean recommended she get police protection .
The Yale police did offer to escort her to one destination , but suggested she stay off campus at night and , if she was still frightened , that she “ run between buildings . ”
Bond , when I called asking him earlier this month for his response to Urie ’s story , said that he was still an associate professor at Yale .
Not named as a defendant in Urie ’s case , he denied her claims , saying , “ we shared consensual , physical intimacies . ”
“ I exhausted every internal means for resolution , ” says Urie , who is now also an affiliate of one of Yale ’s residential colleges .
“ But not achieving that , I am taking this step in the hope that no one else will have the same array of problems and vulnerabilities .
In spite of many people ’s support , as it stands , the process adds insult to injury . ”
The case is pending ;
Yale ’s response has not yet been filed .
Yale ’s public face is not what it seems .
Though the college Website now has a seemingly exemplary description of its grievance procedures , students reading the fine print will discover that a “ full description of the way in which a specific complaint would be treated by the Board ” is only “ obtained from the Yale College Dean ’s Office . ”
A trip that , for many , could be intimidating .
A member of the grievance committee claims that information about the procedures is placed on dining tables annually .
More than a month ago , I asked Brodhead to send me a copy , and he agreed .
I have never received it .
I called the Yale Office of Public Affairs : I was writing a story about this issue , I said .
“ Harold Bloom ? ” asked press officer Gila Reinstein .
“ He hits on everybody ! ” She backpedaled : “ … in a bizarre way , I mean : ‘ My child , ’ ‘ my dear ’ … ” “ This was n’t that , ” I said .
“ This was a hand on my thigh . ” “ I am sorry , ” she said .
I called the Yale English Department to get Harold Bloom ’s response .
A tense secretary said she could not take my message .
She claimed that he had changed his number and that even they did not have his number .
“ He is barely a member of the English faculty , ” she said .
I explained why I was calling — surely she would want to pass on my request to the department head .
“ She wo n’t care , ” she said , repeating that he was barely on faculty .
Then she hung up on me .
I called back to get Bloom ’s fax number .
Someone who sounded like a student answered .
Was Bloom a member of the faculty .
“ Yes , ” she said .
Teaching ?
“ Yes . ”
She read me his course number .
She gave me his phone number .
I called the number repeatedly ; no answer , no machine .
I called Dean Brodhead again and asked him if anyone had known about Bloom ’s approaches to students .
He said that in his tenure as dean , “ no one came to me ” with a formal complaint .
I said that was not what I was asking .
We went back and forth .
Finally , he said in exasperation : “ Am I saying that no one ever went to anyone in the whole of history ?
I am not in a position to answer it . ” I asked again .
Eventually he exclaimed , “ Naomi , please understand I am not in a position to say .
I am not telling you there might not be students who share your thoughts or even your experience about this .
I am saying they did not come to me . ”
I asked Dean Brodhead how often the committee met last year .
“ It met more than no times and not many times . ”
“ What ’s ‘ not many ’ ? ”
“ This is n’t a court . ”
“ Are these matters of public record ? ”
“ No , they are not .
To open the matter to public record is to expose the person who made the charge . ”
Not true ; many universities make statistics about sexual - misconduct complaints available without naming people .
“ How do I know as a concerned alum , since these proceedings are confidential , that there are actual penalties ? ”
“ I am an honorable and truthful person .
These things are dealt with . ”
“ But how many complaints are brought ? ”
“ I ca n’t answer that … I ’m not in a position to give you the statistical information .
I have no … the number of cases … I have not gathered a statistical abstract . ”
“ Can the student ’s attorney be present ? ”
“ The process is not designed as a judicial one … We do not have attorneys present . ”
I told him my story — again — and asked what he would do .
“ Harold Bloom is someone I almost never see , ” he said .
“ Are you not concerned about other young women ? ” I asked .
“ Do you want me to call him ? ”
“ I am asking what you think is appropriate , ” I said .
Because of the time lapse , he said , he would not have even an informal conversation with Bloom on behalf of students today .
Then , as if he had never heard of the letter that had begun my first conversation with him months before , Brodhead noted that I could send him a letter .
“ I ’m going to have a successor , ” he said with relief .
“ You can send a letter to my successor . ”
Is Harold Bloom a bad man ?
No. Harold Bloom ’s demons are no more demonic than those of any other complex human being ’s .
Does this complex , brilliant man ’s one bad choice make him a monster ?
No , of course not ; nor does this one experience make me a “ victim . ”
But the current discourse of accused and accuser , aggressor and victim is more damaging than constructive .
Here is a more helpful reading :
This man did something , at least once , that was self - centered and harmful .
But his harmful impulse would not have entered his or my real life — then or now — if
Yale made the consequences of such behavior both clear and real .
All the women who have come forward want only to fix what is broken .
Critics of sexual - harassment standards argue that you ca n’t legislate passions ; true enough .
But you can legislate what to do about people who act on them improperly .
Powerful men and woman who belittle and humiliate their subordinates manage not to belittle or humiliate their supervisors .
Neither men nor women tend to harass upward in a hierarchy .
There is something terribly wrong with the way the current sexual - harassment discussion is framed .
Since damages for sexual misconduct are decided under tort law — tort means harm or wrong — those bringing complaints have had to prove that they have been harmed emotionally .
Their lawyers must bring out any distress they may have suffered , such as nightmares , sexual dysfunction , trauma , and so on .
Thus , it is the woman and her “ frailties ” under scrutiny , instead of the institution and its frailties .
This victim construct in the law is one reason that women are often reluctant to go public .
But sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is , most seriously , a corruption of meritocracy ; it is in this sense parallel to bribery .
I was not traumatized personally , but my educational experience was corrupted .
If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil - rights and civil - society issue , everything becomes less emotional , less personal .
If we see this as a systemic - corruption issue , then when people bring allegations , the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission .
The Catholic Church is a good example :
The public understood that church leaders ’ maintaining silence about systemic sexual transgressions corrupted the mission of an organization that had a great responsibility to society as a whole .
Even the military is starting to understand that systemic sexual harassment of cadets corrupts its social mission .
If we change the framework to this kind of transparency and accountability question , then instead of asking , “ What were you wearing ? ” or “ Why disrupt this man ’s life ? ” we would ask : “ What are we — together — going to do about it ? ”
The saddest part ?
If a Yale undergraduate came to me today with a bad secret to tell , I still could not urge her to speak up confidently to those tasked with educating , supporting , and mentoring her .
I would not direct her to her faculty adviser , the grievance committee , or her dean .
Wishing that Bart Giamatti’s beautiful welcoming speech to my class about Yale ’s meritocracy were really true , I would , with a heavy heart , advise that young woman , for her own protection , to get a good lawyer .

Stocks fell Tuesday , as market participants considered a pared - down stimulus proposal from congressional lawmakers , and awaited the outcome of the first presidential debate later this evening .
A host of more economic data reports this week also loomed , including multiple reports on the US labor market .
This quote comes from a report , " Preparing for Enemy Combatant Detainment " , created by the U.S. Naval Consolidated Brig officials for an August 2006 presentation at a American Correctional Association conference .
The report was obtained by The Post and Courier ( TP&C ) in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
From the February 23 , 2007 article by Tony Bartelme , " Inside Navy 's secret brig " :
Officials at the Navy 's brig in Hanahan developed elaborate plans to dodge public scrutiny of its operations to detain enemy combatants , plans that include destroying " critical info , " scrubbing public Web sites , and warning brig staff about the temptations of " high priced offers from news agencies , " a Navy report shows .
According to the conference Schedule of Major Workshop Sessions , here is what was presented and by whom :
K - 4 Confining Enemy Combatants and High Profile Domestic Terrorists Enemy combatants confined in the U.S. prisons and jails pose challenges for correctional and law enforcement staff .
Their arrival is not usually planned , and every alphabet agency will provide you guidance for this special person(s ) .
What would you have to plan for and change if you received a phone call saying you will confine an enemy combatant ?
This seminar will look at more than the operational piece and provide an overview of lessons learned from facility staff that had to adapt and overcome these challenges .
Moderator : Lt. Col. David K. Haasenritter , M.S. , Assistant Deputy ( Corrections Oversight ) , U.S. Army , Arlington , Virginia Speakers : Maj. Christopher R. Ferry , Security , Naval Consolidated Brig Charleston , U.S Air Force , Charleston , South Carolina ; Sandy Seymour , Technical Director , Naval Consolidated Brig Charleston , U.S. Navy , Charleston , South Carolina Evaluator : Theresa A. Grenier , CCS , Management and Program Analyst , Directorate of Programs and Services , U.S. Disciplinary Barracks , U.S. Army , Fort Leavenworth , Kansas
From the report 's presentation according to The Post and Courier article :
Before , it was a medium - level security prison capable of holding 364 inmates , and that its main focus was on rehabilitating inmates .
After 9/11 , the Bush administration declared that certain terrorism suspects were " enemy combatants " ... [ and ] could be held without criminal charges until the war was over .
The brig received custody of three known prisoners deemed to be enemy combatants by the Bush administration :
Jose Padilla , U.S. citizen ( arrived in June 2002 , transfered January 2006 )
Yaser Hamdi , former U.S. citizen ( deported to Saudi Arabia in October 2004 )
Ali Saleh al - Marri , Qatar citzen ( arrested in December 2001 , allowed legal council October 2004 )
Before September 11th , 2001 , the U.S. Naval Brig 's main focus was on rehabilitating inmates .
The Bush administration gave brig officials five months to get change their prison to get ready to receive enemy combatants , and change they did .
Quoting the reporting cited in the TP&C article :
There is no rehabilitation mission in detainment .
In December 2006 , Orlando do Campo the lawyer defending Jose Padilla said in court papers wanted to keep their new mission secret .
Quoting the report cited in the TP&C article :
" Taking on a nationally newsworthy mission brings its own pitfalls , " the report said ...
The report said brig officials scrubbed public access documents and Web sites and destroyed " critical info , " including information about rosters and internal operations .
" Staff training to counter media probes paid dividends on several occasions , " Seymour said without further explanation .
The report outlined tactics the brig officials took to dodge the press and avoid public scrutiny .
" Defeat surprise queries by preparing standard answers and keep them near common phone access points and available to all staff ...
Focus on where the vulnerabilities are for camera footage by interested parties and look for unconventional access to your operation . "
Doing so will " starve the query . "
Fortunately for us , the officials at the brig took enough pride in their redefined mission to present at conference how they can get around a citizen 's inherent , fundamental rights and guarantees protected by our Constitution by taking " higher guidance " — advice from George W. Bush — the man above the law .
The ocean sunfish ( mola mola ) is the largest bony fish in the world .
It is a unique pelagic fish , and specimens of ocean sunfish have been observed up to 3.3 m ( 11 ft ) in length and weighing up to 2,300 kg ( 5,100 lb ) .
Curiously , the Ocean Sunfish has a very small brain compared to its size : A 200 kg specimen may have a brain the size of a nut weighing only 4 g .
It would explain their quiet behaviour and how often they get trapped into fisher nets .
According to the National Geographic if it lives to adulthood , a sunfish can gain over 60 million times its starting weight : " the equivalent of a healthy , bouncing human baby growing to a weight equal to six Titanics " .
The images of scuba divers next to a giant sunfish gives us a better idea of their incredible size .
Fortunately , ocean sunfishes float serenely in midwater .
Ocean sunfish is generally thought to be solitary fish , swimming freely in the ocean alone .
However , certain sightings of molas in groups of more than ten have been reported .
Frequently , giant sunfishes lie inert on the ocean surface , apparently sunning themselves .
Sometimes , ocean sunfishes are caught accidentally by fishers nets and a crane is needed to lift them on board .
Another threat to ocean sunfish are floating plastic bags which look like their natural prey , jellyfish .
Sunfish can choke as they try to swallow the bags , or slowly starve as the plastic clogs their stomach .
Recently , a Gaza fisherman trapped a giant sunfish .
He threw his nets into the water and was surprised when the fish got stuck in five of his nets .
His catch measured 3.5 metres or 11 feet in length , 1 metre in width and weighed one tonne .
Many fishers have lived the same experience , and it seems pretty impressive .
Some years ago , Australian Museum acquired such a large specimen that they had to use ropes to haul it up and get it inside the building through a window .
As you can see , the size of other specimens is as big as a parking place .
On the other hand , giant sunfishes are an important menace for little ships .
A collision at high speed can cause both injury to sailors and damage to yachts .
Finally , the flesh of the ocean sunfish contains neurotoxins similar to those of other poisonous tetraodontiformes , but it is considered a delicacy by some people .

His identity is known to Truthdig ’s editors , but he has written anonymously in order to offer an uncensored account .
I have been living and working in Baghdad for the past 16 months and will be leaving next week for good .
I am one of those overpaid Department of Defense contractors , or , as some would call me , a “ war profiteer . ”
Yes , I have profited .
I am out of debt and have money saved .
But it has cost me .
I am a changed man .
I have become hardened .
I almost feel like a zombie .
Although I work in Baghdad , I have no idea what Baghdad looks like .
I have been told by soldiers that it is “ like one of those Mexican border towns . ”
I do n’t live in the “ heavily fortified ” Green Zone , which , although heavily fortified , has been getting hit with mortars on a daily basis .
No , I live on an Army base .
I live in a trailer with four other men .
We each have our own space and I am lucky to have quiet roommates .
There is a common latrine and shower .
I have had a lot of experiences over these 16 months , and the situation has not changed one bit .
I feel like I am leaving a sinking ship .
The only thing that has changed is that more trailers have had to be added for the “ surge ” of troops that have come in .
Oh , and our laundry now takes 72 hours to get done .
The majority of my co-workers are Iraqi , and every single one has been deeply affected by the war .
Everyone knows someone who has been killed or kidnapped , whether a family member or a friend .
It ’s a daily occurrence , and they feel helpless , frustrated and , of course , very sad .
Those that had the means have gone to either Jordan or Syria .
The others are trapped .
No country wants them .
Every day , the Iraqis risk their lives to come to work because they have no choice .
The average salary is $ 300 a month , and many of them are supporting large families .
Some of the Iraqis I work with just live in the building we work in rather than risk going home every day .
Also , the building usually has electricity , which means there is air conditioning .
In Baghdad there is usually one hour of electricity a day and hardly any water .
People pitch in and buy a generator and get just enough electricity out of it to have the ceiling fan and refrigerator run .
Most Iraqis come to work by bus since there is a shortage of gasoline in Baghdad .
People have to wait in line overnight in order to get gas for their cars .
I wonder how we in America would react if we had even one hour without electricity or water and had to wait in a line to fuel our gas - guzzling SUVs .
For us on the base , getting gas is a breeze .
We just drive up to one of the many gas depots and fill our cars up .
I ca n’t figure out how we have such easy access to gasoline and the Iraqis have none .
I was recently on vacation in the States when the bridge collapsed in Minneapolis .
Yes , it was a terrible tragedy , but to the Iraqis that is nothing .
Our media spent hours talking about how the bridge collapsed and how people were coping with the grief .
The authorities immediately brought in grief counselors .
There are n’t enough grief counselors in the world to come to Baghdad and ask the Iraqis how they are coping .
But coping they are , and every day is a crapshoot .
Will I get killed or kidnapped or suffer some other horrible tragedy ?
Most Iraqis feel that they will indeed be killed , whether by the Sunni militia , the Shiite militia , the American Army or a car bomb .
They live in constant fear .
Could you imagine having to live like that ?
And why are they suffering so terribly ?
Because we are giving them freedom .
Freedom is something that I fear the Iraqis will not have any time in the near future .
It is with a heavy heart that I leave behind my Iraqi friends .
Their lives are absolutely horrible , but they have to keep moving every day to survive .
Every day , as they leave for home , I always wonder if it will be the last time I see them .
We have made a mess of Iraq , and the Iraqis , who just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time , are the ones that are paying the price .
Our troops are losing morale .
They know they are fighting a war that will never end , and I feel sorry for them .
I feel that the ship will eventually sink and we will have caused the most terrible suffering for a people that just want a day when they can leave their house without the fear of being kidnapped or killed .
For the Iraqis , freedom certainly is n’t free :
They are paying a heavy price for it .
From Black Agenda Report
" I 've been standing here for the last 45 minutes praying to God you were going to call on me . " - Dennis Kucinich to George Stephanopoulos , ABC news
Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich is alive , well , and free to move about as he pleases .
Yet corporate media treat him like brutal dictators disappearing the opposition .
They do n't want voters to know that a Democratic presidential candidate will defend the citizenship rights of Americans and human rights around the world .
Kucinich was mayor of a major city , Cleveland , Ohio .
He is now a six - term member of Congress and a Democratic presidential candidate for the second time .
His progressive views are firmly in the mainstream , but right wing propaganda labels them unpopular .
Kucinich 's demand for ethical corporate behavior makes the media nervous .
If he became president their bosses would have to accept a government serving the needs of citizens instead of being only at the beck and call of corporate power .
Like good minions everywhere , reporters make sure the higher ups remain happy .
Kucinich has sponsored a bill to impeach Vice President Cheney , opposes any further funding of the occupation of Iraq , advocates health care for all , and exposes the lies used to justify the planned killing of thousands in Iran .
His choice to live up to the values that Democrats claim has earned him only scorn and derision from the media .
They use a variety of methods to disappear him , including removing his image from photos , ignoring him during debates , and simply acting as if he does n't exist .
During the ABC sponsored debate broadcast on August 19th , George Stephanopoulos did not ask Kucinich a single question until nearly 30 minutes had elapsed and then asked him fewer questions than he asked any other candidate .
As if the blatant lack of attention were not bad enough , ABC literally took Kucinich out of the picture .
ABC displayed an Associated Press photo on its website that purported to show the Democratic candidates , but Kucinich 's image was no where to be seen .
When confronted by the Kucinich campaign , ABC lied and lied badly .
They tried to blame the AP when the photo cropping was obviously their own handiwork .
Then they replaced the original cropped photo with one that included Kucinich but never acknowledged the original attempt to eliminate him and his message from view .
The ham fisted crookedness did n't end with a photograph .
An online poll of debate viewers showed Kucinich as the winner .
When the poll gave this unwanted and inconvenient information , ABC buried the results on the web site , making it difficult for readers to find .
ABC is not the only guilty party .
A recent New York Times article stated that " Democrats Say Leaving Iraq May Take Years . "
The headline was a dead give away that Kucinich would be ignored .
He has a plan to immediately announce the end of occupation , not a phony Clinton / Obama / Edwards " end " that leaves U.S. troops in place .
If there were any journalistic ethics left , a candidate who advocates such a different path would be given an opportunity to explain those views to voters , instead of being treated like a skunk at the New York Times private party .
This press behavior has a devastating effect on what is left of American democracy .
If voters do n't know who Kucinich is , they are forced to choose from a group that is more alike than different .
They can then be convinced that they must ignore their own opinions about Iraq or single payer health care .
The inevitable conclusion is that candidates must be chosen by the inherently corrupt " lesser evil " method that has brought this country to ruin .
Democrats who want to reject the continuation of the Bush evil empire are told they have no where to turn , that Clinton / Obama / Edwards is going to win anyway , and that they must be " realistic " and get on board because Kucinich has no chance .
Kucinich would be the choice of many Democratic primary voters if those voters knew anything about him .
When crucial information is withheld from the public , corruption is accepted and the status quo that is destroying the nation continues to reign supreme .
If this disgraceful press behavior continues , Kucinich will be the loser , but democracy and the American people will be the biggest losers of all .

Kucinich grills Rumsfeld on ' cover up ' at Tillman hearing
Michael Roston and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This
In a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the friendly fire death of Army Specialist Pat Tillman , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) grilled former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on whether or not the White House and Pentagon had a strategy to shape press coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Was there a Department of Defense press strategy with respect to the war ? " the Ohio Democrat asked .
" If there was , it obviously was n't very good , " Rumsfeld quipped back .
The Rumsfeld remark drew Kucinich 's ire .
" Well you know maybe it was very good because you actually covered up the Tillman case for awhile , you covered up the Jessica Lynch case , you covered up Abu Ghraib , so something was working for you , " he said .
" So something was working for you . "
Rumsfeld angrily denied any cover up " on this matter . "
The ex-Secretary of Defense denied knowledge of any outside contractors spreading a false message to the press on Tillman 's death .
But he then acknowledged the existence of contacts between the Pentagon and outside contractors to shape messages related to public affairs " over the years . "
In turn , Kucinich called for hearings on the subject .
" Mr. Chairman , I think it 's important that the Committee determine whether or not the outsourcing of press was one of the elements responsible for communicating something to the public that seemed to be beyond the understanding of the Department of Defense , " Kucinich remarked in closing .
The full exchange between the two is taken from CNN 's live video webcast of the hearing .

Walter Reed Shows Administration Priorities
March 6 , 2007
Testimony at Walter Reed Army Medical Center yesterday by wounded soldiers who lived in moldy , cockroach - and mouse - infested rooms , shed new light on the value the Bush Administration places on American soldiers .
Even as a new wave of young Americans ships out for Iraq as part of the Administration 's " surge , " more revelations of disgusting and disgraceful conditions like those revealed by the Washington Post 's Walter Reed investigation are coming to light .
The Post editorialized today about receiving " hundreds of accounts of appalling conditions and management practices at both Army outpatient facilities and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities across the country , " in the wake of its series .
Nowhere is the hypocrisy of the flag - waving chickenhawks in the White House more glaring than in the treatment of America 's veterans .
So much for " support the troops " rhetoric .
That this Administration holds the lives of its soldiers cheap could not be more plain -- first , in sending them off to the misbegotten exercise in Iraq , then in the President 's willingness to push onward despite the deepening disaster there , and finally in these new revelations about the care the veterans are receiving at home .
Fortunately , despite initial stonewalling by the Army , Defense Secretary Robert Gates has been willing to take an aggressive approach to the problem , including firing Army Secretary Francis Harvey .
There is plenty more to do .
Nowhere is the hypocrisy of the flag - waving chickenhawks in the White House more glaring than in the treatment of America 's veterans .
As In These Times reported in a piece entitled " Dishonorable Discharge , " back in 2003 " Even more than his father , and Ronald Reagan before him , Bush is cutting budgets for myriad programs intended to protect or improve the lives of veterans and active - duty soldiers . "
Among the cuts the Administration was pushing back then were $ 75 a month in " imminent danger pay " and a $ 150 family separation allowance , deemed by the White House to be " wasteful and unnecessary , " In These Times reported .
Democrats in Congress led the opposition to those cuts .
But a Bush budget still included $ 3 billion in cuts to VA hospitals .
" VA spending today averages $ 2,800 less per patient than nine years ago , " In These Times pointed out .
And if the Administration treats its own soldiers with such disdain , the fate of the Iraqis they were sent to " save " is even more bitter .
A powerful piece by Emily Harris on NPR this morning featured interviews with Iraqi refugees in Europe describing the complete collapse of their country .
As oppressive and terrifying as life was under Saddam Hussein , it did not compare to the complete destruction of infrastructure and violent anarchy that now engulfs the country .
Easy rhetoric about " regime change " and democracy - building has given way to the plain reality of civil war and social and economic collapse following the American intervention in Iraq .
The human victims of the war -- whether they are disabled American veterans rotting in forgotten corridors at Walter Reed or Iraqis too terrified to leave their homes , stranded without electricity or running water -- show what a package of bright , shining lies the Administration has been peddling .
The greatest irony of Emily Harris 's excellent piece is the news that European countries , including Germany and , to the greatest degree , Britain , are now withdrawing asylum from Iraqis who sought refuge abroad from Saddam Hussein .
Now that Hussein is gone , these countries have concluded , the imminent danger to these Iraqis is over .
Back to Iraq they go .
What awaits them there is a far cry from the new , improved Middle East the war 's planners envisioned .
The late , great star of films including Easy Rider , Dennis Hopper had a distinct style , which was reflected in his acting style , photography , art , and real estate .
His Venice , CA , property , which included an industrial - inspired 5,000 - square - foot main house , a pool house , guest cottage , and condominiums , showcased his sensibility .
The industrial - look main structure , clad in corrugated metal , was designed by Brian Murphy , and the condos were designed by Frank Gehry .

I read in a recent survey by Careerbuilder.com that 40 % of Americans live paycheck to paycheck .
40 % .
That ’s almost one out of every two people .
And that ’s a pretty scary thought , considering the whole mortgage crisis going on in the U.S right now .
Granted , each situation is different and there are probably perfectly valid reasons why some Americans have no choice but to live paycheck to paycheck ( huge medical bills from a car accident , multiple dependents , outstanding family debt , etc. ) , but I ’m pretty sure that comprises of only a small percentage of the 40 % statistic in that survey .
This article is geared more toward those in the 40 % who make enough money so they should n’t live paycheck to paycheck but still do .
So what ’s going on ?
Why are people living paycheck to paycheck when the income they bring in seems to be more than enough ?
The most obvious and easiest answer that comes to mind is that these people do n’t make enough money .
They usually say if I made X amount of dollars more per month , I would be fine .
But that ’s a dangerous belief to have – to think that more money is the answer .
Do n’t get me wrong .
Having more money can indeed help with your financial situation .
BUT , if you cannot properly manage and control the money you have now , what makes you think you will properly manage and control any additional amount of money you get in the future ?
It wo n’t make any difference if you get more money because you will not properly manage and control that money either ; the same thing will repeat itself over and over again .
What will most likely happen is that you ’ll probably be at the very least , proportionally in the same situation in terms of your income to debt ratio as you were before .
For example , if your income was $ 40,000 / year and your debt was $ 10,000 , you had an income to debt ratio of 4:1 .
But let ’s say you get a significant boost in income – say twice as much so you ’re earning so now your income is $ 80,000 a year .
Your debt will probably increase by the same proportion , in this case to $ 20,000 , if not more .
And you know what ?
The debt will probably do just that .
It will increase significantly .
It does n’t seem like it will but it does in a lot of cases and it ’s because people fall victim to Parkinson ’s law .
Parkinson ’s law :
As your income rises , so do your expenses .
With your additional income , you feel like you have more buying power so you get a more expensive car , the monthly payments go up , insurance goes up , if you get in an accident with that car , repair costs go up , you eat out at more expensive restaurants , buy more expensive clothes , etc .
At the very least , the majority of people will be the same off proportionally speaking , but chances are that they will likely incur higher debt as they fall victim to Parkinson ’s law .
Again , all this brings us to the first reason that most people live paycheck to paycheck .
People can’t properly manage and control the money they have now .
Ok then .
What ’s the answer to this ?
How can we properly manage and control the money we have now ?
Here ’s where we get a bunch of advice from personal finance experts .
Make a budget .
Track your expenses .
Save first , then pay your bills after instead of the other way around .
Save your loose change and put it in a jar .
Cash out a certain amount of money per month and only use that for food , going out , entertainment , etc .
That ’s all great advice but we all know that even though people do these things – even though they make budgets , they track their expenses , they save first , they save all their loose change , etc. , they still live paycheck to paycheck .
Again , remember , this article pertains to those who make enough so they should n’t live paycheck to paycheck but still do .
So what ’s going on here ?
To explain this dilemma , let ’s take a look at how different times are today than they were before .
Advertising
We ’re being exposed to more advertising for products and services now more than ever before .
We are literally soaked in it .
TV , radio , Internet , billboards .
It ’s all around us .
And advertisers have done a hell of job at convincing people that they need what they want .
If you think about it , we really do n’t need much .
It ’s people ’s wants that are taking a big chunk out of their paycheck as people have become a slave to their wants .
Job Security
Job security is not as strong as it was before .
Advancements in technology and outsourcing have replaced many jobs .
People change jobs more frequently now but the problem is that when people get a job , they automatically chose to opt for a lifestyle that fits the income they get from that job , and more often than not , it ’s a lifestyle that tends to exceed that income .
Then , with job security being so unstable , it ’s not uncommon to see gaps of unemployment where no income is coming in for months at a time , but with this lifestyle made tailored to a certain amount of income , and no income coming in , people have to rely on loans and credit cards to maintain that lifestyle and keep afloat .
Then , if they do get back on their feet , they ’re greeted with a pile of new debt that they incurred during their transition , so it becomes that much harder for them to get back on track because they have to dig themselves out of the financial hole that was recently made , contributing to the seemingly never ending paycheck to paycheck cycle .
Credit Cards
Credit card offers bombard us in the mail every week teasing us with features such as 0 % APR .
Couple that with how instantaneous shopping can be thanks to the Internet and the instantaneous gratification mentality that seems to be prevalent nowadays and it proves to be a deadly combination .
Combine all these factors above with consumerism and materialism and you get the poster child for the person who makes enough so they should n’t live paycheck to paycheck , but still do :
The fake rich .
What most people do n’t realize is that some people who look like they ’re rich , not all , but some ( and more than you think ) , are just faking it .
They live well beyond their means and rely on credit cards to buy the things they need to keep up the image they portray .
Why ?
It ’s probably because we live in a country where we are predominately conditioned to judge others by what they have , not by who they are .
Of course there are people out there who can afford all the nice things and I would say the old 80 /20 rule comes into play .
80 % can afford that lifestyle and 20 % are just faking it .
It ’s funny because the reverse is true too .
The people you least suspect , who live very simply , who drive average cars , who are n’t very flashy are way more financially stable than those who are fake rich .
Again , not all people are like this , but more than you think .
If you have a chance , pick up a copy of “ The Millionaire Next Door ” and you ’ll see many examples of this in that book .
It reminds me of a verse I remember reading in Proverbs .
Proverbs 13:7
7 Some who are poor pretend to be rich ;
others who are rich pretend to be poor .
With regard to material possessions , what most people fail to realize is that even if you do buy the big mansion , the fancy cars and clothes , it will result in a temporary spike in pleasure .
Over time , you ’ll always fall back to the baseline of happiness you had before .
You ’ll always adapt to whatever environment you ’re in after a period of time has passed , regardless of what it is .
The more people realize this , the more that they ’ll begin to put material things in their proper perspective .
Do n’t get me wrong , there ’s nothing wrong with living in a mansion , driving nice cars , wearing nice clothes .
It ’s just dangerous to think that should be the end game .
People who view that as the end game will climb to the top of the proverbial “ materialism ” mountain and realize that there ’s not much on other side .
And they ’ll then proceed to look down the mountain and see other people struggling to get to the top and wonder why they even bother .
So for those who make enough money so they should n’t live paycheck to paycheck , but still do , more money is not the answer .
You have to properly manage and control the money you have now FIRST before that can help .
But let ’s face it .
The odds are stacked against most people nowadays .
We live in times of :
Massive advertising .
Loss of job security .
Ease of shopping .
Credit cards galore .
Materialism and consumerism .
And we get people who are fake rich as a result because it ’s really easy to pull it off with the availability of credit cards and it ’s really easy to fall into the temptation of doing that when we live in a society where people are conditioned to judge others by what they have , not by who they are .
It ’s really easy to point the fingers at all the reasons listed above , but the hardest thing to do is turn that finger around and point it at one ’s own self .
Staff at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh battled for an hour to disconnect the penis of Captain Dan The Demon Dwarf from a hoover after the diminutive Fringe performer inadvertantly superglued it to the vacuum cleaner 's " attachment " .
According to the Evening Standard , the hoover forms part of Captain Dan's Circus Of Horrors act , in which he inexplicably pulls the device across the stage with his todger .
On this occasion , however , " the attachment came loose before a performance so he tried to glue it back on " .
The 42 - year - old misread the superglue instructions and , having allowed the adhesive a mere 20 seconds to dry rather than the required 20 minutes , duly found himself semi-permanently docked after attempting a premature test .
Of his hospital ordeal , a shaken Captain Dan recounted : " It was the most embarrassing moment of my life .
When I got wheeled into a packed A&E on a wheelchair with a hoover attached to my willie , I just wished the ground could swallow me up . " ®
I cringe ever time I see or hear a mention of software estimation .
After years of seeing my estimates and the estimates of my colleagues fail , I ’ve come to the conclusion that beyond the roughest of figures software estimation is impossible .
This is not due to negligence or incompetence .
Nor is it due to an immaturity of the software field .
It is simply a fact of software development that software estimation is a myth .
The Right Metaphor
To defeat the estimation myth , we must first discard the faulty metaphors assigned to software : construction , writing , engineering .
In reality , developing software is more akin to a developing human relationship .
When I was in grad school I began to notice that from time to time a particular young woman would join my table at the cafeteria for lunch .
I did n’t think much about it until one day I looked up at her and realized that perhaps the reason she was sitting at my table was because she liked me .
We geeks are n’t known for our social intuition so this was a big moment .
So I did some rough calculations on the speed and complexity of relationship building and making proper adjustments for personality factors I estimated we ’d be married in 18 months . . . not !
A marriage “ go live ” date was the last thing on my mind .
In fact it was months and several relational millstones later before we even discussed a date .
As it turned out , circumstances beyond our control delayed even that date .
But , in the end the pieces fell together and we were happily married .
Now we have a house , a mortgage and two small children .
If we substitute “ software project ” for “ young woman ” and “ maintenance and support ” for “ mortgage and family responsibilities ” we would have the perfect description of the software development project .
Relationships Are Unpredictable
Why ca n’t we predict relationships ?
It is certainly is not due to insufficient study .
People have strived to understand how love works for thousands of years .
Yet , at best matchmaking has always been an art of intuition and guesswork .
There are simply too many variables and too many unknowns to predict how two humans will relate .
The same is true of software .
Each new project is built in unknown territory .
Even a simple project has a myriad of variables and unknown factors .
It is simply impossible to predict the result .
An Example
A few months ago a web service I ’d written began to eat up memory like crazy .
I ’d coded it using a modern garbage controlled language so theoretically a memory leak was impossible .
But , it was happening .
I tracked down every obvious choice .
I talked to my co-workers .
No luck .
Finally , after two weeks I finally discovered the problem–a small bug inside a loop was interacting with Microsoft Active Directory to create hundreds of AD tokens .
Another bug caused these tokens to skip garbage collection .
Schedule ?
Throw that to the wind .
Every software developer has stories like this one .
You probably have one from just last month , or even last week !
The interaction between human and computer is simply too complex to predict when the next brick wall will come sailing out of nowhere .
I like to tell junior developers that the art of developing software is like running hurdles — except that instead of hurdles we run at brick walls and in the middle of the night .
When we hit one we scramble up , dig beneath , or bash our way through then sprint headlong into the next wall .
Large Project Estimation
Individual estimation is impossible .
However , if enough developers are involved the random occurrence of schedule breaking events averages out and becomes a measurable “ white noise ” .
The “ white noise ” can be then factored into the estimate as overhead .
Estimation models such as COCOMO are built on this predictability .
However , there are clear limitations to this type of model .
A limited number of critical path options may narrow a project schedule to a tiny set of dependencies .
Once a schedule is dependent on a very small group ( or individual ) developer (s ) the project schedule can ( and will ! ) be blown about by random chance .
If a project depends on unproven technologies or technology unproven to the domain the number of random roadblock events increases unpredictably .
A key assumption of large project estimation is that the average number of schedule delaying events per developer is known and can be factored in as an overhead .
With new technologies this can not be known and can not be accurately factored into the estimation .
Range of Precision : Models are appealing because they provide a number — however , even in ideal conditions they are far from precise .
In short , I would be extremely cautions to schedule or budget based solely on the results of a software estimation model .
However , these models are useful and should be carefully considered in the light of the limitations above .
One of the best uses may in fact be as an antidote to unrealistic optimism –I.e .
“ No , this is n’t a 6 month project .
It really WILL take * THREE FULL YEARS !*”
Summary
We ( and our users ) must accept that a software estimate is about as good as a prediction of marriage on the first date .

Meditation and Attention
The regular practice of meditation appears to produce structural changes in areas of the brain associated with attention and sensory processing .
An imaging study led by Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) researchers showed that particular areas of the cerebral cortex , the outer layer of the brain , were thicker in participants who were experienced practitioners of a type of meditation commonly practiced in the U.S. and other Western countries .
The article appears in the Nov. 15 issue of NeuroReport , and the research also is being presented Nov. 14 at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington , DC .
" Our results suggest that meditation can produce experience - based structural alterations in the brain , " says Sara Lazar , PhD , of the MGH Psychiatric Neuroimaging Research Program , the study 's lead author .
" We also found evidence that meditation may slow down the aging - related atrophy of certain areas of the brain . "

Studies have shown that meditation can produce alterations in brain activity , and meditation practitioners have described changes in mental function that last long after actual meditation ceases , implying long - term effects .
However , those studies usually examined Buddhist monks who practiced meditation as a central focus of their lives .
To investigate whether meditation as typically practiced in the U.S. could change the brain 's structure , the current study enrolled 20 practitioners of Buddhist Insight meditation - which focuses on " mindfulness , " a specific , nonjudgmental awareness of sensations , feelings and state of mind .
They averaged nine years of meditation experience and practiced about six hours per week .
For comparison , 15 people with no experience of meditation or yoga were enrolled as controls .
Using standard MRI to produce detailed images of the structure of participants ' brains , the researchers found that regions involved in the mental activities that characterize Insight meditation were thicker in the meditators than in the controls , the first evidence that alterations in brain structure may be associated with meditation .
They also found that , in an area associated with the integration of emotional and cognitive processes , differences in cortical thickness were more pronounced in older participants , suggesting that meditation could reduce the thinning of the cortex that typically occurs with aging .
" The area where we see these differences is involved in both the modulation of functions like heart rate and breathing and also the integration of emotion with thought and reward - based decision making - a central switchboard of the brain , " says Lazar .
An instructor in Psychology at Harvard Medical School , she also stresses that the results of such a small study need to be validated by larger , longer - term studies .
On the cruelty of really teaching computing science
The second part of this talk pursues some of the scientific and educational consequences of the assumption that computers represent a radical novelty .
In order to give this assumption clear contents , we have to be much more precise as to what we mean in this context by the adjective " radical " .
We shall do so in the first part of this talk , in which we shall furthermore supply evidence in support of our assumption .
The usual way in which we plan today for tomorrow is in yesterday 's vocabulary .
We do so , because we try to get away with the concepts we are familiar with and that have acquired their meanings in our past experience .
Of course , the words and the concepts do n't quite fit because our future differs from our past , but then we stretch them a little bit .
Linguists are quite familiar with the phenomenon that the meanings of words evolve over time , but also know that this is a slow and gradual process .
It is the most common way of trying to cope with novelty : by means of metaphors and analogies we try to link the new to the old , the novel to the familiar .
Under sufficiently slow and gradual change , it works reasonably well ; in the case of a sharp discontinuity , however , the method breaks down : though we may glorify it with the name " common sense " , our past experience is no longer relevant , the analogies become too shallow , and the metaphors become more misleading than illuminating .
This is the situation that is characteristic for the " radical " novelty .
Coping with radical novelty requires an orthogonal method .
One must consider one 's own past , the experiences collected , and the habits formed in it as an unfortunate accident of history , and one has to approach the radical novelty with a blank mind , consciously refusing to try to link it with what is already familiar , because the familiar is hopelessly inadequate .
One has , with initially a kind of split personality , to come to grips with a radical novelty as a dissociated topic in its own right .
Coming to grips with a radical novelty amounts to creating and learning a new foreign language that can not be translated into one 's mother tongue .
( Any one who has learned quantum mechanics knows what I am talking about . )
Needless to say , adjusting to radical novelties is not a very popular activity , for it requires hard work .
For the same reason , the radical novelties themselves are unwelcome .
By now , you may well ask why I have paid so much attention to and have spent so much eloquence on such a simple and obvious notion as the radical novelty .
My reason is very simple : radical novelties are so disturbing that they tend to be suppressed or ignored , to the extent that even the possibility of their existence in general is more often denied than admitted .
On the historical evidence I shall be short .
Carl Friedrich Gauss , the Prince of Mathematicians but also somewhat of a coward , was certainly aware of the fate of Galileo — and could probably have predicted the calumniation of Einstein — when he decided to suppress his discovery of non-Euclidean geometry , thus leaving it to Bolyai and Lobatchewsky to receive the flak .
It is probably more illuminating to go a little bit further back , to the Middle Ages .
One of its characteristics was that " reasoning by analogy " was rampant ; another characteristic was almost total intellectual stagnation , and we now see why the two go together .
A reason for mentioning this is to point out that , by developing a keen ear for unwarranted analogies , one can detect a lot of medieval thinking today .
The other thing I can not stress enough is that the fraction of the population for which gradual change seems to be all but the only paradigm of history is very large , probably much larger than you would expect .
Certainly when I started to observe it , their number turned out to be much larger than I had expected .
For instance , the vast majority of the mathematical community has never challenged its tacit assumption that doing mathematics will remain very much the same type of mental activity it has always been : new topics will come , flourish , and go as they have done in the past , but , the human brain being what it is , our ways of teaching , learning , and understanding mathematics , of problem solving , and of mathematical discovery will remain pretty much the same .
Herbert Robbins clearly states why he rules out a quantum leap in mathematical ability :
" Nobody is going to run 100 meters in five seconds , no matter how much is invested in training and machines .
The same can be said about using the brain .
The human mind is no different now from what it was five thousand years ago .
And when it comes to mathematics , you must realize that this is the human mind at an extreme limit of its capacity . "
My comment in the margin was " so reduce the use of the brain and calculate ! " .
Using Robbins 's own analogy , one could remark that , for going from A to B fast , there could now exist alternatives to running that are orders of magnitude more effective .
Robbins flatly refuses to honour any alternative to time - honoured brain usage with the name of " doing mathematics " , thus exorcizing the danger of radical novelty by the simple device of adjusting his definitions to his needs : simply by definition , mathematics will continue to be what it used to be .
So much for the mathematicians .
Let me give you just one more example of the widespread disbelief in the existence of radical novelties and , hence , in the need of learning how to cope with them .
It is the prevailing educational practice , for which gradual , almost imperceptible , change seems to be the exclusive paradigm .
How many educational texts are not recommended for their appeal to the student 's intuition !
They constantly try to present everything that could be an exciting novelty as something as familiar as possible .
They consciously try to link the new material to what is supposed to be the student 's familiar world .
It already starts with the teaching of arithmetic .
Instead of teaching 2 + 3 = 5 , the hideous arithmetic operator " plus " is carefully disguised by calling it " and " , and the little kids are given lots of familiar examples first , with clearly visible such as apples and pears , which are in , in contrast to equally countable objects such as percentages and electrons , which are out .
The same silly tradition is reflected at university level in different introductory calculus courses for the future physicist , architect , or business major , each adorned with examples from the respective fields .
The educational dogma seems to be that everything is fine as long as the student does not notice that he is learning something really new ; more often than not , the student 's impression is indeed correct .
I consider the failure of an educational practice to prepare the next generation for the phenomenon of radical novelties a serious shortcoming .
[ When King Ferdinand visited the conservative university of Cervera , the Rector proudly reassured the monarch with the words ; " Far be from us , Sire , the dangerous novelty of thinking . " .
Spain 's problems in the century that followed justify my characterization of the shortcoming as " serious " . ]
So much for education 's adoption of the paradigm of gradual change .
The concept of radical novelties is of contemporary significance because , while we are ill - prepared to cope with them , science and technology have now shown themselves expert at inflicting them upon us .
Earlier scientific examples are the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics ; later technological examples are the atom bomb and the pill .
For decades , the former two gave rise to a torrent of religious , philosophical , or otherwise quasi- scientific tracts .
We can daily observe the profound inadequacy with which the latter two are approached , be it by our statesmen and religious leaders or by the public at large .
So much for the damage done to our peace of mind by radical novelties .
I raised all this because of my contention that automatic computers represent a radical novelty and that only by identifying them as such can we identify all the nonsense , the misconceptions and the mythology that surround them .
Closer inspection will reveal that it is even worse , viz .
that automatic computers embody not only one radical novelty but two of them .
The first radical novelty is a direct consequence of the raw power of today 's computing equipment .
We all know how we cope with something big and complex ; divide and rule , i.e. we view the whole as a compositum of parts and deal with the parts separately .
And if a part is too big , we repeat the procedure .
The town is made up from neighbourhoods , which are structured by streets , which contain buildings , which are made from walls and floors , that are built from bricks , etc. eventually down to the elementary particles .
And we have all our specialists along the line , from the town planner , via the architect to the solid state physicist and further .
Because , in a sense , the whole is " bigger " than its parts , the depth of a hierarchical decomposition is some sort of logarithm of the ratio of the " sizes " of the whole and the ultimate smallest parts .
From a bit to a few hundred megabytes , from a microsecond to a half an hour of computing confronts us with completely baffling ratio of 109 !
The programmer is in the unique position that his is the only discipline and profession in which such a gigantic ratio , which totally baffles our imagination , has to be bridged by a single technology .
He has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before .
Compared to that number of semantic levels , the average mathematical theory is almost flat .
By evoking the need for deep conceptual hierarchies , the automatic computer confronts us with a radically new intellectual challenge that has no precedent in our history .
Again , I have to stress this radical novelty because the true believer in gradual change and incremental improvements is unable to see it .
For him , an automatic computer is something like the familiar cash register , only somewhat bigger , faster , and more flexible .
But the analogy is ridiculously shallow : it is orders of magnitude worse than comparing , as a means of transportation , the supersonic jet plane with a crawling baby , for that speed ratio is only a thousand .
The second radical novelty is that the automatic computer is our first large - scale digital device .
We had a few with a noticeable discrete component : I just mentioned the cash register and can add the typewriter with its individual keys : with a single stroke you can type either a Q or a W but , though their keys are next to each other , not a mixture of those two letters .
But such mechanisms are the exception , and the vast majority of our mechanisms are viewed as analogue devices whose behaviour is over a large range a continuous function of all parameters involved : if we press the point of the pencil a little bit harder , we get a slightly thicker line , if the violinist slightly misplaces his finger , he plays slightly out of tune .
To this I should add that , to the extent that we view ourselves as mechanisms , we view ourselves primarily as analogue devices : if we push a little harder we expect to do a little better .
Very often the behaviour is not only a continuous but even a monotonic function : to test whether a hammer suits us over a certain range of nails , we try it out on the smallest and largest nails of the range , and if the outcomes of those two experiments are positive , we are perfectly willing to believe that the hammer will suit us for all nails in between .
It is possible , and even tempting , to view a program as an abstract mechanism , as a device of some sort .
To do so , however , is highly dangerous : the analogy is too shallow because a program is , as a mechanism , totally different from all the familiar analogue devices we grew up with .
Like all digitally encoded information , it has unavoidably the uncomfortable property that the smallest possible perturbations — i.e. changes of a single bit — can have the most drastic consequences .
[ For the sake of completness I add that the picture is not essentially changed by the introduction of redundancy or error correction . ]
In the discrete world of computing , there is no meaningful metric in which " small " changes and " small " effects go hand in hand , and there never will be .
This second radical novelty shares the usual fate of all radical novelties : it is denied , because its truth would be too discomforting .
I have no idea what this specific denial and disbelief costs the United States , but a million dollars a day seems a modest guess .
Having described — admittedly in the broadest possible terms — the nature of computing 's novelties , I shall now provide the evidence that these novelties are , indeed , radical .
I shall do so by explaining a number of otherwise strange phenomena as frantic — but , as we now know , doomed — efforts at hiding or denying the frighteningly unfamiliar .
A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name " Software Engineering " .
As economics is known as " The Miserable Science " , software engineering should be known as " The Doomed Discipline " , doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self - contradictory .
Software engineering , of course , presents itself as another worthy cause , but that is eyewash : if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do , you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter " How to program if you cannot . " .
The popularity of its name is enough to make it suspect .
In what we denote as " primitive societies " , the superstition that knowing someone 's true name gives you magic power over him is not unusual .
We are hardly less primitive : why do we persist here in answering the telephone with the most unhelpful " hello " instead of our name ?
Nor are we above the equally primitive superstition that we can gain some control over some unknown , malicious demon by calling it by a safe , familiar , and innocent name , such as " engineering " .
But it is totally symbolic , as one of the US computer manufacturers proved a few years ago when it hired , one night , hundreds of new " software engineers " by the simple device of elevating all its programmers to that exalting rank .
So much for that term .
The practice is pervaded by the reassuring illusion that programs are just devices like any others , the only difference admitted being that their manufacture might require a new type of craftsmen , viz . programmers .
From there it is only a small step to measuring " programmer productivity " in terms of " number of lines of code produced per month " .
This is a very costly measuring unit because it encourages the writing of insipid code , but today I am less interested in how foolish a unit it is from even a pure business point of view .
My point today is that , if we wish to count lines of code , we should not regard them as " lines produced " but as " lines spent " : the current conventional wisdom is so foolish as to book that count on the wrong side of the ledger .
Besides the notion of productivity , also that of quality control continues to be distorted by the reassuring illusion that what works with other devices works with programs as well .
It is now two decades since it was pointed out that program testing may convincingly demonstrate the presence of bugs , but can never demonstrate their absence .
After quoting this well - publicized remark devoutly , the software engineer returns to the order of the day and continues to refine his testing strategies , just like the alchemist of yore , who continued to refine his chrysocosmic purifications .
Unfathomed misunderstanding is further revealed by the term " software maintenance " , as a result of which many people continue to believe that programs — and even programming languages themselves — are subject to wear and tear .
Your car needs maintenance too , does n't it ?
Famous is the story of the oil company that believed that its PASCAL programs did not last as long as its FORTRAN programs " because PASCAL was not maintained " .
In the same vein I must draw attention to the astonishing readiness with which the suggestion has been accepted that the pains of software production are largely due to a lack of appropriate " programming tools " .
( The telling " programmer 's workbench " was soon to follow . )
Again , the shallowness of the underlying analogy is worthy of the Middle Ages .
Confrontations with insipid " tools " of the " algorithm - animation " variety has not mellowed my judgement ; on the contrary , it has confirmed my initial suspicion that we are primarily dealing with yet another dimension of the snake oil business .
Finally , to correct the possible impression that the inability to face radical novelty is confined to the industrial world , let me offer you an explanation of the — at least American — popularity of Artificial Intelligence .
One would expect people to feel threatened by the " giant brains or machines that think " .
In fact , the frightening computer becomes less frightening if it is used only to simulate a familiar noncomputer .
I am sure that this explanation will remain controversial for quite some time , for Artificial Intelligence as mimicking the human mind prefers to view itself as at the front line , whereas my explanation relegates it to the rearguard .
( The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly : I 'd rather use them to mimic something better . )
So much for the evidence that the computer 's novelties are , indeed , radical .
And now comes the second — and hardest — part of my talk : the scientific and educational consequences of the above .
The educational consequences are , of course , the hairier ones , so let 's postpone their discussion and stay for a while with computing science itself .
What is computing ?
And what is a science of computing about ?
Well , when all is said and done , the only thing computers can do for us is to manipulate symbols and produce results of such manipulations .
From our previous observations we should recall that this is a discrete world and , moreover , that both the number of symbols involved and the amount of manipulation performed are many orders of magnitude larger than we can envisage : they totally baffle our imagination and we must therefore not try to imagine them .
But before a computer is ready to perform a class of meaningful manipulations — or calculations , if you prefer — we must write a program .
What is a program ?
Several answers are possible .
We can view the program as what turns the general - purpose computer into a special - purpose symbol manipulator , and does so without the need to change a single wire ( This was an enormous improvement over machines with problem - dependent wiring panels . )
I prefer to describe it the other way round : the program is an abstract symbol manipulator , which can be turned into a concrete one by supplying a computer to it .
After all , it is no longer the purpose of programs to instruct our machines ; these days , it is the purpose of machines to execute our programs .
So , we have to design abstract symbol manipulators .
We all know what they look like : they look like programs or — to use somewhat more general terminology — usually rather elaborate formulae from some formal system .
It really helps to view a program as a formula .
Firstly , it puts the programmer 's task in the proper perspective : he has to derive that formula .
Secondly , it explains why the world of mathematics all but ignored the programming challenge : programs were so much longer formulae than it was used to that it did not even recognize them as such .
Now back to the programmer 's job : he has to derive that formula , he has to derive that program .
We know of only one reliable way of doing that , viz . by means of symbol manipulation .
And now the circle is closed : we construct our mechanical symbol manipulators by means of human symbol manipulation .
Hence , computing science is — and will always be — concerned with the interplay between mechanized and human symbol manipulation , usually referred to as " computing " and " programming " respectively .
An immediate benefit of this insight is that it reveals " automatic programming " as a contradiction in terms .
A further benefit is that it gives us a clear indication where to locate computing science on the world map of intellectual disciplines : in the direction of formal mathematics and applied logic , but ultimately far beyond where those are now , for computing science is interested in effective use of formal methods and on a much , much , larger scale than we have witnessed so far .
Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA (= Three - Letter Acronym ) , I propose that we adopt for computing science FMI (= Formal Methods Initiative ) , and , to be on the safe side , we had better follow the shining examples of our leaders and make a Trade Mark of it .
In the long run I expect computing science to transcend its parent disciplines , mathematics and logic , by effectively realizing a significant part of Leibniz 's Dream of providing symbolic calculation as an alternative to human reasoning .
( Please note the difference between " mimicking " and " providing an alternative to " : alternatives are allowed to be better . )
Needless to say , this vision of what computing science is about is not universally applauded .
On the contrary , it has met widespread — and sometimes even violent — opposition from all sorts of directions .
I mention as examples
(0 ) the mathematical guild , which would rather continue to believe that the Dream of Leibniz is an unrealistic illusion
(1 ) the business community , which , having been sold to the idea that computers would make life easier , is mentally unprepared to accept that they only solve the easier problems at the price of creating much harder ones
( 2 ) the subculture of the compulsive programmer , whose ethics prescribe that one silly idea and a month of frantic coding should suffice to make him a life - long millionaire
( 3 ) computer engineering , which would rather continue to act as if it is all only a matter of higher bit rates and more flops per second
( 4 ) the military , who are now totally absorbed in the business of using computers to mutate billion - dollar budgets into the illusion of automatic safety
( 5 ) all soft sciences for which computing now acts as some sort of interdisciplinary haven
( 6 ) the educational business that feels that , if it has to teach formal mathematics to CS students , it may as well close its schools .
And with this sixth example I have reached , imperceptibly but also alas unavoidably , the most hairy part of this talk : educational consequences .
The problem with educational policy is that it is hardly influenced by scientific considerations derived from the topics taught , and almost entirely determined by extra-scientific circumstances such as the combined expectations of the students , their parents and their future employers , and the prevailing view of the role of the university : is the stress on training its graduates for today 's entry - level jobs or to providing its alumni with the intellectual bagage and attitudes that will last them another 50 years ?
Do we grudgingly grant the abstract sciences only a far - away corner on campus , or do we recognize them as the indispensable motor of the high - technology industry ?
Even if we do the latter , do we recognize a high - technology industry as such if its technology primarily belongs to formal mathematics ?
Do the universities provide for society the intellectual leadership it needs or only the training it asks for ?
Traditional academic rhetoric is perfectly willing to give to these questions the reassuring answers , but I do n't believe them .
By way of illustration of my doubts , in a recent article on " Who Rules Canada ? " , David H. Flaherty bluntly states " Moreover , the business elite dismisses traditional academics and intellectuals as largely irrelevant and powerless . " .
So , if I look into my foggy crystal ball at the future of computing science education , I overwhelmingly see the depressing picture of " Business as usual " .
The universities will continue to lack the courage to teach hard science , they will continue to misguide the students , and each next stage of infantilization of the curriculum will be hailed as educational progress .
I now have had my foggy crystal ball for quite a long time .
Its predictions are invariably gloomy and usually correct , but I am quite used to that and they wo n't keep me from giving you a few suggestions , even if it is merely an exercise in futility whose only effect is to make you feel guilty .
We could , for instance , begin with cleaning up our language by no longer calling a bug a bug but by calling it an error .
It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs , viz . with the programmer who made the error .
The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer 's own creation .
The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect : while , before , a program with only one bug used to be " almost correct " , afterwards a program with an error is just " wrong " ( because in error ) .
My next linguistical suggestion is more rigorous .
It is to fight the " if - this - guy - wants - to - talk - to - that - guy " syndrome : never refer to parts of programs or pieces of equipment in an anthropomorphic terminology , nor allow your students to do so .
This linguistical improvement is much harder to implement than you might think , and your department might consider the introduction of fines for violations , say a quarter for undergraduates , two quarters for graduate students , and five dollars for faculty members : by the end of the first semester of the new regime , you will have collected enough money for two scholarships .
The reason for this last suggestion is that the anthropomorphic metaphor — for whose introduction we can blame John von Neumann — is an enormous handicap for every computing community that has adopted it .
I have now encountered programs wanting things , knowing things , expecting things , believing things , etc. , and each time that gave rise to avoidable confusions .
The analogy that underlies this personification is so shallow that it is not only misleading but also paralyzing .
It is misleading in the sense that it suggests that we can adequately cope with the unfamiliar discrete in terms of the familiar continuous , i.e. ourselves , quod non .
It is paralyzing in the sense that , because persons exist and act in time , its adoption effectively prevents a departure from operational semantics and thus forces people to think about programs in terms of computational behaviours , based on an underlying computational model .
This is bad , because operational reasoning is a tremendous waste of mental effort .
Let me explain to you the nature of that tremendous waste , and allow me to try to convince you that the term " tremendous waste of mental effort " is not an exaggeration .
For a short while , I shall get highly technical , but do n't get frightened : it is the type of mathematics that one can do with one 's hands in one 's pockets .
The point to get across is that if we have to demonstrate something about all the elements of a large set , it is hopelessly inefficient to deal with all the elements of the set individually : the efficient argument does not refer to individual elements at all and is carried out in terms of the set 's definition .
Consider the plane figure Q , defined as the 8 by 8 square from which , at two opposite corners , two 1 by 1 squares have been removed .
The area of Q is 62 , which equals the combined area of 31 dominos of 1 by 2 .
The theorem is that the figure Q can not be covered by 31 of such dominos .
Another way of stating the theorem is that if you start with squared paper and begin covering this by placing each next domino on two new adjacent squares , no placement of 31 dominos will yield the figure Q .
So , a possible way of proving the theorem is by generating all possible placements of dominos and verifying for each placement that it does not yield the figure Q : a tremendously laborious job .
The simple argument , however is as follows .
Colour the squares of the squared paper as on a chess board .
Each domino , covering two adjacent squares , covers 1 white and 1 black square , and , hence , each placement covers as many white squares as it covers black squares .
In the figure Q , however , the number of white squares and the number of black squares differ by 2 — opposite corners lying on the same diagonal — and hence no placement of dominos yields figure Q .
Not only is the above simple argument many orders of magnitude shorter than the exhaustive investigation of the possible placements of 31 dominos , it is also essentially more powerful , for it covers the generalization of Q by replacing the original 8 by 8 square by any rectangle with sides of even length .
The number of such rectangles being infinite , the former method of exhaustive exploration is essentially inadequate for proving our generalized theorem .
And this concludes my example .
It has been presented because it illustrates in a nutshell the power of down - to - earth mathematics ; needless to say , refusal to exploit this power of down - to - earth mathematics amounts to intellectual and technological suicide .
The moral of the story is : deal with all elements of a set by ignoring them and working with the set 's definition .
Back to programming .
The statement that a given program meets a certain specification amounts to a statement about all computations that could take place under control of that given program .
And since this set of computations is defined by the given program , our recent moral says : deal with all computations possible under control of a given program by ignoring them and working with the program .
We must learn to work with program texts while ( temporarily ) ignoring that they admit the interpretation of executable code .
Another way of saying the same thing is the following one .
A programming language , with its formal syntax and with the proof rules that define its semantics , is a formal system for which program execution provides only a model .
It is well - known that formal systems should be dealt with in their own right , and not in terms of a specific model .
And , again , the corollary is that we should reason about programs without even mentioning their possible " behaviours " .
And this concludes my technical excursion into the reason why operational reasoning about programming is " a tremendous waste of mental effort " and why , therefore , in computing science the anthropomorphic metaphor should be banned .
Not everybody understands this sufficiently well .
I was recently exposed to a demonstration of what was pretended to be educational software for an introductory programming course .
With its " visualizations " on the screen it was such an obvious case of curriculum infantilization that its author should be cited for " contempt " of the student body " , but this was only a minor offense compared with what the visualizations were used for : they were used to display all sorts of features of computations evolving under control of the student 's program !
The system highlighted precisely what the student has to learn to ignore , it reinforced precisely what the student has to unlearn .
Since breaking out of bad habits , rather than acquiring new ones , is the toughest part of learning , we must expect from that system permanent mental damage for most students exposed to it .
Needless to say , that system completely hid the fact that , all by itself , a program is no more than half a conjecture .
The other half of the conjecture is the functional specification the program is supposed to satisfy .
The programmer 's task is to present such complete conjectures as proven theorems .
Before we part , I would like to invite you to consider the following way of doing justice to computing 's radical novelty in an introductory programming course .
On the one hand , we teach what looks like the predicate calculus , but we do it very differently from the philosophers .
In order to train the novice programmer in the manipulation of uninterpreted formulae , we teach it more as boolean algebra , familiarizing the student with all algebraic properties of the logical connectives .
To further sever the links to intuition , we rename the values {true , false} of the boolean domain as {black , white} .
On the other hand , we teach a simple , clean , imperative programming language , with a skip and a multiple assignment as basic statements , with a block structure for local variables , the semicolon as operator for statement composition , a nice alternative construct , a nice repetition and , if so desired , a procedure call .
To this we add a minimum of data types , say booleans , integers , characters and strings .
The essential thing is that , for whatever we introduce , the corresponding semantics is defined by the proof rules that go with it .
Right from the beginning , and all through the course , we stress that the programmer 's task is not just to write down a program , but that his main task is to give a formal proof that the program he proposes meets the equally formal functional specification .
While designing proofs and programs hand in hand , the student gets ample opportunity to perfect his manipulative agility with the predicate calculus .
Finally , in order to drive home the message that this introductory programming course is primarily a course in formal mathematics , we see to it that the programming language in question has not been implemented on campus so that students are protected from the temptation to test their programs .
And this concludes the sketch of my proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen .
This is a serious proposal , and utterly sensible .
Its only disadvantage is that it is too radical for many , who , being unable to accept it , are forced to invent a quick reason for dismissing it , no matter how invalid .
I 'll give you a few quick reasons .
You do n't need to take my proposal seriously because it is so ridiculous that I am obviously completely out of touch with the real world .
But that kite wo n't fly , for I know the real world only too well : the problems of the real world are primarily those you are left with when you refuse to apply their effective solutions .
So , let us try again .
You do n't need to take my proposal seriously because it is utterly unrealistic to try to teach such material to college freshmen .
Would n't that be an easy way out ?
You just postulate that this would be far too difficult .
But that kite wo n't fly either for the postulate has been proven wrong : since the early 80's , such an introductory programming course has successfully been given to hundreds of college freshmen each year .
[ Because , in my experience , saying this once does not suffice , the previous sentence should be repeated at least another two times . ]
So , let us try again .
Reluctantly admitting that it could perhaps be taught to sufficiently docile students , you yet reject my proposal because such a course would deviate so much from what 18 - year old students are used to and expect that inflicting it upon them would be an act of educational irresponsibility : it would only frustrate the students .
Needless to say , that kite wo n't fly either .
It is true that the student that has never manipulated uninterpreted formulae quickly realizes that he is confronted with something totally unlike anything he has ever seen before .
But fortunately , the rules of manipulation are in this case so few and simple that very soon thereafter he makes the exciting discovery that he is beginning to master the use of a tool that , in all its simplicity , gives him a power that far surpasses his wildest dreams .
Teaching to unsuspecting youngsters the effective use of formal methods is one of the joys of life because it is so extremely rewarding .
Within a few months , they find their way in a new world with a justified degree of confidence that is radically novel for them ; within a few months , their concept of intellectual culture has acquired a radically novel dimension .
To my taste and style , that is what education is about .
Universities should not be afraid of teaching radical novelties ; on the contrary , it is their calling to welcome the opportunity to do so .
Their willingness to do so is our main safeguard against dictatorships , be they of the proletariat , of the scientific establishment , or of the corporate elite .

The 80 - megawatt farm is to occupy as much as 640 acres ( 260 hectares ) and upon completion in 2011 will be 17 times the size of the largest U.S. solar farm , said Cleantech America LLC , a privately held 2 - year - old company .
The farm will also be about seven times the size of the world ’s biggest plant and double the largest planned farm , both in Germany .
Bill Barnes , CEO of Cleantech , said the scale of the Kings River Conservation District Community Choice Solar Farm will change renewable energy and make California the global leader for huge solar projects and replace Germany as the solar energy hub of the world .
“ We ’re pretty confident that solar farms on this scale are going to have an industry - changing impact , ” Barnes said by telephone on Friday .
“ We think it ’s the wave of the future .
This scale of project , I think , creates a tipping point for renewable energy . ”
Barnes declined to give the estimated construction cost of the Community Choice farm .
“ We think the impact for it will be similar to the impact of the computer chip , ” which gained computing power once made on a large scale , Barnes said .
“ So too will economies of scale like the Community Choice farm drive down the cost of solar , ” Barnes said .
Cleantech has announced two solar farms so far and the future projects it will announce are , as of now , to be in California and also in the range of the 80 - megawatt farm near Fresno , Barnes said .
Cleantech will partner with public agency California Construction Authority in building its projects .
Among the hurdles to be crossed before the new farm can be built , said Barnes , is buying the acreage somewhere in the San Joaquin Valley , hooking the farm to transmission lines , and contracting with a manufacturer of photovoltaic solar panels .
Cleantech plans to sell the solar - generated power -- enough for almost 21,000 homes -- to the Kings River Conservation District , which is a public agency that seeks to supply power generation for 12 cities and two counties in California ’s Central Valley .
Kings River is the water management arm of the San Joaquin Valley Power Authority , which was formed in November in order to purchase and generate enough power for the 12 cities and two counties to replace power now bought from investor - owned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co. a unit of PG&E Corp. and Southern California Edison , a unit of Edison International .
Last week , Cleantech announced plans to build a five - megawatt solar farm on 40 acres near Mendota , California , also in the Central Valley .
Power will be delivered to PG&E .
The biggest solar farm now in operation is the 4.6 - megawatt Springerville Generating Station near Tucson , Arizona which delivers power to Tucson Electric Power , a subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp ..
The Community Choice farm will not need state approval because Kings River is a self - generator and the farm is a renewable resource and does not emit pollution , Barnes said .
But that designation must be approved by the California Energy Commission .
Local permits must be given , he added .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A non-profit family - planning group founded by Thailand ’s “ Condom King ” has won the $ 1 million Gates Award for Global Health , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said on Tuesday .
The Population and Community Development Association of Thailand ( PDA ) won the 2007 award in recognition of its work in family planning and AIDS prevention , the foundation said .
“ Mechai Viravaidya is widely known as Thailand ’s ‘ Condom King , ’ a testament to his extraordinary popularity as well as his personal leadership in family planning and HIV prevention , ” Dr. Nils Daulaire , president and chief executive officer of the Global Health Council , said in a statement .
“ The world needs more leaders like Mechai , who are willing to tackle taboo subjects like sex and HIV / AIDS directly in order to save lives . ”
As part of the message , Viravaidya ’s group runs the popular Cabbages and Condoms restaurant in central Bangkok , serving Thai cuisine in a leafy garden decked out with holiday lights .
The name refers to his goal of making condoms as common as the leafy vegetable .
The Gates Foundation , run by the multibillionaire founder of Microsoft and his wife , said the PDA was set up in 1974 to provide family planning education to women in rural Thailand .
It helped establish Thailand ’s national HIV prevention campaign in 1991 , which led to a dramatic decline in new infections .
Thailand ’s program is perhaps best known for its liberal use of condoms .
“ PDA has trained nearly 3,000 health workers from 50 countries in HIV prevention , family planning , adolescent reproductive health , and other health issues , ” the Gates Foundation said .
Twice as many girls as boys are being born in some Arctic villages because of high levels of man-made chemicals in the blood of pregnant women , according to scientists from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( Amap ) .
The scientists , who say the findings could explain the recent excess of girl babies across much of the northern hemisphere , are widening their investigation across the most acutely affected communities in Russia , Greenland and Canada to try to discover the size of the imbalance in Inuit communities of the far north .
In the communities of Greenland and eastern Russia monitored so far , the ratio was found to be two girls to one boy .
In one village in Greenland only girls have been born .
The scientists measured the man -made chemicals in women 's blood that mimic human hormones and concluded that they were capable of triggering changes in the sex of unborn children in the first three weeks of gestation .
The chemicals are carried in the mother 's bloodstream through the placenta to the foetus , switching hormones to create girl children .
Lars - Otto Reierson , executive secretary for Amap , said : " We knew that the levels of man -made chemicals were accumulating in the food chain , and that seals , whales and particularly polar bears were getting a dose a million times higher than that existing in plankton , and that this could be toxic to humans who ate these higher animals .
What was shocking was that they were also able to change the sex of children before birth . "
The sex balance of the human race - historically a slight excess of boys over girls - has recently begun to change .
A paper published in the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences earlier this year said that in Japan and the US there were 250,000 boys fewer than would have been expected had the sex ratio existing in 1970 remained unchanged .
The paper was unable to pin down a cause for the new excess of girls over boys .
The Arctic scientists have discovered that many of the babies born in Russia are premature and the boys are far smaller than girls .
Possible links between the pollutants and high infant mortality in the first year of life is also being investigated .
Scientists believe a number of man-made chemicals used in electrical equipment from generators , televisions and computers that mimic human hormones are implicated .
They are carried by winds and rivers to the Arctic where they accumulate in the food chain and in the bloodstreams of the largely meat - and fish - eating Inuit communities .
The first results of the survey were disclosed at a symposium of religious , scientific and environmental leaders in Greenland 's capital , Nuuk , yesterday , organised by the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church , Bartholomew I , which is looking at the effects of environmental pollution on the Arctic .
Dr Reierson said the accumulation of DDT , PCBs , flame - retardants and other endocrine disrupters has been known for some time and young women had been advised to avoid eating some Arctic animals to avoid excess contamination and possible damage to their unborn children .
Dr Reierson , said blood samples from pregnant women were subsequently matched with the sex of their baby .
Women with elevated levels of PCBs in their blood above two to four micrograms per litre and upwards were checked in three northern peninsula 's in Russia 's far east - the Kola , Taimyr and Chukotka - plus the Pechora River Basin .
To check the results the survey was widened and further communities , including those on Commodore Island , were investigated .
The results were now in for 480 families and the ratio remained the same .
He said full results for the widening of the survey would not be published until next year but preliminary results for Greenland showed the same 2:1 ratio in the north .
Aqqaluk Lynge , the former chairman of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference who hails from Greenland , said : " This is a disaster , especially for some 1,500 people who make up the Inuit nations in the far north east of Russia .
" Here in the north of Greenland , in the villages near the Thule American base , only girl babies are being born to Inuit families .
" The problem is acute in the north and east of Greenland where people still have the traditional diet .
" This has become a critical question of people 's survival but few governments want to talk about the problem of hormone mimickers because it means thinking about the chemicals you use .
" I think they need to be tested much more stringently before they are allowed on the market . "
Backstory
The Inuit are nomadic in nature , having survived for thousands of years using formidable hunting skills to seek out the bowhead whale , seal , caribou and walrus .
The Inuit Circumpolar Conference ( ICC ) , an international body , was founded in 1977 to represent the rights of the approximately 150,000 Inuit of Alaska , Canada , Greenland , and Chukotka ( Russia ) .
With relatively low levels of educational attainment and few opportunities , violence , alcohol and drug dependency are a growing problem as the Inuit try to safeguard its traditions .

SHANGHAI
AS an American journalist based in China , I knew there was a good chance that at some point I ’d be detained for pursuing a story .
I just never thought I ’d be held hostage by a toy factory .
That ’s what happened last Monday , when for nine hours I was held , along with a translator and a photographer , by the suppliers of the popular Thomas & Friends toy rail sets .
“ You ’ve intruded on our property , ” one factory boss shouted at me .
“ Tell me , what exactly is the purpose of this visit ? ”
When I answered that I had come to meet the maker of a toy that had recently been recalled in the United States because it contained lead paint , he suggested I was really a commercial spy intent on stealing the secrets to the factory ’s toy manufacturing process .
“ How do I know you ’re really from The New York Times ? ” he said .
“ Anyone can fake a name card . ”
Thus began our interrogation , which was followed by hours of negotiations , the partial closing of the factory complex and the arrival of several police cars , a handful of helmet - wearing security officers and some government officials , all trying to free an American journalist and his colleagues from a toy factory .
This essay was prompted by a recent posting in the newsgroup which took someone to task for " using messages for synchronization " , saying in effect this was a Bad Thing and that there were perfectly fine mechanisms for synchronization already in place .
He cited timers , events , mutexes and semaphores .
I found this a bit odd because timers are not a synchronization mechanism .
Events can be used in certain situations , but are not always the best choice .
And while mutexes are certainly one of the two important choices for mutual exclusion synchronization , the far more efficient CRITICAL_SECTION was not mentioned .
And while semaphores can be used to synchronize the use of countable resources , they are not really a mutual exclusion primitive .
So this essay is going to talk about two mechanisms I use for interthread synchronization : messages and I/O completion ports .
A discussion of the tradeoffs between these is covered in a separate essay , so this is going to discuss the philosophy of why these are actually excellent choices for synchronization .
When it is n't needed at all
I have seen code of the form
volatile BOOL running ; // TRUE to allow thread to run , FALSE to stop it
void CSomeClass :: OnBnClickedStop ( ) { ... set running to FALSE }
Now , the problem is how to set the running flag to FALSE .
The correct answer is
running = FALSE ;
yet I have seen both of these alternatives :
EnterCriticalSection( &lockRunningFlag ) ; running = FALSE ; LeaveCriticalSection( &lockRunningFlag ) ;
and even
InterlockedExchange ( ( volatile long * ) &running , FALSE ) ;
The first form is merely grotesque .
The second form follows the same error of reasoning , but does so much more efficiently .
But in neither case does it make sense to provide an interlock .
An interlock is required only if two or more threads are modifying nonscalar values , or if two or more threads are modifying a scalar in a way that depends upon the previous value in the variable ..
In this case , the value is a single scalar value , and is being modified by only one thread , the thread that sets it to FALSE , no matter what the previous value is .
The other thread is only reading the value .
An operation like a++ , where a can be modified by more than one thread , is not multiprocessor - safe , even if implemented in a single instruction such as inc .
In this case , two or more threads would be attempting to modify the value at the same time , and in this case synchronization is mandatory .
But it is important to realize that the hardware provides synchronization on 32 - bit scalar values implicitly , so an operation that merely stores a value which does not depend on any previous state of the variable does not require synchronization .
An additional property that comes into play here is restricted monotonic mutability .
Even if two or more threads were writing the value , they would always write the same value ( FALSE ) , they write the same value no matter what the original value was , and they never change the value to anything else ever again .
So the value goes from one particular value to another particular value and only goes one way ( monotonic ) .
Synchronization Primitives Are Bad
If you need to do synchronization , you 've already added complexity to your code .
If you did n't need to add the synchronization , you have added either unnecessary complexity , or gratuitous complexity .
But it is clear that if if two threads are touching the same variable in a way that requires the previous value , or two threads are trying to modify a set of values in one or more objects in a way that require that the entire set of modifications give the illusion of being a single atomic action , then it is clear that you cannot allow two threads to operate on the values without guaranteeing that there will not be inconsistencies caused by concurrent access to the values by other threads .
One of the problems of synchronization primitives is that you must remember to actually use them .
If you fail to use them , then your code will malfunction and do something between producing erroneous results , corrupting data , and fatal access faults or storage assertions caused by fatal memory damage .
So first , you have to remember to use them .
One way to handle this is to never make the synchronization visible to the programmer using the object or objects .
To do this , you can conceal the synchronization within a class , and make sure that the only access to the values is via methods that are public while the values themselves remain protected .
But protected is not good enough .
A thread in a subclass of the object could access the fields without using synchronization .
So in this case , if you anticipate subclasses will be created , you would create protected methods to access the data , but declare the actual variables private so they cannot be accessed by any subclass .
class Something { public : Something ( ) { InitializeCriticalSection ( &lock ) ; } ~ Something ( ) { DeleteCriticalSection ( &lock ) ; } ... method1 ( ... ) ; ... method2 ( ... ) ; protected : ... method3 (... ) ; protected : CRITICAL_SECTION
lock ; private : ... the data being operated upon under control of the lock } ;
and generically ,
... Something :: method1 ( ... ) { EnterCriticalSection ( &lock ) ; ... computation ... LeaveCriticalSection ( &lock ) ; }
This works well until something within the critical section calls some other method of a class that also does locking .
Then we have the potential for deadlock , but because the locking is concealed in the class , we do n't actually notice it .
There are other problems with synchronization primitives .
One is that we should really set locks as part of a constructor for a locking primitive and release them when the object is destroyed ; this means that if exceptions are thrown , we will not leave a lock hanging .
The MFC primitives such as CCriticalSection were designed with this in mind , but they have been done so poorly that many programmers ( myself included ) refuse to have anything to do with them .
In fact , the MFC primitives are so riddled with errors that they are virtually unusable , and should be avoided completely .
For example , a CMutex will not indicate if there is a failure because of an abandoned mutex , a fundamentally flawed decision that makes it impossible to use CMutex for any serious programming .
Note that the above scenario can work well if the computation cannot throw an exception and makes no calls that involve additional synchronization primitives .
In MFC , where all exceptions that are thrown by MFC are subclasses of CException , it can be handled as
EnterCriticalSection ( &lock ) ; try { ... computation ... } catch ( CException * e ) { ... make sure all state is restored correctly LeaveCriticalSection ( &lock ) ; throw ; } LeaveCriticalSection ( &lock ) ;
Theoreticians in concurrency have spent a fair amount of effort to define higher - level synchronization mechanisms such as monitors ( Per Brinch - Hansen , in Concurrent Pascal ) , the theory of monitors was elucidated in a seminal paper by C.A.R. ( Tony ) Hoare in 1974 ; the concept of monitors appeared in many languages thereafter , including work by Nicklaus Wirth ( Modula ) and Butler Lampson ( Mesa ) ; was adapted by Jean Ichbiah as the concept of rendezvous ( Ada ) , and any google search will give thousands of citations to higher - level synchronization objects .
So the notion of using well - structured synchronization mechanisms rather than something like mutexes follows Edsger Dijkstra 's original paper ( " Cooperating Sequential Processes " , 1968 ) by only a few years .
Think of mutexes as being the " assembly code " of synchronization , and we would like to have the " C++ " or " C# " level of conceptual description of synchronization .
So in general , synchronization primitives are the technique last resort for synchronization .
Because we have so few high - level mechanisms available to us in C++/MFC ( and in my opinion , the MFC classes like CMutex are just syntactic saccharine [ not even as good as syntactic sugar ] on the primitive concepts of synchronization and therefore would add nothing significant even if they had been correctly implemented ; given how seriously broken they are , they actually have negative value in a program .
This is not to say that the use of mutexes and critical sections is inherently bad ; in restricted scenarios , there may not be a choice .
Key here is to not create a design that requires them to be visible .
Hiding them inside other classes helps , but even then there are risks .
The Cost of Synchronization
Synchronization represents where two threads touch .
If two threads touch , just like in a mechanical system , synchronization causes friction .
Friction in mechanical systems generates heat and wastes energy .
Synchronization primitives add overhead without actually adding any value to the computation ; they only make it correct , but they are not in and of themselves useful computation .
The overhead of calling the kernel , descheduling the thread , rescheduling the thread , and so on all represent what is essentially useless computation insofar as the problem domain is concerned .
In situations of high lock contention , two downsides arise : the aforementioned overheads of doing the synchronization , and in addition , the costs in terms of NUMA ( Non-Uniform Memory Access ) architectures ( particularly as exhibited by the AMD64 architecture , currently the most popular NUMA architecture around -- and I want to emphasize that their implementation is not a bad implementation ; the problem is intrinsic to all NUMA architectures , but it is representative of what we are going to see in the near future ) means that hitting that lock will cause interprocessor bus saturation as well .
The Positive - Handoff Protocol
This is a variant of the " apartment threading " model .
In apartment threading , only the thread that creates an object is permitted to operate on that object .
By imposing this restriction , the need for synchronization is defined out of existence .
The problem with this model is that all computations must be done by the owner thread ; it cannot delegate the work to secondary threads .
This would violate the requirement that it only be operated on by the owner thread .
Positive - handoff is a model that eliminates the restriction of having the object operated on only by the owner thread .
Instead , the requirement for a positive - handoff protocol is that only one thread at a time can operate on the object .
When a thread has completed whatever computation it wants to perform , it hands the object off to some other thread to do work , and it never again touches that object , unless it is handed back .
I use three different implementation mechanisms for positive - handoff , but all three are the same fundamental idea : put something into a queue and forget about it .
The basic principle of positive - handoff
An object is allocated , typically on the heap .
The pointer is passed around .
Once the pointer is sent to a thread , that thread , and that thread alone , is permitted to access the object .
The sender never again uses the pointer ( in fact , it is common practice to set the pointer to NULL if it is not a local variable ) .
Ultimately some thread is responsible for the deletion of the object .
This model is most commonly used for messages carrying data from secondary threads to the main GUI thread , but it is not restricted to that use alone .
It can be used for any interthread communication mechanism ; the key is to design the threads to work with this protocol .
PostMessage / PostThreadMessage
If the receiving thread has a window ( typically the main GUI thread ) , then I use PostMessage to hand off the object .
This works well for a low - bandwidth handoff ( discussed below ) .
If the receiving thread is a UI thread without any windows , I will use PostThreadMessage .
This requires an active message pump , so the thread must not be blocked on any operation in such a way as to interfere with the handling of these messages .
If posted to the main GUI thread , you can not use PostThreadMessage .
See my essay on worker threads for examples of using the PostMessage implementation of positive handoff .
The problem with PostMessage to the main GUI thread is that you can " saturate " the main GUI message pump , and interfere with WM_TIMER and WM_PAINT messages ( these messages are only dispatched if the message queue is empty , and PostMessage means that the queue might never be empty .
In addition , there is a nominal limit of 10,000 messages in the input queue ; after that , PostMessage will discard the message and return FALSE .
In addition , even if the 10,000 limit is not hit , even a few hundred messages can mean that the user sees poor response to keyboard and mouse input , an unacceptable situation .
To solve this , I use a hybrid of PostMessage and I/O Completion Ports ( see my essay on this topic ) to avoid message pump saturation .
I/O Completion Ports as queues
The PostMessage / PostThreadMessage solution works well when a single thread can handle all the traffic .
It does not work well if you want to delegate to one of many threads ( using a thread pool ) .
I often use an I/O Completion Port for this purpose .
The I/O Completion Port is one of the underappreciated features of Windows .
Not only is it the absolutely best way to handle asynchronous I/O ( much better than polling via GetCompletionStatus , far simpler than using callback I/O ) , but it is simply a nice kernel queuing mechanism .
This allows me to create thread pools quite easily .
I can have many threads waiting on the I/O Completion Port ( which has no file handles associated with it ) and thus build multi-producer / multi-consumer architectures .
( For the low - level implementation of producer / consumer architectures , see my essay on semaphores ) .
The Central Controller Protocol
This model is another variant of the apartment model .
In this model , only the thread that owns the object is allowed to access it .
However , other threads wish to operate on this object .
I use this model to implement both the input and output sides of a serial port ; the serial port is created ( possibly by the main GUI thread ) , and handed off to the secondary thread ; in fact , its " input " side is handed off to a worker thread and its " output " side is handed off to a a UI thread .
After this , the only way other threads can interact with the serial port is by communicating with those threads .
The input side of the serial port is handled by a worker thread that uses the Positive Handoff Protocol to send buffers back to the main GUI thread ; the output side is handled by a UI thread that receives requests via PostThreadMessage and handles the output side of the serial port .
No other thread in the entire application will touch the serial port .
One thread is the central controller for serial port input , and one thread is the central controller for serial port output .
Another common use of this is to deal with access to any shared resource .
No thread ever touches the object itself ; in order to effect any modification , or perform any query , it must queue up a request to the thread that owns the resource .
This thread will handle the request , and if any notification is required , will enqueue a notification to the owner thread .
Thus there is no synchronous model as in call / return ; initiation of a transaction is enqueued to the owner thread , and notifications of completion are asynchronously posted to the requestor thread .
One of the major failures in the architecture of concurrent systems is when the programmer is so locked into the synchronous call / return model that the asynchronous event - driven model is not even considered .
The artifices they impose to try to force fundamentally asynchronous events into a synchronous model are most politely referred to as dead - end kludges .
The advantage of the central controller model is that you can in general " fire - and - forget " a request .
You do not need to worry about synchronization , because there is none .
Only the owner of the object is working on the object , and it dequeues only one request at a time , so there is no concurrency with respect to the object .
No synchronization is necessary .
It 's All a Lie ...
Actually , there is synchronization going on .
It takes two forms : queue synchronization and storage allocator synchronization .
Obviously , if several threads are doing PostMessage or PostThreadMessage , someone has to maintain the integrity of the thread message queue .
And indeed , there is low - level synchronization going on .
But it is in the Post logic , and it is very fast .
Because so few instructions are required to enqueue a request , it most likely uses a spin lock , which is very low overhead .
The more serious lie deals with the synchronization at the storage allocator .
In Positive Handoff , the storage allocator is called by every thread creating an object to be handed off , and every thread that ultimately deletes the object .
This creates a possibility for serious collision in the allocator .
Note that this is still lower overhead than the cost of a mutex collision .
This is because the allocator is very fast , and is protected by a CRITICAL_SECTION .
A CRITICAL_SECTION will act as a spin-lock for a brief period of time before calling the kernel ; this time is typically sufficient for most allocation requests .
But in situations in which performance is critical , this potential overhead might be significant .
But the truth is that there is an overhead .
But the Real Truth is ...
It is easier to reason about synchronization when you use protocols like Positive Handoff and Central Controller than if you try to reason about mutexes and semaphores .
Because there is no explicit synchronization , there is no possibility of deadlock .
Because there is never a case in which two or more threads are actually touching an object , there is no possibility of forgetting to lock an object before it is used , or failing to unlock it when done .
Programs developed using this techniques are significantly easier to write , debug , and maintain than programs written with mutexes , CRITICAL_SECTIONs , or semaphores .
The key is to abandon traditional sequential models of thinking about problems , and adopt asynchronous , multithread - distributed models of computing , in which there is no explicit synchronization .
Note that classic call / return is a form of synchronized computing : you fire off a task to perform a computation ( call ) and wait until it terminates ( the return ) .
This model is a single - thread model ; it does not support concurrency .
As soon as you introduce concurrency , introducing artificial sequentiality either defeats the advantage of the concurrency or results in program structures that are so baroque that they cannot be reasoned about or effectively debugged .
Assuming the unlikely situation in which they actually are debugged , the structure of the program is fragile , and the slightest changes will result in catastrophe .
Summary
Interthread messaging is a powerful and flexible mechanism for avoiding the need for explicit synchronization .
It results in programs that are easier to write , easier to debug , easier to reason about , and easier to modify and extend than programs based on the use of low - level synchronization primitives .

You ’ve done the market research .
You have identified the hot products to sell .
Now it ’s time to use one of the most effective tools to make money at home and that is writing articles .
How can you profit by using articles ?
Well , a lot of internet marketers are saying the same mantra : articles , articles and more articles .
Write articles then submit them to article directories and money will follow – the promise that never came .
At least for me .
Money will not follow if article writing is not done right .
The gurus are not telling you the exact details on how to really make money writing articles .
You can make money online when people find your article , read it , click the link which will bring them to your site and then buy the product you are promoting .
If they do not buy right there and then , make sure that you capture their contact information , at least their name and email .
From there you can have tons of opportunities to sell and resell to them .
One of the entry points where people find you is thru the search engines .
And people coming from search engines are , most of the time , targeted , especially if they type specific search terms .
When I say search engine , I meant it to be synonymous with Google .
Do n’t bother with Yahoo or MSN anymore .
With 64 % of the market , Google is THE search engine .
So you have to get noticed by Google and placed higher in this mighty search engine ’s pedestal .
These are the steps :
Step 1 : Use long tail keyword phrases
Do n’t just target general keywords .
Nobody will find your site at Google and it would take an incredible amount of SEO to put you on page 1 or even page 2 .
Long tail keywords are those 3 – 5 keyword phrases which are very , very precise to whatever you are selling or promoting .
The chances to convert a search into sales are higher when the searcher types in a specific keyword phrase .
Here ’s an example for you .
‘ golf ’ is the primary keyword .
“ golf club ” is your secondary keyword .
“ cheap golf club ” is a long tail keyword .
If you go down deeper , it would be like “ cheap callaway golf club ” .
I mentioned this in how to find profitable markets .
You can use also use a free tool by following this link : keyword tool .
Before you go on using a long tail keyword phrase , check two things :
a) How many are searching for that keyword phrase
b ) How many are competing for that keyword phrase
When determining for the number of searches per month , be sure to use the optimized search results .
“ Optimized search results ” are simply the Google results that you get when you type the long tail keyword phrase with the quotation marks .
That is , “ get rid of cats ” ( search result = 53,700 ) is different from get rid of cats [ without the quotation ] ( search result = 1,310,000 )
You would not go ahead if the optimized search result is below 500 per month .
That would not be profitable for you .
Well , there are cases when long tail keywords with only a hundred searches per month would turn out profitable but as a rule you would not go for it as it would take an enormous amount of time and effort .
Step 2 : Put this long tail keyword phrase in the title of your article
If we use the example above “ get rid of cats , ” You can say “ How to get rid of cats ” or “ 3 gentle ways to get rid of cats ” or “ Get rid of cats quickly , ” Be innovative .
Make sure your title grabs the readers ’ eyeballs .
Remember that the title is an ad of your article .
It should lure the reader to click and read your article further .
Also , put this long tail keyword phrase inside the body of your article .
I have experienced good results by putting the phrase in the second sentence of the first paragraph and another phrase at the last paragraph .
Do n’t stuff your article with the keywords as this will signal Google of something spammy .
Remember that Google is older now and have grown a lot smarter .
Two or three of your chosen keyword phrase will do .
And here ’s another thing , with a lot of scraper sites ( websites that copy your content without including the source or your link ) , make sure to put an anchor text inside the body of your article .
This way , the scraper sites could still carry along your link and add to your popularity .
If you noticed , I also put links inside the body of my articles .
An added protection if somebody would just mercilessly scrape it without acknowledging the source .
Well , they could disable the link , but at least it makes their job a step harder .
Also , I ’m including the URL of my site http://www.grandstart.com, in case they do this .
Step 3 : Submit your article to ezinearticles only
Yes , you read it right .
Submit only to ezinearticles , do n’t submit the same article to other directories .
Do you know that Google plays favorites ?
Ezinearticles.com is one of its dear friends .
Maybe it could be of the fact that the good directory does not accept duplicate articles and the review process is done by a real person .
Or Chris knight and Larry Page are neighbors ? :>)
Do n’t know !
Well , with a pagerank 6 and Alexa rank of 531 , ezinearticles.com is the best place to submit your articles .
Hundreds of other smaller directories are picking up articles from ezinearticles so you do n’t have to worry on the distribution .
Step 4 : Create the resource box skillfully
This is an extremely vital component of the how to make money writing article process .
The efforts you put on writing that article would be put to waste if you just make a sloppy resource box .
If you ’re unfamiliar what exactly is a resource box .
It is the box right at the end of your article which gives some information about you or your business .

Step 5 : Repeat steps 1 - 4 but this time use a different long tail keyword phrase
Listen , to really make money online , write at least 15 - 20 articles dedicated to one product you are promoting .
Too many ?
Too hard ?
In my succeeding posts , I will show you some techniques to make article writing easier .
Do n’t shove many long tail keywords into your article .
Use only one long tail keyword per article .
However , you can write 2 or 3 different articles with the same targeted keyword phrase .
If you are limited to the number of allowed submissions per author , you can always use a pen name .
Now , start writing !
Most of the time people fail because of inaction .
Remember , it is not what you know that makes you a success , but what you do with what you know .
Watch Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) recite her talking points on MoveOn / NYT / General Petraeus flawlessly ...
... until Tucker substitute host David Shuster asks her the name of the last soldier from her district killed in Iraq .
Crooks & Liars has the video , and the key part of the transcript :
Shuster : " Let ’s talk about the public trust .
You represent , of course , a district in western Tennessee .
What was the name of the last solider from your district who was killed in Iraq ? "
Blackburn : " The name of the last soldier killed in Iraq uh - from my district I - I do not know his name -" Shuster : " Ok , his name was Jeremy Bohannon , he was killed August the 9th , 2007 .
How come you did n’t know the name ? "
Blackburn : " I - I , you know , I - I do not know why I did not know the name ... " [ Snip ]
Shuster : " But you were n’t appreciative enough to know the name of this young man , he was 18 years old who was killed , and yet you can say chapter and verse about what ’s going on with the New York Times and Move On.org . " [ Snip ]
Shuster : " But do n’t you understand , the problems that a lot of people would have , that you ’re so focused on an ad — when was the last time a New York Times ad ever killed somebody ?
I mean , here we have a war that took the life of an 18 year old kid , Jeremy Bohannon from your district , and you did n’t even know his name . "
Chapter and verse on the New York Times and MoveOn , but not so much as a name on the last soldier from her own district to die .
Not so much as a name .
UPDATE : Yes , hello .

With " Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer " set to give comic book fans another chaotic ride through the world of Marvel Comics ' favorite foursome , we thought it was about time we examined how the two earlier Fantastic Four films compared against the source material .
That 's right , we said two films .
As any self - respecting comic book geek ( and how often do you hear that phrase ? ) could tell you , the 2005 Fantastic Four film was not the first movie depicting Mr. Fantastic , The Invisible Girl , The Human Torch , The Thing and Doctor Doom in action .
That honor , dubious as it may be , falls on the unreleased 1994 film , " The Fantastic Four . "

The 1994 movie is legendary within fan circles .
While some confidently claim the film to be among the worst comic book film adaptations , others feel that the movie captured the spirit of the comic books more effectively than the 2005 film .
The only way you can see " The Fantastic Four " is to watch a bootlegged copy -- the movie was never released commercially in any format .
Why was the movie never released ?
That depends on who you ask .
In this article , we 'll take a look at this little - known release and how it compares to the big - budget 2005 film .

Golly gee whiz , it must be hard to work at the Heritage Foundation : to have one ’s doe - eyed innocence dashed again and again .
Even what seems like good news proves to be further evidence that Americans are just not as pure and perfect as the Heritage Foundation believes we should and could be .
So it was when the righteous ones heard that divorce rates had fallen significantly from their peak in 1981 .
Further investigation showed that fewer were divorcing because fewer were bothering to marry in the first place .
Frowny - faces all around at Heritage :
This is bad for the children !
Still further investigation revealed that divorce rates were significantly lower among college - educated couples .
You know why ?
Craziness !
It turns out opportunity makes people happier !
So perhaps we should reinvigorate our sagging social safety network .
You know what else we could try ?
Letting gay people marry .
Some of them actually want to do it , and their joyful celebrations could give the flagging institution a real shot in the arm .
And the economy , too .
Severn Trent Water says 350,000 people are without tap water and it could be two weeks before supplies are restored .
Many residents say they have struggled to find any mobile street dispensers - known as bowsers - with water in them .
Gordon Brown , who had earlier pledged £ 46 m for flood - hit councils , promised that more water supplies were coming .
Fresh floods have also hit Oxford while areas further along the Thames have been told water levels may peak later .
Homes were evacuated in Oxford overnight while places including Reading , Henley and Caversham are braced for similar flooding .
The Environment Agency still has six severe flood warnings in place - three on the Severn - in Gloucester , Tewkesbury and Worcester - two on the Thames around Oxford , and one on the Ock , near Abingdon , Oxfordshire .
BBC weather forecasters said flood - hit areas would see heavy rain of 10 mm to 15 mm on Thursday , which could slow the speed at which waters recede .
In Gloucestershire , water supplies were cut off after a treatment plant flooded .
Severn Trent Water is supplying more than 1,000 bowsers , while the Army delivered four million bottles of water on Wednesday .
But Gloucestershire 's Chief Constable Tim Brain said there had been instances of people " behaving most selfishly " , using " very large receptacles " to empty bowsers and trying to resell water at inflated prices .
" That is simply theft and it is being treated as theft , " he said .
Government review
A Severn Trent spokesman said they were aiming to do four or five refills per day but that one bowser could be emptied in less than half an hour if people filled up large containers .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown , on his second visit to the region since the floods , said great efforts were being made to help those without water , but added : " We 've got to get the supplies stepped up .
" We will get more tankers in , we will get more bowsers in , we will get more regular filling of them , and at the same time , more bottled water will be provided . "
He said a government review of the flood crisis and the response to it would look at whether similar problems could be avoided in future .
Mr Brown also told the House of Commons he would push insurance firms to make payouts .
Responding to questions in the Commons , Mr Brown said all councils affected by the floods would receive 100 % compensation .
RAIL DISRUPTION
Central Trains - services between Great Malvern and Hereford suspended First Great Western - services suspended between Oxford and Didcot , and Oxford and Worcester Virgin trains - services between Oxford and Reading suspended

He said that besides immediate spending , annual funds for flood protection would rise to £ 800 m by 2010 / 11 .
In Gloucestershire long queues formed in supermarket car parks as people waited to collect their daily ration of six two - litre bottles of water .
At Tesco in Quedgeley residents said the crisis had fostered a war - time spirit .
Reginald Davies , 91 , who fought during World War II , said : " I did five days without water in Burma .
" I 've seen men go mad from thirst .
This is nothing . "
Severn Trent Water said on Wednesday evening that it hoped to use a temporary solution to restore water supply to 10,000 homes in Tewkesbury from Thursday .
Meanwhile police said Mitchell Taylor , 19 , who has not been seen since leaving a bar in Tewkesbury at the height of the floods on Saturday , was still missing .

In a final settlement , Israel is expected to offer the Palestinians land swaps elsewhere to compensate .
The road will allow Israeli settlers living in the north , near Ramallah , to move quickly into Jerusalem , protected from the Palestinians who surround them .
It also helps ensure that the large settlement of Maale Adumim — a suburb of 32,000 people east of Jerusalem , where most of its residents work — will remain under Israeli control , along with the currently empty area of 4.6 square miles known as E1 , between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem , which Israel also intends to keep .
For the Palestinians , the road will connect the northern and southern parts of the West Bank .
In a future that may have fewer checkpoints , they could travel directly from Ramallah north of Jerusalem to Bethlehem south of it — but without being allowed to enter either Jerusalem or the Maale Adumim settlement bloc .
“ To me , this road is a move to create borders , to change final status , ” Mr. Seidemann said , referring to unresolved issues regarding borders , refugees and the fate of Jerusalem .
“ It ’s to allow Maale Adumim and E1 into Jerusalem but be able to say , ‘ See , we ’re treating the Palestinians well — there ’s geographical contiguity . ’ ”
Measure it yourself , he said .
“ The Palestinian road is 16 meters wide , ” or 52 feet , he added .
“ The Israeli theory of a contiguous Palestinian state is 16 meters wide . ”
Khalil Tufakji , a prominent Palestinian geographer , says the road “ is part of Sharon ’s plan : two states in one state , so the Israelis and the Palestinians each have their own roads . ”
The Palestinians , Mr. Tufakji said , “ will have no connection with the Israelis , but travel through tunnels and over bridges , while the Israelis will travel through Palestinian land without seeing an Arab . ”
In the end , he said , “ there is no Palestinian state , even though the Israelis speak of one . ”
Instead , he said , “ there will be a settler state and a Palestinian built - up area , divided into three sectors , cut by fingers of Israeli settlement and connected only by narrow roads . ”
A surprising 94 percent of Americans say they are satisfied with their lives – although far fewer in New York and other Eastern states think they ’re better off than they were five years ago , according to a new survey .
The Harris Poll of more than 1,000 people reported the overall “ satisfaction ” level , defined as people who said they were either very or somewhat satisfied with their lot , was up 4 percentage points , from 90 percent two years ago .
But only 42 percent of people in the Eastern U.S. said things had improved since 2002 .
By contrast , 60 percent of Southerners and 62 percent of Westerners said their lives had improved .
Democratic Rep. Jefferson to receive 16 count corruption indictment
Michael Roston
Published : Monday June 4 , 2007 Print This Email This
Rep. William Jefferson ( D - LA ) is set to face 16 public corruption charges from federal authorities , according to breaking news reports .
A maximum sentence for Jefferson could reportedly result in 200 years in prison .
The Justice Department will announce the charges in a 3:30 PM press conference .
Reuters is reporting that Jefferson will face a range of charges , including " racketeering , soliciting bribes , fraud , money laundering , obstruction of justice , conspiracy and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . "
The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington posted the full indictment to their blog , which can be downloaded from this link .
The Associated Press added that the charges against Jefferson were substantial , and the penalties could be significant .
" A Justice Department official familiar with the case said the indictment outlining the evidence against Jefferson is more than an inch thick and charges the congressman with crimes that could keep him in prison for up to 200 years , " wrote Lara Jakes Jordan .
The New Orleans Times - Picayune also says that Jefferson could continue to serve in Congress in spite of the charges filed against him .
An aide to the Louisiana Democrat , who was re-elected last November in spite of the cloud hanging over him , pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting bribery of a public official and conspiracy last year .
Vernon Jackson , CEO of a Kentucky - based internet company , also pleaded guilty to the act of bribery which Jefferson 's aide admitted to arranging .
Jefferson 's home and office in Washington , DC , were raided by the FBI in May last year , triggering a conflict between the executive and legislative branches in which former House Speaker Dennis Hastert spoke out in Jefferson 's defense .
DEVELOPING ...
Anthony Wilson was an influential figure in the " Madchester " scene
The founder of Factory Records , the label which launched New Order and the Happy Mondays , died on Friday at the age of 57 .
Wilson , dubbed Mr Manchester , had been suffering kidney cancer after being diagnosed last year .
TV presenter Terry Christian said : " No Tony Wilson , no Manchester music scene . "
Stephen Morris , from Joy Division and New Order , who were signed to the Factory Records label , said he owed him his career .
He would get the abuse and the vitriol that we all get if we 're on television and it would amuse him
TV Presenter Richard Madeley
How Tony Wilson changed music
" He was I think , the only person in the music industry that did n't believe in contracts .
" You 'd see him do deals with record companies and the whole thing was done on the back of his hand .
You could literally do what you want . "
TV Presenter Richard Madeley said : " He really did n't care what his colleagues or what the viewers thought about him because he had total belief in himself , and that was the most charming thing about Tony .
You are a true icon , an inspiration
Note on floral tribute
" He would get the abuse and the vitriol that we all get if we 're on television and it would amuse him . "
Coronation Street star Michael LeVell , who plays mechanic Kevin , said Wilson was " one of the biggest and liveliest characters " .
" He was never a man to mince his words .
He just said what he thought and if you did not like it , ' stuff you ' .
" He was a godsend to Manchester . "
Paul Ryder , brother of Sean and the bassist of the Happy Mondays , shared his memories of Wilson .
" I was seventeen years old and I first met him , and I was a bit nervous .
" This was before we signed to Factory , his words to me were , you might not make any money on Factory , but I can guarantee you , you will see the world .
" And I thought that will do for me . "
Truly a great Mancunian ...
Anthony Wilson will be missed by many but only forgotten by a few
Councillor Jim Battle
Dave Haslam , who Wilson gave a job DJ-ing at the Hacienda , said : " I 'm just one of the many , many people , he opened doors for ...
He gave people like me an opportunity . "
Peter Saville , from Factory Records , told BBC Newsnight Wilson was good at spotting things that become important .
He said : " Tony to me was an intellectual in popular culture .
So whether it was television or music
Tony brought a kind of gravitas to it and a sense of importance to it . "
The deputy leader of Manchester City Council , Jim Battle , called Wilson a " truly great " Mancunian , saying he generated pride in the city .
' Massive loss '
Mr Battle said : " Anthony Wilson placed Manchester on the world stage at the leading edge of music and culture .
" Truly a great Mancunian .
Anthony Wilson will be missed by many but only forgotten by a few . "
BBC Radio Manchester presenter Terry Christian said he was absolutely devastated .
" I loved Tony .
To me he is irreplaceable .
It is a massive loss to Manchester , " he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
A bolshy , no nonsense yet compassionate character .
Tony Wilson epitomised the Mancunian psyche , his legacy will live on forever .
Councillor Mike Amesbury
Send us your comments
" Tony was so full of life .
He was fantastic and I never got tired of his company . "
He added : " He was the icon figure we could all kick against .
He was the whole representation of Manchester . "
Flowers and tributes are also being left outside the Hacienda apartments in Whitworth Street West where Wilson 's nightclub once stood .
One tribute said : " What a legend Manchester has lost , love will never tear us apart . "
Another said : " You are a true icon , an inspiration , I truly wish that I could have known you .
" Your spirit will live on in Manchester .
The people and the city will never , ever , forget you . "
It so often seems that our government is not using its resources efficiently , everyone has heard of the thousand dollar toilet seats , and the wasteful government contracts .
However the Iraq
War has been one of the most colossal wastes of money this country has ever undertaken .
Not to mention the horrific lose in life , both American and Iraqi , a loss more grave than any amount of money .
But what if we could get that money back ?
What if we could use it for something that would benefit humanity .
Several groups have attempted to quantify exactly that .
The National Priorities Project has done a great study of what exactly a half of a trillion dollars would buy for America and her people .
They break it down by state for instance in Massachusetts they have the following .
The site has more , and I recommend you check it out .
Much more below .
Another person who has done an interesting calculation is Paul Gipe ( if you are involved in wind power you will know that name , Gipe has written some of the best educational texts on wind power ) .
Gipe has decided to see how much renewable energy that amount of money could have got the nation .
The most shocking finding is that with half a trillion dollars you could build enough wind turbines to produce almost a third of all the energy used in the Untied States (! ) .
Gipe uses some fairly conservative estimates , and the results are still pretty stunning .
With the current high cost of solar energy ( estimated to become cheaper than carbon based energy by 2014 ) , the “ war panels ” would only produce about 1 - 3 % , which while small is still a lot of energy that would no longer require coal oil or gas to produce .
He estimates that you could put a 2.5 kw system on 18 % of American homes with that kind of money .
More significantly , such a large - scale development program , reminiscent of Roosevelt ’s Works Progress Administration , would push America to the forefront of solar photovoltaics technology , enabling us to not only meet our own needs for clean , renewable electricity , but also enabling us to ship panels to distantâ€ “ shall we say “ foreign ” landsâ€ “ to help them meet their more modest needs .
Perhaps in the future we can ship wind turbines and solar panels to the Persian Gulf instead of our sons and daughters .
( via )
I really like the idea of fighting wars over oil with renewable energy .
Paul Gipe is an amazing man , and you should pick up any of his books on wind power to quickly get up to speed on the science and technology behind wind power today .
The New York Times also did a piece on how much the money from the Iraq war could have gotten us .
( be aware this graphic was done in January )
They place the cost of the war at a staggering 1.2 trillion dollars .
Paul Gipe ’s estimates above were assuming a direct cost of half a trillion , if we combine the two we could estimate that as much as 60 % of our energy could be produced from wind ( a high estimate ) .
So lets say that we get real conservative here and say that 10 - 30 % of our nations energy supply could have been from renewable sources right now , had we invested all the money from the Iraq war into renewable energy .
What would a nation like this look like ?
Well for one we would have a lot more jobs .
Someone is going to have to build , ship , install , and maintain all those turbines and panels .
I know that in the part of the Midwest where I grew up there is a massive lack of manufacturing jobs .
There is a large pool of skilled labor just waiting for a crack at working in a wind turbine factory , or a solar panel plant .
This influx of new jobs would help drive more economic growth .
We would also have a lot smaller carbon footprint .
Not only because we were using more renewable energy , but we would also have avoided the massive amount of carbon emitted by the war itself .
War machines are not known for their fuel efficiency , a hummer started off as a Humvee , armor plate a hummer and see what kind of millage you get .
Not to mention the massive amount of co2 released flying and shipping all the troops and equipment back and forth to the other side of the Atlantic ocean on a daily basis .
There would also be the issue of international diplomacy .
The Iraq war was the turning point .
After 9/11 almost the entire world was sympathetic to America .
Willing to help us out in anyway we needed .
When we decided to go to war we ruined all that .
If instead we would have responded with a massive renewable energy campaign ( perhaps also with a ratification of the Kyoto protocol ) we could have capitalized on that good will to show the world the way forward .
I understand that we ca n’t change the past , but looking backwards with some amount of contemplation can show us the road forward .
If instead of spending another half trillion dollars over the next 4 years on the war we instead invested in our infrastructure ( schools , health care , renewable energy ) we could reap the rewards we have missed out on .

水虫を治すために、知るべきことは多々ありますが、用いる薬について理解を深めることは最も重要です。
病院から薬剤を処方された時は、医者の指示に沿って使用すれば、問題ありません。
ドラッグストアなどで、市販品を購入した時は、自分に適した用法用量を事前に確認した上で、利用しなければなりません。
水虫を治療するために使用する薬は、外用薬と内服薬の2種類に分けることができます。
肌に塗布する外用薬の場合、医者から処方される以外に、市販品を購入して手に入れることも可能です。
一方、内服薬の場合は、医者から受け取る処方箋が無ければ、購入できません。
通常の水虫の症状であれば、外用薬が処方されますが、重症化し爪にまで菌が侵入するようになると、内服薬が処方されるようになります。
外用薬に比べ、取り扱いがシビアなので、薬剤師もしくは医師の指示通りに使用してください。
従来の水虫の塗り薬は、1日の間に3回程度塗布しなければ、効果が得られませんでした。
しかし、医療技術が進歩し、より一層効果的な抗真菌薬が発明されるようになると、入浴後一度使用するだけで十分になりました。
次々と新たな薬が登場し、現時点ではおよそ20種類も存在していると言われています。
高い効果が得られる反面、患部に対し直接的に塗り込むので、量が多すぎたり、使い過ぎるとかぶれてしまう可能性もあります。
初めて使用開始した方に、かぶれの症状が生じるのは、使用開始後10日後と言われています。
使い始めて10日後に異変を感じた時には、医療機関に相談するようにしてください。
水虫の薬は、液剤タイプを選ぶことが推奨されています。
液剤タイプであれば、すぐに乾くので、歩いた後に床を汚す心配がありません。
Photo Illustration : Christopher Griffith Every morning of every weekday for 12 years , Thomas Montgomery punched in at the Dynabrade factory in Clarence , a small town in upstate New York .
He strapped on his goggles and stood at his machine until the late afternoon , churning out components for power tools .
After work , he walked the family dog , Shadow , and took his two daughters to swim practice .
He became such a regular presence at the local swim club that he was named its vice president .
He tried to be a good father and a decent husband to his wife of 16 years , Cindy .
There were a few things he enjoyed — poker night on Fridays with the guys , playing Texas Hold ' Em on Pogo.com , and the Dynabrade euchre tournament , which he dominated for two years in a row .
For the most part , though , life was uneventful .
Which may be why Montgomery looked at himself — a 45 - year - old former marine with a reddish mustache , bulging gut , and disappearing hair — and decided to become someone else .
That person , he wrote on Dynabrade stationery that he stored in his toolbox at work , would be an 18 - year - old marine named Tommy .
He would be a black belt in karate , with bullet scars on his left shoulder and right leg , thick red hair , and impressive dimensions ( 6 '2 " , 190 pounds , and a " 9 " dick " ) .
Emboldened by his new identity , Montgomery logged onto Pogo in the spring of 2005 and met TalHotBlondbig50 — a 17 - year - old from West Virginia , whose name , he later learned , was Jessica .
He began instant - messaging " Jessi , " who later also went by the handle " peaches_06_17 , " and the lies flowed easier with every press of the Return key .
His mom had died of cancer when he was 12 , he told her , and his father was a military man .
At 17 , Tommy had raped a cheerleader , and his life became so hopeless that he enlisted in the Marines .
After a stint at boot camp in June to train as a sniper , he was headed to Iraq .
Montgomery concocted elaborate ruses to maintain Tommy 's cover story , creating a second identity as Tommy 's dad , Tom Sr. , who bore a striking resemblance to the real Montgomery .
Tommy 's access to the Internet was supposedly limited because of his military duties , so Dad , as Jessi soon referred to him , began shuttling messages between the two lovers .
He also told Jessi to send any mail and packages for Tommy to him , because he had contacts in Iraq and could get them to the young marine quickly .
Tommy 's tales of hard luck drew Jessi in .
He was in need of comfort , and Jessi provided it , saying she was proud of him despite his mistakes .
Tommy responded by telling her that she was " the best thing that ever happened to him . "
As their intimacy grew , he sent her a picture of a young marine , claiming it was himself , and confided that he planned to commit suicide in Iraq ; she made him promise to stay alive for her .
They talked on the phone when they could .
But if Jessi could n't reach Tommy , she sometimes IM'd Tom Sr. to talk about her lover .
Jessi also emailed Tommy photos of herself , care of Tom Sr . She lived up to her screen handle , whether she was running her fingers through her flowing blond hair or wading in a pool in a yellow bikini or showing off her long tan legs in a denim miniskirt .
Jessi fell for Tommy , and Montgomery did , too — or , at least , for the idea of himself as Tommy , a young man on his way to a future with the prettiest girl around .
Tommy told Jessi that he'd had their special motto — the Marine saying " Always and Forever " — tattooed on his arm , along with her name encircled by a heart .
Jessi , for her part , crafted video montages of herself for Tommy that were set to power ballads like Aerosmith 's " I Don't Want to Miss a Thing " and Lonestar 's " I'm Already There . "
Jessi's photos provoked the couple 's first major blowup : Montgomery became convinced she 'd sent her pictures to other online admirers and accused her of betraying him .
To apologize , Jessi sent him a snail - mail letter , enclosing one of her G - strings and a sterling silver " key to my heart " chain .
She signed off the missive with " T&J " inside a heart .
Tommy forgave her , but Montgomery , in his role as " Dad " and occasional intermediary , did not .
She defended her mistake , writing in frustration that Tommy " has let it go why wont you . "
Tom Sr. wrote , " because u will hurt him and hes an idiot and will believe ur lying ass . "
Meanwhile , Jessi and Tommy had settled into a routine , talking by phone between 6:30 and 6:40 am and from 3:30 to 3:40 pm , when Jessi was led to believe that her " sweet sexy marine " was off duty .
By Christmas , about eight months after they met online , Tommy proposed marriage and Jessi accepted .
He sent her poinsettias , and she sent him more G - strings and dog tags engraved with the message TOM & JESSI ALWAYS & FOREVER .
Jessi worried constantly about Tommy 's safety , writing , " I know your being careful honey and you have the best with you but I also know anything can happen . "
Anticipating his return from Iraq , Jessi planned for their first night together , expressing nerves about what would be her " first time . "
She ended on an optimistic note : " Wo n't be long until its Jessica Blair Montgomery . "
Montgomery was consumed by his marathon online chats with Jessi .
While at work , he did n't stop talking about her , telling colleagues that he planned to leave his wife and move to West Virginia .
In the evening , he would chase his daughters off the computer , planting himself in front of the screen late into the night .
Cindy could n't compete with his new obsession .
For New Year 's , Montgomery made a resolution , which he scribbled on his work pad .
" On January 2 , 2006 , Tom Montgomery ( 46 years old ) ceases to exist and is replaced by an 18 - year - old battle - scarred marine , " he wrote .
" He is moving to West Virginia to be with the love of his life . "
He vowed that he would set aside enough of his imaginary millions to care for Cindy and the girls , even as he fantasized about the life he would build with Jessi .
When the new year began , however , he was still stuck in his aging body and stale life .
He wrote in frustration , " I wish I would know the exact time I would change to new Tom to prepare for it . "
Cindy did not know about her husband 's double , or rather triple , life .
But she did know that something had changed inside her two - story yellow house .
" He would n't get off the Internet , " she said .
" It gave him access to something he would n't have had otherwise . "
Then , in February 2006 , she discovered some of Jessi 's mementos and unraveled the truth .
Cindy 's marriage might not have been the happiest , but contending with the layers of deceit she uncovered — not to mention a teenager 's lingerie — was too much .
" What I can not believe is that you are living out some bizarre fantasy — as father and son , " she wrote in a note to her husband .
" If you want to separate — We can ... but to continue to lie to me & the kids while she is sending ' your son ' gifts in the mail is not acceptable . "
The couple stayed in the same house , though Montgomery complained to a coworker about being consigned to the basement .
As a mother , however , Cindy felt she had to do something for Jessi .
She wrote a letter , enclosing a recent photo of her family .
" Let me introduce you to these people , " she said , describing her husband , Tom , her daughters , 12 and 14 years old , and herself — the " c , " as she put it , in Montgomery 's many emails to Jessi from their account named " tcmontgomery 1 . "
There was no son , she told Jessi , only her husband , a 46 - year - old former marine .
" From what I am pulling from your letters you are much closer to [ my daughter 's ] age than mine let alone Tom's , " Cindy wrote .
" Are you over the age of 18 ?
In this alone , he can be prosecuted as a child predator . "
Adding that Jessi could be her own daughter , Cindy offered some maternal advice : " Do not trust words on a computer . "
IM transcript , April 17 , 2006
__Jessi did n't know __who to believe .
Was there no Tommy ?
Or had Cindy invented the story because she wanted Tommy for herself ?
Jessi found a friend Montgomery had mentioned who also frequented Pogo : " Beefcake1572 , " or Brian Barrett , a 22 - year - old student at Buffalo State College who worked part - time at Dynabrade with Montgomery and played poker with him .
When Barrett confirmed his friend 's trickery , Jessi was devastated .
How could her " everything , " as she referred to Tommy , be a nothing ?
She turned to Barrett for solace , playing Lottso , a kind of Bingo , with him in the Princess Priceless room on Pogo and IMing him on Yahoo .
Their conversations quickly turned intimate .
Soon , in public forums online , she and Barrett called Montgomery a child predator and taunted him .
Montgomery was suspended from a game room .
She shared her passwords with Barrett , who would log onto her accounts and talk to Montgomery as Jessi to humiliate him .
At work , Barrett boasted about his new relationship .
Montgomery was furious .
" Half the company " thought he was a " fucking loser and predator , " he IM'd Jessi .
Parents no longer trusted him with their kids .
His life was so destroyed that he appeared to be contemplating suicide .
" U can say goodbye forever to me and Tommy , " he told Jessi .
IM transcript , May 20 , 2006
Despite her own anger , Jessi could n't turn her back completely on Montgomery .
He was all that remained of her lost Tommy , after all .
" If he existed I would still be holding him everynight and sharing dreams with him everynight , " she wrote Montgomery .
He remarked bitterly that she could " fill that void " with a different admirer .
But Jessi continued to placate him , saying , " I ache to be with Tommy , " noting that the 18 - year - old existed in Montgomery 's continued love for her .
Jessi promised Montgomery she would stop talking to Barrett , saying she took up with him mainly to get revenge .
Her existence was a " living hell , " she said , and she just wanted " everyone to hurt " like she did .
Despite her promises , Jessi continued her romance with Barrett .
Her conversations with him reflected ordinary teenager hang - ups :
She complained about her mother , talked about her preparations for prom , and chatted about her part - time job as a lifeguard .
Their sessions often ended with Barrett typing one - handed while Jessi urged him on with comments like " can I kiss something long and hard . "
At first , Jessi wanted to hide the rekindled relationship from Montgomery , but Barrett persuaded her to go public , and they posted about each other in their online profiles .
As they anticipated , Montgomery noticed immediately .
" I cant believe u chose her over r friendship , " he told Barrett .
" U wanted her u got her just tell her to leave me the fuck alone . "
Jessi seemed torn between the two men .
When Barrett wanted to visit her during his vacation , she told him not to come .
While he was away and offline , she turned to Montgomery again , telling him that she planned to break up with Barrett .
Montgomery heaped abuse on her .
But he finally agreed to forgive her if she promised , yet again , never to lie to him about Barrett .
" If I find out any lies were told to me u will lose something very close to u , " Montgomery warned her .
IM transcript , May 27 , 2006
He was training , he told Jessi , for " war . "
But he was n't going to Iraq .
For the first time in 15 years , Montgomery was working out ; every day , he ran 5 miles and spent two hours at the gym .
He began making vague threats at work .
One employee was so jittery that he donned a bulletproof vest as a joke one day .
Montgomery and Jessi could n't pull away from each other or their computers .
They spent so much time online " as friends " that Montgomery was barely sleeping .
He showered Jessi with attention , and she enjoyed the adulation .
If he was n't engaged in intricate analogies about his " snake " in her " wv [ West Virginia ] fox , " he was professing his love .
But time and again , his affection would veer toward violent jealousy at Jessi 's online boyfriends .
He repeatedly threatened to post Jessi's home address online so that the " niggers " could find her easily .
Even as she talked him down , Jessi seemed to thrive on the whiplash .
Whenever Montgomery threatened to " delete " her from his life , she begged him not to .
In late summer 2006 , Montgomery found out that Jessi and Barrett were talking again .
The cycle of invectives began anew .
Nothing seemed much different at first .
But then , after days of futile attempts to appease Montgomery , Jessi went quiet .
On September 13 , 2006 , he IM'd her at 1:33 in the morning , telling her " u r a whore and thats all u will ever be . "
She wrote back " im leaving now " and signed off .
Montgomery sent her several more messages throughout the day , to little response .
The next day , he pinged her again : " hey whore u suck ur bf brians cock today . "
The white IM window stared back at him .
The following morning , on the 15th , he called her , waking her up .
He was screaming , she says , and in an uncontrollable rage .
She hung up .
Later that evening , at 10:16 pm , Barrett punched out of work and walked to his white pickup truck in the Dynabrade parking lot .
He swung open the door of his truck , settling into his seat .
Three shots pierced the driver 's side window , and Barrett slumped sideways .
He 'd been shot in the neck and upper arm by what police believe was a .30 - caliber carbine rifle .
IM transcript , September 13 , 2006
Just before midnight , Montgomery was at his computer .
" U waiting for ur bf , " he wrote .
At 2:15 in the morning , he tried again , writing " come on cw ur bf brian wont mind u talking to me . "
In interviews with detectives several days after the murder , tipsters fingered Montgomery as the likely culprit .
He 'd been bad - mouthing Barrett , and his behavior had grown increasingly erratic .
According to the detectives , a coworker said that Montgomery told him " he would n't be stupid enough to leave shell casings lying around if he were to kill someone . "
While standing at the time clock two weeks before the killing , Montgomery had asked that same employee what time Barrett got off work .
When detectives later examined Barrett 's cell phone , they found Jessi 's number .
Lieutenant Ron Kenyon called her in the middle of the night to confirm that she'd had an online relationship with Montgomery and to warn her that she might be in danger .
He then sent a message to her local police department in West Virginia , requesting that a cop go to Jessi 's home at the address she 'd given him .
Officer J. L. Kirk arrived the next morning at a dingy white house next to an automotive - parts dealer .
But Jessi was n't there .
Her mother , Mary , said that the teenager was away and that she had no way to contact her .
Kirk reported back to Kenyon , who insisted that he'd just spoken to Jessi a few hours earlier and that she had to be in the house .
Kirk continued questioning Mary , whose manner struck him as strange .
The more he pressed , the more nervous she got until she finally " came clean , " as Kirk put it .
She was the woman Kenyon had spoken to .
In fact , she was the woman Barrett had fallen so hard for .
And yes , Mary was the woman Montgomery may have killed for .
She 'd used her daughter 's identity to beguile the two men .
Back in Buffalo , Kenyon could n't believe that the Jessi he 'd talked to was really her mother .
" She was very convincing , " he said .
" She sounded like an 18 - year - old girl to me . "
He drove to West Virginia to see the truth himself — that the lithe 18 - year - old blonde of Barrett 's and Montgomery 's fantasies was a plump 45 - year - old married mother of two with short brown hair .
Thomas Montgomery ( top ) and Brian Barrett .
Photos : WIVB -TV ; courtesy of Deb BarrettWhen he was questioned about the murder , Montgomery told detectives he needed to retrieve his lunch from his car , because his peaches would spoil .
The cops noted his taste for that fruit : A peach pit — which later tested positive for Montgomery 's DNA — had been found next to Barrett 's truck .
A leather cartridge case with dog hairs that they surmised belonged to Shadow was found in the same area .
In addition to Jessi's G- strings at the Montgomery house , police also unearthed a photo of his gun cabinet containing a .30 - caliber rifle , now missing from the cabinet .
At the time of the questioning , Montgomery had no idea he'd been conned by Mary .
On November 27 , police arrested Montgomery on murder charges .
He denied killing Barrett , saying he'd gone to a local restaurant and arrived home between 10:00 and 10:10 pm , before the killing took place .
His wife estimated that he arrived a half hour or more later .
Montgomery 's cell phone records also put him in the vicinity of Dynabrade at the time of the murder .
Furthermore , investigators intercepted a call that he placed to his wife from prison that seemed to suggest the cartridge case was his .
Of course there were dog hairs on the cartridge case , he told her .
Did n't she remember the state of his car ?
Then there was the matter of the hundreds of pages of correspondence and dozens of photos he kept on his computer to document , and savor , every moment of his time with Jessi :
It was a digital paper trail showing a man careening out of control .
Ken Case , the assistant district attorney who worked on the case , said , " He was a guy who prior to this happening was a very dedicated father .
To make that much of a transformation , as a result of communicating with a fictitious person , is pretty frightening . "
When I caught up with Mary outside her home , she strode to the family van in the driveway and took off , then hit the brake abruptly to ask me who I was .
She wore a gray T - shirt , jeans , and black flip - flops ; her nails and toenails were perfectly manicured .
She burst into tears at the mention of Barrett 's murder , her French tips and diamond ring glinting in the sun as she pushed a crushed paper towel under her sunglasses to dab away the tears .
She begged * wired * not to use her last name .
Locals say she was " one of the best parents around " and a devoted cheerleader at Jessi 's basketball and softball games .
The principal of the middle school that her children attended was so impressed with Mary and her maternal dedication that he hired her for part - time clerical work .
In all of Jessi's 18 years , Mary told me , she had missed only one of her daughter 's games , to work the polls at election time .
How could a mother like that , I asked her , hijack her daughter 's identity to seduce strangers ?
Her answers , unsatisfactory as they are , suggest a profound capacity for self - deception .
Mary said she joined Pogo a few years ago to relax and kill some time .
It was only after she paid for the membership , however , that she realized she 'd used Jessi 's screen name .
Mary was directed to a teen room , and she never bothered to correct the mistake .
She did n't intend for her many admirers to fall in love with her .
Nor did she fall in love with any of them ; she says she is happily married to her husband of 23 years .
Brian was a " sweetheart " and when he initiated the flirtation , she did n't know how to discourage it without revealing her true identity .
Tommy , she said , " was a child who needed someone to show him they cared . "
Why , then , did she continue talking to Montgomery once she knew Tommy did n't exist ?
She says she worried he would take advantage of a real 18 - year - old .
" I should have just let it go , " Mary conceded .
But she did n't , and then she had to keep talking to him to prevent him from doing harm — first to himself , it seemed , and later to her own family members .
That 's the story , more or less , that Mary seems to have told her daughter , whom she refers to lovingly as " my princess " ; her husband ; and , after boarding a plane for the first time in her life , the grand jury in Buffalo .
Montgomery spent the summer awaiting trial at the Erie County Holding Center in downtown Buffalo .
The beefy 200 - plus - pound man in his mug shot had disappeared ; he wore round wire - rimmed glasses , and his orange uniform hung from his now - frail frame .
He tried to commit suicide in April , he said , after receiving a letter from his daughters stating they wanted nothing more to do with him .
His marriage to Cindy fell apart , and she stopped visiting in March .
He tried to explain what drew him to his computer .
" When I 'm talking to Cindy or you like this , face - to - face , " he said , " it 's hard for me to say what I feel . "
As Tommy , however , the words came easily .
And then there was Jessi .
He loved her , or at least believed he loved her , though he knew he was " never going to meet her . "
His plan was to " kill Tommy off " in Iraq , but Cindy intervened too soon .
He nearly committed suicide because of his guilt about having lied to Jessi .
Why , I asked , when he was suspicious of so much of what Jessi said , did he believe she was who she claimed ?
" She kept sending pictures , " he explained .
" One picture , maybe not .
But there were so many pictures over a period of time . "
Montgomery insisted he was n't the killer .
He claimed Barrett was getting calls at work from lots of people who did n't like him , an argument he said will be central to his defense .
Montgomery added that when Jessi first met Barrett he was happy for her — happy that she 'd managed to find someone her own age .

July 23 , 2007 , 6:33 pm
Today I read one of the most bizarre articles I have read in quite a long time .
Murray
Whyte of the Toronto Star ( HT : Junk Science ) seems to have developed a fantasy that climate change will drive people out of Arizona and back to Cleveland , Buffalo and Toronto .
Uh , yeah .
The article is laden with shoddy science , gross contradictions , bad economics , and a recurrent envy of wealth and success .
The article is so much of a mess that I just can't resist fisking it in detail , despite its length .
Before I begin , though , I am not necessarily a huge Arizona booster .
Phoenix works pretty well for me at this point in my life , but I have lived in many great places .
And I am the last one to criticize anyone who decides that they just can't live in a place where it is 110 F for 6 weeks straight .
That being said , lets get into it .
The article is titled :
Climate Change Herald Mass Migration : Concerns
raised as the U. S. Southwest grapples with historic drought , water
supply depletion and the creeping sense that things can only get worse .
We will get into all this later , but you gotta love the " creeping sense that things can only get worse . "
Who has this sense , other than the author ?
Phoenix is one of the most optimistic and positive places I have ever lived .
The state of Arizona has more than 300 golf courses , a booming economy ,
endless sunshine and , at last count , at least five Saks Fifth Avenue
department stores " ” in short , nearly everything the well - heeled
sybarite would need .
He sets the tone right up front .
This article is not about climate or rain or anything else .
It is about envy and a distaste for other people 's wealth and success .
There 's just one thing missing : rain .
For the past
month , not a drop has fallen in Maricopa County , home to greater
Phoenix , the state 's economic engine and fastest - growing hub .
Over that
period , temperatures have hovered five to seven degrees above the
30 - year average , at one point holding steady at over 43C for 10
straight days , while hundreds of brush fires burned statewide .
Its the freaking Sonoran desert !
We go months without rain .
We are supposed to go months without rain .
We average like 8 inches a year .
This county went months at a time without rain long before human beings burned their first molecule of fossil fuels .
If we got much more rain than this , all of our Saguaro cactuses would die .
And 43 c is 109 F .
We almost always go 4 - 6 weeks with temperatures over 109 .
And he is saying this is 6C ( 10 F ) more than normal .
Get real !
I can't remember any June or July we ever went even 5 straight days under 100 F during this part of the summer .
By the way , Arizona 's highest June temperature was recorded in 1994 , its highest July temperature in 1905 , and its highest August temperature in 1933 .
So much for record highs of late .
( Maybe one reason it seems to be getting hotter is that they are measuring the temperature of asphalt parking lots ) .
" And they 're still building billion - dollar houses , right in the
middle of the desert , " says Paul Oyashi , incredulous .
" It does n't seem
rational , does it ? "
Holy Crap !
Billion dollar houses !
Our retractable roof football stadium did n't cost a billion dollars , Canadian or US .
Oh , and you see that having gone 4 paragraphs without being snide about wealth , he needed to get back to this topic .
And who the $ %@ !! is Paul Oyashi ?
In a word , no .
Rational , some would say ,
would be a mass migration from the drought - ravaged American southwest ,
where Southern California just experienced its driest 12 - month period
in recorded history , to more verdant climes .
One such place ?
Cleveland , the battered hub of Cuyahoga County , where Oyashi sits as
director of the department of development .
" We do n't have earthquakes ,
we do n't have brush fires , we 've got all the fresh water you could ever
want , " Oyashi says .
" That 's logic .
But the problem is , it flies in the
face of reality . "
So this Oyashi guy is the development guy for Cleveland ?
Who made the Toronto Star a shill for the Cleveland chamber of commerce ?
Is it really this writer 's premise that we are on the verge of a reverse migration from Phoenix to Cleveland ?
My sense is that we are not on the verge of such a reverse migration , and this is a chance for everyone in the Rust Belt to lament that fact .
At first glance , the crises
of the rust belt and the Southwest would seem unrelated .
They are , in
fact , inexorably linked .
Each has what the other does not .
In Phoenix ,
tremendous affluence ; in Cleveland , and in Detroit , Toledo , Youngstown ,
Buffalo , Rochester , Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie , abundant ,
near - endless water " “ in the Great Lakes alone , as much as 25 per cent
of the world 's supply .
Note the writer implicitly accepts the zero- sum wealth fallacy -- in his eyes , wealth is a natural resource just like water .
Cleveland has water , Phoenix has wealth .
I wo n't get into this fallacy much here , but suffice it to say wealth is not something that springs magically from a well .
More here .
For a hundred years , Cleveland was a wealth - creation machine .
To the extent they are not today , they might check their tax and regulatory policies .
And as the Southwest and parts of the
Southeast grapple with historic drought , water supply depletion " “
earlier this year , Lake Okeechobee in Florida , a primary water source
for the Everglades , caught fire " “ and the creeping sense that , with
climate change , things can only get worse , a new reality is dawning :
that logic , finally , will have a larger role to play in human migratory
dynamics , continent - wide .
With it come not just doomsday scenarios , but
for certain urban centres left for dead in the post - industrial
quagmire , a chance at new life .
Wow , where to start ?
Anyone note the irony of Cleveland pointing fingers at someone because their lake caught on fire ?
Not that he bothers to explain why a lake catching on fire is related to climate change or even drought .
And why on an article on the Southwest is the only example of water shortage taken from Florida ?
But what you really need to note is the arrogant technocratic bent of the author .
He is saying that all you idiots in Phoenix are defying reality , and that finally maybe you will start making the right choices .
This is typical elitist crap .
In the author 's world , anyone who makes a choice the author would not is making a wrong choice .
" Sticking a straw in the Great
Lakes is not a solution to Phoenix 's water problems , " says Robert
Shibley , director of the Urban Design Project at the State University
of New York at Buffalo .
" Maybe it 's time to really think about what
constitutes need and stop spending money to build carrying capacity in
places that do n't have it by nature , and start investing in places that
do . "
Shibley has long been a champion of Buffalo 's dormant
potential " “ a potential reduced by half or more through the latter part
of the 20th century , as the population fell below 300,000 from a
historic high of more than 700,000 .
OK , now we quote a second guy about problems in the American Southwest .
This guy is from Buffalo , New York and is a promoter of the city of Buffalo .
Why is the Toronto Star giving these guys paid advertising for their causes under the guise of a news article ?
And who the hell ever suggested sending water from the Great Lakes to Phoenix ?
This is a " straw " man if I ever heard one .
Even if we started building pipelines east , there would be no reason to go past the Missouri or Mississippi .
And I love this " investing in carrying capacity " thing .
What the hell does that mean ?
Yeah , we have to build infrastructure when the city grows .
We have to look for water , you have to pay for snow plows .
To build in the desert , we have to pipe in water to survive .
So what ?
Buffalo and Toronto and Cleveland have to truck or pipe in coal and heating oil in the winter to survive .
What 's the difference ?
He suggests that in the
Great Lakes basin , where less than half a per cent of the world 's
population sits within easy reach of a quarter of the planet 's fresh
water , the opportunity for harmony exists .
In a perfect world governed
by reason , Shibley says , the only robust economic centre in the region
would serve as its heart .
And that would be Toronto .
Oh my God , what a statement .
Humanity 's last hope to live in harmony with nature is to move to the Rust Belt , home of a disproportionate number of America 's Superfund sites and the burning Coyahoga River .
These are cities that still use the Great Lakes as a toilet , dumping tons of raw sewage out in the lakes every day .
That 's an
issue for international bureaucrats to solve .
But the reality is this :
according to the U.S. government , the population of the United States
is expected to reach 450 million by 2050 " “ an increase of almost 50 per
cent .
The predicted pattern of settlement for these new citizens will
take them to the seven most built - out regions of the country " “ Arizona ,
Texas , Florida and California among them .
Have you seen Arizona ?
Is this guy really arguing that Arizona is more built - out than Michigan , New York , and Ohio ?
" You 're going to have
150 million people living in at least seven of the major regions that
do n't have water , do n't have carrying capacity , can't feed themselves , "
Shibley says .
" It 's an ecological disaster waiting to happen .
So
there 's a good reason to think that people should come back to the
Northeast , where we have the carrying capacity , and have the water . "
First , we have water .
We do n't even have rationing here in Phoenix , and have not in my memory .
What does " have no water mean ? "
The issue with Phoenix water is that we have about the cheapest water in the country .
Any overuse ( whatever that means ) of water here is because politicians pander to citizens and set the price very low .
So yes , I have a big lawn that seems nuts in the desert , but that is because my water bill here is less than half of what it was in Seattle ( ! )
Raise the price , and I would probably xerascape my lawn .
And what city in the Great Lakes area " feeds itself ? "
No one in American cities feeds themselves .
Its called division of labor .
Some have already taken notice .
Last year , The Economist
ranked Cleveland the most liveable city in America ( 26th in the world )
based on five categories : stability , health care , culture and
environment , education and infrastructure .
Among the booming cities of
the Southwest , only Los Angeles and Houston cracked the top 50 .
Phoenix
did n't make the list , falling behind Nairobi , Algiers and Phnomh Penh
among the world 's top 126 urban centres .
LOL .
I love it , we 're behind Nairobi in some survey .
Look , there is a huge disconnect in this whole argument .
If Cleveland is really more liveable , then people will move there .
But the author is saying that people are moving to Phoenix instead .
So the theme of the article is that , what ?
Phoenix has a problem with too many people moving in and has a problem with too many people moving out ?
This is back to the technocratic elitism .
The author is just upset that ordinary people do n't do what journalists tell them they should do .
Water is a factor .
It
is already a significant issue in the major regions Shibley mentions
which , not coincidentally , depend on the same diminishing source for
much of their hydration .
In 1922 , seven states " “ many of them ,
like Nevada , Arizona , Texas and California , desperately arid " “ signed
the Colorado River Compact , which divvied up the mighty waterway's
seemingly abundant flow .
But recent observation of the river is
alarming .
Only two per cent of the river 's water makes it beyond the
U.S. border , where large Mexican cities dependent on its bounty are
left with a trickle " “ much less than they need .
With climate change ,
river flow has been dwindling , due , among other things , to decreasing
snowfall and less consequent spring runoff , which forms a significant
part of the Colorado River basin 's lifeblood .
The river is the
main water source for more than 30 million people stretching from
Colorado in the north all the way down to the U.S. - Mexico border .
By
the end of the century , inflow to the river ( which includes runoff and
tributaries ) is expected to drop by as much as 40 per cent .
First , who is saying that climate change is affecting the flow of the Colorado River ?
Annual variations certainly affect it , but no one , and I mean no one , has created a climate model with the resolution to say that if there is substantial global warming in the future , the effect on the Colorado River flow will be X or Y .
Even the IPCC admits it really does n't have a clue how world temperature changes might affect river flows , or the water cycle in general .
People always want to assume that hotter means drier , but hotter also means a lot more ocean evaporation which can translate into more , not less , precipitation .
The problem with the use of the Colorado is not climate , but price .
As mentioned above , Phoenix has among the lowest water prices in the country .
In addition , farmers in Arizona and Southern California , who use most of the water despite the snide remarks about golf courses and billion dollar homes , get rates subsidized even lower .
Letting water prices rise to a real supply / demand clearing price that matches demand to river flow would solve the water " crisis " in about five minutes .
At
the same time , climate change projections show temperatures in the most
parched regions of the Southwest increasing between five and seven
degrees .
That would make Phoenix 's hottest days well over 54C .
Five to seven degrees C are at the high , worst case end of the IPCC projections , which are themselves grossly overstated for a number of reasons I wrote here and here .
Also , much of the warming would be winter nights -- you just can't add the global warming projections to the daytime maximums -- this is plain ignorant .
One thing I agree with -- if our daytime temperatures were to reach 54C , which is over 129 F , I will be moving .
In
Arizona , though , these warnings seem to fall on deaf ears .
" The Greater
Phoenix region continues to bust at the seams , " says Christopher Scott ,
a research professor of water resource policy at the University of
Arizona in Tucson .
" People look at this and think , ` This ca n't go on ,
can it ? ' "
But it does , and faster than anywhere else in America .
From 1990 to 2005 , the population of Greater Phoenix grew 47.7 per
cent .
In Scottsdale , a posh , affluent corner of Greater Phoenix that ,
despite the lack of moisture , has more golf courses per capita than
anywhere else in America , growth was 72.1 per cent over the same
period .
Altogether , Greater Phoenix will likely crest at 4
million people some time this year , making it the fourth - largest
metropolitan area in America .
By mid-century , some estimates suggest it
will reach 10 million , leaving Phoenix and Tucson fused in the desert .
" We 'll basically be one massive urban corridor , " Scott says .
Hey , he quoted a guy from west of the Mississippi !
This is the same kind of language that every anti-growth person uses in every city .
And by the way , there is that class thing again -- " posh , affluent . "
And what does " bust at the seams " mean ?
Phoenix has some of the least - bad traffic of any major city , we have sufficient water , sufficient power , lots of raw land , etc .
Phoenix
receives water from the Colorado through canals hundreds of kilometres
long , pumped through parched landscapes and small communities along the
way that take their fill .
It is , essentially , a city that should n't be
there , so distant is the water supply .
" Should n't be there , " by what definition ?
Here is what that means : " I , the author , do n't think there should be a city there . "
OK , do n't live here .
Could n't I write this sentence instead , " Cleveland receives petroleum from Texas and the Middle East in pipelines hundreds of miles long to provide needed heat in their cold winters .
Its is , essentially , a city that should n't be there , so distant is its energy supply . "
Jeez , why is it we can have a global economy and division of labor and move resources around the world , but we have to build cities right next to water sources .
What about Aluminum , oil , gold , bauxite , lead , zinc , and iron ?
Must we only build cities where all these are near by as well ?
Scott , who has studied
water supply issues from India to Mexico to West Africa , has seen no
end to water - appropriation schemes in development - crazy Arizona .
" Piping in sea water from the Sea of Cortez in Mexico , desalinating it ,
and then piping the salty brine back into the ocean " “ that 's the kind
of hare - brained notion I 've heard here , " he says .
" Do I consider these
things tenable ?
Not at all .
But these are proposals people are talking
about seriously , in public , and they 're getting a lot more play . "
Scott
worries that technology may well make such things possible , but at a
destructive energy cost that simply exacerbates the problem .
" We're
already starting to ask questions about the larger issues associated
with pumping in all that water along those canals " “ the energy costs ,
and the carbon impact associated with it , " he says .
" They may solve the
water issue short - term , but they pull the sustainability rug out from
under you in the process . "
We now see the author 's real position .
He is not really lamenting the lack of water in the Southwest - he likes it .
He wants to drive people out .
We see he and professor Scott here actually lamenting the fact that technology might solve the water problem .
As to the sustainability issue , its absurd .
I will admit I do n't know the figures , but I would be shocked if moving water around was even 0.1 % of US energy use .
And besides , we move everything else around the world , moving water is trivial .
Finally , I do n't really want to accept the author 's premise that CO2 reduction is so critical , but if I were to accept it , I might point out that most of our electricity in Phoenix is provided by America 's largest nuclear plant supplemented by natural gas , while mid-Western cities are fed mostly by big old honkin coal burning plants .
I would put our electric generation carbon footprint up against most any Rust Belt city .
The long - term solution , of course , is
to relocate people where they can comfortably exist .
( Oyashi certainly
knows a place where you can get a decent house on the cheap . )
In a free
society , of course , forced migration is n't really an option .
Do you get the sense he says the last line with a frustrated sigh , lamenting the fact that he can't force people to live where he thinks they should live ?
But
as the sustainability crisis worsens , " usually economic forces will do
it for you , " says Robert McLeman , a professor of geography at the
University of Ottawa .
" When cities have to build new infrastructure and
to jack up taxes to cope , when the cost of running a household becomes
prohibitive , people will move . "
Fine , but I will bet you a million dollars our taxes in Phoenix are a lot lower than they are in Toronto .
And I know for a fact , since I almost moved there once , that our cost of living is a lot lower .
So maybe this infrastructure and sustainability crisis in Phoenix is a chimera ?
Maybe its just wishful thinking ?
... " Once the heat becomes unbearable , they may find the
freezing cold a little more bearable " “ especially if it's not quite so
freezing cold as they remember . "
It wo n't happen without help .
In
Buffalo , Shibley speaks of a federal urban sustainabilty plan that
funnels federal money to the Great Lakes region to help draw population
back .
It 's been more than 30 years since the U.S. had a comprehensive
national urban plan .
Looming ecological crises in burgeoning urban
centers more than justify a revival .
" Cities do n't grow by topsy , it 's
not a thing of nature " “ it 's a function of public policy , " he says .
Oops , we seem to be abandoning the whole " free society " thing above .
Sure looks like they want to use federal law and tax policy to drive migration where they want it to go , against where people are moving currently of their own free will .
Oh , and city growth is NOT a function of public policy .
Cities grew up and evolved long before government ever took a heavy hand in their development .
But
a significant piece is missing , McLeman warns .
" These cities will have
milder climates , be easier to live in , and cheaper , " he says , " but
ultimately , they 'll have to have the jobs to go with them . "
Oyashi
is painfully familiar with the concept .
Cleveland may have a surfeit of
cheap , liveable housing and an abundance of fresh water , but its
problems are legion .
Abandoned industrial sites litter the area , too
big or too expensive to put to other purposes .
Small victories pale in
the face of greater challenges , like trying to convince Ford not to
close two of its three plants in the region .
" We 've got some dinosaurs
walking around here , " he says .
Speaking of public policy and taxation , you do n't think that different public policy choices in Cleveland vs.
Phoenix might have a teensy bit to do with this ?
But those problems , endemic
rust - belt - wide , are just the most visible .
High crime rates ,
languishing schools and spiralling urban poverty plague Cleveland , too .
Phoenix , for all its money , can't make it rain any more than Cleveland ,
with all its water , can print the money it needs ....
Gee , the relative growth in Phoenix vs. the lack thereof in Cleveland sure is a head scratcher .
Its incredible that people would tolerate long transportation distances for water just to escape things like high crime rates , languishing schools and spirally urban poverty .
He lays the responsibility at the federal
government 's door .
" It 's not like we have a policy that says , ` You
know , we should have a national policy that provides incentive for
people to live in ecologically sustainable areas , ' " he says .
" What we
have here is ` Go wherever you want , do whatever you want , and the
government will follow with its chequebook . '
You get this haphazard
checkerboard of winners and losers , rather than directed development in
the regions that can sustain it .
It 's crisis management . "
Yes , its just awful that the government lets people live wherever they want and then puts infrastructure in the places people choose to live .
So haphazard !
People are doing things that are not controlled or directed !
Eek !
Clearly the author thinks the government should build the infrastructure wherever it wants to , and then force people to live in those places .
We elites know better !
We will tell you where you should live !
And by the way , who in the hell anointed the Rust Belt with the title of " most sustainable area . "
And what is sustainability ?
Could n't I argue that all those midwest cities are sitting on valuable cropland or forest land , and that Phoenix is the most sustainable because we are just building on empty desert ?
And if there is such a thing as sustainability in city development , who decided that the proximity of fresh water was the # 1 be - all end - all component ?
So , I will make a counter - proposal .
Rather than focusing on cities , let 's focus on agriculture , because water IS a be - all end - all component to agriculture .
Much of the water we use in the Southwest is for agriculture , and I
do n't think that agriculture would be here without huge subsidies .
Frankly , the sustainability problem of agriculture in the desert is orders of magnitude worse than that of cities here .
So here is the plan :
1 ) Sell water in Arizona for a price that better matches supply and demand 2 ) Stop subsidizing water for agriculture 3 ) Stop sending farm subsidies , such as for cotton , to people to grow crops in the desert .
This would relieve a taxpayer burden AND it would likely shift farming out of the Southwest to places like the Midwest .
As a result , you would get a migration of farmers and agriculture back east and you would free up a lot of water in the southwest so more people can live here , where they really want to live .
But of course , this is not what the author wants .
He wants more people in the cities , paying absurdly high Detroit property and income taxes .
Well , good luck .
Update : Large follow - up post to this one , including research on Arizona water use and how the Rust Belt treats the Great Lakes like a toilet here .
Anyone who doubts that the war party is firmly focused on Iran need only take note of the Aug. 21 lead editorial in the Washington Post , which had the heading " Tougher on Iran : The Revolutionary Guard is at war with the United States .
Why not fight back ? "
The Post , which regularly features neocons like Charles Krauthammer on its editorial page , was a principal cheerleader for the Iraq war .
Its editorial accepts at face value Pentagon claims that advanced munitions provided by Iran killed one third of the U.S. troops who died in Iraq last month and that 50 members of the Guard operating south of Baghdad are " facilitating training of Shi’ite extremists . "
The Post concludes that the Revolutionary Guard is " trying to kill as many American soldiers as possible " and coyly recommends increasing military pressure while labeling the Iranian group as a terrorist organization to facilitate subjecting it to more economic pressure .
The Post ‘s assertion that Iran is already at war with the U.S. has a familiar ring to it .
It has already been used by Rep. Tom Lantos ( D - Calif . ) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and was originally coined by the Israel lobby .
The big problem with the Washington Post is that it , in knee - jerk fashion , is accepting any Pentagon attempt to implicate Iran in Iraq as fact .
It is also advancing the premise that any time an improvised explosive device is used to kill an American Iran must be behind the attempt .
The Washington Post then uses its extremely unreliable " fact " from the Pentagon to make a leap to the premise that the Iranians are " trying to kill as many Americans " as possible .
This is dangerous language and may be total fiction , as one might readily assume that if the Iranians and their allies were really in earnest about wanting to kill even larger numbers of American soldiers they most likely could do so .
What passes for thinking at the Post is ridiculous , but it serves the purposes of an administration that appears to be paving the way for a new war before President Bush leaves office .
Successful military action against an adversary who has been painted as yet another " new Hitler " could be very useful for the Republicans in 2008 in order to rally the public ’ round the flag again .
There ’s nothing like a war or a terrorist attack to revive red-state fervor .
Blaming Iran also provides a convenient explanation why the U.S. military has done so poorly in Iraq  someone else is " interfering . "
The Post editorial demonstrates that it ’s not just Fox News beating the drum for war with Iran .
The belligerent posturing by the Pentagon and its poodles in the media is all too familiar given the U.S. experience in Iraq , and it is often the " liberal media " that takes the lead in disseminating the propaganda .
One of the more astonishing claims that has surfaced from Pentagon sources in the past two weeks is that the Iraqis have apparently learned to aim their mortars better when they fire into the Green Zone , where the U.S. embassy is located .
That know - how must come from Iran , at least if one believes the logic employed by the Department of Defense , ignoring the fact that Iraq had a large army that included artillery and mortars prior to three years ago .
Where are all those mortarmen ?
They are now unemployed thanks to the U.S. occupation .
An independent source in Iraq suggests that the explanation for the more accurate shooting is twofold .
First , there are numerous informants inside the Green Zone who are collaborating with the insurgents and militias and who are helping direct the shooting using cell phones , not unlike forward artillery observers .
Second , the insurgents are increasingly embedded in formerly secure neighborhoods close to the Green Zone in spite of the " surge , " making the triangulation of the rounds a lot less complicated .
One last comment on the gullibility of Washington ’s self - styled " newspaper of record " is necessary .
If the Iranians are interfering inside Iraq , and it is perfectly possible that they are , where is the evidence ?
Does n’t the Washington Post editorial staff wonder what the Pentagonese " facilitating training " actually means before using it in a leading editorial advocating something close to war ?
If a large group of 50 Guardsmen is operating south of Baghdad and supplying Iraqis with advanced shaped - charge munitions , where is the evidence ?
Why have n’t the U.S. Army and the Iraqi security services caught one of the Iranians ?
Where are the weapons ?
The New York Times , former home of the redoubtable Judith Miller , is not much better than the Post .
Its recent coverage of Pentagon claims that Iran is targeting U.S. troops was similarly accepting of the official line .
In response to numerous complaints about the poor journalism , its public editor conceded that there should have been " more context . "
Maybe he should have said " content . "
Nearly all of the U.S. mainstream media has bought in to Sen .
John McCain ’s line that the only thing worse than going to war with Iran is a nuclear - armed Iran .
Such thinking , which results in only neither - nor scenarios , eliminates all other options for resolution of the conflict and can only lead to war .
Other evidence is also mounting that an attack on Iran is impending .
Former CIA officer Robert Baer , writing in the Aug. 18 issue of Time magazine , notes that the current neocon line of thinking is that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard constitutes the " one obstacle to a democratic and friendly Iran . "
This is reminiscent of the assertion that Saddam Hussein was the one obstacle to a friendly and democratic Iraq .
Baer regards the assertion as the latest neocon delusion , but he also notes , unfortunately , that it informs the White House thinking .
When Baer suggested to his administration source that the opposite might happen and a strike on Iran might unify the country behind the clerical regime , he was told that the Revolutionary Guard ’s improvised explosive devices are a " casus belli for this administration .
There will be an attack on Iran . "
The facts do n’t seem to matter at all to the Bush White House and the true believers still clustered around the mainmast as the ship of state goes down .
Iran is surely not a model that anyone would seek to emulate , a fact that is confirmed by opinion polls conducted worldwide .
The polls , which rank countries based on " favorable impressions , " consistently place Iran at the bottom together with the United States and Israel .
But Iran ’s evident disagreeableness does not mean that it is a threat to the United States or to anyone else that would justify war .
There is no actual hard intelligence confirming that Iran has a nuclear weapons program or that it would even use such a weapon if it acquired one .
There is no solid evidence that Iran is interfering in Iraq or Afghanistan , just essentially unsourced comments from the Pentagon and the American media .
On the contrary , one might easily argue that it is the United States that is interfering in both countries after having invaded them .
Both the Afghan and Iraqi governments claim to have good , positive relationships with Iran , contradicting many of the American claims and heightening the impression that the White House is seeking to create a pretext for a new war in the Middle East .
2週間以上前の記事「 PHPの奇妙なround関数」がすごいことになっていますね。最近書き始めたばかりの日記にこんなに人が来るなんて、有名人の集客力は流石だなあ、などと感心しています。
その集客力のおかげかもしれませんが、FreeBSDとMac OS Xだと挙動が違うよ、というコメントを頂きました。実際にFreeBSDで試してみたところ、確かにLinuxと異なる、いわばマトモな挙動です。その原因がわかりました、というのが本稿の概要です。僕がモタモタ記事を書いている間に理由がわかっちゃった人も居るかとは思いますし、より詳細なところまで把握した人も居そうですが、僕なりに現時点でわかったことを書いてみます。
前回の記事で 、PHP_ROUND_FUZZという定数が「少なくとも僕の手元の環境では」0.50000000001と定義されている、と書きました。この詳細を説明すると、configureスクリプトで下記のコードを実行して、exit codeが1なら0.50000000001に、0なら0.5に定義しています。
#include < math.h> /* keep this out - of - line to prevent use of gcc inline floor ( ) */ double somefn ( double n ) { return floor ( n * pow ( 10,2 ) + 0.5 ) ; } int main ( ) { return somefn ( 0.045 ) /10.0 !=

僕の手元では0.50000000001になっている、というだけでも面白い事実だと思ったのですが、configure次第だということを書かなかったのはフェアでは無かったかもしれません。これでミスリードされた人も居たかと思います。ごめんなさい。
一方で、僕はこのコードの実行結果は浮動小数点数の四則演算とfloor(3)の挙動にのみ依存していて、少なくともx86系のCPUであれば僕の環境と同じ挙動を示すはずだと考えていました。このコードの挙動がFreeBSDとLinuxで違うなどというのは全く想像しませんでしたが、実際のところx86なFreeBSD上でconfigureするとPHP_ROUND_FUZZは0.5になります。

A less - annoying version of Windows Vista is still several months away .
This morning , with a post to the official Windows Vista blog , Microsoft said that the first Vista Service Pack will likely arrive at the beginning of the year , after the usual far - flung beta test .
As SP1 betas continue to turn up on file - sharing sites across the web , the company will roll out an official beta " in the next few weeks , " hoping to iron out more than a few kinks in the little - used operating system .
" In addition to updates we ’ve previously released , SP1 will contain changes focused on addressing specific reliability and performance issues we ’ve identified via customer feedback , supporting new types of hardware , and adding support for several emerging standards , " wrote Vista product manager Nick White .
White also said that the update will make " additional improvements to the IT administration experience . "
But he was adamant - thank goodness - that SP1 would not introduce brand new tools :
" We did n't design SP1 as a vehicle for releasing new features ; however , some existing components do gain enhanced functionality in SP1 . "
The official SP1 ship date will depend on how well the beta test goes .
" We 're targeting releasing SP1 to manufacturing in the first quarter of 2008 , " White said , " but as always , we 're first and foremost focused on delivering a high - quality release , so we 'll determine the exact release date of SP1 after we have reached that quality bar . "
Of course , Redmond sees no reason for computer users to continue using Windows XP as the company prepares a more reliable version of Vista .
" Microsoft encourages organizations not to wait for SP1 but instead [ to ] deploy Windows Vista today in order to benefit from improved security , management , and deployment benefits , " the company told us in a canned statement , after rejecting our request for an interview .
Nonetheless , it seems well aware that most of us will continue to avoid Vista like the plague .
Today , the company also announced that a third and final XP Service Pack will arrive by the middle of next year .
" Microsoft will be releasing Windows XP SP3 to customers and partners in the next few weeks and is targeting the first half of 2008 for an RTM release , " a spokesman said .
" It is a standard practice to release a service pack as a release nears end - of - life for the convenience to our customers and partners .
Windows XP SP3 is a roll - up of previously released updates for Windows XP including security updates , out - of - band releases , and hotfixes .
It will also contain a small number of new updates . "
For more details on Vista Service Pack 1 , check out Microsoft 's beta white paper .
Interestingly enough , the beta does not appear to include an update to Vista 's desktop search interface , which Microsoft promised last month after a legal complaint from arch-rival Google .
" The service pack improves the performance of the desktop shell , but it does not provide a new search user interface or a new version of Windows Media Center , " the white paper reads .
But Shanen Boettcher , a Windows general manager , told Cnet that this would come later in the beta process .
Naturally , as Vista users wait for SP1 , Microsoft will continue to offer OS tweaks through Windows Update .
" Service packs are part of our traditional software life - cycle ; they 're something we do for most major products as a commitment to continuous improvement , " White wrote .
" But , the servicing situation has changed with the advent of Windows Vista , as we no longer rely solely on service packs as the main vehicle used to deploy system fixes and improvements . " ®
It seemed like a good idea at the time : Increase the military , diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran to get the country to bow to the international community on its nuclear enrichment program and curtail its alleged troublemaking in Iraq .
But now , with 15 British sailors and marines held captive and Tehran threatening to withhold its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency , that strategy has apparently backfired .
Months of hard - nosed U.S. political and military pressure on Iran may have further radicalized and emboldened the regime , undermining Washington ’s stated aim of neutralizing the Iranian threat without resorting to war , analysts say .
Elements of Iran ’s government , painted as a rogue state for its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , responded forcefully to the U.S. - led challenge , those analysts say .
Not only have they sparked an international crisis by capturing the 15 Britons in disputed Persian Gulf waters , and airing alleged confessions on television , they ’ve ramped up security operations in the gulf with war games and missile launches .

The regime has blamed a fear of U.S. airstrikes for its decision to stop disclosing non-required information about its nuclear program , according to a series of memos described by the Associated Press .
“ Iranians are on the offensive because they ’re in a defensive posture , ” said Patrick Cronin , a former State Department and Pentagon official who is now director of research at the London - based International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Cronin , a U.S. Navy intelligence officer in the Persian Gulf during the 1980 - 1988 Iran - Iraq war , called the capture of the Britons a “ horizontal escalation ” meant both to shift the domestic discussion and to gain leverage against the West .
“ They have to go on the offensive to change the narrative , ” he said .
“ There ’s a domestic audience and a fight over who is the rightful voice of Iran .
If they do n’t have outside threats , they ’re going to lose power .
If we slap on sanctions , they can blame the West . ”

Overstretched militarily in Iraq and Afghanistan and facing no easy options on confronting Iran ’s rising regional ambitions , the Bush administration appeared to settle months ago on a hard - line strategy , U.S. officials and analysts say .
Ranking U.S. officials for months insisted that “ no option was off the table ” as far as possible military action against Iran .
The Pentagon flooded the gulf with U.S. military hardware and leaked word of a policy to “ kill or capture ” suspected Iranian agents stirring up trouble in Iraq .
As a result , many Iranian officials are convinced that the U.S. remains committed to “ regime change ” and plans to bomb Iran .
“ You ca n’t divorce [ the detention of the Britons ] from all the saber - rattling against Iran , ” said Kaveh Afrasiabi , a former political science professor at the University of Tehran now based in Cambridge , Mass .
“ There ’s a concern of a U.S. - British concert to control the Persian Gulf waterways . ”
Advertisement
But instead of being cowed by the West ’s superior military power , Iran sought ways to step up its own pressure .
“ Because the U.S. military configurations in the Persian Gulf are very similar to those before the Iraq invasion , and because the neoconservatives in the American administration are prone to this sort of stupidity and craziness , we have been fully prepared in terms of hardware and military arsenals but also software and information for electronic warfare , ” said Hamidreza Taraghi , head of the international affairs office of the Islamic Coalition Party , a conservative parliamentary group close to the Iranian leadership .
The clang and clatter of military hardware and rhetoric from all sides has trickled into Iran ’s daily discourse .
Ordinary residents say they fear a U.S. attack is imminent and that they are powerless to prevent it .
“ Will the Americans attack ? ” is the question on the lips of every Iranian who meets a foreign reporter .

Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh ’s New Yorker articles detailing U.S. plans to attack Iran , and a Russian newspaper report specifying this Friday as the day for U.S. airstrikes have made the rounds of blogs and Persian - language satellite channels .
Ahmad Bakhshayesh , a professor of political science at Tehran ’s Allameh Tabatabai University , suggested Iranians thought the British naval personnel were assigned to test Iranian military readiness .
“ One scenario is that their intrusion was a prelude for a large - scale assault , ” he said .
This week , Maj. Gen. Hassan Firoozabadi , Iranian armed forces chief of staff , predicted that the U.S. and Israel would launch a massive attack on the region this summer .

“ International Zionism and the Palestine - usurping Israel with the support of the reactionary neoconservatives of the U.S. are preparing a new plan , ” he said , according to Iranian news agencies .
“ Americans and the West will lose with this plan , ” he said .
“ But the Islamic countries are in danger . ”
Instead of opening its nuclear technology facilities to inspectors , Taraghi said , the government is more cautious than ever about revealing details of its program to inspectors so that the information “ cannot be used against [ us ] in any likely war waged ” by the West .
“ We should not volunteer information regarding our nuclear sites , as they may be misused by Americans , ” he said .
Advertisement
Iran says its program is intended for peaceful purposes .
Western nations allege it is the prelude to a nuclear weapons program .
The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on Iran over its failure to halt uranium enrichment .
The Iranian government ’s increasingly bellicose tone and its suspicion of Western motives also may be the result of being backed into a corner and inundated daily with domestic threats and plots , said Christopher Rundle , a former British diplomat to Iran and honorary president of the Institute of Iranian Studies at Durham University in Britain .
“ Iran is full of conspiracy theories , and some of them may be right , ” he said .
“ The Americans might be supporting Baluchi and Arab separatists .
There is a concerted effort to destabilize Iran . ”
Advertisement
The attempt by Iranian hard - liners to call the U.S. - led bluff , however , may have backfired both internationally and domestically .
Western diplomats in Tehran say hard - liners grossly underestimate the effect of public opinion and mass media in Britain and the U.S .
Iran ’s strident statements and use of British prisoners as propaganda tools have shocked those who advocated cautious diplomacy for addressing the dilemmas Iran poses .
Analysts say Iran did not expect that the British would go to the U.N. Security Council and rally support from European countries such as Germany .
“ I do think they ’ve miscalculated , ” Rundle said .
“ Not many people trusted the current government internationally .
And they ’ll trust them even less now . ”

The Still - Unreported Story of “ Top Gun ” George Bush
Monday September 24 , 2007
New York -
Newly unearthed records reveal that , in 2004 , when Americans were in the midst of a brutal electoral battle over whether to reelect a president posing as a war hero , a commanding US reporter , Dan Rather , went AWOL .
Just three months before the election , Rather had a story that might have changed the outcome of that razor - close race .
We now know that Dan cut a back - room deal to shut his mouth , grab his ankles , and let his network retract a story he knew to be absolutely true .
In September 2004 when Rather cowered , Bush was riding high in the polls .
Now , with Bush 's approval ratings are below smallpox , Rather
has come out of hiding to shoot at the lame duck .
Thanks , Dan .
It began on September 8 , 2004 , when Rather , on CBS , ran a story that Daddy Bush Senior had , in 1968 , put in the fix to get his baby George out of the Vietnam War and into the Texas Air National Guard .
Little George then rode out the war defending Houston from Viet Cong attack .
The story is stone - cold solid .
I know , because we ran it on BBC Television a year before CBS ( see that broadcast here ) .
BBC has never retracted a word of it .
But CBS caved .
So did Dan .
That 's according to Rather 's written confession , his law suit , which is as much a shameful set of admissions as it is a legal complaint .
In the suit filed Thursday , Rather tells us that Sumner Redstone , CEO of Viacom , owner of CBS , was “ enraged that the [ Air Guard ] Broadcast had hurt CBS in the eyes of the Bush administration . ”
Viacom then set out to , “ divert public attention from the accurate facts reported in the Broadcast concerning President Bush 's service ( and lack thereof ) in the TexANG during the Vietnam War ; and enable CBS and Viacom to curry favor with the White House . ”
Redstone roared and Dan , hearing his Dark Lord 's voice , admits he then “ refrained from defending ” the truths in the Broadcast .
Dan shut his mouth , he confesses , in return for 30 pieces of Viacom silver : a promise that “ his contract would be extended . ”
Had Rather stood up to the Viacommunist thugs and defended his story , President Kerry and our nation could today express gratitude for his public service .
Instead , Dan traded the public interest for airtime on 60 Minutes .
Yuck .
Now Dan is shocked to find that the network snakes did n't live up to their slimey bargain with him .
Well , Dan , that 's what happens with snakes .
Get in bed with them and wake up slimed .
The Story Still Not Reported
By contrast , BBC never backed down from the story of the fix that got Little George out of ‘ Nam .
We had a smoking hot document [ view it here ] and an interview with the crucial source : the man who confessed
to making the call for Bush to the head of the Air Guard .
No , I wo n't give you his name .
I do n't expose sources – unlike Dan and CBS .
That 's another thing that makes me just FURIOUS .
Rather revealed , then blamed , a source , retired Air Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett .
Burkett , an Abilene rancher , is a courageous , stand - up guy .
[ See The Real Lt. Col. Burkett ] .
But after standing up with Dan , he was ruined , ostracized from the cattle business .
No one would sell him feed .
Dan got a multi-million dollar kiss - off from Viacom .
Burkett got dead cows and bankruptcy .
And there 's more .
More that Dan did n't report .
As I said , Dan picked up an old story , one that I reported , as did others , in 1999 .
But we added our discovery of a confidential document which had walked its way out of the files of the US Department of Justice .
It was a whistleblower statement that explained why the Lt. Governor of Texas , Ben Barnes , who arranged for George W. to get into the Air Guard , kept silent about it for 35 years .
It states that , in 1997 , Governor George W. Bush overruled his state 's Lottery director and gave a billion - dollar contract to a company tied to Barnes .
Barnes received a cool fee of $ 23 million from the contractor .
This is a devastating accusation .
And one that 's more serious than the scandal of a draft - dodging rich kid 's vile use of daddy 's connections three decades ago .
Here was evidence of gross abuse of public office by Governor Bush to pay off a crony who kept silent while Bush ran for the presidency .
US Reporting : Do n't Ask , Don't Tell
But how could I expect Rather to take on the tough story when he would n't stand by the easy one ?
In June 2002 , two years before his media lynching , Rather explained his Fear of Reporting in an interview on BBC Television ( cautiously , to a European audience only ) :
“ It ’s an obscene comparison but there was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around people ’s necks if they dissented .
In some ways , the fear is that you will be neck - laced here , you will have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck .
It ’s that fear that keeps journalists from asking the toughest of the tough questions and to continue to bore - in on the tough questions so often .
Again , I ’m humbled to say I do not except myself from this criticism . ”
This is what 's so frustrating about Dan Rather .
He 's two people : a real journalist locked inside a television news - actor begging for air - time .
Indeed , disgustingly , in his law suit , he conceals his inner reporter by claiming he only “ narrated ” the draft dodge story .
For shame .
But what about all those other preening birds on the chicken ranch known as US television news ?
Rather tells us he was n't alone in failing to ask tough questions .
Not one damn US reporter asked Bush at a press conference , “ Yes or no , Mr. President : Did your daddy call Ben Barnes to get you out of the war in Vietnam ? ”
[ For the record , BBC did ask for the President 's denial or admission .
We got none .
And when Dan's CBS boss , Leslie Moonves , said Dan 's story , “ ignored information that cast doubt ” on the revelation that Bush Sr. put in the fix to get his son into the Air Guard , I asked Moonves to provide that information .
In fact , I offered him $ 100,000 for his info which would have shown Dan 's story false .
He never produced it . ]
The same week Dan confessed that he agreed to shut up , a journalism student , Andrew Meyer of Florida , insisted on asking tough questions of the man Bush defeated , John Kerry .
For Andrew 's impertinence , he was hit with 50,000 volts from a taser .
Andrew is just a student and still needs a couple of lessons in posing questions properly .
( Lesson One : “ Wear a grounding wire . ” )
But Andrew has the next lesson down pat : ask the question they do n't want to hear when they do n't want to hear it .
Rather could use a few lessons in journalism himself – from Andrew – about taking the heat for the story .
Seeing Andrew 's arrest and Dan 's complaint , I was thinking that perhaps , instead of tase - ing those reporters who ask questions , we might tase those who do n't .

I read a survey recently that asked business people what they disliked most about work .
80 % of them cited time wasting meetings as the bane of their existence .
It seems a hatred of meetings is universal .
And at the same time most of us are stuck with them .
The thing is , if they ’re properly organised , meetings do n’t have to be so bad .
It is remotely possible that someone reading this blog could come to the conclusion that I have a negative attitude .
Particularly about work .
In fact , I enjoy my work most of the time .
People piss me off , true .
But that does n’t make me negative .
That makes me a realist .
Besides , how entertaining would it be to read about how happy I am every day ?
I ’ve been a Business Analyst for almost 12 years .
This suggests I either like the work or I ’m not very career driven .
The answer is mostly I like being a BA .
The usual career path is to move into Project Management and I ’ve made it clear before that I think Project Management sucks .
I ’d rather be a BA where I get to do things than be a PM stuck trying to manage schedules and budgets .
It also makes it a little more interesting when people ask me what I do because my usual answer is “ that depends on who ’s employing me . ”
Depending on the nature of the contract , I might be involved in some early stage requirements gathering , researching options for new software or a website , putting together a tender , writing up Business Requirements and / or Functional Specifications or maybe coming in towards the end of a project to write user documentation and / or help with implementation .
One thing I ’m frequently called upon to do is run meetings and / or workshops .
This terrifies some people but I actually enjoy getting up in front of people .
The videos I post here should give you some clue that I like to perform .
When I ’m planning sessions I usually look online for tips ( Google is my co-pilot ) .
When I was doing such a search recently , I found one guide included on a number of UK government websites .
It seems as though it was aimed more at community and political groups than corporate groups but it looked like there was some worthwhile information in there .
The full guide ran to about 10 pages .
As I worked my way through it , I started to notice a weird tone was developing .
It seemed to have been written by a passive - aggressive hippy .
The hippy side came out because there was a lot of touchy - feely , positive atmosphere , support everyone guff in there .
But I suspect the author was not aware how much of their passive - aggressive side was leaking through .
There seemed to be a paranoia about disruptive elements in the meeting along with a really punitive approach to dealing with them .
Phrases like “ watch body language ” , “ Note digressions and remind members to stay on task ” and “ Guide members who speak a great deal to be briefer , ” started to pop up .
And every time the author gave a suggestion for what to say to a troublemaker , the comment was always directed at a female .
I ’m sure the author would say they were simply being gender inclusive but I could n’t help thinking there might be some … issues behind this .
Then we come to the part that really made me think the author was a hippy : make everything FUN !
This is n’t a completely terrible idea but I do n’t think it has to be binary choice between all fun all the time and complete drudgery .
Plus , “ fun ” is a subjective concept .
One person ’s fun is another person ’s hideous torture .
And some of the suggestions provided went waaaay into trying too hard territory .
The hippy ’s central idea was that if you start each meeting with something fun , then everyone will rush to get to the meeting on time .
After all , who wants to miss out on the FUN ?
I do n’t know how I ’ve missed this in the past .
For years now , my strategy has been to make meetings relevant , concise and as brief as possible .
Clearly I ’m talking out my arse .
Here ’s where I let the expert take over .
I now present for your reading pleasure some verbatim extracts from “ Ideas for launches and fun . ”
Possibly followed by some bile filled editorialising from me .
Sing your name and have the group sing it back to you
Oh . My. Fucking .
God .
I stared at this suggestions for a full minute .
Seriously .
If I ever do this in a meeting , someone stab me in the fucking eye , please .
Because I ’ll sure as hell do it to anyone who sings their name at me .
Break into small groups and do a mime or skit about an agenda item
I cannot imagine a presenter who made this suggestion getting out of the room alive .
I know I would be leading my group in a plot to murder the idiot .
Become someone else , mime it and have people guess
I would not be able to restrain myself if a presenter did this .
I ’d be shouting guesses like “ You ’re a moron …
You ’re an escapee from a mental institution …
No , I ’ve got it , you ’re a brain - damaged weasel ! ”
Sing and dance the song , the hokey - pokey
Personally , I ’d lead a conga line straight out the door at this point .
Do a weather report on how you are feeling .
“ Sunny and warm .
Cloudy with chance of grumpiness … ”
I am Hurricane Katrina .
You are New Orleans .
Start swimming .
Dress up in a costume and make up a story about the history of an agenda item
Here ’s a tip from Mr Angry , kids .
You can take this one to the bank .
If someone sends you a meeting invitation asking you to bring along a costume , DO NOT GO !
Have everyone write their middle name on a piece of paper then try to guess what name belongs to whom .
I would conspire with the others so that everyone wrote “ dildo ” and then every time we ’d guess it was the presenter ’s middle name .
Have everyone write something about themselves nobody knows then try and guess who wrote what .
Again , I would conspire with the group .
This time we would all write “ I ’m going to kill the presenter before the end of the meeting . ”
Each time the presenter read one out , we would all act really innocent .
I ’d love to see how the presenter ’s “ fun ” mood was going after about the third one .
So much for the fun .
Another stellar piece of advice was “ Praise people twice as much as you criticise them . ”
My previous ( and obviously misguided ) strategy was to avoid criticism altogether whenever possible .
But I like this equation .
I look forward to going “ Excellent point , Bob … I ’m glad you brought that up , Bob … Bob , will you shut the fuck up already ?
We all hate you . ”
If anyone is actually looking for serious advice on running meetings , here ’s mine :
Plan it out
Know what you need to achieve
Set an agenda and stick to it
Set a time limit and stick to it – set another meeting for another time if there are still things to resolve at the end of the meeting
Make sure everybody knows ahead of time what ’s expected of them
Make sure the right people ( knowledge holders and decision makers ) are at the meeting
There are times when you need to get creative to keep people engaged , particularly with longer sessions .
Anything longer than two hours needs serious planning and some variety .
Actually , a better idea is to not run sessions longer than two hours .
Whenever possible , follow the KISS principle ( which , of course , stands for Keep It Simple , Shit - for - brains ) .
Cut the bullshit and people will thank you for it .
Klimatische Warnsignale Thorsten Stegemann
Wie extrem ist das Wetter wirklich ?
Im Zeitalter der Jahrhundertfluten , Todesstürme und Monsterwellen haben es seriöse Wissenschaftler schwer , mit Anstand über das Wetter zu reden , ohne die bedrohlichen Aspekte des Klimawandels unnötig zu dramatisieren oder fahrlässig herunterzuspielen .
Insofern tat das Max - Planck - Institut für Meteorologie gut daran , die erste Tagung , die sich umfassend mit den Witterungsturbulenzen der letzten Zeit beschäftigen sollte , ganz einfach Extremwetter - Kongress zu nennen .
Da es sich – pünktlich zum Jahrstag der großen Hamburger Sturmflut von 1962 , die jetzt auch von einem großen deutschen Privatsender gewürdigt wird – um eine Veranstaltung für rund 450 „ Laien , Hobbymeteorologen , Medien und Experten “ handelte , war nicht viel Neues zu erwarten .
Kein Wunder also , dass die Organisatoren es zunächst nicht für angezeigt hielten , auf ihrer Homepage über Zwischenergebnisse oder abschließende Resultate zu berichten .
Unter dem Menüpunkt „ Presse “ war noch am späten Abend des zweiten und letzten Kongresstages zu lesen :
Da wir noch keine Pressemitteilung über den Kongress veröffentlicht haben , finden Sie hier eine spannende Meldung des Deutschen Instituts für Wirtschaftsforschung ( DIW ) .
Die stammte allerdings vom 10 .
August 2005 , und so diente der Aufmarsch respektive die Unterstützung prominenter Warner und Mahner wie Mojib Latif , Jörg Kachelmann , der sich mit dem Deutschen Wetterdienst über ein Monopol oder Nicht - Monopol für Unwetterwarnungen streitet , oder Arved Fuchs , der eingefrorene Schiffe gern mal in größere klimatische Zusammenhänge stellt , zum nicht geringen Teil der Werbung in eigener Sache .
Für das Max - Planck - Institut stand alles Wesentliche ohnehin schon vor Beginn der Konferenz fest .
In den Klimaprojektionen für das 21 .
Jahrhundert wurden die wichtigsten Ergebnisse bereits im Januar kompakt zusammengefasst .
Die Forscher gehen davon aus , dass sich die globale Mitteltemperatur bis zum Ende des 21 .
Jahrhunderts um weitere 2,5 bis 4,1 Grad Celsius erhöhen wird .
Durch die thermische Ausdehnung der Ozeane steigt der Meeresspiegel um 20 bis 30 Zentimeter , weitere 15 Zentimeter könnten durch das Abschmelzen von grönländischem Eis hinzukommen .
Die Kontinente erwärmen sich dabei schneller als die Ozeane , die Intensität der Niederschläge steigt und mit ihr naturgemäß die Hochwassergefahr .
Gleichzeitig drohen Hitzewellen , wie sie Europa im Sommer 2003 schockierten , zur Normalität zu werden , und im Mittelmeerraum , im südlichen Afrika oder in Australien werden Trockenheit und Dürre an der Tagesordnung sein .
Wer noch knapp 100 Jahre ausharrt , muss im winterlichen Europa nur noch gut 10 % der jetzigen Schneemenge ertragen , dafür in der kalten Jahreszeit aber umso heftigere Stürme über sich ergehen lassen .
Die Voraussagen des Max - Planck - Instituts basieren auf einer Serie von hochkomplexen Modellrechnungen , die am Deutschen Klimarechenzentrum in Hamburg durchgeführt wurden .
Sie sollen in den vierten Sachstandsbericht des Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change einfließen , der 2007 erscheinen und nach Meinung der Experten alle bisherigen Prognosen an Umfang und Detailgenauigkeit in den Schatten stellen wird .
Um möglichst viele Variablen zu berücksichtigen , wurden die Berechnungen für drei Zukunftsszenarien ( A2 , A1B und B1 ) mit sehr unterschiedlichen sozioökonomischen Annahmen durchgeführt .
Daraus erklärt sich die Spannbreite der Prognosen , beispielsweise im Hinblick auf die Erderwärmung .
Die Erhöhung kann je nach Modell „ nur “ 2,5 ( B1 ) , 3,7 ( A1B ) oder sogar 4,1 Grad ( A2 ) betragen .
Grundsätzlich können bislang unbekannte Einflussfaktoren wie die Senkung oder Erhöhung der Schadstoffemissionen oder auch natürliche Klimaveränderungen , welche die durch den Menschen verursachten Trends überlagern , zu weiteren Schwankungen führen .
Zeitliche Entwicklung des globalen Meeresspiegels in den Szenarien A2 , A1B und B1 relativ zum Mittelwert der Jahre 1961 - 1990 .

Dass die Tendenz nicht gut aussieht , lässt sich freilich auch vermuten , ohne das Höchstleistungsrechnersystem in Hamburg 400.000 CPU - Stunden lang zu beanspruchen .
So geht etwa die Münchner Rück im Nordatlantik von einer „ systematischen Veränderung der Gefährdungssituation “ und deshalb auch von einer „ Verschiebung der Schadenverteilung und ihrer Parameter “ aus .
Grund für diese Annahme ist die erhöhte Hurrikan - Frequenz in den vergangenen beiden Jahren .
Nachdem 2004 der bis dahin höchste Versicherungsschaden aus tropischen Wirbelstürmen verursacht wurde , steigerten Katrina , Rita oder Wilma die Schadensbilanz 2005 noch einmal deutlich .
Selbstredend wird diese auch durch die größere Bevölkerungsdichte , die allgemeine Anfälligkeit hochzivilisierter Industriegesellschaften oder auch fehlende Frühwarnsysteme beeinflusst .
Das Max - Planck - Institut gibt überdies zu bedenken , dass realistische Voraussagen derzeit noch schwierig zu treffen sind , weil die Maschenweite der aktuell verfügbaren Klimamodelle nicht über 100 bis 200 Kilometer hinausreicht und tropische Stürme so nur bedingt simuliert werden können .

Aber es müssen schließlich auch nicht unbedingt die Überschwemmungen , Schneekatastrophen , Erdbeben , Tsunamis oder Vulkanausbrüche herbeizitiert werden , um die Folgen des Klimawandels zu erkennen .
Sie zeigen sich auch im klimatischen Mikrokosmos .
Indikatoren auf der Basis von globalen Beobachtungsdaten der letzten 50 Jahre zeigen generell eine Zunahme der Nachttemperaturen und der Dauer von Hitzewellen , eine Abnahme der Frosttage sowie eine Zunahme der nassen Tage bzw .
der maximalen 5 - Tages - Niederschlagsmengen während eines Jahres .
Die Berechnung der genannten Indikatoren mit dem IPCC - Klimamodell bestätigen diese Veränderungen für das 20 .
Jahrhundert .
Max - Planck - Institut für Meteorologie
Unter diesen Umständen darf ernsthaft daran gezweifelt werden , ob sich der Begriff „ Extremwetter “ einfach als Teil der üblichen Schwankungsbreite und subjektive Empfindungskategorie abheften lässt , wie das der Heidelberger Wetterforscher Bernold Feuerstein in einem Gespräch mit der Deutschen Presse - Agentur andeutete .
Denn die Folgen sind bereits jetzt für jeden spürbar .
Das behauptet zumindest die Umweltschutzorganisation Greenpeace .
Unter Berufung auf Zahlen des Wissenschaftlichen Beirats der Bundesregierung „ Globale Umweltveränderungen “ ( WBGU ) schätzt sie , dass ein weltweiter Temperaturanstieg um zwei Grad Celsius auch die deutsche Volkswirtschaft in Mitleidenschaft ziehen könnte .
Die Organisation geht von drei bis fünf Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts aus , was einem Jahresdurchschnitt von 870 bis 1500 Euro pro Person entsprechen würde .
Schon von 1990 bis 2000 hätten die Bürgerinnen und Bürger alljährlich sieben Euro für die Folgekosten der Wetterextreme bezahlt .
Seitdem sei dieser Betrag – innerhalb von nur fünf Jahren - auf etwa 24 Euro gestiegen .
Über die Frage , ob sich die Entwicklung noch einmal umkehren lässt , kann natürlich mit ähnlichem Einsatz gestritten werden .
Eine drastische Reduzierung der Schadstoffemissionen wird Umwelt und Klima allerdings mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit nicht zum Nachteil gereichen .
Gleiches gilt für die Maßnahmen , die jeder Einzelne in seinem privaten Umfeld ergreifen kann , also das gute alte Sprit - und Energiesparen , den Einsatz von erneuerbaren Energien oder den konsequenten Boykott von Tropenholz .
( Thorsten Stegemann )
When George Bush began trying to justify the occupation of Iraq by invoking the " lessons " of Vietnam , I had the urge to send him a copy of the new documentary " War Made Easy " featuring Norman Solomon .
That 's hardly surprising -- no doubt we 've all had the occasional desire to try to educate our president .
Then as I read and listened to the responses from mainstream pundits -- most of whom missed the real insights to be gained by analyzing the U.S. invasion of Southeast Asia and the relevance of that history to our invasion and occupation of Iraq -- I realized a whole lot of allegedly smart people need to see the film .
But the real mark of the film 's value is that everyone -- even those of us who think of ourselves as well - informed with a critical framework -- can learn much from Solomon 's analysis in the film and his book by the same name .
At a time when it 's more crucial than ever to understand the post - World War II era in which the United States became a permanent warfare state , Solomon 's film and book hone in on one of the key features of that project :
The propaganda aimed at us in the United States is as important to that military - industrial project as the guns trained on people in the Third World .
The goal of that propaganda is to get people to believe a claim that is contradicted by all of history and contemporary experience -- that the objective of the United States in its military interventions around the world has been not to expand and deepen economic domination ( which has been the goal of all other empires ) but to bring peace , freedom , and democracy to the world .
U.S. officials are not the first in world history to assert such noble motives for such inhuman policies ( just ask the Brits ) , but never has that claim been made so relentlessly , with so much help from allegedly independent journalists .
" War becomes perpetual when it 's used as a rationale for peace , " Solomon says in the film , and then goes on to provide ample evidence of how the justification for perpetual war has been manufactured , packaged , and sold .
If it were n't such serious business , the producers ' collection of sound bites from presidents -- Democrats and Republicans alike , all mouthing some version of " We seek peace " -- would be comical .
From Korea through every conflict up to Iraq , the rhetoric is remarkable similar , as are the real aims and the deadly consequences of the policy .
Solomon 's target is not just the politicians , however , but the journalists who become the vehicle for selling that story .
His work reminds us that even when journalists seem to be reporting critically about failed war policies , they almost always implicitly endorse U.S. officials ' underlying claim about the desire for peace and democracy .
While the film covers all the conflicts in the post - WWII period , it is the Vietnam / Iraq parallels that are most chilling .
One of the most crucial to remember -- in defiance of the distorted revisionist history that suggests the U.S. public lost its will to support the Vietnam War because of relentlessly critical news coverage -- is that journalists were largely supportive of the war in the early years .
Not until the failures on the battlefield were too obvious to ignore did the media coverage abandon the administrations ' propaganda line .
The producers of this film have used archival footage brilliantly , and one of the most illustrative clips is of Walter Cronkite in 1965 climbing into a B - 57 to go along on a bombing run .
In the breathless fashion typical of so much war reporting , Cronkite extols the virtue of the airplane and the thrill of the mission .
Viewers see him get off the plane and say to the officer he 's about to interview , " Well , colonel , it 's a great way to go to war . "
After the Tet Offensive in 1968 Cronkite would declare the war " mired in stalemate , " and so he 's remembered as a critic of the war .
But like most of the press corps he first was enthusiastic about U.S. power , and even in that famous 1968 broadcast he did n't challenge the basic propaganda story about the so - called Communist threat .
That segment also reminds us that journalists have long expressed a giddy , almost childlike , fascination with the increasingly high - tech weapons with which these wars have been fought .
Journalists , it seems , are always suckers for machines that go fast and blow things up .
Solomon suggests that there 's " a kind of idolatry there .
Some might see it as a worship of the gods of metal . "
This technology fetish reached unimaginably sick levels in the 2003 invasion of Iraq , when the news media flooded us with high - tech graphics and retired military officers offering commentary .
Solomon reminds us that for all the talk about precision weapons , the percentage of deaths that are civilians has climbed steadily from 10 percent in World War I to almost 90 percent in Iraq .
He describes how " an acculturated callousness " to the effects of massive bombardment has built up in our society , facilitated to a large extent by journalists who are more likely to focus on how a weapon works than what it does to victims .
One of the film 's most poignant scenes comes when images of those victims are shown over the voice of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld waxing eloquent about the unprecedented humanitarianism of this " precision " bombing .
But back to Vietnam and Bush 's bizarre analogy , in which he suggested that the United States ' mistake was not invading another country to block a popular leftist government that had been on the verge of winning a fair election .
No , it turns out that our mistake was leaving an immoral and unwinnable war too soon .
When I asked Solomon last week for his reaction to Bush 's comparison , he pointed out that Bush was invoking a familiar " stab - in - the - back theme " to assert that a lack of resolve at home undermined the military effort , to bolster the idea that with continued support , " this time the USA can , and must , see the war through to its appropriately triumphant conclusion . "
But the possibility of such a victory in Iraq is about as likely as it was in Vietnam , in large part because each war was morally bankrupt from the start .
It was the same game during the Vietnam War , Solomon said , pointing to news footage from " War Made Easy " of a network TV announcer saying , " Appealing for public support for his peace policy , Mr. Nixon said , ' The enemy cannot defeat or humiliate the United States .
Only Americans , ' he said , ' can do that . ' "
Perhaps we have not really been defeated and humiliated by either the enemy or ourselves , but by leaders who have created this warfare state and journalists who have helped sell it to the public .
" War Made Easy " is a useful tool for progressive educators and activists who want to redefine peace and end a state of perpetual war .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A plague carried around the world by travelers , pets and curious teen - agers may show that experts have not taken everything into account when planning for an outbreak of disease , researchers said on Monday .

Luckily , the world involved is an Internet game .
The outbreak of “ Corrupted Blood ” indicates that specialists trying to predict what the next pandemic will look like might make use of a real - world laboratory -- the culture of online gamers .
“ It really looked quite a bit like a real disease , ” Nina Fefferman of Princeton University , who worked on the report with her then - student Eric Lofgren , said in a telephone interview .
This includes stupid behavior , near - instant international travel and infection by pets .
The outbreak was an accidental consequence of a software challenge added to the “ World of Warcraft ” game in 2005 , Fefferman and Lofgren report in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases .
The virulent , contagious disease was introduced by maker Blizzard Entertainment Inc. of Irvine , California , as an extra challenge to high - level players .
But , just as a real virus might spread , it was accidentally carried out of its virtual containment area .
“ Soon , the disease had spread to the densely populated capital cities of the fantasy world , causing high rates of mortality and , much more importantly , the social chaos that comes from a large - scale outbreak of deadly disease , ” Fefferman and Lofgren wrote .
“ When this accidental outbreak happened , players embraced it .
Some thought it was really cool , ” Fefferman said .

The makers did not .
They reset the computer game to eliminate the disease , wiping out any data that may have been collected .
STUPID FACTOR
But Lofgren , who played the game , alerted Fefferman , and they studied what they could .
Fefferman , a medical epidemiologist , immediately recognized human behaviors she had not ever factored in when creating computer models of disease outbreaks .
For instance , what she calls the “ stupid factor ” .
“ Someone thinks , ‘ I ’ll just get close and get a quick look and it wo n’t affect me , ’ ” she said .
“ Now that it has been pointed out to us , it is clear that it is going to be happening .
There have been a lot of studies that looked at compliance with public health measures .
But they have always been along the lines of what would happen if we put people into a quarantine zone -- will they stay ? ”
Fefferman added .
“ No one have ever looked at what would happen when people who are not in a quarantine zone get in and then leave . ”
She will now incorporate such behavior into her scenarios , and Fefferman is working with Blizzard to model disease outbreaks in other popular games .
“ With very large numbers of players ( currently 6.5 million for World of Warcraft ) , these games provide a population where controlled outbreak simulations may be done seamlessly within the player experience , ” she wrote .
Fefferman noted that Ran Balicer of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel came to a similar conclusion in a paper published in the journal Epidemiology in March .
Experts agree the world is overdue for a pandemic of some sort of disease .
The current No. 1 suspect is the H5N1 avian influenza virus , which has killed 194 out of 321 people infected since 2003 .
Ways in Which iTunes ’s Just - Released Official Ringtone Support Is Weird , Rude , and / or Just Plain Buggy
Determining Which Songs Are Ringtone - Able
When I first launched iTunes today , I was prompted with this dialog box :
Which , reading between the lines , seems to translate to : Look , we know it sucks that only some of the songs in the iTunes Store are available as ringtones .
Trust us , we ’d love to sell them all to you as ringtones .
Do n’t blame us , blame the dopes at the music labels .
But , anyway , the feature did n’t work .
I clicked “ Check Songs ” and … nothing .
After turning on the new Ringtones column in iTunes ’s View Options dialog , not one of the nearly 300 songs I ’ve purchased from the iTunes Store was listed as being ringtone - able .
I tried it on my wife ’s system , and it worked just fine , displaying the ringtone icon next to many of the same tracks I have in my library .
For example , in my iTunes library , Wilco ’s Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is listed with zero ringtone icons .
In the iTunes Store , however , the album shows four ringtone - able tracks : “ Jesus , Etc. ” , “ Pot Kettle Black ” , “ Ashes of American Flags ” , and “ Radio Cure ” .
Curious , I went back to my iTunes library and control - clicked on a supposedly non-ringtone - able track from that album , “ Kamera ” .
I chose the Create Ringtone command .
The ringtone waveform selection tool appeared at the bottom of the window , I chose a 15 - second clip , clicked Buy , and just like that , created and paid for a ringtone from a song that did n’t have the “ you can turn this into a ringtone ” marker in either my library or the iTunes Store .
( After synching my iPhone , it appeared and works just fine in the phone ’s ringtone list . )
With other not - marked - as - ringtone - able tracks purchased from the iTunes Store , however , you get an error message as soon as you select them and choose Create Ringtone :
“ Can no longer be made into a ringtone ” ?
Anyway , obviously the Create Ringtone command should only be enabled when you ’ve selected ringtone - able songs ; you should n’t have to invoke the command to find out if it ’s ringtone - able , and , at least for me , you ca n’t trust the ringtone icons in the track listings .
More absurd is the error dialog iTunes displays when you invoke the Create Ringtone command on a track that was n’t purchased from iTunes , like , say , any MP3 or AAC file ripped from a CD :
Think about how weaselly this wording is .
It ’s like a politician who ’s asked a pointed question about topic A , and responds with a non sequitur talking point regarding topic B .
User : I ’d like to turn this song right here into a ringtone .
i Tunes :
You can turn some of those songs over there into ringtones .
Perhaps whoever wrote the copy for this dialog was simply too ashamed to spell it out : iTunes will not allow you to use any non-iTunes Store audio file with its built - in Create Ringtone feature .
The Ringtone Sub - Library Source List Preference
Now that ringtones are available from the iTunes Store , iTunes offers an additional top - of - the - source - list sub-library named “ Ringtones ” :
There ’s a checkbox in the iTunes preferences dialog that controls whether the Ringtones sub-library appears in the list .
What ’s interesting about this checkbox is that it appeared out of the blue today ; it was n’t visible in iTunes 7.4.1 until after the iTunes Store turned on ringtone support .
Also :
You ca n’t drag ringtones out of the Ringtones library in the main iTunes window .
( But the Show in Finder menu command works . )
Are iTunes Plus Non-DRM Songs Freely Ringtone - Able Using the Unofficial File Extension Renaming Trick ?
Yes .
Just use the trick where you make a copy of an AAC audio file and change its extension to “ .m4r ” , open it in iTunes , then change the file extension back to “ .m4a ” and sync your iPhone .
Or , far easier , just use Rogue Amoeba ’s new freeware MakeiPhoneRingtone utility , which automates the above steps .
Works equally well with AAC files ripped from CDs and “ iTunes Plus ” files purchased from iTunes .
Terms of Service Changes
The iTunes Store Terms of Service changed today to accommodate ringtones .
The pertinent sections :
9. Purchase of Apple Content ( iv )
You shall be able to store Products from up to five different Accounts on certain devices , such as an iPod or iPhone , at a time ; provided that each iPhone may sync ring tone Products with only a single Apple - authorized device at a time , and that synching an iPhone with another Apple - authorized device will cause any ring tone Products stored on such iPhone to be erased and , if you so choose , to be replaced with any ring tone Products stored on such other Apple - authorized device .
Someone needs to tell Apple Legal that it ’s ringtone , not ring tone .
( vi ) You shall not be entitled to burn Video Products or ring tone Products .
I do n’t know why you ’d want to burn one anyway , but it ’s crummy to disallow it .
And what ’s up with the crazy capitalization ?
( viii )
You may only use ring tone Products as a musical “ ringer ” in connection with phone calls .
So am I violating this term when I play a ring tone in iTunes on my Mac ?
What about as an alarm in the iPhone Clock app ?
The language here seems pretty clear : an alarm played by Clock is not “ in connection with phone calls ” , and thus not allowed .
But the ringtone I purchased shows up — alongside all my other ringtones — in the list of alarm sounds available in Clock .
So , in other words , Clock actively encourages you to break this rule from the Terms of Service .
I just do n’t get it .
You ’ve paid $ 1 for the song , you ’ve paid another $ 1 to turn the song you already paid for into a ringtone , and you ’re not allowed to use the ringtone in any other context ?
Preposterous .
[ NOTE FROM JOHN : AJ is a former Department of Defense civilian Intelligence Officer who was decorated for his recent civilian service in Iraq . ]
The Post reports that the chief spokesman for the U.S. military yesterday called al - Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) “ the principal threat ” to Iraqis .
This is , quite simply , completely and totally false .
Anyone who claims that the so - called al Qaeda in Iraq group is the “ principal threat ” to anything in that nation — whether its citizens , the government , the political process , or any specific ethnic or sectarian group — is either grossly ignorant of the realities of the Iraq war or blatantly lying .
I honestly have no idea which it is in this case , though it ’s worth noting that the chief U.S. military spokesman , Brig .
Gen. Kevin Bergner , was employed as a Special Assistant to the President prior to his current appointment .
Most reliable estimates put the fundamentalist / jihadist / al Qaeda actors in Iraq at around 3 - 5 % of the total insurgency , with virtually no approximations exceeding 10 % .
I really cannot overstate how misleading it is to focus on al Qaeda when the driving forces of the conflict are average , native , very pissed - off — but not religious fundamentalist — Iraqis .
The vast majority of the Sunni population is relatively secular ( more secular , in fact , than Iraqi Shia ) , and even tacit support of jihadists is founded in anti-American sentiment .
Even the sectarian violence is fueled more by localized conflicts between Sunni and Shia families , tribes , and militias than by al Qaeda .
It is true that AQI groups commit the most spectacular attacks , including the vast majority of suicide bombings , but if the underlying problems were solved , or even addressed ( including , but not limited to , oil revenue sharing , federalism , de- Ba’athification , provincial elections , etc. ) , AQI would lose most of its ability to operate because it would have no support on the ground .
It ’s deja vu :
To make the case for war in Iraq , the Bush administration misled the public about the relationship of Iraq to terrorism .
Now , in an effort to bolster support for continuing the war , it is trying to link staying in Iraq with our efforts against global terrorist groups ( which are , incidentally the strongest they have been since 9/11 , largely because this administration put our intelligence and military resources into Iraq ) .
The Post , to its credit , does spend considerable article space describing opposing view of “ analysts , ” and those anonymous voices are absolutely right .
Again , these latest statements are either shockingly misinformed or shockingly mendacious .
Either way , shameful .
“ I really like that term ‘ momentary autism , ’ ” a woman says softly into the mike .
She is in the back of the Times Square Studios speaking to a room of some 200 people , and more important , Malcolm Gladwell , who ’s standing solo onstage .
It ’s the second day of the fifth annual New Yorker Festival , and Gladwell has just finished a detailed reprise of the seven seconds that led to the infamous 1999 fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo .
Minutes before , every eye in the room was locked on him as he unspooled the nanodecisions that misled four New York cops into thinking the innocent Guinean immigrant was an armed criminal , resulting in 41 shots , 19 to the chest .

As the woman repeats the phrase to the crowd , you can hear her digesting it as if it has just become a part of her .
It is a term Gladwell introduced to the group only moments earlier when describing what happens when our ability to read people ’s intentions is paralyzed in high - stress situations .
Cocking his hands back in a gunlike position , he had explained in a tone that was part sociologist , part Shakespearean actor , how the cops misread a “ terrified ” black man for a “ terrifying ” black man .
“ They did n’t correctly understand his intentions in that moment , and as a result they completely misinterpreted what that social situation was all about , ” he said .
“ I call this kind of failure ‘ momentary autism . ’ ” It ’s only one of many neatly packaged catchphrases Gladwell sprinkles throughout his new book , Blink : The Power of Thinking Without Thinking ( Little , Brown , January 2005 ) .
There ’s “ rapid cognition , ” “ thin - slicing , ” and the “ Warren Harding error , ” but “ momentary autism ” is the one that you can quickly imagine this woman using , explaining to her boss why she froze during the new business pitch .
No one in recent memory has slipped into the role of business thought leader as gracefully or influentially as Gladwell .
Soon after his first book , The Tipping Point : How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference ( Little , Brown , 2000 ) , fell into America ’s palms , Gladwell made the leap from generalist staff writer at The New Yorker to marketing god .
Since then , Gladwell has oscillated between pen and mike , balancing lengthy New Yorker articles with roughly 25 speaking gigs a year , his current going rate some $ 40,000 per appearance .
Last year , he spoke at such highbrow conferences as TED and Pop !
Tech and was invited to share his wisdom at companies including Genentech , PricewaterhouseCoopers , and Hewlett - Packard .
His New Yorker articles have become required reading for B - school students .
The Tipping Point spent 28 weeks on the New York Times best - seller list and more than two years on Business Week’s , and today there are almost 800,000 copies of Gladwell ’s trend - mapping bible in print .
Mention his impact , though , and he modestly tries to brush it off — leaning , like any good journalist , on data points to support his argument .
“ Remember , ” he points out , “ even a book that ’s a best - seller still is only read by less than 1 % of the American public . ”
But as the expert in social epidemics knows better than anyone , it ’s not how many people you reach , it ’s whom you reach .
Gladwell and his ideas have reached a tipping point of their own , and evidence of his impact can now be found in all corners of our culture , from politics ( Donald Rumsfeld used “ tipping point ” to describe the war in Iraq ) to entertainment ( legendary hip - hop group The Roots used it as the title of their latest album ) .
But nowhere is Gladwell ’s influence being felt more than in business .
Starbucks ’ Howard Schultz publicly attributed his company ’s success to the tipping - point phenomenon .
The public - relations agency Ketchum created what it infelicitously named an “ Influencer Relationship Management ” database that emulates Gladwell ’s model of connectors , mavens , and salesmen .
One tech company even named itself TippingPoint Technologies Inc .
The mere mention of his name to creative directors or product developers results in nouns not typically associated with business thinkers :
He ’s a rock star , a spiritual leader , a stud .
Now Gladwell ’s back again in bound , written form , this time exploring how first impressions affect decision making .
In Blink , he argues that by distilling the first few seconds in which we interact with a person , product , or idea into what is useful information and what is misleading , we can learn to make better decisions .
“ We talk endlessly about what it means to think about a problem , deliberative thinking and rational thinking , ” he says .
“ But we spend very little time talking about this other kind of thinking , which is happening in a split second and which is having a huge impact on real - world situations . ”
The more Gladwell discusses his next big idea , the more it becomes apparent that his drive is both intellectual and practical .
He understands that in order for change to happen , he must package his ideas in a language that people can use to discuss them .
The curious journalist who sees himself as nothing more than a “ conversation starter ” has earned himself a greater responsibility than that .
To the business world , he ’s now a corporate sage , a 21st - century Peter Drucker .

A Genre of His Own
When you see Malcolm Gladwell for the first time , standing barefoot at the entrance of his breezy Tribeca apartment , you are struck by how young he looks .
He ’s 41 , but seems closer to 30 .
His slight build is that of a high - school runner , his halo of bushy brown hair evokes Lenny Kravitz .
You notice his relaxed stance , his jeans and fitted white T - shirt .
If you were going to rely on your own uncanny ability to nail first impressions , you would probably never guess that this is the guy so many people claim has changed the way they do business .
From an early age , Gladwell was drawn to the written word .
Raised in a home with no TV , the youngest son of two published authors was reading the Bible by age 6 , and by 16 won a writing competition for a story in which he interviews God .
A track star as well , “ he was very , very competitive , ” says his father , Graham , a math professor .
“ In fact , he was obnoxiously competitive . ”
While he was clearly precocious , Gladwell describes his Canadian upbringing as “ very mellow , ” attributing it to Canadians ’ general nonchalance toward the American ideal of success .
“ There is n’t this big fretting about getting into college , ” he reflects .
“ It seemed like a very easy and warm way to grow up , and by comparison , sometimes I feel like things seem to be a lot more at stake in America . ”
This combination of a laid - back demeanor with an inner ambition has turned out to be his competitive edge in journalism .
He got his inauspicious start in high school publishing a ‘ zine : Ad Hominem : A Journal of Slander and Critical Opinion .
“ The rule was , in every article you had to attack somebody , ” says Gladwell , smirking while noting that only about four issues ever made it to press .
While he dabbled in journalism , “ it never occurred to me you could actually make a career out of [ writing ] . ”
So the self - described “ slightly lost ” University of Toronto grad with a history degree tried breaking into advertising — to no avail — and on a lark landed an editorial gig at the conservative magazine The American Spectator .
He was later fired , probably , he says , for his penchant for oversleeping .
Gladwell eventually found a home at The Washington Post , where he worked for nine years , migrating from the business beat to science and medicine to New York bureau chief .
He gravitated to business writing for the same reason he gravitated to science — because they are about real things that have tangible consequences .
Since joining The New Yorker in 1996 ( “ It just kind of happened , ” he says ) , Gladwell has , as his editor Henry Finder puts it , “ essentially invented a genre of story . ”
A “ Malcolm Gladwell story ” is an idea - driven narrative , one focused on the mundane rather than the bizarre .
It takes you on a journey in and out of research through personal , social , and historical moments , transports you to a place you did n’t know you were going to end up , and changes the way you think about an idea .
The result is articles such as “ The Talent Myth : Are Smart People Overrated ? ” published in 2002 and still circulating today .
In it , Gladwell uses psychology and case studies to demolish the “ star ” talent system that McKinsey & Co. lauded — and its client ( the then - bankrupt ) Enron epitomized .
“ They were there looking for people who had the talent to think outside the box , ” he writes .
“ It never occurred to them that , if everyone had to think outside the box , maybe it was the box that needed fixing . ”
The business community ’s fervor for Gladwell and his work , particularly The Tipping Point , stems from this potent mix of the entertaining with the perspective - shaking .
In The Tipping Point , Gladwell reveals a map for how ideas , products , and behavior become contagious within a culture .
He traces the word - of - mouth life cycle through the people who start and then accelerate it , whom he dubs “ connectors , ” “ mavens , ” and “ salesmen . ”
“ I bought books for my whole team , my whole family , and all my friends .
I probably bought 30 copies , ” says Nikki Baker , a marketing analyst at Pepsi who tested the concept for the Aquafina Essentials product launch in 2002 .
A year after the beverage giant was busy pitching its bottled water to yoga instructors ( deemed “ key influencers ” ) , its more irreverent competitor , Glaceau ( maker of Vitaminwater and Smartwater ) , began seeding 500 influencers across the country .
Matt Kahn , Glaceau ’s director of corporate marketing , now makes The Tipping Point required reading for his 35 - person marketing team , starting from the point of hire .

Other companies have built entire practices around his ideas .
After Simmons Market Research ’s team read the book , it created the Tipping Point Segmentation System — syndicated research its clients can use in order to understand how to reach the 12.5 % of the U.S. population that falls within Gladwell ’s classification of tipping - point segments .
One of its clients ?
Gladwell ’s own employer , The New Yorker .
Its sales team applies the data to its 950,000 - plus subscriber list to help convince advertisers of the magazine ’s “ influencer ” following .
Gary Warech , a vice president at Simmons , puts it plainly : “ It was a great book .
It became the bible , the must - read in business circles .
Our guys read it and said , ‘ This is great .
We can operationalize this and help our clients . ’ “ In the Blink of an Eye “ The first thing that started happening was I started getting speeding tickets .
. . .
I was n’t driving any faster than I was before , I was just getting pulled over way more . ”
The impetus for Blink started with Gladwell ’s hair ( as did his brief splash in the gossip pages when he got “ a little too close to some candles ” and it ignited during a recent literary event , according to the New York Post ’s Page Six ) .
For most of his adult life , he had worn it closely cropped , but several years ago decided to let it grow out into a woolly Afro .
“ The first thing that started happening was I started getting speeding tickets .
. . .
I was n’t driving any faster than I was before , I was just getting pulled over way more . ”
Then there was the day Gladwell was walking around New York and cops surrounded him , mistaking him for a rape suspect .
“ I ’m exactly the same person I was before , ” recalls Gladwell , who ’s half black ( his mother , a therapist , is Jamaican ) .
“ But I just altered the way someone makes up very superficial , rapid judgments about me . ”
Rather than merely grouse — legitimately enough — about prejudice , Gladwell , who has the tendency to look in on his own life as a case study , was inspired to try to understand what happens beneath the surface of rapidly made decisions .
“ The idea that something that is extraordinarily harmful in society could be exactly the same in its form as something that ’s incredibly useful is really interesting to me . ”
The “ useful ” that Gladwell advocates in Blink is the idea that we can teach ourselves to sort through first impressions to “ figure out which ones are important and which ones are screwing us up . ”
While most of us would like to think our decision making is the result of rational deliberation , he argues that most of it happens subconsciously in a split second .
This process — which Gladwell dubs “ rapid cognition ” — is where room for both error and insight appears .
Many of the snap judgments we make are based on previously formed impressions and are competing with subconscious biases such as emotions and projections .
Once we become aware of this , Gladwell argues , we can learn to control rapid cognition by extracting meaning from a “ thin slice ” of information .
Hiring is one area where we tend to fall into the “ dark side ” of rapid cognition , says Gladwell .
He conducted a study to showcase how we often succumb to what he calls the “ Warren Harding error ” ( Harding being , he says , “ one of the worst presidents in American history , ” who nevertheless radiated “ all that was presidential ” ) .
Polling about half of the Fortune 500 companies , Gladwell discovered that the vast majority of their CEOs were at least 6 feet tall ( only about 14.5 % of all American men are 6 feet or taller ) .
What does this say about the way we hire ?
“ We have a sense of what a leader is supposed to look like , ” he writes .
“ And that stereotype is so powerful that when someone fits it , we simply become blind to other considerations . ”
Similarly dangerous is how first impressions cripple breakthrough ideas and innovation .
Gladwell tells the story of furniture maker Herman Miller Inc. in the early 1990s , when it created a new office chair .
It was made of plastic and mesh , and while it was created as the “ most ergonomically correct chair imaginable , ” he says , it was just plain ugly .
Focus groups , facility managers , and ergonomics experts all despised it .
Why ?
“ They said they hated it , ” writes Gladwell .
“ But what they really meant was that the chair was so new and unusual that they were n’t used to it . ”
Gladwell argues that it ’s a mistake to rely on the first impressions of customers who are inherently biased against the unfamiliar .
Herman Miller execs went against the market research , stuck with their instincts , and created the Aeron , which eventually became the company ’s best - selling chair ever .
“ What once was ugly has become beautiful , ” he writes .
Unless you ’re willing to take that kind of leap , he says , you ’re condemned to doing knockoff , me - too chairs .
advertisement
For every Herman Miller “ going with your gut ” success story , though , there are 100 flops by companies that did n’t listen to customers .
Gladwell acknowledges this , but notes , “ only by accepting the risk of failure will [ a company ] ever hit a home run . ”
Relying on the good judgment of your staff , he believes , is the key ingredient for a new kind of decision - making environment , and judgment is what companies should be screening for when hiring .
With the right people in place , companies can liberate themselves from their obsession with data - driven decisions .
While the notion is provocative , the road map Blink offers corporate America gets fuzzy from there .
( For example , Gladwell never explains how Herman Miller ’s execs overcame their concerns about the Aeron ’s ugliness . )
Gladwell offers much more insight into how those in rapid - decision - making professions ( such as firefighters or ER doctors ) can slow down a moment or create an environment where spontaneous decision making can take place .
That ’s less applicable in the white - collar workplace .
You can learn how to untrain yourself from making the Warren Harding error , but you ’re more or less on your own in rewiring your thinking .
This raises the primary criticism of Gladwell ’s work — that he sometimes stretches his colorful stories to make them apply to business issues .
And he admits it .
“ I ’m just trying to get people to start a conversation , even if the conversation is , ‘ Well , that ’s interesting , and that ’s not , and that ’s sort of bulls — t’ . . .
I ’m much happier getting criticized for overreaching than I would for being too timid . ”
In effect , that ’s exactly the leap he wants companies like Hewlett - Packard to make .
For a company of numbers - driven engineers , steering away from data is downright frightening .
“ We want to innovate and break out , but we do n’t have the instinct for it , really .
It scares us a little , ” says Shirley Bunger , HP ’s director of brand innovation .
So as part of her mandate to help HP ’s 145,000 employees think differently , she brought Gladwell in last June to share the Aeron story .
Bunger recalls watching reactions around the room as Gladwell ’s presentation erupted into a vibrant discussion .
“ There were some people who just had this sense of relief and connection and then other people with this sense of ‘ Oh my God , this man is completely challenging everything I believe in , ’ ” she says .
At one point , someone asked Gladwell if he believed in focus groups , and he replied , “ I think we would all be better off if focus groups ceased to exist . ”
While this idea and others in Blink are n’t revolutionary , they ’re exactly the kind of thing that can spark change .
And who better to hear them from , argues Bunger , than Gladwell ?
Guru or Scribe ?
Companies like HP are still vying to “ bring in Gladwell in a way that he could really shape some of our work , ” says Bunger .
Add it all up : a passionate following , companies eager to sign him on as a consultant , some accessibly packaged books , and a knack for addressing a room full of businesspeople with the intimacy of a dinner - party chat .
It sounds like the beginning of Malcolm Inc .
advertisement
“ Oh God , no , ” Gladwell laughs , shielding his hazel eyes with his hands .
“ I ca n’t imagine anything more horrible . ”
While he is flattered by how many diverse groups have been drawn to his work and he enjoys speaking to companies , formal consulting would be a breach of his first commitment — journalism — and he claims he ’ll never do it .
Yet when you ask Bunger , she says Gladwell was very receptive to the idea of a formalized working relationship .
And he ’s already well entrenched in the pantheon of business prophets : Gladwell is number 27 in Accenture ’s ranking of “ The Top 50 Business Gurus , ” above the likes of Jack Welch ( 34 ) and Richard Branson ( 45 ) .
Gladwell ’s reluctance to accept the trappings of gurudom reflects his professional DNA : He ’s more Peter Drucker than Tom Peters .
Like Drucker , he does n’t come from the usual feeder pools of consulting or academia , and his MO is n’t prescribing the solution but sparking more questions .
“ I was definitely surprised that he did n’t have all the answers and he did n’t care about it , ” says Nikki Baker , the marketer at Pepsi who saw Gladwell speak at The New Yorker Festival last October .
“ He was just a thinker . ”
She does n’t mean that as faint praise , of course .
But not everyone holds Gladwell ’s thinker credentials in such high regard .
“ When [ Gladwell ] talks about mavens or connectors , in my neighborhood we call them ‘ gossips , ’ ” says Mario Almonte , who heads the PR practice for Herman Associates , a marketing communications agency .
John McGrath , a psychiatrist who ’s also the vice chairman of a public - affairs firm , believes marketers became starry - eyed over Gladwell ’s first book because he props up the elusive with the quantifiable .
“ You tend to think , ‘ Oh wow , this is really science - based stuff . ’
Well , it ’s new language , but it ’s not science . ”
In fact , the tipping - point concept has been around for decades .
The idea was first deeply explored by the economist Thomas Schelling ( as Gladwell acknowledges in his original tipping - point article ) , and marketers have been practicing these ideas without Gladwell ’s vocabulary for years .
“ It ’s one of these things that ’s kind of obvious but nobody said it , ” says Henry Mintzberg , the management guru and a Gladwell admirer .
“ You know , thousands of psychologists spend lifetimes studying these things , and here , one guy kind of waltzes along with a really interesting idea . ”
“ When I was writing The Tipping Point , I realized that in order for people to talk about something . . . they need some way to describe and name things . ”
Gladwell ’s real gift is packaging these ideas in a way that makes them palatable .
“ [ He ] acts almost like a translator between the scholarly world and the practical world , ” says Frank Flynn , an associate professor of organizational behavior at Columbia Business School , who uses many of Gladwell ’s articles in his MBA classes .
Gladwell deflects the charge that he ’s just a savvy marketer of ideas , standing by his earnest intentions to help frame people ’s thinking .
“ When I was writing The Tipping Point , I realized that in order for people to talk about something . . . they need some way to describe and name things , ” he says .
“ So I always like to try to come up with simple , sort of catchy ways of capturing complex ideas . ”
While Gladwell ’s newfound role in the business spotlight might be entirely accidental , he sees himself as part of a greater movement .
“ I feel like there ’s been a kind of intellectual awakening in the business world in the past 20 years or so , where people began to realize that there was an enormous amount to be learned from the world outside of business , ” he says .
“ I think of myself as one of the many people who are trying to feed that curiosity . ”
As CEOs and marketers and R&D teams immerse themselves in Gladwell ’s new notions of decision making , and as he gears up for a new flurry of speaking gigs , Gladwell admits he has n’t given much thought to what ’s next .
“ I do n’t think that far ahead , ” he says , his eyebrows perking up like bookends .
“ Yeah , I do n’t really have high expectations about much .
It ’s a good psychological position to be in , because that means I ’m usually delighted by what happens in my life . ”
Whether that means dreaming up more best - sellers or seeing the impact of his ideas playing out in the real world , we can be sure of one thing .
He ’ll soon be in his favorite un - gurulike pose , lying on his couch with his laptop on his belly , typing away .

AFP
IN PITTSBURGH , a Turkish group , pious but peaceful , decides to rethink its plans for an Islamic centre after an angry public hearing .
In Clitheroe , a town in northern England , a plan to turn an ex-church into a mosque wins planning approval after seven failed bids .
In Austria a far - rightist , Jörg Haider , grabs headlines by proposing that no mosques or minarets should be built in the province of Carinthia , where he is governor .
In Memphis , Tennessee , Muslims manage to build a large cemetery despite local objections to their burial customs .
On the face of it , there is something similar about all these vignettes of inter - faith politics in the Western world .
They all illustrate the strong emotions , and opportunistic electoral games , that are surfacing in many countries as Muslim minorities , increasingly prosperous and confident , aspire to build more mosques and other communal buildings .
All these stories show the way in which whipped - up fears of a “ clash of civilisations ” can inflame the humdrum politics of a locality .
But there is a big transatlantic difference in the way such disputes are handled ( see article ) .
Although America has plenty of Islam - bashers ready to play on people 's fears , it offers better protection to the mosque builders .
In particular , its constitution , legal system and political culture all generally take the side of religious liberty .
America 's tradition of freedom is rooted in the First Amendment , and its stipulation that “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ... ”
Another recourse for embattled minorities of any kind is “ Section 1983 ” of America 's civil - rights legislation , which allows an individual who is deprived of a legal or constitutional right to sue the official responsible .
More important than the letter of the law is an ethos that leans in favour of religious communities which are “ new ” ( to their neighbours ) and simply want to practise their faith in a way that harms nobody .
In America the tone of disputes over religious buildings ( or cultural centres or cemeteries ) is affected by everyone 's presumption that if the issue went to the highest level , the cause of liberty would probably prevail .
The European Convention on Human Rights , and the court that enforces it , also protect religious freedom .
But the convention is not central to European politics in the way the Supreme Court and constitution are in America .
The European court disappointed advocates of religious liberty when it upheld Turkey 's ban on the headscarf in universities .
The risk in the garages
Legal principles aside , there are pragmatic reasons for favouring the American way .
Most mosques in the Western world pose no threat to non-Muslim citizens ; but a few do pose such a danger , because of the hatred that is preached in them .
In such cases police forces generally have the legal armoury they need to step in and make arrests if necessary .
Quashing extremism will surely be easier in an atmosphere where the founding and running of mosques is an open , transparent business .
As Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , once said : “ It is not minarets which are dangerous ; it is basements and garages which hide secret places of worship . ”
Will someone please tell the Swiss ?
Politicians from two of the biggest political parties are seeking to insert a sentence into the country 's constitution forbidding the building of minarets .
Measures of this sort exemplify the bigotry that lies behind much of the opposition to mosque building in Europe .
Christians in the West have long complained about how hard it is for their brethren in Muslim lands to build churches .
Fair enough .
But they should practise what they preach .
As the longest day of the year is just past , we begin the inexorable annual trajectory towards winter .
A short fifty years ago , people heated their homes in winter with coal .
A hundred years ago and before , people living in cold climates largely stayed warm in winter with firewood .
Today , in a country ( and planet ) with vastly more people , we heat homes in northern climates largely with high quality fossil fuels , specifically natural gas , heating oil , and propane .
Trees , a less energy - dense form of stored sunlight than oil and gas , have recovered a good part of their former % of landcover in the US , despite being still used for paper , wood , furniture , pulp and some heat .
Below is an analysis of how the US residential sector heats its homes , how large are our forests and how much they grow and how much wood we could use for heat , after fossil fuels decline .
INTRODUCTION
Peak oil and Peak Natural Gas have so many implications that I could think of a new one ( and write about it ) pretty much daily .
In a recent discussion of the depletion of high quality fossil fuels with a neighbor - she quipped " Well - I guess its time to buy a woodstove then " .
It was the same day that the EIA heating oil inventories had dropped sharply .
This got me to thinking , which resulted in the below analysis of how much heat from fossil sources we currently use and how much could be generated from our forests .
At some point in the next decade , perhaps later , probably sooner , we will likely be faced with liquid fuels shortages .
Coincident with the decline in high quality oil production , a portfolio of alternative energy sources will be sought out to fill the gaps , both on the macro scale and by individuals .
Already given increases in heating oil and natural gas prices , there is renewed interest in using alternatives to fossil fuels .
Consumer switching ability for home heating exists , as it did in the 1970 ’s , but in today ’s world we have little choice but to go southwards on the energy pyramid ( oil / NG to wood or coal ) as opposed to the lateral movement 25 years ago ( oil to NG and propane ) ( Natural gas has more hydrogen atoms than does oil , and both have more than wood ) .
What if some of the TOD and private forecasts for dramatically higher oil and gas prices occur in the coming years ?
People quickly respond to these price signals , and may increasingly look to heat their homes using more traditional means that they can individually control .
Trees are ubiquitous , and it takes but some money or effort to create a nice neat stack of warmth producing wood next to ones home , especially for the more rural dwellings in our nation .
Living in Vermont and buying firewood for my woodstove has made me ponder the following questions :
What if everyone wanted / needed to heat with trees at the same time ?
Would there be enough trees to go around ?
What is the annual biomass ‘ interest ’ vs. existing forest ‘ capital ’ ?
Could any states replace their winter heating requirements sustainably from forests ?
( note : the Drupal spell check is telling me ' sustainably ' is not a word ... ;)
What would be the environmental impact of over - harvesting for heat ?
Would home heating demand for wood then displace other wood uses , ( electricity , lumber , paper , etc . )

CURRENT HOME HEATING MIX
The US uses over 7 quadrillion BTUs ( quads - written 7,000,000,000,000,000 ) for heating our homes each winter ( out of 100 quads total energy use ) .
Heating needs are a function of a ) cold temperatures , b ) population and c ) efficiency of heating method ( I suppose I could add d)tolerance / preference ) .
As seen in the below graphic , natural gas is by far and away our largest source of residential home heat , followed by heating oil and propane , which is a product of both natural gas and crude oil refining .

HOME HEATING DATA
Some notes on the data .
Heating oil is the combined total of distillate # 1 , distillate # 2 and kerosene , though the vast majority is distillate # 2 .
Home heating use of distillate fuel ( essentially diesel ) is about 10 % of total distillate use .
( highway trucking is over 50 % ) ( Source ) .
I used 2004 - 2005 heating data partially because it was easier to find but also because the last 2 winters were among the lowest in the last 30 years as far as fuel usage .
2001 and 2003 were considerably higher ( 11 % and 13 % ) .
2004 -2005 was close to the average of the last 7 years .
There are a small number of homes that still heat directly with coal but good data does n't exist so coal was excluded from the analysis .
I do n't particularly trust the EIA data on wood either as it appears they use the amount of firewood purchased and reported so those numbers may be light because of do - it - yourselfers are not good at reporting - it - to - authorities .
Also excluded were heat generating sources / devices like the sun , better insulation , extra blankets or dogs , cats and spouses .
In the broadest sense , these are very real heat sources , but they should still be there after fossil fuels decline .
Electricity makes up a minor part of home heating use - of course , there is also natural gas and coal used as a precursors to electricity but I did n't extend this analysis that far .
( About half of all energy used by a household goes to heat and cool the home .
( 116 billion kWh ( 2001 ) = 116 billion * 3,413 Btu = 396 trillion BTUs ( .396 quads ) )
US residential heating is dominated by natural gas - more than 2/3 of our home heating is derived from piped natural gas .
Below is a historical graph of demand for this largest component of heat in the United States .

In 2005 , 18.895 billion gallons of propane were sold in the U.S. 7.942 billion gallons were sold to residential users .
At 92000 BTU per gallon this equated to about 6 % of our residential heat needs .
The above graphic illustrates that propane ( LPG ) is primarily used out West , and in the more rural areas that may not have natural gas pipelines or consistent oil access .
United States natural gas and heating oil use in millions of BTUs per person .
Heating demand is essentially a function of population and cold ( temperatures ) .
The above graphic shows the intensity of fossil BTU use for home heat per person .
The northeast and midwest have the coldest temperatures ( and or the wimpiest people ) .
Maine uses the most heat per person in the United States , but their low population makes the state itself not one of the higher ranked users .
Adding the population factor produces the below graphic :

WOOD AND FORESTS
Humans have used wood since the dawn of civilization and historical scarcities of wood have triggered major technological changes .
Wood shortages in Greece taught architects how to exploit solar energy .
Thousands of years later , shortages of wood forced England into the fossil fuel era , and it began a widespread use of coal .
Englands attraction to America was in no small part due to the scarcity of timber resources in the British empire and the awareness of huge wood resources in the New World .
In the United States , the market for coal expanded slowly and it was not until 1885 that a low population density , heavily forested nation burned more coal than wood .
Even in the world today over 2 billion people use firewood as their primary fuel source . ( 1 )
United States forest statistics compared to the World - Source National Forest Service ( 2 ) .
United States land and forest statistics - Source National Forest Service ( 2 ) .
The US was heavily forested when it was discovered / populated in the 1600s .
( note that the 30 % decline in last 375 years is by land area not by volume of wood ) .
Though the statistics above mask it , in the 1800s so much wood was used for construction , export and heat that the eastern forests were largely clearcut .
Vermont went from 100 % down to 40 % forest cover and has since rebounded dramatically .
According to biologist Stuart L. Pimm the extent of forest cover in the Eastern United States reached its lowest point in 1872 with about 48 per cent compared to the amount of forest cover in 1620 .
In the last 100 years , the amount of forest , due largely to presidential decree of increasing reserve land and intensive tree planting has generally held steady or increased .
Rates of growing stock growth , removals , and mortality on productive unreserved forest , 1953 - 2002 .
Source : USDA Forest Service ( Graphic first posted on TOD by Stuart Staniford here ) .
The US standing forest as of 2002 was 856,000 million cubic feet .
The annual growth of this forest is 23,689 million cubic feet , or around 2.5 % of the volume .
The above graph shows historical trends of growth , removals and mortality on non-reserved forest - the growth on this type of timber is closer to 3 % annually .
As can be seen , the forest size was gradually growing as annual growth outpaced removals and mortality until recent years .
Now the annual growth net of mortality is just about used .
There is no rule saying removals cant be above growth - that just portends a smaller forest the following year .
( It is unclear how much of the dead wood can or could be used , and decaying woods impact on soil nutrients and ecosystems is beyond the scope of this post . )

Less than 10 % of our wood use currently goes towards fuel use , and even less of this towards heating .
The forest service did not break down this category into fuelwood for home heating and other fuel sources , though one can assume the majority is for residential use ( though I know my schools city , Burlington , VT uses wood to generate heat and electricity for the public utility ) .
The total use of 15.7 billion cubic feet is less than the annual total growth of 23.69 billion cf , but there is mortality of 6.3 billion cf which needs to be subtracted ( though in theory this would have some heat value ) .
Essentially , we are using all of our forests growth right now , even at the same time we are using all time record amounts of coal , oil and near record amounts of natural gas .

THE ANALYSIS
HOW MANY CORDS OF FIREWOOD GROW IN ONE YEAR ?
In 2002 , the forested area of the United States contained 856,000,000,000 cubic feet of tree volume , of which 364,000,000,000 cf were hardwoods .
( This is the forest capital ) .
( Due to larger amounts of creosote and much lower wood fiber density in softwoods , they are not suitable for conventional firewood and I assumed are not used for heating –in a more advanced analysis this assumption could be relaxed as people could harvest softwoods and replant with hardwoods at least to some extent and / or install external wood burners ) .
The current annual volume growth is 10.1 billion cubic feet annually ( or about 2.5 % ) .
Existing usage rate is 5.7 billion cubic feet with an annual mortality rate of 2.7 billion cubic feet .
( Interestingly , the mortality rate was at a 50 year high and the USFS admit they do not know the reason for it ) .
For ease of calculation let ’s be aggressive and assume that humans can access all of the dead wood for burning .
We then have 4.4 bcf of annual growth of potential firewood that is not otherwise being utilized for lumber , electricity or current home heating .
At 128 cubic feet per cord , this equates to approximately 34.7 million ( more ) cords of wood that can be accessed sustainably , without dipping into the forest ‘ capital ’ .
If we discontinue other current market uses for the wood we would have 10.1 billion cf or 78.9 million cords of potential firewood per year .
THE ENERGY CONTENT OF FOSSIL FUELS
Each cubic foot of natural gas , depending on its origin , has about 1,027 BTU’s .
# 2 Heating oil has 149,793 BTU ’s per gallon .
Kerosene , used in some places for winter heating , produces 134,779 BTUs per gallon .
In total , the amount of fossil fuels used for winter heat in the United States equates to over 7,000 Trillion BTU ’s. ( 2001 / 2 , a much colder winter , was 13 % higher ) .
THE ENERGY IN WOOD
Freshly cut wood has over 60 % moisture and therefore takes much more effort to release the energy in the wood fibers .
Seasoned wood approaches 20 % moisture content and releases about 6,400 BTUs per pound of wood .
( Pure bone - dry wood tops 8,000 BTUs per pound but is not practical for home use ) .
Almost all wood types create the same amount of BTUs per pound ( 6,400 ) , but depending on their individual densities and other properties , differ in how many pounds make up 1 cord .
Some examples are :
Hickory => 4,327 lbs per cord => 27.7 million BTUs per cord
Red Maple => 2,924 lbs per cord => 18.7 million BTUs per cord
Cottonwood => 2,108 lbs per cord => 13.5 million BTUs per cord
Cedar => 1,913 lbs per cord => 12.2 million BTUs per cord
A complete list of wood types and BTU content per cord can be found here
This analysis assumes one cord of wood typically is about 2400 pounds .
We then arrive at 2,400 X 6,400 BTUs =15,360,000 BTUs per cord .
Therefore , in the 52 US states , we have 34.7 million cords of annual volume growth of wood available times 15.36 million BTUs per cord => 533 Trillion BTUs that can be presently be accessed sustainably from hardwoods .
( If we eschew all other forest products , this number roughly doubles , and if we include softwoods , it roughly doubles again )
PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER
Heating with wood is not as efficient as heating with natural gas or # 2 heating oil .
A significant portion of the heat generated from burning escapes up the flue to dissipate as heat in the atmosphere .
Wood stoves and furnaces average about 55 % efficiency .
This compares to 85 % efficiency for natural gas furnaces and 80 % for furnaces using # 2 heating oil or kerosene .
( the lower the efficiency rating the more BTUs of heat is ‘ lost ’ and unable to provide heat to targeted areas ) .
So , of the 5,030 trillion BTUs generated by natural gas furnaces in 2004 , 85 % or 4,275 trillion BTUs went directly to heating , and 15 % , or 755 trillion BTUs was dissipated as waste heat .
Similarly , of the 998 trillion BTUs generated by heating oil , roughly 80 % , or 799 trillion BTUs went directly to heating .
Of the 532 Trillion BTUs that could be generated annually from forest growth , approximately 55 % or 297 Trillion BTUs would end up as ‘ actual heat ’ .
Natural Gas and Heating Oils collectively generated 5,074 Trillion BTUs of ‘ actual heat ’ .
Thus , this analysis indicates that we could sustainably replace 297 / 5,074 Trillion BTUs or 5.8 % of fossil fuel home heating use with home heating from wood .
Alternatively , the entire United States forest stock of hardwoods contains 364 billion cubic feet of wood , or 2.84 billion cords which would throw off 24,024 Trillion BTUs ( note , this is only 24 % of the total annual energy usage of the country ) .
So the good news is if we were really cold and sans fossil fuels , we could chop down trees for at least 4 years before the US would resemble Easter Island ( 24,024/5,074= 4.74 years ) .
On a state by state basis , the distribution would look like the following :

THE ECOLOGY
If there is wide scale deforestation , for heating , ethanol or other uses , we will increase the CO2 in the atmosphere directly through wood burning , and indirectly through loss of soil biomass , not to mention changing the water / irrigation patterns due to increased erosion , etc .
An in - depth environmental assessment of over - harvesting the annual growth in wood biomass is beyond the scale of this preliminary analysis , but of course is both relevant and important .
THE ECONOMICS
This last statement suggests that only a moderate amount of switching can occur given macro constraints .
Consumers however , do not look at the macro picture of sustainability , but at their own microeconomics .
Let ’s see how the current rates of $ 2.70 heating oil and $ 14 natural gas ( retail ) stack up to $ 260 / cord .
Cost per Million Btu's ( MBtu ) Useful Heat Into the Room :
1 ) Fuel oil at $ 2.70 per gallon :
There are 149,793 Btus per gallon of fuel oil and oil furnace efficiency equals 0.80 :
1,000,000 Btu x $ 2.70 / gal
-------------------------------------
149,793 Btu/gal x .80 = $ 22.84/MBtu
2 ) Natural gas retail at $ 14.00 /1000 cu ft , 1007 Btu / cu ft , and efficiency equals 0.85 :
1,000,000 Btu x $ 14.00 /1000 cu ft
--------------------------------------
1,007 Btu /cu ft x .85 = $ 16.36 / MBtu
3 ) Wood ( red oak ) at $ 180 / cord , 19.6 MBtu/ cord , and efficiency of airtight stove equals 0.55 :
1,000,000 Btu x $ 260 / cord
-------------------------------------------
19,600,000 Btu/ cord x .55 = $ 16.70 / MBtu
At today ’s approximate prices , the per BTU cost is about equal natural gas and wood but a good deal less than heating oil .
For those that own their own trees however , cutting them may prove a substantial savings .
Economic theory would suggest that as fossil fuel prices increase , wood prices , as a substitute , will also increase – the large private landholders then may hold the key to whether we dip into the forest bank account when a fuel shortage presents itself .
ADDITIONAL ISSUES TO CONSIDER
1 ) Technically , since forests and people are not uniformly distributed , and a tree is too large to fit into a woodstove , energy must be used to reduce forests to manageable human chunks ( by chainsaws or axes ) and then transported to individual houses ( by trucks or horses ) .
These tasks mostly require oil .
To an individual , the added costs will show up as higher price for cords of wood .
To a society , they result in less BTUs available to heat what is needed from the new source .
Clearly with NO fossil fuels , to obtain these amounts of BTUs from wood would be unattainable , as one would need chainsaw and transportation ability to cut all but the low hanging fruit in ones yard .
So the net BTUS to the system , as opposed to each individual should be considered ( in an Energy Returned / Energy Invested sense ) .
Obviously , as with oil , there is a gross resource ( which Ive presented here ) and a net resource - I expect people in Colorado wo n't be heating their homes with the trees on Pikes Peak as they would likely be procured only at an energy loss .
1a ) ( deleted )
I decided to make the discussion about wood harvesting , time and net energy a separate post next week as it got long ( and interesting ... ;)
2 ) Using softwoods , while creating some problems , would increase the available BTUs available annually by 45 % or so .
3 ) Very little of the Southern forests are used for winter heating .
In this way , wood could be ‘ imported ’ if it were necessary .
Again – how much would it cost to do this ( in $ and energy ? )
4 ) At some harvest point greater than the sustainable harvest of 5.8 % of our heating requirements , there would arise externalities from loss of ecosystem services .
Clearly the scale does not exist for large increases in the amount of firewood consumed annually without environmental consequences .
5 ) Walmart , Home Depot and others have recently been selling large quantities of electric heaters .
If people are switching to electrical heat due to high fossil fuel prices , this will in turn increase the price of electricity and increase the amount of biomass currently used for electricity production ( thereby reducing the amount of wood available for home heat )
6 ) Most population dense areas , and most new houses , do n't easily have the ability to heat with wood .
But external burners might be come popular in a hurry if winter heating needs increase in price or availability .
In the same vein , most modern houses dont have the ability to NOT heat with natural gas unless modifications are made .
This is another example of how fixed vs marginal energy investment will be key - like the automobile , home heating is not just a plug - and - play BTU problem , as there is long lead time necessary to change relevant built infrastructure .
7 ) Last but not least , I am not an expert on carbon cycles , but if fossil fuels should leave us before large human populations do , we will likely have a carbon sink problem of epic proportions as we switch from ancient , back to old , sunlight .
( assuming current sunlight is insufficient ) .
CONCLUSION
This post has been a first look at the comparative scale of our home heating use from fossil fuels vs. more traditional methods .
A more rigorous analysis using dynamic systems modeling could eventually be a component of a larger renewable energy meta-analysis .
We are at the very early stages of a Sustainability Revolution , equally momentous for humankind as were the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions .
While no one can know with certainty the timing of the decline in liquid fuels , analysis can be put in place ahead of time to focus our efforts on alternatives and portfolios thereof that collectively give us a chance at sustainability .
While there is seemingly a huge inventory of trees in our country , there is also a huge inventory of humans and their respective consumptive wants .
Warmth and protection from cold is among the most basic of our human needs – quite simply , there are not enough trees for an annual growth harvest to provide more than a fraction of our current heating needs .
I do n't really expect we will return to heating with wood , but the point of this exercise is to show that if the market should incentivize people to heat with wood , we have upper limits in expanding our use of wood for heating , and they are not too far from where we are now .
This analysis provides yet another example of the power , density and importance of natural gas and oil in our society .

Sadr City is Moktada al - Sadr ’s place , and the Americans have never come close to subduing it .
There would not be an American forward outpost permanently stationed there , with patrols going out every day , if Mr. Sadr did n’t want it .
The fact is that back in January , the whole thing was closely and specifically negotiated between the Americans , the Iraqi government and Mr. Sadr ’s people .
Likewise , when Mr. Sadr withdrew all six ministers of his party from the cabinet in April , it was greeted by the press as a prelude to Iraq ’s next great cataclysm .
Few recalled that he had done more or less the same last fall , in protest at Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s meeting in Jordan with President Bush .
That gesture , greeted with similar alarmism , was followed two months later , as this one will be , by a return of the Sadrists to their posts .
Nor did most commentators note that even as he pulled out of the cabinet , Mr. Sadr was keeping his 30 members in Parliament , or that the ministries he was given sway over in the power - sharing agreement were still being run by their Sadrist appointees .
The Sadrists ’ cooperation with their own government gets ever deeper .
An Iraqi friend of mine in Baghdad recently tagged along with a Mahdi Army element on a mission to Baghdad ’s Dora neighborhood , a particularly bloody place where the Mahdi Army used to play an active role in protecting Shiites from Sunni “ cleansing . ”
My friend and the Sadrists drove to Dora at midnight , confirmed that the Iraqi Army was there and keeping the Shiite families safe , and went home .
There is also much concern in Washington and elsewhere that Mr. Sadr may be a pawn of the Iranians .
This notion ignores the history of his movement and the essential nationalism underlying his project .
By allying themselves with and speaking for the Shiite poor , Mr. Sadr and his father have long differentiated themselves from the traditional Shiite hierarchy in Najaf , with its great wealth and its ties to Iran .
The Sadrist movement has always been about Iraq for the Iraqis .
They might accept help from Iran — and I saw Iranian supplies in their compounds in Najaf in 2004 — but the movement is not for sale .
Mr. Sadr gets his strength from the street .
And the Arabs of the Iraqi street have no time for Persian bosses .
Nor do they seem to want to foment an all - out civil war .
For all the time I have spent with Sadrist death - squad leaders who focus on killing former Baathists and Al Qaeda ’s supporters ( Sunnis all ) , I have spent just as much time with Mahdi men who have been sent by their leaders to protect Sunni mosques after Sunni provocations , lest Shiites retaliate too broadly .
Declassified report says CIA did n't do enough to prevent 9/11 Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday August 21 , 2007
Print This Email This Internal CIA investigation finds no ' silver bullet ' would have prevented 9/11 A just - released report from the CIA 's inspector general excoriates the agency and its former director , George Tenet , for not doing enough to prepare for the threat of terrorism prior to Sept. 11 , 2001 , when the US suffered its worst domestic terror attack .
The inspector general 's review , which current and former CIA officials tried to keep classified , said intelligence analysts " did not always work effectively and cooperatively . "
The Democratic controlled Congress ordered the declassification of the report 's executive summary in legislation implementing some 9/11 Commission 's recommendations that President Bush signed this month .
In one example of a failure to communicate , the IG 's report says " 50 to 60 individuals " saw Agency alerts about travel information on two 9/11 hijackers between January and March of 2000 .
The CIA did not have Nawaf al - Hazmi and Khalid al - Mihdhar added to a State Department watch list " on a timely basis , " although it knew in early 2000 that one of the two had a US visa and the other had flown to Los Angeles .
The report did not identify a " single point of failure " or " silver bullet " that would have allowed the nation 's intelligence agencies to prevent 9/11 , but did say the lack of communication within and among agencies hampered efforts against al Qaeda .
" If ( intelligence ) officers had been able to view and analyze the full range of information available before 11 September 2001 , they could have developed a more informed context in which to assess the threat reporting of the spring and summer that year , " the report says .
The CIA " did not have a documented , comprehensive approach to al - Qa'ida " and then - Director of Central Intelligence Tenet " did not use all of his authorities in leading the IC's strategic effort " against bin Laden , the report found .
Tenet hit back against the report , saying the Inspector General ignored its own pre-9/11 assessment of the CIA 's terror - fighting capabilities that called the agency 's Counterterrorist Center ( CTC ) " a well managed component " of the effort to " undermine the capabilities of terrorist groups . "
In a lengthy statement , Tenet defended his performance , although he conceded the CIA 's pre-9/11 performance was not beyond reproach .
" But just as we owed it to the country to do better -- the CIA IG owed it to the nation and the men and women of the intelligence community to do a better job in reviewing the circumstances that led to the tragedy of September 11th , " Tenet wrote .
Current CIA Director Michael Hayden begrudgingly released the report Tuesday , saying the fight against terrorism depends on not becoming " captive " to the past and that the release " will , at a minimum , consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed . "
The report was not all bleak for Tenet and the CIA .
It acknowledged Tenet " was actively and forcefully engaged " in the agency 's counterterrorism effort and said he received near - daily updated on bin Laden for two years before the terror attacks .
Although Tenet authorized the creation of an anti-bin Laden task force in 1998 , the IG 's report found that neither Tenet nor his deputy followed up those initial warnings to create a " documented , comprehensive plan . "
It found that Tenet and the CTC focused more on operations and tactics than long - term strategy in combating terrorism .
Tenet began as the Director of Central Intelligence in 1997 , during former - President Bill Clinton 's second term .
He resigned as the second - longest - serving DCI in July 2004 .
Later that year Bush awarded Tenet the Presidential Medal of Freedom , in a move Democrats questioned because of Tenet 's oversight of the CIA when it produced faulty intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq invasion .
The New York Times notes that an internal examination of the FBI 's pre-9/11 readiness also faulted some actions , but " while some officials in both the F.B.I. and C.I.A. have come under heavy criticism , none has been disciplined . "
Developing ...
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) instructed drugmakers yesterday to update the warning labels that have been required on antidepressant medications since 2005 .
The warning , which previously applied to those under the age of 18 , states that antidepressants have been found to double the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors .
The new " black box " warning — the FDA 's strongest possible label — will alert people younger than 25 to a similar risk .
And in an unusual move , it will state that depression and some other psychiatric disorders " are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide . "
If the warning seems to suffer from a split personality , it mirrors an ongoing debate among researchers and patient advocates about the risks and benefits of antidepressants .
The FDA 's Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended in December that the warning be expanded to cover young adults .
The panel had reviewed 295 trials of antidepressants that included 77,000 adults of all ages who suffered from major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and other psychiatric conditions .
Reviewers concluded that , compared with a placebo , antidepressant treatment had led to five additional cases — twice the rate — of suicidal thoughts or behavior ( suicidality ) per thousand adults aged 18 to 24 .
The risks from drugs and placebos were roughly equal in those aged 25 to 64 , and antidepressants led to six fewer cases than a placebo in those 65 and older , according to the proposed FDA warning , which includes a table breaking down the risks by age group .
The number of successful suicides , however , did not show a clear trend .
For young adults , " the risk is quite small , but we think it is a real risk and it 's something that needs to be paid attention to , " said Thomas Laughren , director of the FDA 's Division of Psychiatry Products , at a press conference yesterday .
The same FDA panel recommended in 2004 that the black box warnings be added to 34 drugs , from Anafranil to Zyban .
The warning advised patients to consider both the risks and benefits of treatment , but some experts were concerned it would scare off patients who might benefit from the drugs .
Prescription rates for antidepressants fell in 2004 , after the FDA first made public announcements about their risks .
Perhaps coincidentally , the teen suicide rate rose 18 percent between 2003 and 2004 , the latest years for which data is available .
" The coincidence of a decrease in prescribing and an increase in adolescent suicides after years of suicides coming down is a concern , " Laughren said .
" We do n't know specifically whether or not the black box has been the cause of either , " he said .
The suicide trend is " worrisome , " agrees David Brent , a child psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
Last month Brent and colleagues published a pooled analysis of 27 trials for MDD and other psychiatric problems in kids , in which they compared the total number of individuals successfully treated with those harmed during the first couple months of treatment with one of several antidepressants .
" Many more people benefit from the drug than experience suicidal thoughts , " Brent says , " So the question is what is this expanded label going to do ? "
The risks of antidepressants may be small , but so are the measured benefits , says clinical psychologist David Antonuccio of the University of Nevada School of Medicine .
In the Brent group 's analysis , he notes , 50 percent of those suffering from MDD responded to a placebo , compared with 61 percent who responded to treatment — specifically , to Prozac , the only drug approved by the FDA for treatment of depression in children or teens .
" This comes down to informed consent , " Antonuccio says .
Depression requires treatment , but other treatments are less risky , if less effective , he adds .
" The value of the warning label is that it alerts parents , physicians and patients to the possibility that some kids can become more agitated " on antidepressants , Antonuccio says .
" That 's a very important piece of information . "
June 8 , 2007  --
The immigration reform bill cobbled together by a bipartisan group of about a dozen senators was a true compromise in the sense that there was something in it for everyone to hate .
Thus , senators on the left and right tried to change it with amendments , undoing the compromise .
The amendments , combined with growing opposition to the measure among both conservatives and liberals , essentially killed the bill Thursday night .
It was a defeat for the bipartisan group that had been working on the compromise for three months ; the presidential campaign of one from their ranks , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . ; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. ; and the unpopular President Bush , not necessarily in that order .
One of the leading critics of the bill , Rep. Tom Tancredo , R - Colo. , said he fought to defeat it because it would n't provide better border security .
" Out our way , we call it ' all hat and no cattle . '
Nothing would do anything about security , " he said on " Good Morning America . "
Shortly before 9 p.m.
Thursday , a procedural motion that had come to represent the bill 's life or death achieved a vote of 50 against the bill to 45 for it .
Even some of those in the original bipartisan coalition that had put the bill together and announced it to great fanfare on May 17 — Sens.
Jon Kyl , R - Ariz. , Johnny Isakson , R - Ga. , and Saxby Chambliss , R - Ga. — voted against the measure , joined by 11 Democrats .
Seven Republicans , including McCain , Nebraska 's Chuck Hagel and South Carolina 's Lindsey Graham voted for the procedural motion in favor of the bill .
" We 're going to take the bill off the Senate floor , but there are ways we could do this , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , who described one of his colleagues , an author of the bill , as crying in his office .
" There could be an agreement . …
Hopefully , we could do that in the next several weeks . "
The previous two days were marked by the Senate Democratic and Republican leaders wrangling over how many amendments Republicans would be permitted to offer .
Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky blamed the Democrats for not allowing the Republicans to introduce enough amendments .
" I think we 're giving up on this bill too soon , " McConnell said .
But Reid complained that Republicans were never able to specify how many amendments they wanted to offer , making Democrats suspicious that their intent was to nibble the bill to death .
" We spent so much time on this bill trying to make people happy on this bill who were n't going to vote for the bill anyway , " Reid said .
Republicans , conversely , said that a more gifted Senate leader could have satisfied Republican calls for more amendments and achieved the bill he wanted .
The president , overseas at the G - 8 Summit , did not immediately comment , but the failure of what he hoped would be a major legislative achievement during his final two years would surely not come as good news for a president eager to line up achievements for the history books .
Earlier in the day , as Reid tried to force the measure to a vote , he said , " Someone should get word to the president that if this bill goes down with the vast majority of the Democrats voting for this … the headline 's going to be ' Democrats Vote to Continue the Bill , Republicans Vote Against It , the President Fails Again . ' "
The Bush administration was present , in the form of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez , working in the vice president 's Senate office to save the compromise .
Indeed , those who were part of the fragile bipartisan coalition that put together the compromise tried to make it work until the very end , meeting behind closed doors to try to strike a deal to alter the bill to undo changes the amendment process had made .
Some took to the floor to plead that the bill not be killed .
" If we vote no on this legislation , " warned Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass. , one of the bill 's authors , " we 're returning to the law of the jungle , because that 's what it is .
It 's a jungle on that border . "
Kennedy said it 's easy for senators to " find the excuses " to vote against the bill .
" We all find the reasons to say no , " he said .
" We can all find different aspects of this legislation that we differ with , but underneath it ... this is a proposal that is deeply rooted in remedying one of the great national challenges that we have -- broken borders and a broken immigration system . "
In general , conservatives thought the compromise was insufficiently strong on border security and too lax on illegal immigrants who are , after all , in the country illegally .
Liberals thought the temporary guest worker program favored by big business would drive down American wages and create a new underclass .
And as each side tried to improve the bill to their liking , members of the bipartisan coalition that cobbled together the compromise lost their patience .
Sen . Jeff Sessions , R - Ala. , one of the bill 's chief opponents , argued on Thursday that he was " getting a little tired " of hearing from senators who supported his various amendments but voted against them because they would unravel the compromise .
" I was n't in on that grand compromise , " Sessions said .
" I was n't in the room and neither were the American people . "
On Wednesday evening , Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - N.D. , introduced an amendment that would sunset after five years -- or end unless it 's reauthorized -- the temporary guest worker program , which had already be reduced from 400,000 workers a year to 200,000 .
" Let 's sunset this and evaluate what we 're doing , what impact it has on American workers , " Dorgan said .
McCain , whose presidential campaign may be hurt by his leadership in favor of the immigration compromise , argued that Dorgan 's amendment was nothing more than " another attempt to kill this legislation .
That 's what it will do .
That 's exactly what this amendment does . "
Dorgan 's amendment passed by a narrow vote of 49 - 48 .
Four Republicans who oppose the measure voting for it , presumably to hasten the bill 's demise .
And McCain was right .
The addition of the Dorgan amendment to the bill was one of the main reasons some Republicans ultimately voted against the bill .
Dorgan ultimately voted against the bill , as well , along with fellow Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California , Jim Webb of Virginia , Robert Byrd of West Virginia , seven other Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont .
Another amendment that was problematic for Democrats was offered by Sen. John Cornyn , R - Texas , and approved by a vote of 57 - 39 Wednesday evening .
Cornyn's amendment would have stripped confidentiality provisions from applications by illegal immigrants for permanent " Z " visas .
Under Cornyn's proposal , information from those applications could be used to track down and deport illegal immigrants who were ineligible for " Z " visas .
Opponents of that amendment , most of them Democrats , argued that it undercut the whole point of the pathway to citizenship , because undocumented immigrants who are eligible for the " Z " visa would not utilize the program if they think information in their application could be used to deport them .
In an incident of less consequence but more spectacle , Graham essentially accused Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , of employing empty rhetoric on the campaign trail after the Democratic presidential hopeful offered an amendment that would sunset after five years the bill 's provision to provide a new points - based immigration system .
The points - based system would factor in education levels more so than family connections -- so big business , and in particular the high - tech industry , is behind it .
Many liberals think it inherently devalues family in favor of the bottom line .
Graham and others judged Obama 's amendment to be a " poison - pill , " which would wean away Republican support for the bill .
Graham called Obama out , implying that his campaign rhetoric is so much hot air .
" My good friend from Illinois says to those who have worked so hard to get this bill to the point that it's at , ' Nothing personal , but I can't live with this provision , ' " Graham said .
" You know , bipartisanship is music to the American people 's ears .
When you 're out there on the campaign trail , you 're trying to bring us all together .
You 're trying to make America better .
' Why can't we work together ? ' "
" This is why we can't work together , " Graham said .
" Because some people , when it comes to the tough decisions , back away . "
Graham said that he and his Republican colleagues " have told our base we 're not going to put [ illegal immigrants ] in jail and we 're not going to deport them . "
The Obama amendment , " in the name of making the bill better ... means that everybody over here who 's walked the plank and told our base , ' You 're wrong ' " did so for naught , Graham said .
" Some of us on the Republican side have been beat up and some of you on the Democratic side have been beat up because we 've tried to find a way forward in a problem that nobody else wants to deal with .
" So when you 're out on the campaign trail , my friend , " Graham concluded , " telling about ' Why ca n't we come together ? ' this is why . "
Obama took umbrage at the comments , saying his amendment " simply says that we should examine after five years whether the program is working .
The notion that somehow that guts the bill or destroys the bill is simply disingenuous , and it 's engaging in the sort of histrionics that is entirely inappropriate for this debate . "
Obama , his voice angry if measured , said that the notion that his amendment " somehow destroys the bipartisan nature of this bill is simply untrue . "
Obama 's amendment ultimately did not pass .
But enough amendments did for the bill to die , at least for now .

As Northwest Airlines counts it , Janis Cavinder endured a two - hour delay during a quick trip to London to celebrate the Fourth of July with a college roommate .
But by her count , it was a full - day ordeal that diverted her to Newark and ended last night with a flight on another airline .
Ms. Cavinder , a 27 - year - old Air Force captain who is headed to Afghanistan soon , missed a connection after her first flight from San Diego to Detroit .
That led to the diversion to Newark and a six - hour layover .
She made the best of it , quickly visiting the Statue of Liberty and ground zero , but felt sorry for her friend , a fellow Air Force officer , who was alone for the holiday in London .
“ We were going to be the Americans in London celebrating the Fourth .
Now we ’re going to be celebrating the Fifth , ” said Ms. Cavinder , of Abilene , Tex. , who finally made a Continental Airlines flight .
As anyone who has flown recently can probably tell you , delays are getting worse this year .
The on - time performance of airlines has reached an all - time low , but even the official numbers do not begin to capture the severity of the problem .
Two layers of a high - performance plastic film called ethylene tetrafluoroethylene , or ETFE , fill in the spaces between structural members and are inflated from within to create pillows with a rounded surface .
Both the exterior and interior of the 12 - foot - thick walls and 22 - foot - thick roof have ETFE skins – the hollow space in between is used for ventilation .
This design allows the structure to act like an enormous greenhouse .
When the building needs heat , air is circulated from the warm walls into the interior spaces ; when the building needs to be cooled , air is pulled up from ground level and expelled through the roof .
Various groups in Russia have been claiming that Vladimir Putin is shutting down free democracy .
So when they decided to organize a march in Moscow , Putin did what any self - respecting bastion of freedom would do : sent in the military and arrested people .
Russian riot police detained as many as 200 demonstrators Saturday , including opposition leader and former chess champion Garry Kasparov , in a crackdown on a banned protest in central Moscow .
Thousands of riot police and interior ministry soldiers in camouflage battledress flooded the city centre to prevent a march by The Other Russia , a coalition of groups that accuse President
Vladimir Putin of dismantling democracy .
Kasparov , one of the leaders of The Other Russia , was detained as he attempted to lead demonstrators on to the historic Pushkin Square , an AFP correspondent saw .
Sometimes I wonder how I was lucky enough to be born in America .
I routinely criticize our government for their designs on restricting freedom .
But here , freedom is the rule , not the exception .
In most other countries , it ’s the exact opposite .
Now , considering April 15th is almost upon us , it would be nice if our government could learn a little bit from one of the good things Putin has done …
Here are a few high - tech weapons you would n’t want to mess with , includes DREAD and Metal Storm .
Do n’t agree with our choices ?
Leave us a comment with your picks .
DREAD : The Silent Weapon System
DREAD is an innovative new weapon system that has “ no recoil , no sound , no heat , no gunpowder , no visible firing signature ( muzzle flash ) , and no stoppages or jams of any kind . ” .
So , instead of using self - contained cartridges containing powdered propellant ( gunpowder ) , the DREAD ’s ammunition will be .308 and .50 caliber round metal balls ( steel , tungsten , tungsten carbide , ceramic - coated tungsten , etc… ) that will be literally spun out of the weapon at speeds as high as 8000 fps ( give or take a few hundred feet - per- second ) at rather extreme rpm’s , striking their targets with overwhelming and devastating firepower
Metal Storm Sentry Gun
Like its predecessor , this Metal Storm sentry gun prototype is capable of firing up to 1,000,000 rounds per minute .
The stacked projectile and electronic ignition technology eliminated the need for cartridges , and for many moving parts associated with traditional guns .
Multiple barrels containing stacked rounds could be grouped together in arrays allowing unprecedented ( albeit very brief ) rates of fire of up to 1,000,000 rounds per minute
MOAB Bomb
The MOAB ( Massive Ordnance Air Blast ) bomb “ weighs 21,000 pounds and carries nine tons of H - 6 explosive . ”
The MOAB uses a GPS system to guide it to targets , but with a lethal blast radius of 400 feet , it can hardly be considered a precision weapon
[ Source ]
Redback 40 mm Weapon System
Metal Storm Limited has partnered with Electro Optic Systems Holdings to demonstrate a 40 mm weapon system that ’s capable of taking out three incoming targets in a blistering fast 1.2 seconds .
“ This weapon system is designed to be very light and very fast , and to fulfil a number of urgent operational requirements which rely upon intense directed firepower for short periods . ”

Local Minority scores lag on teaching test Panel to study failure rate , bias complaints
More than half the black and Hispanic applicants for teaching jobs in Massachusetts fail a state licensing exam , a trend that has created a major obstacle to greater diversity among public school faculty and stirred controversy over the fairness of the test .
The minority failure rate has been demonstrably higher than among whites since the test 's inception nearly a decade ago , according to state statistics , which show that 52 percent of Hispanic applicants and 54 percent of black applicants fail the writing portion of the exam .
By comparison , 23 percent of whites fail .
Black and Hispanic teachers also lag behind white teachers in major subject tests such as English , history , and math .
The problem has become so acute that a state task force of teachers , professors , hiring directors , and state education officials convened last week to begin examining why minorities fare so much worse on the tests .
" One of the fallouts which is particularly upsetting in our expe rience across the colleges is fewer and fewer students of color are even going into teaching because word has gotten out that these tests are very difficult for them , " said Sally Dias , a vice president at Emmanuel College in Boston who is a member of the panel .
" One test should really not be a determinant of someone 's career . "
Stiffer federal rules about teacher quality have increased educators ' worries about the results of the teaching test , which more than 16,000 Massachusetts teachers take annually .
States , under a 2001 federal law , must show teacher competency under a bar set by the state .
In Massachusetts , school districts now risk losing federal money if they are not making progress toward licensing all teachers .
Education school deans in the last year began expressing concerns about the minority teachers ' high failure rates to state officials and asked the state to evaluate the validity of the test and consider other ways of judging prospective teachers .
They and others say the minority teachers ' results raise questions about whether the design of the Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure is culturally biased and whether the quality of education that minority teaching applicants receive is good enough .
The state 's teachers have had to take a battery of tests to get their licenses since 1998 , under rules set in the 1993 Education Reform Act .
Before 1998 , teachers qualified for licenses if they passed certain college courses and had completed student teaching .
Chris Anderson , chairman of the state Board of Education , said he is open to other ways of assessing teachers as long as standards are not lowered .
" There 's no reason to have any barriers to quality teachers if we do n't need them , " he said .
" But at the same time , we need to have accountability and assurance that there are basic abilities for any new teacher in Massachusetts . "
To receive state certification , teachers must pass the reading and writing tests , known as communication and literacy skills , as well as exams in the subjects they teach .
They can take the tests as many times as necessary to pass , but can continue teaching only if their school systems apply to the state for waivers , which have become more difficult to get .
Boston dismissed more than 100 teachers last year because they were unlicensed .
Aspiring minority teachers and education professors first complained to the state about the tests after it was first administered in April 1998 , when 60 percent of white test takers passed the writing portion , compared with 24 percent of blacks and 40 percent of Hispanics .
A similar but narrower gap still exists in reading .
Asians also trail whites but pass at a higher rate than blacks and Hispanics .
The writing test , where minorities fare the worst , asks multiple choice questions about spelling , punctuation , and capitalization .
Teachers must also show their knowledge of grammar by editing reading passages and defining grammatical terms .
They also must write an essay , and summarize a reading passage .
Some minority teachers have criticized the test for containing culturally biased questions such as readings about investing in the stock market and ancient literature that white , middle - class applicants and those with liberal arts college backgrounds more readily identify with .
Many minority teachers in urban school systems began their education careers as teacher aides or parent volunteers , and earned their education degrees at night and during summer courses in local colleges .
A Cambridge lawyer said he plans to file a class - action lawsuit shortly against the state Department of Education and the testing company on behalf of three minority teachers who failed the test multiple times since 1998 and lost their jobs .
Armando Jaime , who was teaching special education on a waiver in the Boston Public Schools for eight years , was demoted to a nonteaching job last year after his waiver was denied because he had failed the teaching test at least eight times since 1998 .
His $ 62,000 teaching salary was cut nearly in half , he said , and he was forced to take a part - time job as a waiter .
Jaime 's transcript from Lesley University , where he received his master 's degree in May 2006 , shows a slew of A's and B's .
" I felt devastated , thinking I went to school for nothing , " said Jaime , 46 , a native Spanish speaker from Puerto Rico who was a teacher 's aide for nine years before becoming a teacher .
" My degree felt diminished . "
Testing specialists disagree on whether the state 's teaching tests , administered by National Evaluation Systems Inc. , are biased against minorities .
Some call the tests defective because other teacher tests run by the company have been invalidated in the courts .
In 1989 , a federal judge ruled that the company 's tests in Alabama were flawed and ordered them discontinued after a group of black teachers filed a lawsuit .
Massachusetts has a committee that reviews the tests for bias to make sure the content does not disadvantage test takers from different cultural or ethnic backgrounds .
But the state task force plans to scrutinize the test more and make recommendations by December or early next year , said Heidi Guarino , the education department spokeswoman .
In addition to 1998 results , the state recently analyzed test data from 2003 to 2006 and established a persistent pattern of failure among minorities , she said .
Some school system officials liken the disparity among teaching applicants ' test results to the achievement gap between black and Hispanic students , and their white and Asian classmates .
" If you take the achievement gap of high school students , you can just project it forward into college and into the teaching ranks , " said Nick Balasalle , an educational consultant working in the Boston Public Schools and who belongs to the state 's new task force .
He and others said minority teachers who graduate from more selective teacher training programs fare better on licensure tests than those who attend less selective programs .
Rather than scrap teacher testing , the state should focus on the quality of teaching colleges , many said .
" We ask the students to meet performance standards so we should do no less for the teachers , " Balasalle said .
In Boston , the school system two years ago began subsidizing courses on the state tests for more than 650 substitute teachers , teacher aides , and teachers who had not yet passed the tests .
The Black Caucus of the Boston Teachers Union also plans to conduct its own study sessions for minority teachers starting this fall .
" It 's at a do or die stage , " said Sarita Thomas , chairwoman of the caucus and an eighth - grade math teacher in Boston .
" We 're losing too many of our good teachers because they 're not given waivers or extra time to pass these tests . "

Development With Types [ Apr. 9th , 2007| 05:40 pm ] totherme
Lots of folk seem to agree that one of the nice things about having a blog is that you can use it as a public whiteboard , to help order your thoughts on any given subject .
I do n't post all that often myself , but this is n't because my thoughts are already ordered .
It 's because I 've long been in the habit of using a different technology for ordering my thoughts - and when it comes to the sort of geeky code philosophy that might be most at home here , that technology is often pozorvlak
Every so often , he 'll encourage me to blog something from one of our email conversations and invite comment - and I should do so far more often than I do .
I do n't think he'd object to my describing him , for the purposes of this post , as a " recovering perl hacker " .
That is to say that he 's fairly happy with the sensibilities of the perl hacker , and using them to produce Stuff .
He 's also aware that there are other ways of doing things , and wants to understand them .
One of these ways is embodied by the Haskell language and community .
The relationship between the language , the community and the development style are a frequent topic of our emails .
I 'll open then , by quoting a question he asked in a recent email :
... this led me to a question that I 've been wondering about for a while : various Haskell bods ( Cale , Duncan , YAHT , etc ) claim that Haskell code , once it compiles , is typically bug - free .
YAHT says " most of the code I 've written is not buggy , as most of the common sources of bugs in other languages simply do n't exist in Haskell . "
This is not at all my experience .
I have n't measured it properly or anything , but it feels like my Haskell code is approximately as buggy as my Perl code , with the added downsides that it takes a lot longer to get to the stage where you can test it , and a lot longer to find the bugs once you can :-(
[ Must get round to trying Hat . ]
But things like off - by - one - errors , infinite loops , and good old " not understanding the problem properly and writing the wrong thing " are all possible in Haskell , as I 've discovered to my cost .
There are two ways I can see to interpret their statements :
They 're talking about things like memory leaks , null pointer bugs , bugs caused by looping over array indices , etc , that do n't exist in Perl either , but do exist in C .
They 're using l33t guarantee - oriented sk1 llz to prove correctness of their code using the type system .
Do you know which one it is ?
Now , I certainly think there 's a fair bit of ( 1 ) that goes on ( for example , using the Maybe monad to solve the strings problem ) , but I 'm interested here in what pozorvlak
What follows is pretty well taken straight out of the reply I emailed back .
In it , I sort of accidentally started using the word " Duncan " to mean " a mythical perfect haskell programmer " .
I hope he does n't object .
Do you remember that Dijkstra rant we both read some time ago ?
It included such gems as :
The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect : while , before , a program with only one bug used to be " almost correct " , afterwards a program with an error is just " wrong " ( because in error ) .
and :
Right from the beginning , and all through the course , we stress that the programmer 's task is not just to write down a program , but that his main task is to give a formal proof that the program he proposes meets the equally formal functional specification .
... we see to it that the programming language in question has not been implemented on campus so that students are protected from the temptation to test their programs .
I think this might be an indication that Dijkstra writes assembly the way that Duncan writes haskell - and vice versa ...
I 'm not sure - but I think there might be something in the notion .
Let 's think about the two ...
In fact - I guess I 'll start by thinking about Dijkstra , and wind back around to haskell in a second ...
When we read that rant for the first time ( and exchanged emails about it ) , the impression I eventually came away with was that Dijkstra had an interesting idea , so far as it went .
He would probably be able to produce a generation of students who could each take a formal specification of a problem ( or a similarly clear exam - question style description of a problem ) , and produce correct code which satisfies it .
This is a useful skill , but is only part of the job of the programmer , who also has to come up with that specification in the first place .
You mention three classes of bugs ( off by one errors , infinite loops , and not really understanding the problem ) in your email - it 's the third of these that I was n't convinced that Dijkstra 's methods would deal with for us .
I am fairly convinced that the first two can be eliminated this way .
I have an excellent book on my desk - a hang over from the Oxford course - called " Programming : The derivation of Algorithms " by Anne Kaldewaij .
It shows how to take a certain sort of specification and , almost entirely mechanically , derive the programme from the specification .
There are points of choice - of creativity along the way , but they 're limited to high level things .
Low level details like off - by - one errors are eliminated by the system , so long as you 're able to follow it ( it ca n't guard against typos ) .
Termination proofs are part of the thing too , so you 're not going to get infinite loops either .
I never actually write procedural code this way - it takes far too long .
But I can see that a mechanical method exists which will eliminate those kinds of silly mistakes , and I guess I nod towards it when I write complex things ( which is n't very often ) .
I 'm willing to take it on faith that Dijkstra could produce coders who could code in a way similar to that - which eliminated those sorts of bugs , and he could probably have them turn out code at a fairly professional rate .
I think many of these sorts of problems can be eliminated by certain sorts of high level language .
I think the memory errors you mentioned , and the strings problem I mentioned are also in this class of errors .
The difference between the solutions to those problems that we mentioned , and the solution that Dijkstra proposes , is that ours is packaged up - the proof of the java garbage collector is in the mind of some Sun engineer somewhere - and java programmers do n't have to care .
There does n't happen to be a packaged up proof / method for the off by one error you came across , so the error caught you out .
The advantage that Dijkstra 's students would have , is that they'd be versed in that style from the beginning - they'd be able to use the garbage collector the same as you , but when they found a gap in the system ( the space for an off - by - one bug ) , they'd be able to fill it in , and avoid the bug .
So , for that class of what I 'll call " silly mistake " bugs , I think that haskell 's probably better than perl , is better than C , is better than assembly .
None are perfect , because none of them produce proofs automatically , but someone versed in that particular skill can fill in those gaps .
The interesting class of bugs is the " not understanding the problem " class .
Having a specification eliminates this problem , so we can think of it as " producing a specification " or " describing the problem " or something like that .
I know that Dijkstra has written big reliable code , so it seems to me that he has a solution to this problem , even if he does n't bang on about it so much as he does about eliminating the " silly mistakes " .
So , back to the point in hand - haskell and Duncan 's programming style .
I suspect that both Duncan and Dijkstra may have hit upon a similar solution to the specification problem , namely , to explore the problem in a different intellectual space than the runtime - inspired one that imperative programmers ( apart from Dijkstra ) tend to use .
A portion of that space may well be type - system inspired for Duncan .
It may be quite a large portion , but I do n't think that 's all of it .
I suspect that when he 's writing a programme , he thinks about what he wants it to guarantee first ( as distinct from what he wants it to do - as you spotted ) , then tries to express a portion of that as a series of function types ...
The programme is n't even in his head yet ..
The specification ( probably part formed at this stage ) is in his head , and the silhouette of the specification on the type system is on the screen .
Then , the interesting bit - the agile methods style cycle of prototyping , testing and refining the spec can happen using the type system and Duncan 's mind .
He 's practised at knowing what can and can't be easily expressed in the type system , so he does n't waste time trying to express things that are n't easily expressible - but there 's enough of a silhouette for him to get a tangible grip on the programme .
Dijkstra , of course , does n't need this - he's a maths god , and can do this stage all in his head .
Once the types of his functions are all written down , I 'd guess that the spec is clear enough to him , that he can spend all his effort now on eliminating the " silly mistake " type bugs .
He still has n't written any code , but he already knows what the shadow of the code looks like , so he 's free to concentrate on the detail as he refines the specification in his head to code on the screen .
If he 's chosen his types carefully , many silly mistakes will be eliminated by the type system .
And since he 's been thinking about the relationship between the spec , and the types he 's written down , it 'll be more obvious to him what guarantees he needs that the type system can't give him - so he 'll be watching for those mistakes as he writes the function bodies , and possibly coming up with other abstractions to help guard against them on the way .
So , I guess an advantage of this kind of method would be that one separates out the problem of understanding the problem , from the problem of silly mistakes in implementation ...
Tackle the first whole heartedly first , then you 're free to tackle as much of the second as can't be done mechanically already with your full attention .
Does that make any sense ?
It 's kind of a stream of thought , and I 'm probably projecting a whole load of random junk onto Duncan 's image - but it seems plausible to me that such a theoretical Duncan might exist .
Perhaps I / we should send him a copy of this , and ask how close it comes to what he does ;)

Someone I know attended a talk which Homeland Security Head Michael Chertoff gave today at the University of Southern California on port and supply - chain security and public infrastructure protection
My contact reported to me today by email that Chertoff spoke about more " gut feelings " that he ( Chertoff ) has about a simultaneous Los Angeles / San Francisco dirty bomb attack that " our enemy is surely planning " .

A revolutionary drug that stops Alzheimer 's disease in its tracks could be available within a few years .
It could prevent people from reaching the devastating final stages of the illness , in which sufferers lose the ability to walk , talk and even swallow , and end up totally dependent on others .
The jab , which is now being tested on patients , could be in widespread use in as little as six years .
The most common cause of dementia , Alzheimer 's affects around 500,000 Britons , with about 500 new cases diagnosed every day as people live longer .
Scroll down for more ...
Treatment costs the NHS up to £ 14 billion a year - more than it spends on strokes , heart disease and cancer combined .
Existing drugs can delay the progress of the symptoms , but their effect wears off relatively quickly , allowing the disease to take its devastating course .
In contrast , the new vaccine may be able to hold the disease at bay indefinitely .
Professor Clive Ballard , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " A successful vaccine would be a groundbreaking treatment advance for the 25 million people with Alzheimer 's disease worldwide . "
Vaccines are typically used to provide immunity to a disease as a preventive measure before it can develop , but this is an example of a therapeutic vaccine , used to treat a disease which has already developed .
Known as CAD106 , it is the brainchild of scientists at Zurich - based biotechnology firm Cytos , which is also developing anti-smoking , obesity and flu vaccines .
Cytos chief executive Dr Wolfgang Renner said : " If it could prevent the progression of Alzheimer 's , it would be fantastic . "
Early tests showed the vaccine is highly effective at breaking up the sticky protein that clogs the brain in Alzheimer 's , destroying vital connections between brain cells .
When the jab was given to mice suffering from a disease similar to Alzheimer 's , 80 per cent of the patches of amyloid protein were broken up .
The vaccine is now being tried out on 60 elderly Swedish patients in the early and middle stages of Alzheimer's .
Half of the men and women are being given the vaccine while half are being given dummy jabs .
Although the year - long trial is designed to show that the treatment is safe , the researchers will also look at its effect on the patients ' symptoms .
While the results are not due until early next year , the initial findings are promising .
Dr Renner told a Zurich conference earlier this week : " I am glad to report that the vaccine is very well tolerated . "
If the trial is successful , larger - scale trials will follow , in which researchers will work out the best dose to give and how often it should be given .
The finished product is six to eight years from the market .
The vaccine uses a tiny section of the amyloid protein attached to an empty virus shell to trick the immune system into attacking and breaking up deposits of protein clogging the brain .
Scientists at Cytos , who have sold the rights to the vaccine to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis , say the vaccine is likely to be given to those in the early stages of Alzheimer 's , to stop the disease from progressing .
The development of tests capable of detecting the disease in its earliest stages would allow the jab to be given at the first possible opportunity .
It could also be used to keep the disease at bay in those with a strong family history of the illness , and even for the mass vaccination of people in late middle age .
However , while the jab may stop the disease in its tracks , it is not expected to repair dead tissue , and so will not be a cure .
Nevertheless , preventing the disease 's progression would have an enormous impact on sufferers ' lives .
British Alzheimer 's experts welcomed the research .
Professor Ballard of the Alzheimer 's Society said a previous development , the Elan jab , which failed due to severe side - effects , " was seen as the most exciting treatment development ever investigated for the treatment of dementia " .
He added : " This new vaccine is potentially promising as scientists hope they have found a way to limit adverse reactions . "
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said the vaccine is still many years away from the pharmacy shelf .
But she added : " This is very exciting research and brings us a step closer to finding an answer to this terrible disease .
" With 700,000 people with dementia in the UK - a number forecast to double within a generation - we urgently need to find ways to halt this devastating disease . "
Experts forecast that the ageing population will result in a " global epidemic " of Alzheimer 's , with one in 85 people being sufferers by 2050 .

Hell is a place of everlasting damnation and fire .
locokamil : Your belief system is thermodynamically unsound .
The international rights group warns that the use of fear as a political tool is threatening to create a world in which no person is safe and no right is protected .
Amnesty lays much of the blame for this grim situation on the global " war on terror , ” which it says has encouraged human rights abuses and poisoned the atmosphere of international relations .
Joshua Rubenstein , Amnesty ’s Northeast Regional Director , said the criticism applies to governments around the world – including China , Russia , Zimbabwe – but rests heavily with the United States , which is no longer seen as a leader on human rights .
U.S. ' Setting A Bad Example '
" In pursuing its so - called war on terror , the U.S. is winking at the use of torture , it is holding people without trial , without charges , in Guantanamo Bay and trying to restrict access by their attorneys , " he says .
" It ’s setting a terrible example for the rest of the world . ”
And in a statement accompanying the report , Amnesty ’s secretary general , Irene Khan , accuses the United States of " globalizing ” human rights abuses with its " war on terror ” and renditions program , in which suspects are taken to secret prisons abroad for interrogation .
She says the United States is treating the world as " a giant battlefield . ”
The rights group also has harsh words for insurgent groups that use terror tactics against civilians to advance their agendas , and points to the almost daily attacks in Iraq as a prime example .
In the past year , divisions between Muslims and non-Muslims around the world have deepened , largely because of what Amnesty calls " discriminatory counterterrorism strategies in Western countries . ”
Discrimination Against Minorities
And the report notes that racism and xenophobia have increased because governments from Ireland to Russia have turned a blind eye to hate crimes and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities .
Amnesty gives several reasons for concern in Russia , including the crushing of independent media , crackdowns on public protests , the eviction of ethnic minorities from bazaars , and hate crimes that go unpunished .
It condemns the failure to make arrests when journalists are killed , and singles out the October , 2006 , murder of the journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya .
AI 's Rubenstein says President Vladimir Putin 's brutal handling of the conflict in the Caucasus has led to a culture of violence in many parts of Russia .
" In Russia , the way President Putin has exploited the conflict in the Caucasus , particularly in Chechnya , has created a climate in which there is greater violence against minorities and people who appear to be dark - skinned in Russia , " he says .
" This includes attacks on people who are thought to be from the Caucasus , on African students , and on Jews .
So there ’s a climate of xenophobia and chauvinism in Russia .
And we do not believe the government is doing enough to counteract that , to hold people responsible . ”
Uzbekistan , Belarus Rated Among Worst
Both Uzbekistan and Belarus are held up by Amnesty as among the world ’s worst human rights abusers .
In Uzbekistan , Amnesty faults the authorities for ignoring international calls for an independent investigation into the May , 2005 , killings of hundreds of civilians by government troops in the town of Andijon .
The group says harassment , imprisonment , and torture of human rights activists occur on a wide scale , and President Islam Karimov ’s regime has revoked the licenses of several U.S. - funded nongovernmental groups , forcing them to leave the country .
Rubenstein says the media climate in Uzbekistan is one of intimidation and restriction .
" You see journalists being restricted , apparently Uzbek citizens are not permitted to write for foreign media , foreign newspapers , and the foreign media who are trying to be present in Uzbekistan are under tremendous pressure not to criticize the government , " he says .
The report also condemns Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Kyrgyzstan for cooperating with Uzbekistan in the " war on terror ” by forcibly returning people suspected of belonging to banned Islamist parties .
" The way Putin has exploited the conflict in the Caucasus has created a climate in which there is greater violence against minorities and people who appear to be dark - skinned . " -- Joshua Rubenstein , Amnesty International
In Belarus , Amnesty cites the March 2006 elections , after which thousands of people protested the results and hundreds were beaten and arrested , as an example of how civil society has deteriorated there .
" Belarus is really one of the most , I suppose it ’s fair to say , extreme examples of human rights violations in Europe today , with certainly one of the most flawed elections one could imagine in Europe , ” he says .
Yet Putin , he adds , is " indifferent ” to democracy and human rights in the entire former Soviet sphere and is not encouraging democratic reforms or rule of law .
" He seems happy to work with [ Belarusian President Alyaksandr ] Lukashenka and Karimov and other authoritarian figures in the [ former ] Soviet Union . ”
' Deterioration ' In Iran
In Iran , where jail cells hold hundreds of political prisoners , Amnesty says the human rights situation has worsened .
Journalists , activists , and lawyers are routinely arbitrarily detained , and torture before trials is common .
Mass arrests after demonstrations occurred several times in 2006 , and more than 175 executions were carried out .
The group also criticizes the Afghan government and the international community for failing to establish the rule of law and respect for human rights in Afghanistan .
Instead , it says , insecurity and corruption have been allowed to flourish , which has helped the Taliban re-emerge .
Criminal masterminds are the subjects of numerous movies and books .
Their stories are quite fascinating , full of intrigue and ingenious schemes .
But dumb crooks are funnier .
Criminals , like everyone else , have varying levels of intelligence .
Some can pull off strings of robberies without a hitch .
Others find it a feat just to get out the door at the bank .
Here are some videos of the most hilariously dumb criminals on the Web .
How Not to Break Into a Liquor Store
Liquor stores are frequent targets of thieves .
But most of them wait until after they get their haul to get drunk .
Not this guy .
He apparently got hammered first , then tried to get in through the roof of this liquor store .
He finally made it in , but after that things just went downhill .
Do n’t Push , Pull
The bank robber in this video is having a terrible day .
First the teller activates a security shield , causing him to lose a day ’s pay .
Then when he tries to go out , he ’s locked in .
Oh , wait , no he ’s not .
He just does n’t know how to operate the door .
Help , I ’m Being Held for Ransom !
Kidnappers are often ruthless in their pursuit of ransom money .
But they usually ask for millions , or at least thousands of dollars .
This guy called the cops and told them that drug dealers had kidnapped him and were demanding a ransom … of $ 200 .
As it turned out , the guy was his own kidnapper .
Brad Pitt Becomes a Con Artist
Criminals often use fake IDs to commit crimes .
But what do you do when you ’re making an ID and do n’t have a picture of yourself ?
One guy in the United Arab Emirates just downloaded a picture off of the Internet to use .
Too bad he did n’t realize that it was a picture of a major American movie star .
Would - Be Thief Knocks Out Accomplice and Self
The crook in this video has a great plan :
Get his buddy to look out while he gets some big rocks and breaks a window .
Unfortunately , the window does n’t budge and both of the two guys end up out cold .
A British Web site , Manboobs.co.uk , welcomes readers with the slogan , “ Welcome to Man Boobs .
The site that says , ‘ we ’re fat and we ’re proud , ’ and then quickly puts it T - shirt back on . ”
And several Web sites , such as gc2compression.com and makemeheal.com , sell compression garments that purport to reduce the visibility of enlarged male breasts .
Plastic surgeons in the United States suggested that the rise in popularity of professional golf may have also contributed to public awareness of gynecomastia ; several prominent popular players have slightly enlarged chests .
But in most adolescents who are not obese , the condition will resolve itself spontaneously as the boy progresses through adolescence and produces more testosterone , said Dr. Brenda Kohn , an associate professor of pediatrics who specializes in pediatric endocrinology at New York University School of Medicine .
As such , she said , “ It is very important that one not operate on a child who is still in puberty . ”
If surgery is done too early , she said , the hormones that caused the initial breast enlargement may still be active and cause ongoing breast development after surgery .
While gynecomastia in young men is most often associated with hormonal fluctuations or obesity , many surgeons are also beginning to link it with increased abuse of steroids .
“ They have hopped up their testosterone levels , and so when they get off the stuff , there is a change in the hormonal milieu , ” said Dr. Guy , the Florida plastic surgeon .
“ It can reset itself , but many times if they have abused steroids , you have to send them to an endocrinologist to address the problem . ”
If that does n’t work , she said , they come back to her for surgery
Surgeons who are referred a young patient by a pediatrician often will first call for a complete endocrinological workup to make sure that the breast enlargement is n’t a transient hormonal fluctuation .
Other causes include decreased testosterone production , kidney failure , testicular tumors and liver disease .
The condition can be addressed with hormone treatments such as testosterone patches or even Tamoxifen , an estrogen - inhibiting drug that is best known for its use in the treatment of breast cancer in women .
“ You have to rule out any other cause before surgery , ” Dr. Copeland said .
( This reporter was until four years ago a cosmetic surgery patient of Dr. Copeland . )
DIGG THIS
Every time Bush stands up to speak about the war , how we have to stick it out , how we have to stand up against evil , how our nation is being called to do its historic duty , I have the same thought : and what are you doing besides making this stupid speech ?
Presidents speak as if they somehow embody the will of the nation , and so the courage shown by the troops is their courage , the determination of the commanders on the ground is their determination too , and the strong will of the people to fork over to fund this ghastly war is their strong will too .
They might even believe it .
But this has nothing to do with reality .
The people who are ordering this war to be fought are not actually doing the fighting .
The politicians are not dying by the dozens per day .
Senators are n’t getting their arms and legs blown off or their faces disfigured .
Executive branch bureaucrats are not fearing for their lives every minute , facing extreme psychological stress , suffering from every manner of sleep deprivation or physical malady .
Nor do politicians live with the ever - lasting guilt that comes with killing in cold blood people who are merely trying to secure the independence of their country .
Indeed , politicians try to stay as far away from the real action of war as possible .
When Bush encounters enlisted soldiers , it is only within carefully scripted parameters .
His handlers make sure that he hears cheers , not hisses .
All the politicians spend more time watching poll numbers than body counts .
For them , most of the death associated with this war is an abstraction .
If any of them were forced to witness first hand the scene of a suicide bomb that kills 20 in an instant , sleep in the bunkers with the troops and hear of their fears and struggles , to personally deliver the news of a dead husband to a young wife and children , matters would be different indeed .
But does that make them any less guilty ?
Not according to the Bush administration ’s own moral theory of culpability .
They claim that Osama bin Laden bears the primary guilt for the crime of 9 - 11 .
He did n’t fly the planes into buildings .
They say that he sponsored the hijackers ’ training , planted the idea , and gave the orders .
That makes him a war criminal and deserving of death .
But then so too have Bush and the political class sponsored the training of the soldiers who are killing and being killed daily .
They gave the commanders the notion that it would be a good idea to demolish a country and a people .
Bush and those he hired have given the orders .
And unlike the case of Osama , there is no doubt about the paper trail that leads directly to the White House .
All these years later , after hundreds of thousands of dead , after unthinkable evil perpetuated and unleashed on Iraq , we are starting to see a growth in the opposition based on partisan concerns .
The Democrats watch polls , and they observe that the war is wildly unpopular and increasingly so all the time .
So there is a movement growing within the party not to back down when faced with Bush ’s preposterous rhetoric that cutting the flow of funds would harm the troops and bring about a victory for terrorism .
What ’s sad here , even disgusting , is that it has taken a strong movement in the polls and the prospect of an election to finally light a fire under the Democrats .
Rivers of blood and the destruction of a country — even massive evidence that the administration lied us into war — have n’t prompted an effort to stop the war .
But a change in the polls seems to have made a difference .
What does this tell us about political motivation ?
Across the country , politicians are telling audiences : we care about you .
We care about your real problems such as health care and education .
We seek the well - being of you and your family , and we have a plan to assist you in every respect .
But one only needs to look at this war to see how much these people truly care about human well - being .
If they did , they would n’t have to wait for poll shifts to stop the killing .
They would act even if the decision were unpopular .
To use the old public - choice language concerning this war , the costs are diffuse and spread thinly but the benefits are direct .
The Democrats too benefit from war booty .
They have merchants of death in their districts that get the cash .
They benefit from the huge spike in " homeland security " funds , and so have every incentive to keep the level of war hysteria high and growing .
They are part of the state apparatus , and war is the health of the state .
They too have much to lose from ending the war and much to gain from keeping some form of the war going .
So do they really care about human well - being ?
It ’s an abstraction to them .
So how to fix the problem ?
One solution is suggested by a visit that Democratic leader Harry Reid made to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
He met with gravely wounded troops .
He also called survivors of the dead and spoke to them about their problems .
All evidence indicates that he was deeply touched .
He is , after all , a human being , and anyone who would n’t be touched by such contact with human suffering would have to be morally blind or a demon possessed .
It was this experience that has prompted him to work for an end to the war .
Though one must note that no such trip was required for Ron Paul to oppose this war from the beginning .
Is there not some antiwar group that could arrange for the non-Ron Paul political class to make similar phone calls and pay visits to those who suffer ?
Such experiences could help create an intellectual link between their political decisions and the suffering they bring about .
We need ever more such visits .
Even better would be to sponsor field trips by the political class to actually walk in the steps of the troops in Iraq .
That would be enough to dispel the impression that ending the war amounts to a failure to support the troops .

This is a selection of photographs of some of the most important or famous historical events that have occurred since photography was invented .
In 1884 , George Eastman developed the technology of film to replace photographic plates , leading to the technology used by film cameras today ; nevertheless , many images exist from before that time that we taken via other photographic methods .
Click the photographs for a larger view .
15 The First Photograph [ France , 1826 ]
Taken by Nicéphore Niépce , this is the first photograph ever taken which still exists .
He called his method heliography ( sun writing ) and this photograph took 8 hours of exposure time ( hence sunlight on both sides of the building ) .

14 Looking Down Sacramento Street [ San Francisco , 1906 ]
Advertisement
This photo was taken on April 18th , 1906 .
It is the most famous photograph of the devastation caused by the great fire and earthquake .
It was taken by Arnold Genthe on a borrowed camera .
13 Breaker Boys [ Pennsylvania , 1910 ]
This is a photograph of breaker boys – child labour used to separate coal from slate .
This image helped lead the nation to outlaw child labour .
The photo was taken by Lewis Hine who travelled the United States taking photographs of child labourers .
12 The Lynching of Young Blacks [ Indiana , 1930 ]
This photograph was taken after the lynching of two young black men accused of raping a white girl .
They were hanged by a mob of 10,000 .
The faces of the crowd are very telling .
A third man was saved by the girls uncle who said he was innocent .
11 Migrant Mother [ Oklahoma , 1936 ]
This photograph of Florence Owens Thompson ( 32 year old mother of 7 ) is one of the great representations of the Great Depression .
The photograph was taken by Dorothea Lange after Florence had sold her tent to provide food for her children .
10 Hitler in Paris [ Paris , 1940 ]
This photograph was taken of Adolf Hitler visiting Paris with his architect Albert Speer , on June 23 , 1940 .
Hitler ’s army had captured Paris and Hitler went to admire his new City .
9 The Last Jew in Vinnitsa [ Ukraine , 1941 ]
This was found in the personal album of an Einsatzgruppen soldier .
It was labelled on the back “ The last Jew of Vinnitsa ” .
All 28,000 of the Jews living there were killed at the time .
8 V - J Day [ New York , 1945 ]
This is one of the most famous photographs from the Second World War .
The soldier and the nurse are unknown but people have come forward to claim the fame .
Apparently the nurse slapped the soldier immediately after .
The event was the celebration of the end of the war and it was taken in Times Square by Alfred Eisenstaedt .
7 Soviet Flag raised above the Reichstag [ Berlin , 1945 ]
Soviet Union soldiers Raqymzhan Qoshqarbaev , and Georgij Bulatov raising the flag on the roof of Reichstag building in Berlin , Germany in May , 1945 .

6 Vatican II Begins [ Vatican City , 1960 ]
This is a photograph of Pope John XXIII signing the document that officially started the Second Vatican Council .
After his death , Pope Paul VI continued the council which was to change the Catholic Church so much that has become barely a reflection of what it was before .
On his deathbed , John XXIII is rumoured to have said “ Stop the council ! ”
5 The Body of Che Guevara [ Bolivia , 1967 ]
After capturing and killing Guevara ( Marxist revolutionary ) , the Bolivian army showed this photograph to prove that he was dead .
His death dealt a death blow to the socialist revolutionary movement in Latin America and the Third World .
4 Execution of a Viet Cong Guerrilla [ Vietnam , 1968 ]
Photographer Eddie Adams took this photograph of Nguyen Ngoc Loan , South Vietnam ’s national police chief executing this Viet Cong captain .
Adams later said that he regretted that the world did not see Loan as a hero for his actions in Vietnam .
3 Footprint on the Moon [ Lunar , 1969 ]

プロファイラのしく み
UNIX 偏向文書 artu の中で " Measure Before Optimizing " と説く Raymond は , 同時にプロファイラの計測機構 ( instrumentation ) がもたらすノイズについて注意を促している .
私のプロファイラ信仰に不安が翳を落とす.
gprof
ノイズはさておき , そもそもプロファイラはどんな仕組みで速度を測っているんだろう.
gprof のマニュアル によると , GNU 一族のプロファイラは次のように実装されている : まず " - pg " オプションつきの gcc でソースをコンパイルする .
この指示を受けたコンパイラは各関数の冒頭に " mcount " という名前の関数呼出しを加える .
リンクする C のランタイムも専用バージョン ( gcrt0.o ) に差し替わる. このランタイムは裏で profil ( ) 関数を使いタイマを仕掛ける .
そのタイマは発火毎に現在のプログラム・カウンタ( PC)のレジスタを記録する.
プログラム終了時 , ランタイムは mcount ( ) と profil ( ) が集めたデータを " gmon.out " ファイルに出力する .
肝心な gprof の仕事はこの gmon.out をパースして結果を表示するだけらしい . ( 横柄なやつだ ... )
とりあえず試してみよう .
int foo( int n ) { int x = 0 , i = 0 , j = 0 ; for ( i=0 ; i< n ; i++ ) { for ( j=0 ; j< n ; j ++ ) { x += i*j ; } } return x ; } int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { int i=0 ; for ( i=0 ; i<1000 ; ++i ) { foo( i ) ; } return 0 ; }
これをコンパイルすると ...
$ gcc - pg - S - O0 main . c
_hello : .... pushl %ebx subl $ 20 , %esp call ___i686.get_pc_thunk.bx call Lmcount$stub .... call L_puts$stub .... ret .globl _main _main : .... call Lmcount$stub .... call _hello .... ret ....
Lmcount$stub : .indirect_symbol mcount ....
たしかに mcount ( ) が呼ばれている .
( gcrt0. o の確認はパス . ) こいつは何をしているんだろうか. あちこち探すと glibc に実装があった .
( gmon/mcount . c )
mcount ( ) の引数はレジスタの値がふたつ .
呼出元のプログラムカウンタ frompc と , 現在の selfpc をとる .
この値をグローバル変数 _gmonparam のデータ構造に保存している. mcount ( ) に渡る PC 対を gprof では " arc " と呼ぶ .
" 呼び出しグラフ " の辺 ( arc ) というわけ .
_gmonparam には , 各 arc の通過回数が記録されている .
さっきのコードを動かしてみよう .
$ gcc - pg - O0 main .c $ ./a.out $ gprof a.out gmon.out
結果はこんなかんじ :
... % cumulative self self total time seconds seconds calls ms / call ms / call name 100.0 0.10 0.10 1000 0.10 0.10 _foo [ 1 ]
0.0 0.10 0.00 1 0.00 100.00 _main [ 2 ] ...
" calls " エントリが呼出回数 .
1000 回 , ちゃんと記録されているのがわかる. mcount ( ) を埋めこんだ甲斐があった .
さて , mcount ( ) は関数の入口で arc を記録するだけだ .
実行時間は別に測る必要がある. そこで先に紹介した profile ( ) の出番になる. マニュアルから profil ( ) はシステムコールであるかの印象を受けたけれど , これも glibc で実装されている .
( sysdeps / posix / profile.c ) 呼び出しも glibc に含まれるプロファイル用ランタイムが行う .
ユーザの出番はない .
profil ( ) の仕事は profil_counter ( ) 関数をタイマに登録するだけ .
UNIX には ITIMER_PROF というプロファイラ専用のタイマが用意されており , 発火すると SIGPROF シグナルが発行される .
ユーザ空間で実装されるとはいえカーネルよりの仕組みなのがわかる.
SIGPROF ハンドラの ( profil_counter ( ) は PC レジスタの値を引数に profil_count ( ) を呼ぶ. これが本体. 先に profil ( ) から渡しておいた sample 配列に PC を記録する .
sample 配列は PC を添字にとる整数配列で , 以下のように PC の呼出回数を覚えておく :
sample [ PC/N ]++;
配列の大きさ や N の値をどう決めるかは悩ましいが , プロファイル用ランタイムはよろしくやってくれる .
gprof の量子化誤 差
細かい間隔のタイマで動く profil_counter ( ) は各瞬間の PC を数える .
これが実行時間の根拠になる .
PC の記録回数が多い関数ほど長く実行されたとみなすわけ. arc を記録する mcount ( ) と違い , profil ( ) は現在の PC だけを記録する .
どこから呼ばれたかは無視. だから profile ( ) の結果から直接わかるのは , 自分自身の実行時間 ( gprof の出力にある " self " のエントリ ) だけだ.
これは子の呼び出しを含まない. 子を含む " total " の時間は mcount ( ) の arc 情報と組合せて計算している .
具体的には , total = self +
( ( {子関数 i の実行時間} x {i の呼び出し回数} ) の総和 ) となる .
gprof は " 子関数 i の実行時間 " に平均値を用いている .
しかし関数の中には入力によって実行時間の大きく変わるものがある.
そうした関数を含む計測に平均という前提をもちこむとトラブルになる.
たとえば 先のサンプルにあった foo ( ) は入力に対し O ( N^2 ) の計算量をもつ. foo ( ) を使った以下のようなプログラムを動かしてみる.
int bar ( ) { int x = 0 , i = 0 ; for ( i=0 ; i< 10 ; i++) { x += foo( 10000 ) ; } return x ; } int baz ( ) { int x = 0 , i = 0 ; for ( i=0 ; i< 10000 ; i++) { x += foo ( 10 ) ; } return x ; } int main ( int argc , char* argv [ ] ) { bar ( ) ; baz( ) ; return 0 ; }
プロファイル結果 :
% cumulative self self total time seconds seconds calls ms / call ms / call name 100.0 0.38 0.38 10010 0.04 0.04 _foo [ 1 ]
0.0 0.38 0.00 1 0.00 0.38 _bar [ 5 ]
0.0 0.38 0.00 1 0.00 379.62 _baz [ 4 ]
0.0 0.38 0.00 1 0.00 380.00 _main [ 2 ]
baz ( ) の実行時間が bar ( ) の 1000 倍になっている .
おかしい. ベタにタイマーで測ってみよう .
int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { clock_t start = 0 , bar_end = 0 , baz_end = 0 ; start = clock ( ) ; bar( ) ; bar_end = clock ( ) ; baz( ) ; baz_end = clock ( ) ; printf ( " bar : %d , baz : %d
" , bar_end - start , baz_end - bar_end ) ; return 0 ; }
結果 :
bar :478 , baz :
1
この問題は gprof の man にも BUG として言及されている .
プロファイル結果は直感に反するなんてよく言うけれど , 事実に反するのは困るなあ... プロファイラだけでなく , 様々な計測を組み合わせるべきなんだろうね.
gprof の限界
gprof は手軽に使えるけれど , 先の誤差をはじめ制限は多い .
たとえばプロセスをまたぐ測定はできない.
プロセス単位で仕事を分担する UNIX にとってこれは都合が悪い .
グローバル変数が多くマルチスレッド対応も弱い.
動作はするが意味のある数字は期待できない.
IO などカーネルが遅いのもわからない .
これら問題の多くはプロセス内で動くよう設計された gprof の限界だと言える . 20 年以上前のツールだから仕方ない. 計測業界(? ) 自体は 20 年かけてそれなりに進歩しており , その成果には庶民が使えるものもある.
有名どころを少し眺めてみたい.
OProfile は linux 用の " system - wide " プロファイラ .
カーネルのドライバ(+デーモン)として実装されており , プロセスをまたいだシステム全体のの計測ができる.
カーネル内の速度もわかるし , マルチスレッドも OK .
OProfile はもともと DCPI ( Digital Continuous Profiling Infrastructure ) という旧 DEC 製の プロファイラからアイデアを得て作られた .
だから意図を知るには DCPI の解説記事 が役にたつ .
( OProfile のページからもリンクされている . )
DCPI は実運用されているシステムを計測するために作られた .
運用中のシステムを測る以上 , オーバーヘッドは極力小さくしたい .
またある程度長い時間かけて測りたいから , 集めた大量の計測データもうまく管理する必要がある.
Alpha CPU の威信もあって SMP 環境できっちり動かないといけない . 目標は高い .
OProfile もこれに倣ってけっこう野心的な作りになっている .
OProfile の基本的な仕組みは profil ( ) に近い.
割り込みを使って PC レジスタを記録し , 各コード/モジュールの実行時間を測る. OS のタイマーを使う profil ( ) に対し , OProfile は CPU の " パフォーマンスカウンタ " を直接使う .
パフォーマンスカウンタは CPU 備え付けの計測機構 . 各種 " イベント " の回数を数え , 所定の回数になったら割り込みを起こす .
イベントは , たとえば速度を測りたいなら命令の実行回数を数えることができる.
( イベントの名前や機能は CPU によってまちまち . )
パフォーマンスカウンタの割り込みを直接使うこの仕組みは , スケジューラの絡む OS のタイマーより軽い .
ハードウェアのドライバがデバイスからの割り込みを直接拾うように , OProfile もある種のドライバとして実装されている . ( だからカーネル空間で動く . )
OPorifle ドライバのコードは linux カーネルのツリーに入っている :
ドライバはカーネル空間に溜めこんだデータを定期的にユーザ空間へ掃きだす.
ユーザ空間ではデータを受けとるデーモンプロセス oprofiled が待ち構えている .
データの受け渡しは専用のファイルシステム oprofilefs を経由して行う . ( oprofilefs.c , event_buffer .c など. ) oprofiled は仮想ファイルからデータを読みだし , 今度は本当のファイルに保存する .
こうして計測データはカーネルから届き , 解析されるのを待つ .
解析は oreport コマンドを使う .
ユーザは oreport でそのファイルを後処理し , 眺めることができる .

すげー! linux マシンほしいなあ .
OProfile そのほかの見 所
さすがに今時のコードだけあって , OProfile は見所が多い .
ちょっと紹介 .
まず SMP 対策. 前に書いたとおり , OProfile の本体はパフォーマンスカウンタの割り込みハンドラにある.
割り込みハンドラは当然 CPU 毎に並列で動いてほしい .
一方で各 CPU から集めたデータはまとめて oprofiled に渡す必要がある .
そこで OProfile では CPU 毎にバッファを用意し , 割り込みハンドラはそこにデータを書き込む .
バッファの中味はあふれる前にカーネルのワーカスレッドが回収する.
バッファへの書込みはさぞかしハイテクなのかと思いきや...
void oprofile_add_ext_sample ( unsigned long pc , struct pt_regs * const regs , unsigned long event , int is_kernel ) { struct oprofile_cpu_buffer * cpu_buf = & cpu_buffer[smp_processor_id( ) ] ; if ( !backtrace_depth ) { log_sample ( cpu_buf , pc , is_kernel , event ) ; return ; } .... }
CPUID で配列アクセスかよ !
単純だなー .
マルチスレッドのプログラミングは案外カーネルの方が楽なんじゃないかしら...
今日もスレッドのバグで半日つぶした私は訝しみたくなる.
まあいいです .
CPU 毎にバッファを確保するこのアプローチは DCPI から引き継いでいる .
つぎはカーネル内のフック .
プロセスをまたぐ以上 , PC レジスタだけでは情報が足りない .
今うごいているプロセスが何か , またそのプロセスはどんなライブラリをロードしているのかを知る必要がある.
DCPI ではローダを改造してたが , OProfile は既存のコードを置き換えない .
かわりに linux カーネルに用意されたプロファイラ用のフックを使う .
( buffer_sync.h , linux / profile.h , kernel / profile .c ) こんな便利な API があるとは ... 比較的最近 ( 2004 年くらい ) に入ったものらしい .
古い OProfile のコードを見るとシステムコールの関数ポインタを上書きしていてびびる.
たしかにフックが欲しい .
PC レジスタの記録だけでは呼び出しグラフを作ることができない .
OProfile は 0.8 からスタックトレースを記録するようになった. ( backtrace . c ) おかげで呼び出しグラフの統計もとれる.
記録をするタイミングは PC レジスタの保存と同時 .
負荷が気になるけれど便利そう .
カーネル内のがんばりだけでなく , 統計ツール側の工夫もある .
OProfile は多くの CPU アーキテクチャをサポートしており , 一方でプロファイルカウンタの仕様は CPU 毎に大きく異なっている .
しかし Oprofile ドライバの大部分やデーモンはこの違いを意識しない .
プロファイルカウンタからの情報は arch / 以下の実装に隠蔽され , バイト列としてファイルまで持ち越される.
そのバイト列を解釈するのは oreport など後処理ツールの仕事になる .
その後処理ツールも CPU の差異をうまいことデータとしてコード外に追い出せている. ( oprofile / events / ) 感心. ( 詳しい仕組みはよくからないけど ... )
そんなわけで OProfile のしくみを眺めた .
カーネルに住み , パフォーマンスカウンタの割り込みで動く profil ( ) の進化形 .
移植性は高くツールも充実している. gprof は遠くなりにけり ...
DTrace
じゃ次に進みます .
DTrace は Solaris 付属のトレースツール .
あるプロセスのシステムコール呼び出しを追跡する strace に対し , DTrace はシステム全体の様々なイベント ( システムコール含む ) を監視できる .
技術的な概要は USENIX の記事 にまとまっている .
登場したのは 2004 年らしい.
ぐぐると
Sun の blog もその周辺で盛り上っていた .
( 私はだいぶあとに ACMQ の記事を読んで知った . )
OProfile が profil ( ) の延長だったのに対し , DTrace は mcount ( ) と gcc - pg に近い .
もっぱらコードを書き換えて監視のフックを仕込み , 記録をとる . このフックを DTrace では provider と読んでいる .
provider のフックは色々だ .
デバッガがやるようにメモリ上のバイナリを
書き換えて記録をとるものもあるし , プログラマがソースコードの中に書き込んでおくこともできる.
mcount ( ) 相当の関数フックは , 動的なコード書き換えを行う ( Function Boundary Provider ) で実現する .
また provider はフレームワークとして拡張可能になっており , 新しい provdier を自由に定義 , 追加できるらしい .
この拡張性は DTrace のもつ特徴のひとつ .
マニュアルにも山ほど provider が載っている .
Solaris は多くの provider をカーネル組込みで用意している .
たとえばシステムコールのや IO などを監視できる .
DTrace が持つもう一つの特徴は , " D " という awk / C 風 DSL で 集計用のフィルタを記述できるところ .
こんなかんじ ( 記事からコピペ ) :
syscall : : read : entry { self ->t = timestamp ; } syscall : : read : return / self ->t/ { printf ( " %d/ %d spent %d nsecs in read
" , pid , tid , timestamp - self ->t ) ; }
関数名のところがトレースするフックのパターン , カッコの中がフィルタ/集計のロジックらしい.
DSL を用意した理由の一つとして , 先の記事では実行時の安全性を挙げている .
D 言語は dtrace コマンドでバイトコードにコンパイルされ , そのバイトコードがカーネル内の VM で動く .
VM は意図的に仕様を制約しており , アクセス違反や無限ループはおこらない .
だからフックの度に動かしても安全というわけ.
やりすぎ感に溢れていて楽しい. コアとおぼしき ( dtrace .c ) なんて半分くらい VM だもんなあ ... raymond も喜んでくれるよ , たぶん .
拡張性を誇示するかのように , DTrace のページ には様々な provider が紹介されている .
sh , java , PostgreSQL , JavaScript , Mozilla , Apache ... これらの大半は USDT ( Userland Statically Defined Tracing ) という provider を使う .
プログラムは dtrace が提供する USDT のフック関数をソースコードに埋め込む . ( sys/ sdt.h ) " dtrace enhanced " なプログラムというのは , 要するに DTrace 用のフックをパチったもののこと .
関数を追跡する FBP ( Function Boundary Provider ) があるのに わざわざ手動のフックを用意しているのは , 関数をまたく高次のトレースを行うためだ .
たとえばトランザクションの開始から終了まで , VM 内の call 命令から ret 命令まで , データの受信開始から完了までといった処理のなかには , 一つの関数呼び出しで完結しない制御フローを持つものがある .
こうした手続きを関数ベースのトレースで追いかけるのは難しい.
USDT を使えば , transaction_start や transaction_end といったトレース対を 自分で定義して埋め込めむことができる .
プログラマがアドホックに作るトレースに比べ , USDT は DTrace のインフラを使いまわせるぶん楽ができる .
また USDT のフックにはユーザの定義した引数を渡すことができる .
たとえば Java VM のメソッド呼び出し命令を処理する関数で
Java のメソッド名を引数にとれる .
ふつうのプロファイラにこれは難しいだろう. そのほか readXX ( ) 関数に渡すバイト数を記録するといった使い方もできる. 便利 .
具体例は bugzilla にある Gecko 用のパッチ群 # 370906 がわかりやすい .
( dtrace ファイルを定義す る # 277393 , それを使う # 277395 , SpiderMonkey 用 # 271004 )
Sun の人々はがんばってパッチを作っているけれど , できるなら汎用的なフック機構を作り , そこに DTrace のトレースを挿す方がクリーンだと思う .
Apache の mod_dtrace は module として dtrace を組み込んでいる .
PostgreSQL も " Generic Monitoring Framework " と銘打ち 間接マクロを挟んでいる .
( pg_trace.h : 単なるマクロにしては名前がごつすぎる気も...)
それにしても DTrace を使うのはけっこう敷居が高そうだ .
単純なプロファイラならリストを上から順に潰せばいいけれど , こちらはまず監視するトレースにあたりをつけないといけない.
逆にいうと素朴な計測ではみつけにくい問題を調べるための道具だと言える.
USENIX の記事も ACMQ の記事も , 発見の難しいプロセスをまたいた性能バグを いかに退治したかのケーススタディが載っている. とても面白い .
Sun のページ にはサンプルやチュートリアルが充実している .
最近では Ajax / Java アプリを DTrace で計測 なんて記事もある .
あっけにとられた .
Solaris 好きなら DTrace プログラミングという特殊技能を身につけるとかっこいいかも .
DTrace は言ってみれば OS 版アスペクト指向プログラミングだ .
ログ取りにしか使えないと揶揄された AOP だけれど , DTrace は最初からその目的に特化している .
様々なフックを用意し , 時にはコードを書き換え , あつめたデータを DSL で集計して性能バグを追いつめていく .
DTrace はここで紹介した以外にも色々な機能やアイデアが盛り込まれている.
テクノロジーとして見所が多い. 満足 .
そろそろ OS の話には疲れてきた .
最後に少し毛色の違うプロファイラを眺めてみよう , ということで ruby - prof に進みます .
ruby - prof は ruby 用のプロファイラ .
C 言語による拡張として実装されている .
OProfile も DTrace も動かせなかったけれど , これならマカーにも使えそう .
まず gprof 用に書いた C のサンプルを ruby に移植しよう .
def foo n ( 0 ... n ).inject(0 ) do |a , i| a + ( 0 .. n ).inject(0 ) { |b , j| b + i*j } end end def bar ( 0 ... 10 ) .inject (0 ) { |a , i| a + foo( 1000 ) } end def baz ( 0 ... 1000 ) .inject (0 ) { |a , i| a + foo( 10 ) } end bar baz
動かす :
$ ruby - prof hello.rb
結果 :
Thread ID : 202500 Total : 181.38 % self total self wait child calls name 63.09 180.45 114.43 0.00 66.02 22022 Range#each - 2 18.70 33.91 33.91 0.00 0.00 11155882 Fixnum # + 17.73 32.16 32.16 0.00 0.00 11143132 Fixnum #* 0.26 181.32 0.47 0.00 180.85 1012 Range#each - 1 0.11 180.65 0.20 0.00 180.45 22022 Enumerable #inject-2 0.04 0.08 0.08 0.00 0.00 23036 < Class :: Object >#allocate 0.04 0.07 0.07 0.00 0.00 10285 Bignum# + 0.02 181.37 0.04 0.00 181.33 1012 Object#foo ....
ruby - prof は C で書かれた計測部分と ruby で書かれた集計表示部分からなる .
C のコード ( ruby - prof.c ) は約 1600 行. 今回眺めたコードの中では抜群に小さい .
これでちゃんとプロファイルがとれるんだから面白いよね.
ruby - prof は計測のためにフックを使う .
フックは ruby コアが用意しており , rb_add_event_hook ( ) ( thread . c ) から登録する .
こんな都合のいい API があるとは ... なんとなく ruby の ChangeLog を確認 .
Wed Mar 16 22:03:15 2005 Shugo Maeda < shugo@ruby-lang.org > * eval.c ( rb_add_event_hook ) : new function to add a hook function for interpreter events .
Shugo Maeda さんは ruby - prof の開発者でもある ...
コアが汎用的なフックを用意し , 計測機構はプラグインとしてつくる. これは正しい姿だとおもう. ruby - prof 以外にも , たとえば rcov がこのフックを使っている .
ruby dtrace も同じ路線で書けそうだ .
( さがしてみると dtrace for ruby というのが見つかった .
でも容赦なく eval .c をパチっている . 悲しい...)
さて , gprof の量子化誤差を思いだそう .
ruby - prof に同じ問題は見られない .
正しく測れているかんじ .
% self total self wait child calls name ...
0.02 181.37 0.04 0.00 181.33 1012 Object#foo ... 0.00 178.98 0.00 0.00 178.98 1 Object#bar ...

0.00 2.40 0.00 0.00 2.40 1 Object#baz
実装をみればすぐ理由がわかる. ruby - prof は関数の出入口にあるフックで時間を測る .
だから関数全体の実行時間がわかる. 推測による誤差は入らない .
ruby - prof の C コードはプロファイラのアルゴリズムを理解するのにちょうどいい.
ruby 固有の部分は面倒だけれど , プロファイルのロジックは素直に書かれている .
データ構造を ruby 側に公開し , 整形は ruby で書くあたりもそれらしくて楽しめた .
まとめな ど
そんなわけで gprof , OProfile , DTrace , ruby - prof と 4 種類のプロファイラを眺め , いいかげん飽きました .
( ほんとは valgrind も見たかったけど挫折 ...)
まとめ :
プロファイルの仕組みにはタイマーで実行中のプログラムを観察するサンプル方式と , 何らかの方法でフックを用意するトレース方式がある.
gprof は両方 OProfile はサンプル方式中心 DTrace と ruby - prof はトレース方式中 心
OProfile や DTrace はシステム全体の負荷を測るため OS のカーネルに組込まれている データ加工のタイミング色々 : DTrace はカーネル内 , OProfile はカーネル外 負荷を減らす工夫色々 : パフォーマンスカウンタ , CPU 単位のバッファ , 投機的計測 拡張の工夫いろいろ : トレース機構のプラグイン , DSL
アプリケーションにも計測用のフックをつけると便利かも

The Future Of Biofuels Is Not In Corn
Corn - now used to produce 95 percent of U.S. ethanol and the only commercially viable ethanol feedstock prepared to capitalize on refinery subsidies in the Farm Bill - is the least sustainable biofuel feedstock of all raw materials commonly used .
by Staff Writers
London UK ( SPX ) Jul 20 , 2007
The future of biofuels is not in corn , says a new report released today by Food and Water Watch , the Network for New Energy Choices , and the Vermont Law School Institute for Energy and the Environment .
The corn ethanol refinery industry , the beneficiary of new renewable fuel targets in the proposed energy legislation as well as proposed loan guarantee subsidies in the 2007 Farm Bill , will not significantly offset U.S. fossil fuel consumption without unacceptable environmental and economic consequences .
" Rural communities wo n't benefit from the Farm Bill becoming a fuel bill .
In the long run , family farmers and the environment will be losers , while agribusiness , whose political contributions are fueling the ethanol frenzy , will become the winners , " said Food and Water Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter .
" Rising oil prices , energy security , and global warming concerns have led to today's ' go yellow ' hype over corn ethanol , " explained Scott Cullen , Senior Policy Advisor for the Network for New Energy Choices .
" But all biofuels are not equal .
Expansion of the corn ethanol industry will lead to more water and air pollution and soil erosion of America 's farm belt , while failing to significantly offset fossil fuel use or combat global warming . "
The report , The Rush to Ethanol : Not all BioFuels are Equal , is a comprehensive review of the literature on the environmental and economic implications of pinning our hopes on corn ethanol to reduce dependency on fossil fuels .
Report findings include the following :
Not all biofuels are equal .
Corn - now used to produce 95 percent of U.S. ethanol and the only commercially viable ethanol feedstock prepared to capitalize on refinery subsidies in the Farm Bill - is the least sustainable biofuel feedstock of all raw materials commonly used .
The capacity of corn ethanol to offset U.S. fossil fuel use is extremely limited .
Dedicating the entire U.S. corn crop to ethanol production would only offset 15 percent of gasoline demand .
Conversely , modest increases in auto fuel efficiency standards of even one mile per gallon for all cars and light trucks , such as those passed by the Senate last month could cut petroleum consumption by more than all alternative fuels and replacement fuels combined .
Corn ethanol is the wrong biofuel for combating global warming .
The most favorable estimates show that corn ethanol could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent to 28 percent , while cellulosic ethanol is estimated to offer a reduction of 87 percent compared to gasoline .
Ethanol is not the solution to revitalizing rural America .
While higher commodity prices and cooperatively owned ethanol refineries could be a boon to independent farmers , unregulated ethanol industry growth will further concentrate agribusiness , threatening the livelihood of rural communities .
" As long as we spend more on subsidizing energy suppliers than we do on investments in energy efficiency , we are on a path to pain .
We are already subsidizing corn-ethanol with more money than we spend on high - mileage cars or on quality mass - transit .
That 's good for some companies and some politicians , but it 's bad for our nation and our world . , " said Michael Dworkin , of the Vermont Law School Institute for Energy and the Environment
Both the farm and energy legislation being debated in Congress contain provisions that will set biofuels policy for years to come .
While the politicians promise that America will be driving on switchgrass - based ethanol instead of gasoline in the next decade , the majority of the subsidies will go to corn - based ethanol refiners in the near term .
The groups made recommendations on U.S. biofuels policy including the following proposed reforms to ethanol provisions of the 2007 Farm Bill :
Biofuels promotion policies should be tied to a sustainable fuel standard that ensures best management practices of land , water , and soil use , and other measures to reduce impacts on wildlife and natural ecosystems .
Any ethanol funding in the U.S. Farm Bill should focus on research and development of cellulosic ethanol .
There is sufficient private investment in corn ethanol development and refining already .
Because cellulosic ethanol is not ready for market , any subsidies for refining in this year 's bill will only lock U.S. ethanol production even more tightly to corn .
No coal - fired ethanol refineries should be eligible for federal subsidies .
Instead , small scale ethanol refineries should be encouraged to use lignin , a cellulosic byproduct , as fuel .
Loan guarantees for refineries should be directed to locally owned facilities that benefit farmers and rural communities .
The farm bill should include measures similar to those in place in Minnesota to ensure that subsidies are only provided to refinery operations that are farmer majority - owned .

BBC News , Bolivia
It seems perverse that one of the main roads out of one of the highest cities on Earth should actually climb as it leaves town .
" Every year it is estimated 200 to 300 people die on a stretch of road less than 50 miles long . "
Enlarge Image
But climb it does - just short of a lung - sapping five kilometres ( three miles ) above sea level , where even the internal combustion engine is forced to toil and splutter .
Then it pauses for a while on the snow - flecked crest of the Andes before pitching - like a giant white knuckle ride - into the abyss .
The road from Bolivia 's main city , La Paz , to a region known as the Yungas was built by Paraguayan prisoners of war back in the 1930s .
Many of them perished in the effort .
Now it is mainly Bolivians who die on the road - in their thousands .
In 1995 , the Inter American Development Bank christened it the most dangerous road in the world .
And , as you start your descent , and your driver whispers a prayer , you begin to see why .
The bird 's eye view is on the left , on the front seat passenger 's side , where the Earth itself seems to open up .
Crosses at the roadside mark the locations of fatal accidents .
On the driver 's side there is a sheer rock wall rising to the heavens .
There is no margin of error .
The road itself is barely three metres wide .
That is if you can call it a road .
After the initial stretch to the top of the mountain it is just dirt track .
And yet - incredibly - it is a major route for trucks and buses .
Hairpin bends
Drivers stop to pour libations of beer into the earth - to beseech the goddess Pachamama for safe passage .
Then , chewing coca leaves to keep themselves awake , they are off at break - neck speeds in vehicles which should not be on any road , let alone this one .
Perched on hairpin bends over dizzying precipices , crosses and stone cairns mark the places where travellers ' prayers went unheeded .
Where , for someone - the road ended .
But even these stark warnings are all too often ignored .
As first one - and then a second impatient motorist - overtook our car on the ravine side of the road , my own driver - who hardly ever spoke a word and only then in his native Aymara - intoned loudly , eerily and in perfect English ... " You will die . "
It is not a rash prediction to make .
Extreme weather conditions make driving more hazardous .
It is the end of the dry season in Bolivia .
Soon the rains will come - cascading down the walls of the chasm .
Huge waterfalls will drench the road - turning its surface to slime .
Then will come those heart - stopping moments when wheels skid and brakes fail to grip .
There are stories told of truckers too tired - or too afraid - to continue , who pull over for the night , hoping to see out an Andean storm .
But they have parked too close to the edge .
And as they sleep in their cabs , the road is washed away around them .
This is not the place to drop off .
Cliff edge
But for now the road is a ribbon of dust .
Every vehicle passing along it churns up a sandstorm in its wake .
Choking , blinding clouds obscure the way ahead .
Around one hairpin , a cloud of debris was beginning to clear .
Further down the road we passed a spot where a set of fresh tyre tracks headed out into the void
It seemed at first that they had got off to stretch their legs , while their driver argued with another vehicle coming in the other direction about who should give way .
( Reversing is not something you undertake lightly on a cliff edge . )
It transpired instead though , that the bus driver was dying .
Blinded by the dust , he had run into the back of a truck .
The bus 's steering column had gone through him - severing his legs .
There was nothing anyone could do .
Mobile phones do not work here .
In any case , who would you call ?
There are no emergency services .
And no way of getting help through , even if any were to be found .
The bus driver bled to death .
We edged past the crumpled bus , and headed on .
Further down the road we passed a spot where a set of fresh tyre tracks headed out into the void .
They told their own story .
High in the Andes , they are building a new road .
A by - pass , to replace the old one .
But this is Bolivia , and already it has been 20 years in the making .
Who knows when it will be complete ?
Until it is , people will have to continue offering up their prayers , and taking their lives in their hands on the most dangerous road in the world .

Foreign intelligence services did not have full access to American intelligence .
But some had dissenting opinions that were ignored or not shown to top American officials .
Congress had nothing close to the president 's access to intelligence .
The National Intelligence Estimate presented to Congress a few days before the vote on war was sanitized to remove dissent and make conjecture seem like fact .
It 's hard to imagine what Mr. Bush means when he says everyone reached the same conclusion .
There was indeed a widespread belief that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons .
But Mr. Clinton looked at the data and concluded that inspections and pressure were working -- an view we now know was accurate .
France , Russia and Germany said war was not justified .
Even Britain admitted later that there had been no new evidence about Iraq , just new politics .
The administration had little company in saying that Iraq was actively trying to build a nuclear weapon .
The evidence for this claim was a dubious report about an attempt in 1999 to buy uranium from Niger , later shown to be false , and the infamous aluminum tubes story .
That was dismissed at the time by analysts with real expertise .
The Bush administration was also alone in making the absurd claim that Iraq was in league with Al Qaeda and somehow connected to the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
That was based on two false tales .
One was the supposed trip to Prague by Mohamed Atta , a report that was disputed before the war and came from an unreliable drunk .
The other was that Iraq trained Qaeda members in the use of chemical and biological weapons .
Before the war , the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that this was a deliberate fabrication by an informer .
Mr. Bush has said in recent days that the first phase of the Senate Intelligence Committee 's investigation on Iraq found no evidence of political pressure to change the intelligence .
That is true only in the very narrow way the Republicans on the committee insisted on defining pressure : as direct pressure from senior officials to change intelligence .
Instead , the Bush administration made what it wanted to hear crystal clear and kept sending reports back to be redone until it got those answers .
NOVEMBER 7-- An
Ohio family is suing Greyhound Lines , claiming that they were driving behind one of the company 's buses when the vehicle discharged its latrine , covering them and their car with a fetid stew of human waste , toilet paper , and chemicals .
In a Court of Common Pleas lawsuit , Robert and Angela Stokes charge that they were driving last May ( Mother 's Day , to be exact ) on I - 75 in Toledo when ' Greyhound Bus No. 6426 ' suddenly 'emptied the contents of its latrine . '
The Stokes , who were traveling with their three children , claim that they and their 2002 Ford Explorer were covered with ' human urine , human feces , toilet paper , other waste products ' and a liquid toilet chemical known as F - 104 Inca Gold .
Along with destroying their car , the Stokes contend that the bus discharge ruined their clothes and caused them to incur about $ 10,000 in medical bills .
The complaint , an excerpt of which you 'll find below , seeks at least $ 300,000 in total damages for the five family members .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani came under attack on Friday from Democratic rival John Edwards for saying he spent as much time if not more at the site of New York ’s destroyed World Trade Center than rescue workers .
Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards speaks at the Visible Vote '08 Presidential Forum sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and broadcast on the Logo Network in Hollywood August 9 , 2007 .

The clash highlighted the continued importance of the September 11 attacks to U.S. presidential politics as Giuliani tries to use his record as former New York City mayor to help him get into the White House .
The group 9 - 11 Families , which represents some of those rescue workers , demanded an apology , saying , “ Rudy Giuliani has insulted all September 11 first responders , family groups and especially those of us who are battling life - threatening illnesses with his delusional statement . ”
In a visit to Cincinnati on Thursday , Giuliani told reporters that no one did more for firefighters killed in the attacks and their families than he did and that he raised millions on their behalf .
“ Every single penny of the $ 227 million went to the families , ” Giuliani said .
“ This is not a mayor or governor or president who was sitting in an ivory tower . ”
“ I was at Ground Zero as often , if not more , than most of the workers , ” he said .
The Edwards campaign issued a statement from its national chairman , former Michigan Democratic Rep. David Bonior , who said , “ Evidently , Rudy Giuliani has taken a break from reality . ”
“ It is outrageous for Giuliani to suggest , in any way , shape or form that he did more at Ground Zero or spent more time there than the brave first responders who worked tirelessly around the clock for many months during the rescue and recovery operation , ” Bonior said .
Thousands of rescue workers who combed through the debris of the collapsed World Trade Center towers have developed health problems from breathing in the dust and fumes from the buildings .
Giuliani admitted on Friday in an interview with talk radio host Mike Gallagher , “ I probably could have said it better . ”
“ What I was trying to say yesterday is that I empathize with them because I feel like I have that same risk , ” Giuliani said .
He said he was not suggesting he was competing with the rescuers , while admitting it came across that way .
“ Gosh almighty , I was there often enough , even though they were there , people there more and people there less , but I was there often enough so that every health consequence that people have suffered , I could also be suffering , ” he said .
Giuliani ’s communications director , Katie Levinson , lashed out at the Edwards camp for its attack .
“ For John Edwards to lecture Rudy Giuliani about September 11 is laughable at best .
This is , after all , the same guy who thinks the ‘ war on terror ’ is simply a bumper sticker , ” she said .
A thousand and one people out there in the world are trying their hardest to convince you they have a silver bullet that will prevent , slow or cover up aspects of degenerative aging .
From the perspective of the radical life extension that will be possible in the years ahead , none of these folk are selling anything worth a damn .
Sure , there are a few modestly effective ways to cover up some outward - facing results of age - related damage .
But why spend your resources there when ( a ) everyone knows what lies underneath anyway , and ( b ) you could be helping progress towards medical technology that would actually repair that same age - related damage ?
Sure , some modern therapies are fairly promising when it comes to patching up some of the hundreds or thousands of age - related conditions that result from accumulated cellular damage .
But the development of new patches and the patching process is always too slow , too late , too expensive - and it fails all too soon anyway , because the underlying causes were not tackled .
Present approaches are wonderfully better than nothing for those who suffer , but are as nothing in comparison to the methods and medical technologies that could blossom in the near future .
Sure , calorie restriction and a number of related lifestyle choices will reduce the rate at which you accumulate cellular damage - thereby extending your healthy life span and greatly reducing your risk and cost of suffering common age - related disease .
If you 're smart , you 'll make use of these strategies ... but you 'll be just as dead in the end if we do n't progress far further in medicine .
The point which often goes undiscussed by the CR folks , most biogerontologists , longevity gene fans ( including people such as Sinclair and Guarente who are really studying the mechanisms by which CR works ) , centenarian researchers , most " anti-aging " physicians , etc. is that with these approaches the animals ( and people ) WILL STILL AGE and WILL STILL DIE !
This approach does nothing but slow down the rate of aging -- it does not stop it or reverse it .
The sensible approach to what little benefit we can gain for health and life span today is illustrated well , I think , in this post from Eric Boyd :
I need to carefully consider how long I figure I need to live in order to benefit from SENS type interventions .
I figure that without interventions , I should be healthy up to about age 70 , plus maybe 10 more years in an increasing frail state .
This gives me 40 years of further progress in medicine .
Assuming we do n't get started on SENS ( i.e. addressing the causes of aging via an engineering approach ) for another 5 years or so , that gives me 35 years of progress before I am ' desperate ' .
I would like not to have to take the risks and expenses of being a first - generation - treatment taker , which likely means that I have to lag state - of - the - art by 10 years to feel comfortable , and that means only 25 years of progress .
That is not enough - given what I know about even fairly simple things like drug development and testing , I expect that real anti-aging interventions will take decades to develop , so 25 years will just be the beginning of results .
CR could theoretically add 10 to 20 years of extra vitality of my life , which is more than enough to make a substantial difference .
For this reason I will be implementing a system over the next few years
In other words , you are not the cricket grasping at the now .
Rather , you are the ant who plans ahead .
We are close to real , working anti-aging medicine , after all - with the right level of public support and investment in research .
It all brings to mind nothing quite so much as the fable of the lazy cricket and the industrious ant - although this may be somewhat unfair on the crickets in this case .
My point is this : if you find yourself playing the role of the cricket , looking for necessities at the last minute in any aspect of life , then you are likely out of luck .
Nothing in this world happens without preparation , hard work and a sound recognition of what the future will bring .
The winter of age - related degeneration approaches for us all - indeed , we have a very good idea as to when it will arrive .
We cannot wait until aging hurts and incapacitates us to search for medicines that will repair the damage to our bodies and enable us to live longer , healthier , active lives .
If we wait , if we laze rather than work to ensure that the right research is funded , then it will be too late in the decades ahead .
We will suffer , become crippled , and die .
Do you save for your retirement ?
I 'm sure you do if you 're of working age .
If you can look that far ahead for financial matters , why are you not also investing a similar level of resources to ensure that you will not be crippled by age - related diseases ?
Be an ant .
Do n't be a cricket .
A silver bullet for degenerative aging will exist one day - if we all pull our weight and help to make it happen .
It will take the the form of multiple therapies , repair and preventation technologies for different modes of age - related damage .
It will be comparatively limited and expensive at first , but then improve rapidly in reliability and cost , as do all new medical technologies .
Will the first meaningful anti-aging technologies arrive within our lifetime ?
We - all of us alive today - will determine the answer to that question through our actions and choices .
Be an ant , not a cricket .
Technorati tags : activism , anti-aging , health , life extension
The reason for this throbbing tsunami of joy ?
The Rimbutt 2000 Harry Potter Broom — a four - foot long vibrating stick hand - crafted from solid beechwood — which promises to give Harry Potter fans ' the ride of your life . '
Each Harry Potter broom is assembled by highly - trained Taiwanese craftspersons in state - of - the - art lean to sheds somewhere in Guatemala under the strict supervision of the manufacturers — the acclaimed corporation of Strasburg , Pennsylvania .
One mother , who was clearly not paying attention when some bloke dumped his load in her love tunnel after a few too many Bacardi Breezers , told breathlessly : " My daughter is a huge Harry Potter fan , and simply adores Quiddich , but I was a bit reluctant to buy her this toy broom as she 's nearly fifteen and I was afraid she would think it was a bit childish , but she just loves it !
Even my daughter 's older friend , who ’s seventeen , enjoys playing with her new Harry Potter broom .
Now there 's never less than a dozen squealing kids locked in my daughter 's bedroom playing together for hours with that thing ! "
Unlike previous Harry Potter broom replicas which failed to capture the imagination of female movie fans , the Rimbutt 2000 not only vibrates along its entire length , which is thoughtfully ' grooved for easy riding ' , but has a ' generously sized ' three inch diameter handle that rotates to allow kids to experience ' the authentic sensation of flight just like their favourite Quiddich team . '
A feature prized by one delighted sixteen - year - old girl who told us that her broom had taken her ' to the moon ' on several occasions — or she may have meant Uranus .
Our researcher was a little puzzled by the lubrication nozzles built into the Harry Potter broom until a helpful spokestypeperson for the company assured her they were a ' safety feature ' included to ' minimize soreness after extended ' flights . '
Camilla Mountjoy , thirty - eight , was quick to recognise the dangers of the new Harry Potter broom .
" Our daughter has been badgering us for months to buy her this toy .
So even though it has no educational value whatsoever in the end I gave in just to keep her quiet .
Well , it certainly did that because she shot off to her bedroom with it and we did n't see her for the rest of the day !
It was n't until I went in to say goodnight and found her still riding it that I realized why she 'd been so quiet .
A four foot vibrating broom with a rotating handle would make anyone think they were flying !
Lucy was a bit disappointed when we took the batteries out but as a responsible parent one has to set an example to one 's kids .
I mean she was actually masturbating with that thing ! "
The pretty , fourteen - year - old told a different story when we caught up with her outside her .
" At first I was puzzled why my Harry Potter broom was always sticky after mummy had tidied my bedroom .
But then I caught her riding it in the kitchen with the batteries in !
It 's so unfair , " pouted the tearful teen .
" The broom was my birthday present but now it 's so yucky all the bristles have gone stiff . "
Lucy is not the only disappointed teenager who is finding it hard to keep a grip on the popular toy .
The Rimbutt 2000 Harry Potter broom is proving such a hit with some parents that manufacturers have been unable to keep up with demand , resulting in a thriving trade in ' pre - enjoyed ' brooms on Ebay , where the sticky toys are changing hands — or possibly thighs — for as much as ninety pounds each .
Unsurprisingly , , have been quick to pounce on the controversial Harry Potter broom , or in some cases , grasp them firmly between their quivering buttocks — as yet another example of the moral decay which has driven to ape American teens by donning baseball caps , exposing their bellies and giving blow jobs to complete strangers in exchange for a packet of Lambert & Butler and a bottle of sweet cider .
The Reverend Percy Pantz — a charismatic
Tele - evangelist from Tennessee who advocates women should wear the burqa , or the as angry women have dubbed it — is typical of those who are trying to get the Rimbutt 2000 Harry Potter broom withdrawn from sale .
" Any American child that has been given one of these Satanic sex toys is riding straight to Hell on a slippery serpent of sin !
This four - foot rod of wickedness with vibrating bristles undermines the blessings of and self - flagellation with nettles !
For the Love of God !
If you 've got this devil in your house , at least remove the batteries !
These filthy British sluts will do anything to corrupt our young people with their sinful , pagan ways .
Why , only the other day I saw a thirteen - year - old British girl pleasuring herself with her on that Internet thang . "
But many British mums do n't agree .
" Nothing little girls do is dirty , unless you have a dirty mind , ’ snapped professional masseuse , Glenda Scutbucket , turning a knob on a yellow plastic duck 's tail to make the toy vibrate .
" My ten - year - old son loves to play with this duck in the bath .
It 's the only way I can get him to wash properly between his legs .
It 's insane to try to ban this harmless novelty just because some kids might use it as a sex toy .
You might as well ban little girls sliding down banisters or riding ponies . "
Sharon Gussett , a single mother of six from Chingford , in Essex — told she had confiscated her thirteen - year - old daughter 's Harry Potter broom within minutes of its arrival .
" When I opened Jade 's bedroom door I was shocked to see her sprawled on her bed , with her thighs wrapped around a vibrating broom and her around her ankles .
I mean , I do n't mind her giving her but those vibrating bristles could do her little pussy a serious mischief . "
Pausing only to swig from a bottle of vodka , puff on a fag and apply a generous helping of lube to the Harry Potter Rimbutt 2000 broom sandwiched between her shaking thighs —
Ms Gusset gushed on : " Until that toy arrived , I had no idea you could get so much pleasure from shoving a huge , throbbing broom handle up your furry front bottom .
Well , as you can imagine , after I saw what it did to Jade , I nicked it off her double quick and locked myself in my bedroom for three hours with half a bottle of sweet cider , knickers down and on the fucking job .
I must have had forty - three orgasms — no wait , forty - four — before the batteries gave out . "
It seems that even grandmothers are not immune to the Harry Potter magic as we discovered when we spoke to one young teen who finally tracked down her missing broom after weeks of fruitless searching .
" I heard this weird buzzing sound coming from the cellar and when I went down to investigate I found grandma with her bloomers around her ankles , sitting on the washing machine with my Harry Potter broom between her legs , going ' Wheeee ! "
" I enjoy riding that broom just as much as my twelve - year - old granddaughter , " chuckled sixty - eight - year - old Shirley Shufflebotham , " and she 's not getting it back !
The vibrations , along with the groaning sounds make for a truly magical journey !
It 's a really durable toy , unlike my tight - fisted daughter - in - law thinks I do n't know she keeps in her knicker drawer ! "
When we put the concerns of the Reverend Pantz and outraged parents to the manufacturers , Ms Diane Zimmerman of Amish Adult Stores told us : " We 're simply helping young women to become more comfortable with their own bodies .
Hopefully this will encourage more physical jerks — um , fitness and self - confidence amongst young teens .
Nowhere in our sales literature does it say that our Harry Potter replica broom is .
The Rimbutt 2000 is all about healthy action and stimulation . "
Their defensive attitude was shared by acclaimed author , J K Rowling , who took time out from working on her new manuscript of Harry Potter and Hermione 's Magical Pussy to speak exclusively to from atop a huge mountain of cash .
" It 's been nearly ten years since I wrote The Philosopher 's Stone .
Harry 's fans are sixteen now and like him , they 've moved on from playing with dollies and train sets .
At least this new Harry Potter broom toy will stop the randy little sods smoking crack and having unprotected sex behind bus shelters . "
Even if the controversial Harry Potter broom is withdrawn from stores , the millions of kids who are hooked on his wizardry wo n't go short of new toys to play with , as sixteen - year - old twin sisters , Zoe and Kim , were eager to explain .
" The new Harry Potter vibrating chess set is totally wicked , " cooed Zoe , as she wriggled out of her black lace thong .
" Although the pieces are plastic and do n't look much like anyone at Hogwarts , they have these great ridges and knobbly bits , and they 're a decent size — knights and bishops are like , over six inches high ! "
" Yeah , " agreed Kim , sucking happily on the Black Queen before accidentally dropping it between her sister 's widespread thighs .

Common wisdom : Condoms , for all their necessity , inhibit men's sexual pleasure .
Common bullshit : Wearing a condom makes reaching orgasm impossible for men , and ruins sex .
The reason is because the sheath stops men from having the intimate skin - to - skin contact which is imperative for pleasure .
More common bullshit :
If you buy the condoms with ribs and dots and swizzles , your lady will really get off because your mighty sword is so fantastically tricked out .
The Honest - to - Dick Truth :
The main reason condoms screw up male pleasure is because — read this carefully :
" tight - fitting condoms bind the glans penis , resulting in restricted sensitivity and loss of stimulation during coitus . "
I 'm quoting from a current patent fight about condom designs , but their explanation is perfect .
The main distress men have with condom use is the friction element going awry .
Furthermore , the color or texture of a condom has always made ZERO difference to women , because — news flash — we can't feel the damn thing in the first place .
The vaginal walls do not have sensitive nerve endings .
We have no idea which bloody condom your 're wearing , and we just pray you have the damn thing secured .
If we could " feel " the texture of your condom ... holy cow , every woman would die instantly in childbirth , if we had that kind of vagina sensitivity .
This is the same reason why the ever - popular bullshit about " vaginal orgasms " is also such a crock .
At the height of the AIDS epidemic , a new condom shape emerged called The Pleasure Plus , that was designed to make men feel pleasure and comfort by changing the silouette of the head .
It looks like the letter " P. "
It does n't fit tightly on the head of your cock at all — it 's more like having an extra foreskin !
I immediately tried it out with my male lovers , and they were shocked .
A condom that actually feels different , that honestly affects your arousal and orgasm in a juicy way ? — it did n't seem possible .
Condom marketers had been lying for SO LONG , appealing to various macho vanities , but no one had ever made something that truly affected a man 's sexual PLEASURE .
Chalk another one up to the puritans .
The problem with the Pleasure Plus was that it went in and out of distribution .
Today , in Salon.com , Andrew Leonard has uncovered the story of the Indian inventor who created the Pleasure Plus , ( and subsequently two other innovative designs ) which has led to a condom war between the companies fighting over his various patents .
Andrew writes :
" Sex expert Susie Bright , the host of " In Bed With Susie Bright " on Audible.com , and a longtime commentator on all things sexual , had never heard of Reddy [ the inventor ] .
But she squeals with delight when told that he had invented the Pleasure Plus .
" I used to hoard them the way Elaine hoarded the Today sponge on Seinfeld , she recalls .
" It was the only condom that offered any physical difference whatsoever .
I 've always said , forget the ribs and colors and all that bullshit .
If the point is sensitivity and feeling good , the Pleasure Plus is the only alternative . "
Adam Glickman , whose retail store Condomania was the first to sell the Pleasure Plus , recalls Reddy as " a man deeply concerned about condom effectiveness . "
At the time , Glickman says , " what was so refreshing and different about him was that he was n't defining effectiveness in terms of safety and reliability , he was defining it in terms of acceptability and pleasure .
No one had really defined condom performance so totally under those terms before him . "
But despite the great reviews , the Pleasure Plus was hard to find .
In fact , almost as soon as it became popular , it disappeared .
" It was a big mystery , " Bright says .
" We heard all kinds of rumors .
It was there and then it was gone . "
It turns out the original business went bankrupt .
Then Mr. Reddy came out with two other designs that two other companies are marketing , including Trojan , who calls theirs the " Twisted Pleasure . "
Once Trojan came out with their Reddy - miracle , of course it wiped out the competitive ability of the first two smaller companies ....
Trojan is often the only label represented at major drug stores .
This is why there 's a lawsuit extravaganza in progress .
I have not tried out the " Inspiral " or the " Twisted Pleasure , " the children of the original PP .
Have you ?
It 's still a variation of the Pouch - Within - A - Pouch design .
I think , from the looks of it , I like the original the best , but I 'm hardly the one to decide .
I like the simplicity ; I do n't need the thing to look like a roller coaster ride .
But men should be the ones to speak up and say what feels the best .
I resent the notion that you have to sell this thing with a " kinky " name , or imply that it 's for party animals .
Goddammit , this design should be the basic condom profile for every single rubber made !
The thing that Andrew told me — and explains in his article — is that all those world health and family - planning organizations that promote birth control around the world are not recommending these condoms because the powers - that - be think they 're a hedonistic frill .
The world of STD - prevention is SO FUCKED UP .
Condoms should be made as easy , pleasureable , and cost - free as possible , distributed en masse to men the world over .
Young men should be given a bagful in the 6th grade and told to go home and masturbate with them until they get as smooth and suave as those soldiers who clean their guns with a blindfold on .
Women should be told point blank that any guy who tells you he can't get off with a condom is either lying , or has never given it so much as a kindergarten try .
Sure , when you initially try one on , you feel like a clumsy fool .
We all felt this way when we first kissed , or tried to have sex , and dealt with our profound awkwardness .
Getting your braces caught together is a big limp provocation too , but you do n't see people railing against orthodontics for ruining their sex life !
There 's all kinds of hassles that go into sexual initiation , but we strive for grace because we are MOTIVATED .
And condoms need to be part of that motivation , because frankly , this barrier method of preventing pregnancy and disease is excellent .
There are no side effects .
It just does the job .
The day I got off the Pill and onto condoms is one of the best health decisions of my life .
Meeting men who know how to use them is an aphrodisiac in itself .
I advise young men who write me , craving the secret to getting laid , to start conversations about how great they think condoms are , how easy they are to use , how relaxing it is to not have to worry about anything , and let your partner just get into sex without fear .
Then just start taking names and numbers !
I 'm very glad Andrew wrote this story .
I 'm also pleased to turn you onto Condomania , which has a great web site as well as store in San Francisco .
I found this great animated condom fuck film on their web site , which will provide the perfect epilogue to this post !
Advice for New Managers on How to Avoid Harwell ’s Laws
In 2004 I wrote a tongue - in - cheek essay called “ Harwell ’s Unfortunate Laws of Human Organizational Behavior . ”
I put it on my web site , but I just sent the link to a few close friends .
Frankly , I thought the content of the essay was too different from my normal , more up - beat type of article .
But I was looking at the “ Harwell ’s Laws ” essay a few weeks ago , and it struck me that there ’s a positive statement that can be made from every negative .
So I ’ve decided to repeat the 10 laws here , together with the advice that I would offer based on each of the laws .
Law # 1 : People always try to use their experience even if it does n’t apply to the current situation .
See my newsletter article , “ Do n’t Get Stuck in a Learning Stage . ”
It describes how people who are new to a situation – for example , first - time managers – do n’t know what they do n’t know .
As a result , they make the incorrect assumption that their prior experience must apply to the current situation , even when it does n’t .
There are ways to avoid this problem , but they chiefly depend on having a good mentor who can help you differentiate between things you know and things you do n’t .
It also takes an open mind , which of course is difficult to achieve in itself , especially under the pressure of a new management job .
Law # 2 : If someone is brought in as the new manager of an organization , then the new manager will feel obligated to change the organization .
Otherwise , what value is the manager contributing ?
This again gets back to the “ do n’t know what they do n’t know ” situation .
If you ever jumped rope as a child with other children holding the rope , then you know that you have to get into the rhythm of the rope before you jump in ; otherwise you ’ll just get all tangled up .
The same thing applies to a new manager of an organization : you have to get a sense of the “ rhythm ” of the organization before you understand it enough to make changes .
Yes , you want to make the organization better , but it helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the organization – and of the people in the organization – before you start making improvements .
To use a different analogy , if you ’re going to tear down some of the walls in a building , it helps to know which ones are structural supports before you start demolition .
Otherwise the whole building may come down around you .
Some of the processes , attitudes , people and relationships in an organization are just as much structural supports as a supporting wall .
Change them only after you have put alternative supports in place .
Law # 3 : If a manager does n’t know how to improve an organization , then he / she will change it to look like the last organization that he / she remembers .
In Chapter 3 of my book , Boiling the IT Frog , I say that “ It ’s human nature to want to minimize change , and if [ you ’re ] used to working with a product , and if [ you ’ve ] been successful with the product in the past , then [ you ’re ] going to want to work with it again . ”
The same thing applies to processes : you want to use the same processes that you ’ve used in the past because you ’re used to them .
What you might forget , however , is that there ’s just one of you , and there are lots of employees who are already used to doing things the way they ’re doing them now .
So if you ’re sure that changing things will provide a benefit , then go ahead .
But do n’t make changes just because you ’re used to things working a certain way ; you ’ll waste your time , the time of your employees , and the limited credibility you get as a new manager .
Law # 4 : Either things in an organization will get better or things will get worse .
If things get better , then the manager will be rewarded , regardless of whether the manager is responsible for the improvement .
If things get worse , then the manager will move on to another organization to try again .
If this is true in your company then it ’s not the fault of the new manager – it ’s the fault of the manager ’s manager .
Do n’t reward people based on organizational improvement without understanding whether the person being rewarded actually caused the improvement .
You might have to do a little digging to find out , but it will be time well spent .
And if the reward you ’re giving the “ successful ” manager is a promotion , then you need to consider the fit of the potential manager for the new position into which he / she is being promoted .
Managing engineers does n’t quality someone to manage customer service people ; managing clerical people does n’t qualify someone to manage engineers .
Look at the specific needs of the new management role , and then take a hard look at whether those needs can be met by the prospective manager .
If there ’s a gap , then are you prepared to help the new manager attain the skills necessary to close the gap ?
Law # 5 : Sometimes things in an organization get a little better before they get a lot worse .
If the manager is lucky , then he / she will be promoted to a better job before things start to get worse .
Of course , then the cycle will start all over again .
See my comments on Law # 4 .
This is what happens when you promote based on organizational success without determining whether the manager of the organization had anything to do with that success .
It ’s also what happens when you declare victory prematurely ; it sometimes takes a while to determine whether an initially positive change will continue to be positive .
Law # 6 : Rarely , a new manager will actually ask the employees what should be improved .
If the employees understand how their organization contributes to the company ’s overall performance , then they will undoubtedly provide a better answer than the manager ’s experience .
There are two statements included in this law .
First , there ’s the statement that employees often know what can be improved in an organization .
This is almost always true , and I talk about it in my newsletter article , “ Hidden Consultants within your Organization . ”
Second , there ’s the statement that new managers will rarely ask employees what should be improved , and I explain why in that same newsletter article .
I wo n’t repeat these lessons in this month ’s newsletter article , but here ’s the bottom line : listen to your employees , but put their advice into perspective .
Law # 7 : Sometimes the manager will hire a consultant .
The consultant will then ask the employees what should be improved , and the result will be put into a PowerPoint® presentation , then ignored by the manager .
Smart consultants know how valuable a resource the employees of an organization are .
The consultants do a lot of listening , and then they filter the things they ’ve heard based on their prior experience ( see Law # 1 ) .
Nevertheless , much of the employee advice will find its way into the consultant ’s recommendation , and thus into a PowerPoint presentation to management .
Alas , the manager will then proceed to filter the consultant ’s recommendation based on his / her own experience , thus gutting the key aspects of the consultant recommendation .
Realistically – and very unfortunately – most consultants are hired not to provide new recommendations , but to legitimize the actions that the manager already wants to take .
That ’s why the consultant ( and employee ) recommendations are so often ignored .
But it does n’t have to be this way , and as a new manager you are in a position to actually listen to employee and consultant recommendations .
If you use those recommendations , then you ’ll be pleasantly surprised at how much the recommendations can help , and you ’ll be amazed at the morale boost you ’ll get from employees who know that you listen .
Law # 8 : Good organizations will continue to get better until someone in higher management decides they ’re not good enough .
Then they ’ll get worse .
When you ’re on a path toward improvement , it ’s easy to get impatient and try to speed things up .
But there are many hazards in doing so , not the least of which is that you often do n’t really understand why things are getting better .
You might think that the improvement is due to a particular change you ’ve made , when in fact the improvement might be caused by other factors entirely , like improved interaction among employees or a better sense of pride in the work .
If you pick the wrong factor and attempt to speed it up , then you ’re likely to sabotage the progress you ’ve made .
Patience is rare in today ’s organizations , but it ’s extremely important when coping with complex organizational change .
Law # 9 : Bad organizations will continue to get worse until a new manager tries an idea which should have been obvious from the beginning .
Actually , there is no such thing as a “ bad organization ” – there are only organizations which are n’t focused on the right things .
Most people in an organization know what the right things are ( for example , customer satisfaction or truly enjoying the work ) , but most managers are distracted from the right things by instructions from higher up in the chain of command .
When a manager finally sees the light and realizes ( maybe by talking to employees or customers ) what the right things are , and when the manager redirects the organization to do those right things , then the organization will be able to turn its performance around .
Law # 10 :
If a company contains multiple similar organizations , then they will always be compared , but the true differences will not be discovered .
The good organizations will get worse as a result of the comparison , and the bad organizations will get worse as well .
It ’s human nature to compare things , and in business we like to compare things using numbers .
“ XYZ organization is more profitable , more productive , [ pick your own numeric superlative ] than ABC organization . ”
We think we know what we ’re talking about , but we have to be very careful when we try to explain why one organization has a better numeric score than another .
That ’s the first mistake we typically make : we jump to the conclusion that the difference between XYZ and ABC can be attributed to a certain factor .
Then we make a second mistake : we assume that there is a cause and effect relationship between that factor and the numeric performance .
As a result we try to change this factor in organization ABC and assume that the numeric performance of ABC will improve .
Now the people in organization XYZ begin to believe that this magical factor is the cause of their success .
They begin to put an inappropriate emphasis on the factor in the hope of making things even better , and their performance begins to degrade .
Maybe they were doing things “ right ” before , but now they ’re caught up in the psychological game of thinking they know how to improve , and because they ’re focusing on improvement instead of on the “ right things ” ( see my comments on Law # 9 ) , XYZ ’s performance gets worse .
Meanwhile , the people in organization ABC try to improve their performance by changing the identified factor .
But however they were doing before , their new emphasis on this factor is likely to distract them from the “ right things ” and the result is likely to be poorer performance for ABC .
You might be able to make temporary improvements in an organization by focusing on some factor that ’s not directly related to the end goal of the organization , but improving an organization is like improving your golf or tennis game : you have to integrate all of the factors into a single focus on the result , and not be distracted by a short - term focus on contributing factors like your backswing , your stance or your follow - through .
Conclusion
I wrote the ten laws to point out some patterns in the way managers and organizations relate .
The laws are funny , but in a Dilbert sort of way ; there ’s an edge to the humor because we all see situations in our own lives where these laws hold true .
Humor is good because it helps us address problem areas without being embarrassed ; we can learn from humor by trying to avoid situations where our actions would be seen as a joke .
Laugh all you want at my 10 Unfortunate Laws – just try to make sure the joke is not on you .

It is compatible with the EU legislation that Member States exclude the personal data communication related to the internet traffic when this is requested in order to allow the prosecution of violations of the royalties in civil cases .
— Conclusion of European Court of justice
According the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) , the supreme court of European Union , the EU laws do not oblige ISPs to hand over personal data of people suspected of illegal sharing of copyrighted materials over the net .
The ECJ has been asked for a preliminary ruling on question " Does Community law ... permit Member States to limit the duty of operators of electronic communications networks and services , providers of telecommunications network access and providers of data storage services to retain and make available connection and traffic information generated during the supply of an information society service to where it is required in connection with a criminal investigation or the need to protect public safety and national defence , thus excluding civil proceedings ? "
And its opinion , presented by advocate general Juliane Kokott , is that member states are allowed to ' exclude ' revealing personal data on internet traffic in civil cases .
This does not apply to criminal cases , where such compliance would be required .

The Polish president Lech Kaczynski and his identical twin Jaroslaw ( who happens to be prime minister ) are n't fans of being mocked .
Fair enough .
Most people are n't .
But most people do n't attempt to arrest those who mock them .
Google Blogoscoped has a translated version of recent Polish newspaper accounts of Marek W. , a young Pole from Cieszyn who apparently wrote some sort of " Googlebombing " software that targeted the Polish president .
It was successful enough to return a link to the President 's office when the word " kutas " ( penis ) was searched , but the authorities were not amused .
Marek was arrested earlier this year for the act , which may be illegal under Polish law ( insulting the president is a crime ) .
It may be one of the last major Googlebombing cases ever , though , as the company tweaked its algorithms to eliminate the practice .
It 's not the first time that the power of the state has been brought to bear on those who mock the twins .
Last summer , newspapers around the world buzzed with the news that Poland was attempting to arrest a German journalist who published a satirical piece about the two brothers .
The case was serious enough to prompt Reporters Without Borders to issue a statement calling the event " unworthy of a European head of state who supposedly respects freedom of the press . "
Poland 's laws might seem unduly restrictive to many observers , but the neighboring Czech Republic features freedom of speech so complete that it still extends to child porn .
Amazingly , ownership of such images is allowed ( though the government is looking into ways to change this ) , just as it is in Latvia , Slovenia , and Portugal .
Surely , in both cases , there has to be a better way to balance rights and freedoms ?
Gonzales refuses to send witness to Hill for voting rights hearing

Two House Democrats criticized Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for refusing to send a witness to the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing on voting rights .
In response , the committee postponed a hearing that had been scheduled for this morning .
Reps .
John Conyers and Jerrold Nadler , respectively the Chairs of the House Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties , criticized the decision by Gonzales .
" We are disappointed by this decision , " they wrote to the Attorney General .
" Mr. Tanners testimony is important to the Committees efforts to understand the manner in which the Department has implemented its legislative mandate .
As Chief of the Voting Section , Mr. Tanner is personally familiar with the facts surrounding the Departments decisions in significant and controversial voting rights cases . "
Gonzales had offered to send a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in Tanner 's place .
In the letter , the two Congressmembers also expressed their desire to work with Gonzales to secure Tanner 's testimony .
Controversy has emerged in the management of the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division .
Earlier in the year , an ex-Justice employee told the House Committee that the office had been heavily politicized with political appointees creating an environment deemed hostile by many career attorneys , who quite their posts .
Subsequently , a former Voting Section Chief acknowledged to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had bragged about primarily hiring Republicans for career positions in a June hearing .
What Google ’s acquisition of Writely means Jason 68 comments Latest by Gokcen Ogutcu
Google just bought a great product in Writely .
Writely was one of the best executed products I ’ve seen in a while .
But what does the acquisition mean ?
There ’s plenty of talk about Google building up a full office suite .
But I do n’t think that ’s what it ’s about .
I think this is about Google building up half an office suite .
Google knows that most people do n’t need the full Microsoft Office collection .
They do n’t even need most of it .
They do n’t even need half of each product .
They just need a few things ( like creating a quick , simply formatted document and sharing it with someone ) .
And it looks to me like Google wants to offer those few things .
Google wants to build the “ Just Enough Office ” because that ’s really want the people want .
Writely is n’t a full featured web - based word processor because most people do n’t need a full featured web - based word processor .
Gmail is n’t a full featured email program because most people do n’t need a full featured email program .
Will Google ’s calendar be a full featured calendar replacement on par with Outlook ?
No .
It does n’t have to be .
Most people do n’t need a full featured Outlook - level calendar .
So my guess is that Google wants to put together a simple collection of tools that serve the 80 % .
Let Microsoft try to keep the last 20 % happy .
That ’s a thankless , tireless job .
Plus , 80 % is bigger than 20 % so might as well go after the larger market — especially when it ’s easier to please .
I doubt we ’ll ever see a feature - for - feature web - based Google reproduction of Microsoft Office .
The 80 % does n’t need that .
Google does n’t seem to be in the business of giving people what they do n’t need .
Google products are generally small and focused and do a few things pretty well .
That ’s what most people need .
Writely seems like a great first step .
Well done Google — and Writely .
Normally I do n’t enjoy watching violence .
The exception is when a bull wins a bullfight .
When one of those videos pops up on the Internet , I ’ll watch it two or three times .
I do n’t mind saying it makes me happy .
I realize I ’m supposed to be rooting for the sadistic asshole that ’s dressed like a waiter on acid .
But I have to be honest : I ’m delighted when a bull puts a horn up a matador ’s sphincter and trots around the arena wearing him like a rapper ’s hat .
There are two things I look for in bull victories :
1. Air time
2. Stomping
Air time is when the bull lifts the matador off his feet and tosses him .
You can rate the quality of the toss by how many times the matador yells “ Mierda ! Mierda ! Mierda ! ” before he hits the ground .
Three mierdas is good , but I prefer four .
Then comes the stomping , which I regard as a form of afterglow .
That ’s when the sadistic asshole helpers come out to save the psychopath matador .
It strikes me as unsportsmanlike .
I root for the bull to kill them too , but it rarely works out the way I ’d like .
The experts say one of the ways you can predict a future serial killer is if he ’s cruel to animals and thinks it ’s entertaining .
You use the same method to predict a future matador .
The only difference is that the future serial killer does n’t dress like an organ grinder ’s monkey and masturbate furiously after killing the mammal .
Just to be clear , I normally value the life of a human being higher than the life of an animal .
But I think we ’d all agree that the best animal is better than the worst human .
Bulls usually mind their own business .
All they want to do is eat , poop , and hump anything that moos .
As a man , I respect the clarity of their missions .
On the other hoof , a matador is a guy who did n’t have enough people skills to be promoted to serial killer .
Honestly , I do n’t see how anyone can root for the human in this situation .
Bonus question :
What would you name a bull that contributes to global warming , and stabs matadors with his horns ?
You can go to Realtor.com and search for homes for sale in any city in the U.S. , and you can specify a certain price range .
If you search for homes for sale in Detroit , Michigan , you 'll find that there are 22,387 homes for sale right now , and if you search for Detroit homes for sales between $ 0 and $ 20,000 , you 'll find that there are 3,431 homes for sale in that price range !
That is , more than 15 % of the homes for sale in Detroit , or almost 1 out every 7 homes for sale , is priced at $ 20,000 or less , including the " Great Investment Property " pictured above , which is listed at a $ 1,500 sales price ( negotiable ? ) with estimated monthly payments of only " $ 7 per month . "
" $ 7 for a monthly house payment , " is n't that about what a single pack of cigarettes cost now ?
The Shining in 30 seconds , re-enacted by bunnies .
The next day , after my quiet moment at dawn , we all explored the ruins .
Our mule driver knew a little about the site , but for the most part we guided ourselves .
I had Spanish - language photocopies of government materials ; the one book I had found in English was filled with beautiful photographs and too heavy to tote up the mountain .
We saw only six other tourists .
Choquequirao , like all important Incan cities , is laid out in alignment with the movements of the sun and the stars .
One building on the central plaza has nooks in which the mummies of important citizens were placed , and it is onto these nooks that the first rays of dawn fall each day .
The city ’s central temple is a small rectangle on the other side of the plaza with evenly spaced depressions for altars and stone hooks where the priests hung their raiment .
The most striking feature about the temple is how tiny it is ; like those at Machu Picchu , it could fit perhaps 20 worshipers and had very little of the architectural grandeur of a mosque , a church or a synagogue .
But then , an attempt at human grandeur here , in the shadow of the jagged jungle peak Corihuayrachina and facing arid , domelike mountains so gargantuan they make clouds look small , would seem redundant at best .
Although Choquequirao is more spread out than Machu Picchu , and therefore less photogenic , the promontory on which it lies reaches its zenith with a ceremonial hill behind the plaza , a smaller version of the rugged mountain seen in every photograph of Machu Picchu .
The hike up takes just a few minutes but affords a 360 - degree view of the ruins and the surrounding landscape .
The curious feature of the hill is that it was scalped , flattened and denuded of vegetation by the Incas so their priests could perform rituals there .
On the other side of the plaza , the city climbs steadily uphill following a carved stone aqueduct where water will again flow in a few years as restoration progresses .
It soon reaches a zigzag set of terraces resembling a giant ’s staircase .
Obsessed as they were with building cities on top of mountains , the Incas developed terraces like these to grow crops .
Choquequirao has quite a few scattered about , long rice - paddy - like structures imposing angular order on the wild cliffs , but these narrower terraces were special .
The priests probably used them to grew the special coca that figured heavily in their rituals .
( Modern Andean peoples still use the coca leaf , not to make cocaine but for the mildly euphoric coca tea that appears to occupy the same space in their culture as our coffee , alcohol and aspirin wrapped into one . )
A path from the central plaza leads to the residential district , a complex of newly exposed simple four - walled houses that the jungle is already doing its best to reclaim .
The place had a creepy “ Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ” vibe , heightened by the rustling of unknown animals in the brush .
That glancing - over - your - shoulder fear , the sort of adrenaline rush you hope for at ancient ruins , is still attainable at Choquequirao .
Introduction
After reading an article called " How Google Earth Works " on the great site HowStuffWorks.com , it became apparent that the article was more of a " how cool it is " and " here ’s how to use it " than a " how Google Earth [ really ] works . "
So I thought there might be some interest , and despite some valid intellectual property concerns , here we are , explaining how at least part of Google Earth works .
Keep in mind , those IP issues are real .
Keyhole ( now known as Google Earth ) was attacked once already with claims that they copied someone else ’s inferior ( IMO ) technology .
The suit was completely dismissed by a judge , but only after many years of pain .
Still , it highlights one problem of even talking about this stuff .
Anything one says could be fodder for some troll to claim he invented what you did because it " sounds similar . "
The judge in the Skyline v. Google case understood that " sounding similar " is not enough to prove infringement .
Not all judges do .
Anyway , the solution to discussing " How Google Earth [ Really ] Works " is to stick to information that has already been disclosed in various forms , especially in Google ’s own patents , of which there are relatively few .
Fewer software patents is better for the world .
But in this case , more patents would mean we could talk more openly about the technology , which , btw , was one of the original goals of patents — a trade of limited monopoly rights in exchange for a real public benefit : disclosure .
But I digress …
For the more technically inclined , you may want to read these patents directly .
Be warned : lawyers and technologists sometimes emulsify to form a sort of linguistic mayonnaise , a soul - deadening substance known as Patent English , or Painglish for short .
If you ’re brave , or masochistic , here you go :
1. Asynchronous Multilevel Texture Pipeline
2. Server for geospatially organized flat file data
There are also a few more loosely related Google patents .
I do n’t know why these are shouting , but perhaps because they ’re very important to the field .
I ’ll hopefully get to these in more detail in future articles :
3. DIGITAL MAPPING SYSTEM
4. GENERATING AND SERVING TILES IN A DIGITAL MAPPING SYSTEM
5. DETERMINING ADVERTISEMENTS
USING USER INTEREST INFORMATION AND MAP - BASED LOCATION INFORMATION
6. ENTITY DISPLAY PRIORITY IN A DISTRIBUTED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM ( this one will be huge )
And there is this more informative technical paper from SGI ( PDF ) on hardware " clipmapping , " which we ’ll refer to later on .
Michael Jones , btw , is one of the driving forces behind Google Earth , and as CTO , is still advancing the technology .
I ’m going to stick closely to what ’s been disclosed or is otherwise common technical knowledge .
But I will hopefully explain it in a way that most humans can understand and maybe even appreciate .
At least that ’s my goal .
You can let me know .
Big Caveat : the Google Earth code base has probably been rewritten several times since I was involved with Keyhole and perhaps even after these patents were submitted .
Suffice it to say , the latest implementations may have changed significantly .
And even my explanations are going to be so broad ( and potentially out - dated ) that no one should use this article as the basis for anything except intellectual curiosity and understanding .
Also note : we ’re going to proceed in reverse , strange as it may seem , from the instant the 3D Earth is drawn on your screen , and later trace back to the time the data is served .
I believe this will help explain why things are done as they are and why some other approaches do n’t work nearly as well .
Part 1 , The Result : Drawing a 3D Virtual Globe
There are two principal differences between Google Maps and Earth that inform how things should ideally work under the hood .
The first is the difference between fixed - view ( often top - down ) 2D & free - perspective 3D rendering .
The second is between real - time and pre-rendered graphics .
These two distinctions are fading away as the products improve and converge .
But they highlight important differences , even today .
What both have in common is that they begin with traditional digital photography — lots of it — basically one giant high - resolution ( or multi- resolution ) picture of the Earth .
How they differ is largely in how they render that data .
Consider : The Earth is approximately 40,000 km around the waist .
Whoever says it ’s a small world is being cute .
If you stored only one pixel of color data for every square kilometer of surface , a whole - earth image ( flattened out in , say , a mercator projection ) would be about 40,000 pixels wide and roughly half as tall .
That ’s far more than most 3D graphics hardware can handle today .
We ’re talking about an image of 800 megapixels and 2.4 gigabytes at least .
Many PCs today do n’t even have 2GB of main memory .
And in terms of video RAM , needed to render , a typical PC has maybe 128MB , with a high - end gaming rig having upwards of 512 .
And remember , this is just your basic run -of - the - mill one - kilometer - per - pixel whole - earth image .
The smallest feature you could resolve with such an image is about 2 kilometers wide ( thank you , Mr. Nyquist ) — no buildings , rivers , roads , or people would be apparent .
But for most major US cities , Google Earth deals in resolutions that can resolve objects as small as half a meter or less , at least four thousand times denser , or sixteen million times more storage than the above example .
We ’re talking about images that would ( and do ) literally take many terabytes to store .
There is no way that such a thing could ever be drawn on today ’s PCs , especially not in real - time .
And yet it happens every time you run Google Earth .
Consider :
In a true 3D virtual globe , you can arbitrarily tilt and rotate your view to pretty much look anywhere ( except perhaps underground — and even that ’s possible if we had the data ) .
In all 3D globes , there exists some source data , typically , a really high - resolution image of the whole earth ’s surface , or at least the parts for which the company bought data .
That source data needs to be delivered to your monitor , mapped onto some virtual sphere or ideally onto small 3D surfaces ( triangles , etc .. ) that mimic the real terrain , mountains , rivers and so on .
If you , as a software designer , decide not allow your view of the Earth to ever tilt or rotate , then congrats , you ’ve simplified the engineering problem and can take some time off .
But then you do n’t have Google Earth .
Now , various schemes exist to allow one to " roam " part of this ridiculously large texture .
Other mapping applications solve this in their own way , and often with significant limitations or visual artifacts .
Most of them simply cut their huge Earth up into small regular tiles , perhaps arranged in a quadtree , and draw a certain number of those tiles on your screen at any given time , either in 2D ( like Google Maps ) or in 3D , like Microsoft ’s Virtual Earth apparently does .
But the way Google Earth solved the problem was truly novel , and worthy of a software patent ( and I am generally opposed to software patents ) .
To explain it , we ’ll have to build up a few core concepts .
A background in digital signal theory and computer graphics never hurts , but I hope this will be easy enough that that wo n’t be necessary .
I ’m not going to explain how 3D rendering works — that ’s covered elsewhere .
But I am going to focus on texture mapping and texture filtering in particular , because the details are vital to making this work .
The progression from basic concepts to the more advanced texture filtering will also help you understand why things work this way , and just how amazing this technology really is .
If you have the patience , here ’s a very quick lesson in texture filtering .
The Basics
The problem of scaling , rotating and warping basic 2D images was solved a long time ago .
The most common solution is called Bilinear Filtering .
All that really means is that for each new ( rotated , scaled , etc .. ) pixel you want to compute , you take the four " best " pixels from your source image and blend them together .
It ’s " bilinear " because it linearly blends two pixels at a time ( along one axis ) , and then linearly blends those two results ( along the other axis ) for the final answer .
[ A " linear blend , " in case it ’s not clear , is butt simple : take 40 % of color A , and 60 % of color B and add them together .
The 40/60 split is variable , depending on how " important " each contributor is , as long as the total adds up to 100 % . ]
That functionality is built into your 3D graphics hardware such that your computer can nowadays do literally billions of these calculations per second .
Do n’t ask me why your favorite paint program is so slow .
The problem being addressed can be visualized pretty easily — that ’s what I love about computer graphics .
It turns out , whenever we map some source pixels onto different ( rotated , scaled , tilted , etc… ) output pixels , visual information is lost .
The problem is called " aliasing " and it occurs because we digitally sampled the original image one way , at some given frequency ( aka resolution ) , and now we ’re re-sampling that digital data in some other way that does n’t quite match up .
1 . A simple low - res ( 11×11 pixel ) image is about to be rotated .
( the grid lines are merely to delineate pixels )
3 . Close up of one output pixel .
Bilinear interpolation averages the " best " four source pixels for each new destination pixel ( shown as black border with white dots ) based on their relative importance ( ideally : fractional area ) .
2. Each pixel in the destination grid overlaps multiple pixels from the rotating original .
4 . After bilinear interpolation , the resulting rotated image has some clear ( or rather blurry ) issues .
Now , when we talk about output pixels and destinations , it does n’t much matter if the destination is a bitmap in a paint program or the 3D application window that shows the Earth .
Aliasing happens whenever the output pixels do not line up with the sampling interval ( frequency , resolution ) of the source image .
And aliasing makes for poor visual results .
Dealing with aliasing is about half of what texture mapping is all about .
The rest is mostly memory management .
And the constraints of both inform how Google Earth works .
The mission then is to minimize aliasing through cleverness and good design .
The best way to do this is to get as close as possible to a 1:1 correspondence between input and output pixels , or at least to generate so many extra pixels that we can safely down - sample the output to minimize aliasing ( also known as " anti-aliasing " ) .
We often do both .
Consider : for resizing images , it only gets worse — each pixel in your destination image might correspond to hundreds of pixels of source imagery , or vice - versa .
Bilinear interpolation , remember , will only pick the best four source pixels and ignore the rest .
So it can therefore skip right over important pixels , like edges , shadows , or highlights .
If some such pixel is picked for blending during one frame and skipped over subsequently , you ’ll get an ugly " pixel - popping " or scintillation effect .
I ’m sure you ’ve seen it in some video games .
Now you know why .
Tilting images ( or any 3D transformation ) is even more problematic , because now we have elements of scaling and rotation , but also a great variation in pixel density across rendered surfaces .
For example , in the " near " part of a scene , your nice high - res ground image might be scaled up such that the pixels look blurry .
In the " far " part of the scene , your image might appear scintillated ( as above ) because simple 2×2 bilinear interpolation is necessarily skipping important visual details from time to time .

Here ’s an example of where a certain kind of texture filtering causes poor results .
The text labels are hardly readable ( why they ’re painted into the terrain image at all is another issue ) .
Better Filtering , Revealed
Most consumer 3D hardware already supports what ’s called " tri-linear " filtering .
With tri-linear and a closely coupled technique called mip-mapping , the hardware computes and stores a series of lower resolution versions of your source image or texture map .
Each mip-map is automatically down - sampled by a factor of 2 , repeatedly , until we reach a 1× 1 pixel image whose color is the average of all source image pixels .
So , for example , if you provided the hardware with a nice 512×512 source image , it would compute and store 8 extra mip- levels for you ( 256 , 128 , 64 , 32 , 16 , 8 , 4 , 2 , and 1 pixel square ) .
If you stacked those vertically , you might more easily visualize the " mip- stack " as an upside down pyramid , where each mip - level ( each horizontal slice ) is always 1/2 the width of the one above .
Drawing of a mip-map
pyramid ( not to scale ) .
The X depicts trilinear filtering sampling two mip -levels for an in - between pixel to reduce aliasing .
During 3D rendering , mip - mapping and tri-linear filtering take each destination pixel , pick the two most appropriate mip- levels , essentially do a bi-linear blend on both , and then blend those two results again ( linearly ) for the final tri-linear answer .
So for example , say the next pixel would have no aliasing if only the source image had a resolution of 47.5 pixels across .
The system has stored power of two mip maps ( 16 , 32 , 64 … ) .
So the hardware will cleverly use the 64×64 and 32×32 pixel versions closest to the desired sampling of 47.5 , compute a bilinear ( 4 - sample ) result for each , and then take those two results and blend them a third time .
That ’s tri-linear filtering in a nutshell , and along with mip - mapping , it goes a great distance to minimizing aliasing for many common cases of 3D transformations .
Remember : so far , we ’ve been talking about nice , small images , like 512×512 pixels .
Our whole - earth image will need to be millions of pixels across .
So one might consider making a giant mip-map of our whole - earth image , at say one meter resolution .
No problem , right ?
But you ’ll realize fairly soon that would require a mip -map pyramid 26 levels deep , where the highest resolution mip - level is some 66 million pixels across .
That simply wo n’t fit on any 3D video card on the market , at least not in this decade .
I ’m guessing Microsoft ’s Virtual Earth gets around this limit by cutting their giant earth texture into many smaller distinct tiles of , say , 256 pixels square , where each gets mip - mapped individually .
That approach would work to an extent , but it would be relatively slow and give some of the visual artifacts , like the blurring we see above , and a popping in and out of large square areas as you zoom in and out .
There ’s one last concept about mip-maps to understand before we move on to the meat of the issue .
Imagine for a moment that the pixels in the mip -map pyramid are actually color - coded as I ’ve indicated above , with an entire layer colored red , another yellow , etc. .
Drawing this on a tilted plane ( like the Earth ’s ground " plane " ) would then seem to " slice through " the pyramid at an interesting angle , using only those parts of the pyramid that are needed for this view .
It ’s this characteristic of mip-mapping that allows Google Earth to exist , as we ’ll see in a minute .
A typical tilted Google Earth image ( copyright & courtesy Google ) .
The same view , using color to show which mip levels inform which pixels
The example on the left shows a normal 3D scene from Google Earth , as well as a rough diagram showing from where in the mip - stack a 3D hardware system might find the best source pixels , if they were so colorized .
The nearer area gets filled from the highest - resolution mip - level ( red ) , dropping off to lower and lower resolutions as we get farther from the virtual point of view .
This helps avoid the scintillation and other aliasing problems we talked about earlier , and looks quite nice .
We get as close as possible to a 1:1 correspondence between source and destination , pixel for pixel , so aliasing is minimized .
Even better still , tri-linear filtering 3D graphics hardware has been improved with something called anisotropic filtering ( a simple preference option in Google Earth ) which is essentially the same core idea as the previous examples , but using non-square filters , beyond the basic 2×2 .
This is very important for visual quality , because even with fancy mip-mapping , if you tilt a textured polygon to a very oblique angle , the hardware must choose a low - resolution mip - level to avoid scintillation on the narrow axis .
And that means the whole polygon is sampled at too - low a resolution , when it ’s only one direction that needed to dip down to the low - res stuff .
Suffice it to say , if your hardware supports anisotropic filtering , turn it on for best results .
It ’s worth every penny .
Now , to the meat of the issue
We still have to solve the problem of how to mip - map a texture with millions of pixels in either dimension .
Universal Texture ( in the Google Earth patent ) solves the problem while still providing high quality texture filtering .
It creates one giant multi-terabyte whole - earth virtual - texture in an extremely clever way .
I can say that since I did n’t actually invent it .
Chris Tanner figured out a way to do on your PC what had only ever been done on expensive graphics supercomputers with custom circuitry , called Clip Mapping ( see SGI ’s pdf paper , also by Chris , Michael , et al. , for a lot more depth on the original hardware implementation ) .
That technology is essentially what made Google Earth possible .
And my very first job on this project was making that work over an internet connection , way back when .
So how does it actually work ?
Well , instead of loading and drawing that giant whole - earth texture all at once — which is impossible on most current hardware — and instead of chopping it up into millions of tiles and thereby losing the better filtering and efficiency we want , recall from just above that we typically only ever use a narrow slice or column of our full mip -map pyramid at any given time .
The angle and height of this virtual column changes quite a bit depending on our current 3D perspective .
And this usage pattern is fairly straightforward for a clever algorithm to compute or infer , knowing where you are and what the application is trying to draw .
A Universal Texture is both a mip-map , plus a software emulated clip - stack , meaning it can mimic a mip-map of many more levels and greater ultimate resolution than can fit in any real hardware .
Note : though this diagram does n’t depict it as precisely as the paper , the clip stack ’s " angle " shifts around to best keep the column centered .
So this clever algorithm figures out which sections of the larger virtual texture it needs at any given time and pages only those from system memory to your graphics card ’s dedicated texture memory , where it can be drawn very efficiently , even in real - time .
The main modification to basic mip- mapping , from a conceptual point of view , is that the upside down pyramid is no longer just a pyramid , but is now much , much taller , containing a clipped stack of textures , called , oddly enough , a " clip stack , " perhaps 16 to 30 + levels high .
Conceptually , it ’s as if you had a giant mip -map pyramid that ’s 16 - 30 levels deep and millions to billions of pixels wide , but you clipped off the sides — i.e. , the parts you do n’t need right now .
Imagine the Washington monument , upside down and you ’ll get the idea .
In fact , imagine that tower leaning this way or that , like the one in Pisa , and you ’ll be even closer .
The tower leans in such a way that the pixels inside the tower are what you need for rendering right now .
The rest is ignored .
Each clip - level is still twice the resolution of the one " below " it , like all mip-maps , and nice quality filtering still works as before .
But since the clip stack is limited to a fixed but roaming footprint , say 512×512 pixels wide ( another preference in Google Earth ) , that means that each clip - level is both twice the effective resolution and half the coverage area of the previous .
That ’s exactly what we want .
We get all the benefits of a giant mip-map , with only the parts relevant to any given view .
Put another way , Google Earth cleverly and progressively loads high - res information for what ’s at the focal " center " of your view ( the red part above ) , and resolution drops off by powers of two from there .
As you tilt and fly and watch the land run towards the horizon , Universal Texture is optimally sending only the best and most useful levels of detail to the hardware at any given time .
What is n’t needed , is n’t even touched .
That ’s one thing that makes it ultra-efficient .
It ’s also very memory - efficient .
The total texture memory for an earth - sized texture is now ( assuming this 512 wide base mip-map , and say 20 extra clip - levels of data ) only about 17 megabytes , not the dozens to hundreds of terabytes we were threatened with before .
It ’s actually doable , and worked in 1999 on 3D hardware that had only 32 MB or less .
Other techniques are only now becoming possible with bigger and bigger 3D cards .
In fact , with only 20 clip - levels ( plus 9 mip levels for the base pyramid ) , we see that 229 yields a virtual texture capable of up to 536 million pixels in either dimension .
Multiply that by 1 /2 vertically , gives an virtual image of a few hundred terapixels in area , or enough excess capacity to represent features as small as 0.15 meters ( about 5 inches ) , wherever the data is available .
And that ’s not the actual limit .
I simply picked 20 clip levels as a reasonable number .
And you thought the race for more megapixels on digital cameras was challenging .
Multiply that by a million and you ’re in the planetary ballpack .
Fortunately , for now , Google only really has to store a few dozen terapixels of imagery .
The other beauty of the system is that the highest levels of resolution need not exist everywhere for this to work .
Wherever the resolution is more limited , wherever there are gaps , missing data , etc ..
the system only draws what it has .
If there is higher resolution data available , it is fetched and drawn too .
If not , the system uses the next lower resolution version of that data ( see mip - mapping above ) rather than drawing a blank .
That ’s exactly why you can zoom into some areas and see only a big blur , where other areas are nice and crisp .
It ’s all about data availability , not any hard limit on the 3D rendering .
If the data were available , you could see centimeter resolution in the middle of the ocean .
The key then to making this all work is that , as you roam around the 3D Earth , the system can efficiently page new texture data from your local disk cache and system memory into your graphics texture memory .
( We ’ll cover some of how stuff gets into your local cache next time ) .
You ’ve literally been watching that texture uploading happen without necessarily realizing it .
Hopefully , now you will appreciate all the hard work that went into making this all work so smoothly — like feeding an entire planet piecewise through a straw .
Finally , there ’s one other item of interest before we move on .
The reason this patent emphasizes asynchronous behavior is that these texture bits take some small but cumulative time to upload to your 3D hardware continuously , and that ’s time taken away from drawing 3D images in a smooth , jitter - free fashion or handling easy user input — not to mention the hardware is typically busy with its own demanding schedule .
To achieve a steady 60 frames per second on most hardware , the texture uploading is divided into small , thin slices that very quickly update graphics video memory with the source data for whatever area you ’re viewing , hopefully just before you need it , but at worst , just after .
What ’s really clever is that the system needs only upload the smallest parts of these textures that are needed and it does it without making anyone wait .
That means rendering can be smooth and the user interface can be as fluid as possible .
Without this asynchronicity , forget about those nice parabolic arcs from coast to coast .
Now , other virtual globes can also virtualize the whole - earth texture , perhaps they cut it into tiles , and even use multiple power - of - two resolutions like GE does .
But without the Universal Texturing component or something better , they ’ll either be limited to 2D top - down rendering , or they ’ll do 3D rendering with unsatisfying results , blurring , scintillation , and not nearly as good performance for streaming the data from the cache into texture memory for rendering .
Johnson said that Decoatsworth , a 16th District patrolman who graduated from the police academy in March , was very close to the assailant and was fortunate he did not suffer more extensive damage .
Johnson said Decoatsworth was also fortunate to be hit with birdshot - smaller , less deadly pellets than those contained in buckshot .

Many of the early inventors of the typewriter thought that what they were inventing was a prosthetic device for the blind .
Why would ordinary writers need a writing machine ?
They had pens .
Eventually , it became clear that such a mechanism could benefit the seeing , too , but , as we find out in “ The Iron Whim : A Fragmented History of Typewriting ” ( Cornell ; $ 29.95 ) , by Darren Wershler - Henry , a professor of communication studies in Ontario , almost two centuries , roughly the eighteenth and the nineteenth , passed before that hope was realized .
There was no single moment of discovery , no lone inventor crying “ Eureka ! ” in a darkened laboratory .
On the contrary , historians estimate that the typewriter was invented at least fifty - two times , as one tinkerer after another groped toward a usable design .
One early writing mechanism looks like a birthday cake , another like a pinball machine .
One was almost eight feet tall ; another , a Tyrolean entry , was whittled largely from wood .
Until about the eighteen - thirties , all typewriters lacked a keyboard , and when they got one it was usually modelled on that of the piano .
Nor did they have a ribbon .
That did n’t make its appearance until 1841 ; in most earlier machines the keys were inked by rollers or carbon paper .
As with all inventions , however , people want to know who the “ father ” was , and that title is usually awarded to Christopher Latham Sholes , from Milwaukee .
It is strange and pleasing that a machine famed for its cold efficiency issued from the hands of this modest and distracted man .
( “ He wore battered hats , ” one historian says .
“ His trousers were inches too short . ” )
Sholes was apparently trying to invent a mechanical paginator — a device that would number the pages of a document sequentially — when he read an article on the typewriter in Scientific American and switched to that instead .
The design he came up with was in many ways no better than previous ones , and he had little part in the typewriter ’s later history .
He soon disowned the machine — refused to use one or even to recommend its use .
Nevertheless , his model was the first to be successfully marketed .
In the eighteen - seventies , the arms manufacturer E. Remington & Sons was looking for a new product line ; the Civil War was over , and rifles were less in demand .
Sholes ’s typewriter seemed a good bet .
In 1873 , Remington put it on the market , attached to a sewing - machine table , and made a bundle .
Sholes was also the author of the so - called QWERTY keyboard , which , with a few modifications , is still in use on our personal computers .
( Look at the top row of your letter keys . )
A problem with early typewriters was that the key arms kept getting stuck together .
As the arm of the letter that had just been typed was falling back into place , it would jam against the arm rising to type the next letter , and the typist would have to stop and pry them apart .
Reportedly , Sholes ’s partner delegated his son- in - law , the superintendent of schools for western Pennsylvania , to draw up a list of the most common two - letter sequences in the English language .
Sholes then designed the keyboard so that these pairs were separated , thus introducing a tiny delay between the activation of one letter and the next .
Wershler - Henry quotes an early history of the typewriter , Bruce Bliven ’s “ The Wonderful Writing Machine , ” to the effect that the QWERTY keyboard was in fact “ considerably less efficient than if the arrangement had been left to chance . ”
Nevertheless , people got used to it , and it was never replaced .
Wershler - Henry follows the fortunes of the typewriter into the twentieth century , with special emphasis on the role of women in the story .
In the beginning , few people imagined that anyone would compose at the machine .
The user of the typewriter would be an amanuensis — in other words , a secretary — taking dictation from another person .
Accordingly , in the early days the word “ typewriter ” was used to mean not just the machine but the person plying it .
That person , the Remington folks assumed , would be a woman .
( The flowers printed on the casing of the early models were to make the mechanism seem friendly to the weaker sex . )
Remington ’s prediction was correct .
It was often as typists that women poured into the professional workforce at the turn of the century .
By 1910 , according to the Census Bureau , eighty - one per cent of professional typists were female .
Guardians of the social order warned that this development would have baleful consequences .
It would unsex women ; it would spell the end of the American family .
They were right , in part .
Together with other social changes , the availability of typing jobs no doubt did weaken the family ’s hold on women .
As for unsexing them , the effect was the opposite .
Wershler - Henry documents the entry of the “ typewriter girl ” into the iconography of early - twentieth - century pornography .
He also gives us illustrations , from the so - called Tijuana Bibles , dirty comic books produced in Mexico , starting in the nineteen - thirties , for the American market .
In one panel , a three - piece - suited executive , staring at his secretary ’s thigh , says , “ Miss Higby , are you ready for — ahem ! — er—dictation ? ”
Such a situation did not lead swiftly to Miss Higby ’s empowerment , but for a woman to have a job , any job , outside the home was part of the humble beginnings of twentieth - century feminism .
Wershler - Henry covers these matters in the first half of his book .
But he is a scholar of the postmodern persuasion , and , as he soon tells us , his interest is not in the typewriter ’s history but in its “ discourse . ”
In the postmodern vocabulary , this means the web of assumptions that collect around a cultural fact , with heavy emphasis on notions that have been unmasked as naïve and ridiculous by French theorists .
The names of Michel Foucault , Jacques Derrida , and Jean Baudrillard come up frequently in the book , and Wershler - Henry has a couple of propositions , consistent with those men ’s theories , that he wants us to agree with .
First , he says , in the age of the typewriter — the twentieth century , more or less — there was a mythology that what was typewritten was true , that the machine somehow caused writers to bare their souls .
This is a central idea of “ The Iron Whim , ” and it calls forth some of Wershler - Henry ’s most atmospheric prose :
“ The typewriter has become the symbol of a non-existent sepia - toned era when people typed passionately late into the night under the flickering light of a single naked bulb , sleeves rolled up , suspenders hanging down , lighting each new cigarette off the smouldering butt of the last , occasionally taking a pull from the bottle of bourbon in the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet . ”
Wershler - Henry ’s second big point is that people believed that what was typewritten was dictated , by a voice separate from the person typing ; even people composing at the typewriter thought they were receiving dictation from elsewhere .
Both these ideas are surprising — furthermore , they seem to contradict each other — but Wershler - Henry never really tries to prove them or reconcile them .
He just asserts them , repeatedly .
Never mind .
They make him think of good stories to tell us about the typewriter .
Nietzsche used a typewriter .
This is hard to imagine , but in the effort to stem his migraines and his incipient blindness — symptoms , some scholars say , of an advanced case of syphilis — he bought one of the new contraptions .
So did Mark Twain , and he was the first important writer to deliver a typewritten manuscript , “ Life on the Mississippi , ” to a publisher .
Henry James also had a typewriter , and a secretary , to whom he dictated .
That is a famous fact ; it is said to have contributed to the extreme complexity of James ’s late - period style .
( But why would oral composition make a writer ’s prose more complex , rather than more simple ?
Again , Wershler - Henry does not address the question . )
James got used to the sound of his Remington ; when it was in the repair shop and he had to use a loaner , the new machine ’s different sound drove him crazy .
For many years after his death , his devoted typist , Theodora Bosanquet , claimed that she was still receiving dictation from him .
Indeed , through her spirit medium she was informed that Thomas Hardy , George Meredith , and John Galsworthy , all as dead as James , also wanted to use her stenographic services .

OTTAWA–The ex-wife of former South African president Nelson Mandela has been barred from entering Canada , stranding her at home in Johannesburg when she had planned to stand in the spotlight last night at a Toronto gala for an opera that celebrates her life .
Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , 70 , learned Monday that her application for a temporary resident visa had been denied , just as she was packing her bags and preparing to fly to Toronto for the event with her daughter .
An event organizer told a steady stream of reporters of Madikizela - Mandela 's disappointment even as performers rehearsed in the background of the Capitol Event Theatre on Yonge Street .
" She 's devastated , we 're devastated .
She 'd gone a week before that to get her visa and everything was fine , " Carole Adriaans of MusicaNoir said .
The MusicaNoir theatre company , which launches The Passion of Winnie Friday night , was stunned in part because the human rights campaigner and AIDS activist had been in New York City just three weeks ago to receive an award for her efforts tackling the medical scourge in her native country .
Hardy Jimbes , founder and president of the New York - based Save Africa Concert Foundation , said it was relatively easy to arrange the visit with U.S. officials .
He sent a letter to the embassy in South Africa with information about the award his organization was bestowing on Madikizela - Mandela and the temporary visas were processed for the trip , which lasted from May 18 to 22 .
" I do n't understand why they would refuse a visa to her , " Jimbes told the Star in a telephone interview after he was informed of Canada 's decision .
" It 's uncalled for . "
It appears that Canadian immigration officials were more influenced by Madikizela - Mandela 's criminal record than by her record of good work and advocacy when they processed her visa application .
Along with Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress party , Madikizela - Mandela was prominent in the fight to free the country 's black majority from the white minority 's apartheid regime .
But she has also been sentenced to prison twice for crimes seemingly separate from her political struggle .
In 1991 , one year after her last public visit to Canada , she was convicted of kidnapping a 14 - year - old boy and being an accessory to his murder .
In 2003 , she was convicted of 68 counts of theft and fraud in connection with a number of bank loan applications in the name of non-existent individuals she said were in the African National Congress Women 's League .
She pleaded that she was only trying to help poor women , but the judge discounted her argument , saying : " You are no Robin Hood . "
Still , she escaped both convictions without serving jail time .
Canadian officials would not comment directly on the case , but said anyone with a criminal record is automatically barred from entering Canada except if they obtain a ministerial permit .
There were more than 247,000 temporary residents permitted into Canada in 2005 .
A member of the House of Commons immigration committee estimated that between 600 and 1,000 ministerial permits are granted each year .
" It 's certainly not immediately apparent why such a visa should be denied , " said NDP Leader Jack Layton .
" Unfortunately , there are far too many visas being denied to individuals who want to come to this country for a whole series of very positive and helpful purposes . "
Many politicians and dignitaries had already lent their support to the opera honouring her life , which reportedly received a $ 20,000 federal grant .
Governor General Michaëlle Jean , Ontario Lieutenant Governor James Bartleman , Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty , Toronto Mayor David Miller , former Ontario premier Bob Rae and Toronto Liberal MP Bill Graham all sent written declarations of support to be published in the opera 's program .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper declined a request to write a message of support for the show , Adriaans told the Star .
But Secretary of State for Multiculturalism Jason Kenney sent along his support for a show that , he wrote , " demonstrates the potential of artistic expression to enhance cross-cultural understanding and communication . "

Graham 's message says that Canadians are proud of the " solidarity they shared with South Africans in the struggle against apartheid .
" Today we remain connected to South Africa through bonds of shared values and a shared view of global interests , " he wrote .
Grow­ing media atten­tion on the brain fit­ness field .
At least on the “ Healthy Aging ” seg­ment ( I pre­dict the media with catch up soon with devel­op­ments in oth­er areas , from cog­ni­tive train­ing for kids and adults with ADD / ADHD to stroke and TBI reha­bil­i­ta­tion , to peak per­for­mance for cor­po­rate train­ing ) .
First , a superb arti­cle by Leslie Walk­er at the Wash­ing­ton Post : Cross - Train­ing Your Brain to Main­tain Its Strength
Quotes : “ A grow­ing body of research sug­gests that men­tal activ­i­ty in mid­dle age and ear­li­er can help lat­er in life .
As a result , Web sites such as HappyNeuron.com are spring­ing up to offer online games to peo­ple of all ages , while blogs like SharpBrains.com pro­vide com­men­tary on the fledg­ling indus­try . ”
( Note : we can also pro­vide com­men­tary on the com­men­tary ! )
“ Peo­ple who engage in very chal­leng­ing tasks — not just in work but dur­ing leisure activ­i­ties such as read­ing , cross­word puz­zles , bridge , chess and trav­el — tend to slow down their men­tal aging process very sig­nif­i­cant­ly , ” says Breznitz , who is also a mem­ber of Israel ’s leg­is­la­ture and has devel­oped a brain - train­ing pro­gram called Mind­Fit . ”
“ Also con­tribut­ing to the brain work­out boom are state - of - the - art imag­ing tech­niques that have allowed sci­en­tists to val­i­date a the­o­ry devel­oped decades ago .
By tak­ing detailed pic­tures of brain neu­rons , sci­en­tists watch parts of the brain that had seemed dor­mant light up and assume new respon­si­bil­i­ties in response to stim­uli .

“ It remakes itself into a more effi­cient oper­a­tion to do the things you ask it to do . ”
Com­ments : the arti­cle touch­es many key points .
I espe­cial­ly enjoy the quote “ To be effec­tive , sci­en­tists say men­tal activ­i­ty must become pro­gres­sive­ly more chal­leng­ing .
Oth­er­wise , the brain adjusts and learns to per­form repet­i­tive tasks with less effort ” , a key mes­sage I make often in my lec­tures to explain why well - designed pro­grams can be more effec­tive than doing cross­word puz­zle num­ber 512,789 .
The arti­cle also relates how many retire­ment com­mu­ni­ties and senior cen­ters and indi­vid­u­als are try­ing out the new brain fit­ness pro­grams com­ing to mar­ket , and shows some healthy skep­ti­cism on the state of the research .
Now , this is an invi­ta­tion to the reporter to inter­view neu­ropsy­chol­o­gist Dr. Elkhonon Gold­berg to get the full pic­ture of the sci­ence behind the field , since these pro­grams have n’t appeared in a vac­u­um .

" Speciﬁcally , morning - types gather their knowledge from the tangible and concrete , trusting direct experience and observable phenomena ( realistic / sensing ) , prefer to process knowledge using analysis and logic ( thought - guided ) , and transform new knowledge according to what is known ( conservation - seeking ) .
Their behaviour style was upstanding and self - controlled ; they relate to authority in a respectful and cooperative manner and tend to behave in a formal and proper manner in social situations ( dutiful / conforming ) .
Finally , morning - types care about giving a positive impression "
" the thinking style of evening - types was based on the symbolical and unknown data more than on concrete and observable ones ( imaginative / intuiting ) , they tend to be creative and to take risks , ready to transform and recast whatever they come upon ( innovation - seeking ) .
As for behaving style , evening - types tend to act out in an independent and nonconforming manner and resist following traditional standards ( unconventional / dissenting ) . "

Nowhere are variations in individual work routines more apparent than in an independent and liberal work environment such as the research lab I work in .
It is easy to observe , for example , subpopulations of obligate morning - workers and obligate evening workers , as well as the facultative morning / evening workers .
Then there are the really crazy ( but increasingly rare ) individuals who just never go home .
But what underlying differences cause different people to gravitate towards different work schedules ?
Are certain work schedules more productive than others ?
I recently came across a paper that found some interesting correlations between student work schedules and tendencies in two areas of personality that are highly relevant to scientific research : 1 ) How students internalize information about their environment and 2 ) how they communicate with others .
Basically , morning - types tend to be conformists : Whereas evening - types tend to be innovators :
It 's interesting to speculate as to the underlying biological basis for these differences ( ie circadian rhythms , etc. ) .
But to me the real take - home message from this work is that different people probably perform to the best of their abilities on different working schedules .
Thus the most productive research environment is likely to be one that respects the individual 's freedom to work on one 's own schedules .
On an individual level , this study might also suggest that different research tasks ( ie repetitive labor vs. idea brainstorming ) are best performed on different schedules .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s main human rights body will vote next week on a resolution opposing the teaching of creationist and intelligent design views in school science classes .

The Council of Europe ’s Parliamentary Assembly will debate a resolution saying attacks on the theory of evolution were rooted “ in forms of religious extremism ” and amounted to a dangerous assault on science and human rights .
The resolution , on the agenda for October 4 , says European schools should “ resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion . ”
It describes the “ intelligent design ” argument as an updated version of creationism .
Anne Brasseur , an Assembly member from Luxembourg who updated an earlier draft resolution , said the vote was due in June but was postponed because some members felt the original text amounted to an attack on religious belief .
Only minor changes have been made to the initial draft .
“ There are different views of the creation of the world and we respect that , ” she told Reuters .
“ The message we wanted to send was to avoid creationism passing itself off as science and being taught as science .
That ’s where the danger lies . ”
The Council , based in the eastern French city of Strasbourg , oversees human rights standards in member states and enforces decisions of the European Court of Human Rights .
If passed , the resolution would not be binding on its 47 member states but would reflect widespread opposition among politicians to teaching creationism in science class .
NATURAL SELECTION DROPPED
Creationism says
God made the world in six days as depicted in the Bible .
Intelligent design argues some life forms are too complex to have evolved according to Charles Darwin ’s theory and needed an unnamed higher intelligence to develop as they have .
Some conservatives in the United States , both religious and secular , have long opposed the teaching of evolution in public schools but U.S. courts have regularly barred them from teaching what they describe as religious views of creation .
Pressure to teach creationism is weaker in Europe , but has been mounting .
An Assembly committee took up the issue because a shadowy Turkish Muslim publishing group has been sending an Islamic creationist book to schools in several countries .
Supporters of intelligent design want it taught in science class alongside evolution .
A U.S. court ruled this out in a landmark decision in 2005 , dismissing it as “ neo-creationism . ”
“ The aim of this report is not to question or to fight a belief , ” Brasseur wrote in a memorandum added to the new resolution .
“ It is not a matter of opposing belief and science , but it is necessary to prevent belief from opposing science . ”
She said the resolution also shortened references in the resolution to “ evolution by natural selection ” to “ evolution ” because some members had misunderstood the reference to natural selection to be an attack on their religious beliefs .

When the history of the Iraq war is written , the question of who lost it and how it was lost will be paramount , yet the answer is clear enough even today .
The seeds of defeat were sown long ago , and not just by the policymakers and authors of our present disastrous policy .
The co-authors of defeat in Iraq are the politicians and the U.S. military , both of whom are constrained by the internal political dynamics of U.S. imperialism .
The military deficiencies that some , like Sen. Harry Reid , have pointed to are not a matter of individual " incompetence " on the part of some generals : the inefficiencies are inherent in the system .
Via Matt Yglesias we hear the news that the U.S. is now ramping up the air strikes , a sure sign  according to William Lind  that we are losing and clueless :
" Nothing could testify more powerfully to the failure of U.S. efforts on the ground in Iraq than a ramp - up in airstrikes .
Calling in air is the last , desperate , and usually futile action of an army that is losing .
If anyone still wonders whether the ‘ surge ’ is working , the increase in air strikes offers a definitive answer : it is n’t . "
Civilian casualties are way up  but who cares ?
Not the Americans , who are so fixated on the internal politics of the war  the " battles " raging in Washington , D.C.  that they do n’t have either the time or the inclination to pay attention to the " metrics " coming out of Iraq .
Besides which , as Yglesias reminds us , the Pentagon does n’t bother keeping track of Iraqi casualties .
In a war for hearts and minds , however , the civilian casualty rate is a big indicator of American ( or insurgent ) success : the higher the rate , the lower are the chances that the U.S. can pull it off .
After all , we are aiming  presumably  to give the Iraqis the security within which they can resolve their intractable political situation and begin to stand up ( so we can stand down ) , but the bureaucratic and political imperatives of the imperial system that is evolving  in Iraq and everywhere else the American footprint is large  override the strategic requirements of fighting a successful war , as this story makes all too clear :
" The Air Force feels left out of the counterinsurgency debate .
What ’s particularly galling to some officials is that the role of air power was relegated to a five - page annex at the back of the new Army and Marine Corps counterinsurgency manual .
Setting out to rectify that perceived shortcoming , the Air Force is drafting its own manual for irregular warfare , due out this summer .
And officials are speaking out about air power ’s contribution to labor - intensive irregular warfare , seen as the domain of the U.S. military ’s ground pounders . "
The war on the ground in Iraq must take a back seat to the ongoing war within the U.S. military between the " air power " boys and the " ground pounders . "
Everybody wants a piece of the action  except , of course , when it comes time to take responsibility for defeat , which is even now looming large in the Pentagon ’s nightmares .
One of the chief weaknesses of imperialism is that empires have their own internal dynamics , which do n’t always conform to the requirements of external military and diplomatic policy .
The only hearts and minds the American military seems to care about are those in Washington : winning over the Iraqi people is incidental , because the incentives work the other way .
The Air Force has to show it is part of the solution in Iraq , whether or not it can actually play a significant positive role on the battlefield , because that is the road to increased pull on the Hill and in the White House , which means more funding .
Within the Empire are all these little empires , competing for tax dollars , prestige , and political primacy , and it is this civil war  always being fought , albeit at various levels of intensity  that is the ultimate undoing of the imperial order .
It does n’t matter that air power exacerbates the problem in Iraq , rather than solving it .
It does n’t matter that we ’re alienating ordinary Iraqis , who often are the victims of U.S. air raids ; all that matters is that the Air Force ’s rivalry with the Army ( and the Navy ) requires air strikes .
What determines our " strategy " is a shifting concatenation of competing agencies and political factions that meet on the battlefield of congressional committees and the higher councils of U.S. policymakers .
The outcome of this war  the intra-bureaucratic turf war  determines the strategy and conduct of the external war .
And that is the road to certain defeat .
Rent by internal contradictions , the American Empire contains within it the seeds of its own destruction , and these are sown and nurtured by the sheer scope of it .
I am reminded of an anecdote Rose Wilder Lane tells in her 1936 polemic Give Me Liberty : she had gone to Russia a convinced Communist and supporter of the October Revolution and was astonished to find that the " liberated " workers and peasants did n’t share her enthusiasm for the proletarian state .
She got into a debate with a Russian peasant , who appeared impervious to the lure of Leninism :
" I drew for him a picture of Great Russia , to its remotest corner enjoying the equality , the peace , and the justly divided prosperity of his village .
He shook his head sadly .
‘ It is too big , ’ he said .
‘ Too big .
At the top , it is too small .
It will not work .
In Moscow there are only men , and man is not God .
A man has only a man ’s head , and one hundred heads together do not make one great big head .
No. Only God can know Russia . ’ "
The American Empire is being undone by its bigness  no one can centrally plan such an enormous undertaking .
The physical holdings of the Pentagon alone are so vast that they constitute a nation unto themselves , a huge empire as complex and far - flung as Great Russia then or now .
The regime - changers in Washington are no better at planning the reconstruction of the Iraqi state than the central planners in the Kremlin were at building a modern industrial state out of a peasant - based economy .
The American Empire will end just as certainly and ignominiously as the Soviet Empire did  and , perhaps , even more rapidly , on account of the economic factors involved .
It ’s true that our enormous wealth  i.e. , the boundless productive capacity of capitalism  masks the true economic cost of war , to some degree .
Yet , in the end , we may wind up being destroyed by the very market forces we are so intent on globalizing .
Empires cost money , and this one , as Garet Garrett wryly observed half a century ago , is unique in that " everything goes out and nothing comes in . "
The Romans exacted tribute from subject nations , seizing gold , slaves , and anything not nailed down .
The American Imperium , on the other hand , is the Bizarro Empire , where U.S. taxpayers pay tribute to America ’s local satraps , such as Egypt and Israel  the two biggest recipients of our " foreign aid " program .
We defend Japan and South Korea , allowing them to shelter under our military umbrella while they export finished goods to the American market  and lend us the money to build an empire of bases around the world .
As Ron Paul tirelessly points out , the American welfare - warfare state is built on the shifting sands of an economic pump - priming perpetual motion machine , i.e. , government debt .
We are selling our children into slavery and bankrupting the nation : this is the price of empire , at least in purely economic terms .
The price in blood ours , the Iraqis , and perhaps the Iranians and others in the not - too - distant future  is higher still .
Whether the American people are prepared to pay it is a question that is currently torturing our elites : this is the real heart of the Iraq war issue in American politics , and both parties seem committed to persuading us that the price of empire is worth it .
The Democrats propose to do it on the cheap .
They solemnly vow to fight future wars of conquest " smartly , " while the Republicans are more extravagant and daring , with a devil - may - care attitude about the expenditure of troops and treasure in pursuit of " global hegemony , " as the neocons like to put it .
The rise and fall of the Bizarro Empire is going to be an object lesson in how greatness , and liberty along with it , is lost .
The story promises to be Spenglerian in its tragic denouement yet oddly inspiring in that the old republic survived as long as it did  up until at least the fatal year 1917 , when we were dragged into the Great War and the seeds of the next were planted .
The beginning of the end was when America embarked on its long overseas crusade to make the world safe for democracy against the villain of the day .
Twice the villains were Germans , and since then the Russians , the Iraqis , and now the " Islamofascists " have all had their turn .
Tomorrow it may well be the Russians again , and then there ’s always the Red Chinese , whom the Fates have entrusted with much of our debt  a weapon more deadly than any H - bomb .
America , having exhausted itself militarily , economically , and spiritually , will one day be found washed up on some foreign shore , a hapless Gulliver overrun by hordes of angry Lilliputians and bound by a thousand threads to their feuds .
When the history of the American Empire is written , any fair and objective author will have to concur that it did n’t have to turn out that way : if we choose the prerogatives of Empire over the ascetic ideals of our republican tradition , we go willingly to our doom .
Richmond is set to become the largest city in America with a Green Party mayor , after the election Tuesday of Gayle McLaughlin , and party leaders say her victory thrusts a group once defined as middle - class environmentalists into a new role as a multicultural force in local politics .
In the past decade , Green Party members have served as mayors in nearly two dozen predominantly white cities in California , from Sebastopol to Santa Cruz and Davis .
But the strong showing of McLaughlin in the gritty , cash - strapped East Bay city , where about three - fourths of the 103,000 residents are minorities , would mark an enormous shift in the political demographic of Green Party support .
" The defining thing is that this is a direct election in a major urban center , so it is definitely our biggest win , " said Susan King , the Green Party 's California spokeswoman .
" The victory signals for us that we are moving beyond our base , that we can have an impact in minority communities and actually have some pull with working - class people . "
With most ballots counted , McLaughlin , a 54 - year - old city councilwoman , leads Mayor Irma Anderson by 192 votes in a three - way race for mayor .
McLaughlin received 37.2 percent of the votes , followed by Anderson with 36.1 and businessman Gary Bell with 26.1 .
The rest of the tallied votes were for write - in candidates .
Anderson refused to concede defeat Wednesday , saying she would wait until all the provisional and late absentee ballots are counted , which will take at least a week .
But few people believe she can make up the deficit .
McLaughlin , who was elected to the council four years ago , said being an environmentalist allowed her to understand the troubles in Richmond 's neighborhoods , including high rates of childhood asthma in areas near refineries and heavy industry .
" I stand for a sustainable environment , " said McLaughlin , who helped found a local group called Solar Richmond .
" We have too much pollution in Richmond .
We need to clean many toxic sites left by many years of manufacturing . "
McLaughlin , a former schoolteacher , said her campaign was all about promoting the " people 's interests over corporate interests . "
To combat the city 's high crime , she said she will launch a job corps for local youth so young people can help with street repair and park maintenance .
" I want to put 1,000 kids to work throughout my term , " McLaughlin said .
" We should be dealing with our existing neighborhoods and our existing quality of life .
That will bring in businesses . "
Jack Citrin , a political science professor at UC Berkeley , attributed the election results more to dissatisfaction with Richmond 's current mayor than any ideological shift in the city toward Green Party politics .
Such dissatisfaction motivated Terrell Temple , whose parents , grandparents and an aunt live near John F. Kennedy Park in central Richmond , where a man was shot to death recently while sitting in a car parked across the street from one of the " tent cities " erected in a stand against violence .
" I have an aunt that lives on the other side of the park , and she got held up at gunpoint going from her car to her house ( late last year ) , " said Temple , 41 , who grew up in Richmond and now lives in Fairfield .
" I 'm for any change that will help out in this city -- anything that will help stop the violence is a plus . "
Bruce Cain , another UC Berkeley political science professor , said the key question is whether McLaughlin can solve the nuts - and - bolts issues of municipal leadership .
" In the end , whether you are progressive or conservative , you have to provide the everyday services that people expect out of city government -- the lights , the water , the police , the fire , the emergency services , " Cain said .
" What the new mayor does in Richmond will help develop an image people have about what the Green Party is and whether it can govern . "
Larry Robinson , a green mayor in Sebastopol in 2001 and 2005 , said the Green Party focuses on creating sustainable communities .
" The issues that we are concerned about in our white , middle - class communities are the things that working - class and minority communities are concerned about -- economic and environmental justice , affordable housing , a living wage , good schools for our kids and health care , " Robinson said .
McLaughlin is set to become California 's first elected Green Party mayor .
All 22 previous green mayors in the state , including mayors in Fairfax , Sonoma , Sebastopol , Davis , Arcata and Santa Cruz , were appointed as part of a mayoral rotation .
In all , 31 U.S. cities have had green mayors , beginning in 1991 with Kelly Weaverling 's election in Cordova , Alaska , amid widespread anger over the Exxon Valdez oil spill .
Larry Barnett , a two - time Green Party mayor in Sonoma , said McLaughlin 's victory in Richmond shows that communities are more interested in solutions than they are in partisan politics .
" I think people are simply looking for authentic candidates and officeholders who have values that the voters can identify with , " Barnett said .
" As a Green Party candidate , you are not tied down to an affiliation with either political party . "

I drive slower these days .
While I used to be a bit of a driving maniac ( ask my wife ) , passing everybody and stepping hard on my accelerator , I would also get increasingly frustrated when people would drive slow and keep me from driving fast , or cut me off .
Driving was a stressful experience .
Not anymore .
These days , driving is a much more calm , serene experience , and I enjoy it much more .
I look around at other drivers and wonder whether they really need to get to where they ’re going so fast , and whether they ’ll slow down when they get there .
I wonder if it ’s really worth burning all that gas and getting so angry and risking so many lives .
And then I think about other things , because driving for me has become a time of contemplation .
I heartily recommend driving slower — for many reasons , but one of the best reasons is that it has made me a much happier person .
It ’s such a simple step to take , but it makes an incredibly big difference .
Recently a reader named Vadim wrote to me with the following comment on speeding :
I have recently acquired a TomTom GPS in car navigator .
Amongst its many astonishing features , it has a display on it that shows you your estimated arrival time for the route you are traveling …
Now here is the kicker ; I used to routinely travel at 130 % of the speed limit everywhere … I thought that I was keeping myself alert and saving time .
My TomTom , however , disagreed .
In fact anywhere I traveled ( and I routinely drive more than 100 miles ) I would only shave off 5 - 10 minutes of the estimated arrival time !
5 - 10 minuts of time that is then wasted because I was n’t late to start off with !
Since then , I adopted a new way of driving , I never speed .
I love this comment , and it inspired me to write this post .
People often think they ’re saving time by driving faster , but it ’s not very much time , and it ’s not worth your sanity or safety .
Here are just 5 reasons to drive slower :
Save gas .
The best ways to save gas ( besides driving less or driving a fuel - efficient vehicle ) are to avoid excessive idling , more gradual accelerating and decelerating , and driving slower ( see report on Edmunds.com ) .
With gas prices so high these days , wasting gas by driving unnecessarily fast is something we ca n’t afford .
Save lives .
Driving fast can kill people ( including the driver ) .
Two stats : Traffic is the biggest single killer of 12 - 16 year olds .
Surprisingly , at 35 mph you are twice as likely to kill someone you hit as at 30 m ph .
( Source )
Faster driving gives you a shorter amount of time to respond to something in your path , and even a fraction of a second can mean the difference between life and death .
Drive slower for your safety and that of those around you … especially drive slow around runners , cyclists , schools , and neighborhoods with kids on the streets .
Save time ?
As Vadim pointed out in his email , while you think you ’re saving time by driving faster , it ’s not a lot of time .
And that small amount of time you ’re saving is n’t worth it , considering the other factors on this list .
Better yet , start out a few minutes early and you ’ll arrive at the same time as someone who drove faster but started later , and you ’ll arrive much happier than that person to boot .
Save your sanity .
The above three reasons are very important ones , but for me the most noticeable difference has been the huge drop in stress levels when I drive .
Far from being a crazy experience , driving is actually a relaxing and pleasant experience now .
I no longer get road rage , because I simply do n’t care whether other drivers are going slow or cutting me off .
Simplify your life .
This is related to the one above , but expanded .
In addition to saving your stress levels , driving slower can reduce many other complications as well — the headache of accidents and speeding tickets , for one , going to the gas station too often , for another , but also the hectic pace of life .
Why must we rush through life ?
Slow down and enjoy life more .
If we ’re always in a hurry to get places , when will we get to our destination and finally be happy ?
Life is a journey — make it a pleasant one .
OK , assuming that you want to drive slower , here are some of the tips that worked best for me :
Play relaxing music .
My favorite is anything by Jack Johnson or Ben Harper .
But anything that relaxes you is good : “ You Sexy Thing ” by Hot Chocolate , “ Drive Slow ” by Kanye West , anything by Otis Redding or Aretha , “ Feels Like Rain ” by John Hyatt , “ Son of a Preacher Man ” by Aretha or Dusty Springfield , Radiohead , Prince , Sade …
Whatever you choose , enjoy it , and relax .

Ignore other drivers .
This was my problem before .
I cared so much about what the other drivers were doing , that it would stress me out .
At times , it would cause me to drive faster to spite other drivers ( awful , I know ) .
Now , I just ignore them .
Well , I pay attention so I do n’t crash into anyone , but I do n’t worry about what they ’re doing or how dumb they are .

Leave early .
If you speed because you ’re running late , make it a habit of getting ready early and leaving early .
Now you do n’t have to worry about being late , and you can enjoy the ride .

Brainstorm .
I like to use my drive time for contemplation .
I come up with ideas for things to write about , I think about my day ( either the day to come or the day in review ) , I think about my life as a whole and where I want to go .

Keep to the right .
If you drive slower than the other crazy drivers out there , it ’s wise to keep out of their way if possible and keep to the right .
While I tend to ignore other drivers who might get mad at me for driving slow ( I do n’t care about them anymore ) , it ’s good to be polite .

As a software developer what practices do you consider essential ?
Which practices are must - haves that you would refuse to build software without ?
I believe that producing good software is hard , and that we software developers need all the help we can get in developing software .
I have put together a list of the top five practices that I find to be the most helpful in making it easier to produce good software :
These practices are generally applicable across the board : for new application development and ongoing application maintenance , for small teams and large teams , for custom enterprise software for a single customer and commercial shrink - wrap software , and for any language or technology .
The specifics of how the practice is implemented will of course vary depending on the nature of the project .
Automated Tests
Automated unit tests provide a convenient way to test the software 's functionality both during initial development and later as the software is maintained .
This is especially essential during maintenance when the original developers are no longer around .
Another benefit of automated tests is that they impose a design constraint upon the software that it be testable .
This frequently helps improve the overall design of the software by reducing the amount of coupling between different components .
In order to be effective at finding defects , automated tests need to be written effectively .
I have come across many examples of poorly written unit tests that are ineffective at finding defects .
My article
How to write good unit tests discusses this in detail .
Version Control
The use of version control software to manage changes to the software is indispensable for teams larger than one person .
Some of the more important benefits of version control include helping coordinate concurrent changes to the code base , providing a history of changes , tracking the versions making up a release , and supporting parallel development on different versions of the software .
I even use version control for my personal projects at home , where I am the sole developer .
( Read about my experience using Subversion . )
Some of the problems I have observed when version control is not used are : each team member developing with a slightly different version of the software , resulting in chaos when it is time to deploy the software , and variations in the software installed in different environments , with no one able to explain for sure what the correct version is .
Refactoring
The design of a piece of software is a critical attribute for determining its quality .
While good design does not imply good software , bad design generally does imply bad software .
Refactoring is the key practice by which the quality of the design can be maintained and even incrementally improved as the software changes .
Refactoring is a potentially risky activity because of the possibility of introducing defects .
This risk is mitigated when the software has a comprehensive suite of automated tests .
Repeatable Build and Deploy
Every software team has some kind of method for building and deploying their software .
I wanted to emphasize repeatability because that is the essential aspect of this practice .
A build and deploy process that you can repeat consistently across team members , across environments , and across different versions of the software is critical to successfully shipping your software or deploying it into production .
This practice only works effectively when version control is used to define the official version of the software being built and deployed .
A related aspect of this practice is keeping your active development mainline in good shape , which I define as having the code compile and pass all unit tests .
This allows developers to reliably check out , build , and work with the latest changes , which helps avoid integration hell .
For the last while I have been involved with software deployment and I have written a couple of articles on the topic : Architecting for Deployability and Designing for Deployability .
I have encountered teams using ad - hoc build and deploy processes .
I have observed such teams often experiencing production failures due to the incorrect implementation of changes into the production environment .
Communication
I see the other practices frequently mentioned by software consultants and software development books , but the practice of communication seems to receive less attention .
However , I consider it equally essential .
Frequent and open communication between team members , across teams , and across layers of the organization are critical to producing good software .
Successful large open source software projects are excellent examples of communication in action : they have multiple mailing lists , standards for discussing changes and informing others of patches , and defect or task tracking tools for communicating issues and task assignments .
When communication is lacking or ineffective within a team , then I have observed work being done by one team member conflicting with or disrupting the work of other team members .
Poor communication between teams can be more serious : teams working on interdependent applications or components need to keep the other teams informed and involved when the interfaces between them change .
I have seen failure to do so lead to schedule slippages due to the additional work being identified too late , and even production failures .
You may feel that some of these practices are so obvious that they are not worth discussing .
For every one of these practices , however , I have encountered individuals who did not see the value of the practice or who only adopted it grudgingly .
If you or your team does not follow one of these practices , I strongly recommend giving it a try .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Senate Republicans blocked a vote of no confidence in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on Monday , dashing Democratic hopes of embarrassing Gonzales and his boss , President George W. Bush , with a formal demand for his ouster .
A Senate no -confidence vote in a Cabinet member would have no force of law in the U.S. system of government .
Earlier on Monday , Bush called the resolution “ meaningless . ”
But Democrats wanted to pile pressure on Bush to fire the country ’s top law enforcement officer over his handling of the controversial firing of U.S. prosecutors , which critics portray as a politically motivated purge .
The Republicans stopped the no-confidence vote under Senate rules that allow a minority to block consideration of a measure .
Their move came despite months of searing criticism of Gonzales by members of both parties .
Seven Republicans split with their party and sided with Democrats .
Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter said the Democratic motion was “ political chicanery ” but he had decided the interests of the country , including needed improvements at the Justice Department , were more important .
“ There is no doubt that the ( Justice ) department at the present time is in shambles , ” Specter said .
“ Have I lost confidence in Attorney General Gonzales ?
Absolutely , yes . ”
Instead of defending Gonzales , Republican critics of the Democratic resolution argued it was a waste of time as well as a political stunt sponsored by the head of the Senate Democrats ’ campaign committee , New York Sen. Charles Schumer .
“ The American people may not have particular confidence , one way or another , in this attorney general , but this is not an election of the attorney general , ” Sen .
Trent Lott said before the vote .
“ This is not the British Parliament , and I hope it never will become the British Parliament , ” where no -confidence motions in members of the government can be brought , said Lott , a Mississippi Republican .
“ This is all about partisan politics . ”
The Democrats have a majority of 51 in the Senate , counting two independents who often vote with them -- although on Monday , one of those , Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , did not .
Democrats needed 60 votes to scale the procedural hurdle erected by Republicans , but got only 53 , with 38 voting against .
‘ NO WRONGDOING ’
Gonzales has refused to step down and is supported by the Republican president , his longtime mentor from Texas .
Bush , traveling in Europe , dismissed the Democrats ’ move as political , declaring , “ There ’s no wrongdoing . ”
The Justice Department said after the vote that Gonzales would remain focused on the “ important issues ” of his job .
“ With so many pressing issues facing our country such as the threat of terrorism and the danger posed by gangs and violent criminals , we look forward to continuing to work with Congress to identify appropriate solutions to address these issues , ” the Justice Department statement said .
Schumer , sponsor of the no-confidence motion , said he knew there were few if any precedents in the U.S. Senate .
“ The situation at the Department of Justice is also without precedent , ” Schumer said , adding Gonzales had “ failed miserably . ”
Both the House and Senate have been investigating Gonzales for months over the firings of nine U.S. attorneys last year .
Criticism of Gonzales intensified after an April Senate hearing in which he said many times he could not remember details of what had happened during the firings .

Thanks to my parents ’ genes , I simply do not grow facial hair .
I never have , unless you count microscopic stubble in the same ranks as a full beard .
It certainly makes me a little jealous , especially when there are groups around promoting goodwill and happiness through the growth of a beard .
So imagine my surprise when I found out that facial hair has had a much more troubled history than I first imagined .
Coming in many shapes , sizes and colors , the beard is a prominent feature on most men who do not shave ( and the occasional woman – though let ’s not go there ) .
Today , pogonotrophy is normally accepted in society ; but in the past , growing a beard could cause quite a few problems .
Sprouting your manly facial hair could get you taxed , be a sign of rebellion against the church – or could even get you killed .
At the least , removal of facial hair can be painful .
Archaeologists have found evidence that men started to shave off their beards as early as 100,000 BC .
However , the the first razors discovered by archaeologists date back to 30,000 BC , and were made of flint .
Thus , before then shaving was a painful ordeal .
One who wanted a bare face would use two sea shells to grip their hair , then pull ; a method which sounds even more distressing than getting a bikini wax .
Beards were in the vogue in Greek society , where a healthy beard was a sign of wisdom and knowledge .
But then Alexander the Great came along and changed all that , for the sake of the military .
He forced his soldiers to shave for fear that an enemy could use a man ’s beard to his disadvantage in close combat .
He thought that the enemy would grab it during hand - to - hand struggles , though I would be more worried about the pain of someone ripping my beard off .
In contrast , the slaves , who were normally made to shave , were then ordered to grow out their stubble .
Far be it for slaves to be equally fashionable as their masters .
The beard eventually came back into fashion , but a few rulers objected to their presence .
In 1698 , Peter I of Russia commanded his courtiers and officials to cut off their beards .
To add insult to injury , he would sometimes personally shave the beards of his noblemen .
Those wishing to keep their beards had to pay a tax – 100 rubles each year – as well as carry around a medal proclaiming that “ beards are a ridiculous ornament . ”
A similar taxation was passed by England ’s Henry VIII in 1535 – who , hypocritically , continued to grow a beard of his own .
It ’s good to be the king .
Luckily for English clergymen , priests already kept their faces clean - shaven as a sign of their celibacy .
So , when the protestant reformation began in the 16th century , protestant priests would grow their beards out in protest of the old ways .
In this case , size mattered ; the greater the beard , the greater the protest .
This move was well - timed with the reign of Elizabeth I , who decided to tax beards again in the same vein as Henry VIII – either for her dislike of beards , or for money .
A government ’s got to generate revenue somehow , right ?
The growing ( or cutting ) of a beard has had some important symbolic references in the past .
Roman boys would not remove any facial hair until they had reached adulthood , then would shave as an offering to the gods .
More towards the East , one punishment for crimes was to have one ’s beard removed in public .
In America , an Amish man will keep a clean - shaven face until he has married , after which he will grow a beard which he will keep forever .
In the Chatti , a German tribe , a man was not allowed to shave until he had killed an enemy !
In modern times , many police and military forces prohibit beards for one important reason that came up during World War I .
In order to get a clean seal on a gas mask , you must have a clean face , so soldiers made sure to shave .
They may or may not have been worried about the pulling of beards during hand - to - hand combat , as Alexander the Great was .
Regardless , in a choice between shaving my beard and dying a horrible death via biochemical warfare , I ’d go with the one that involves staying alive .
Of course , I cannot grow a beard , and maybe I should be grateful for that .
Given the colorful history of beards , I may be better off without one .
In England , polygamous husbands can claim extra state benefits for their harem , even though bigamy is illegal :
Polygamous husbands settling in Britain with multiple wives can claim extra benefits for their “ harems ” even though bigamy is a crime in the UK , it has emerged .
Opposition MPs are demanding an urgent change in the law , claiming that the Government is recognising and rewarding a custom which has no legal status and which is “ alien ” to this country ’s cultural traditions .
Officials said yesterday a review was now under way into whether the state should continue to pay out income support , jobseeker ’s allowance and housing and council tax benefits to ‘ extra ’ spouses .
Islamic law allows a man to take up to four wives , providing he can provide for them fairly and equally .
But British law only ever recognises one spouse , while bigamy is punishable by up to seven years in jail .
However , if a husband and his wives arrive and settle in Britain having wed in a country where polygamy is legal , then the UK benefits system recognises his extra wives as dependents and pays them accordingly .

4 Privet Drive , Little Whinging — Back to Top
The News :
In the book , it ’s been a month since the school year ended during which Harry has been in isolation from the wizard world while staying as usual with his non-wizard Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon on Privet Drive .
Harry ’s Aunt and Uncle are listening to the news , while Harry hides outside under their window trying to listen in on the news , too .
There ’s a loud cracking noise ( much like when a wizard Apparates / Disapparates ) that alerts his Uncle , who catches Harry and reprimands him for sneaking around .

Owls :
Owls deliver messages to Harry at 4 Privet Drive from his friends Ron and Hermione , but the letters are brief and contain no news from the wizarding world .
Harry ’s frustration and feelings of isolation grow stronger and on his 15th birthday , he ’s so angry with his friends , he throws out the gifts they sent .

Nightmares :
We find out that Harry has been having restless , sleepless nights with nightmares about Cedric dying ( this happens at the end of Goblet of Fire ; Cedric is killed on Voldemort ’s orders during the Triwizard Tournament ) , and feelings of helplessness .
Also , the scar on his forehead is burning more often now .
Dementors Attack — Back to Top
At The Playground : Harry goes to a nearby playground .
This is where the movie begins .
Harry ’s bully cousin and his friends appear and Dudley does his best to taunt Harry with by mocking what Harry calls out in his sleep ( “ Do n’t kill Cedric ! ” ) .
Just as the two are about to come to blows , the sky grows dark and Dementors attack Harry and Dudley .
Harry uses the Patronus Charm to save them .
( In the book , Harry produces silver vapor the first two times and on the third try he gets a full Patronus — a stag — which defeats the Dementors ; in the movie , he does the spell once and gets only vapor , which here is enough to get rid of the Dementors . )
Once the Dementors are gone , Harry ’s neighbor Mrs. Figg shows up and tells Harry NOT to put his wand away .

She explains to Harry that Dumbledore has had people watching Harry at Privet Drive to make sure he ’s safe .
The person patrolling that night — Mundungus Fletcher — left his post early and that ’s when the Dementors attacked .
Mundungus is not mentioned nor does he appear in the movie , but is in the book several times .
He ’s a member of the Order of the Phoenix ( the secret society found by Dumbledore ) and is often at its headquarters ( much to the dislike of Mrs. Weasley ) .

Expulsion : Harry brings
Dudley back home and gets the blame for Dudley ’s condition .
Then , a letter comes from the Improper Use of Magic Office stating that Harry is expelled from Hogwarts School for using magic in the presence of a Muggle ( non- Wizard ) .
In the book , it ’s here that Harry admits to his family why he ’s expelled and his Aunt slips up and says how she ’s heard of Dementors before .
Harry gets more letters , from Arthur Weasley and Sirius Black warning him not to leave the house .
Another letter from the Improper Use of Magic Office arrives to say that the previous statement has been amended and that Harry will now have to face a disciplinary hearing , which will decide if he can retain his wand and continue at Hogwarts .
In the movie , only one letter from the Improper Use office arrives , and it ’s the one telling Harry he ’s been expelled .
Dumbledore ’s Letter to Aunt Petunia — Back to Top
A Warning : A revealing scene takes place here in the book that is NOT in the movie : Harry tries to get his Aunt and Uncle to understand that the dark wizard ( Lord Voldemort ) who killed his parents has returned and is after him .
They are so outraged by Harry ’s talk of magic ( of which they ’ve always denied the existence ) and fearful that Harry is bringing danger to their house , that Uncle Vernon tells Harry to leave .
That ’s when a “ howler ” letter shows up from Dumbledore to Aunt Petunia that reads , “ Remember my last , Petunia . ”
Because of this Aunt Petunia reluctantly states that Harry will have to continue to stay with them , but he ’s not allowed to leave the house .
This scene is important because it reveals that Dumbledore and Petunia had an agreement regarding Harry staying with her and that there will be consequences if Petunia breaks this agreement .
Hedwig — Back to Top
Hedwig :
In the book , after the Dementor attack , Harry has his owl Hedwig send letters to Ron , Hermione , and Sirius demanding information .
He tells Hedwig to keep pecking at them until they provide decent - length answers to his queries .
He goes without a reply for four days , and on the last night , his family leaves the house and members of the Order of the Phoenix come to rescue him .
( We find out in the book that the family left thinking they were going to the All - England Best - Kept Suburban Lawn Competition , but none such event exists .
It was sent by the Order just to get them out of the house . )
None of this is mentioned in the film , though we do see Harry ’s family leave him alone on the night he ’s rescued by members of the Order .
And in the film , they leave on the night of the Dementor attack , and it ’s to take Dudley to the hospital .
** One thing I noticed is that in the film , when the rescue team comes , Hedwig is shown in her cage , as there was no previous scene to show Harry send her on the errand .
Harry does n’t appear to take her with him during the escape and there is no explanation as to how she later on shows up at Hogwarts .
( There ’s also no scene to show Tonks helping Harry pack his stuff . )

Injury :
Not in the film , but there ’s a time when Hedwig brings Harry a letter and he sees that the owl has been injured .
He brings her to Professor Grubbly - Plank ( the teacher who is covering for Hagrid in Care of Magical Creatures ) , who assessed that Hedwig ’s been attacked .
Harry , Ron , and Hermione think that Umbridge is behind the attack , and that she ’s reading all mail in and out of Hogwarts .
The Rescue From Privet Drive — Back to Top
The Rescue Team :
In the movie , Mad - Eye Moody , Nymphadora Tonks , and Kingsley Shacklebolt ( along with two unnamed characters who I think are Elphias Doge and Emmeline Vance ) are on the rescue squad .
It ’s here that Harry learns that Dumbledore has persuaded the Ministry of Magic not to expell Harry ; instead , Harry will face a disciplinary hearing .
In the book , Dedalus Diggle , Sturgis Podmore , and Hestia Jones are also there to rescue Harry , but they do not appear at all in the film .
More importantly , it ’s supposed to be Remus Lupin who leads this rescue team , but in the movie he ’s not on - screen until they get to the Order headquarters .
It is in this part of the book that we learn that Tonks ’s mother was a witch , her father a Muggle , and that she ’s an Auror as well as a Metamorphmagus — someone who can change their appearance at will , a trait she was born with .

Escape :
The movie and book both show that the rescue team gets from 4 Privet Drive to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix ( located at 12 Grimmauld Place in London ) via broom .
But the movie leaves you to wonder why they are flying without worrying about being detected by Muggles .
In the book we find out that Moody put a Disillusionment Charm on Harry to conceal him before they set out .
The Order of the Phoenix Headquarters — Back to Top
Reunion :
Once at headquarters , Harry meets up with Ron and Hermione .
He ’s very angry at them for not keeping him abreast for the last month .
They explain that it was under Dumbledore ’s orders that they stayed quiet .
While this is shown in the film , there ’s very little dialogue in this scene .
In the book , there ’s a lot being said , Harry really opens up about how angry and frustrated he was , and his friends give lengthy explanations about their behavior .
Also , in the book , this is where we see that Hedwig is still at headquarters , and Ron and Hermione show Harry the peck marks on their hands from Hedwig , who followed Harry ’s orders to “ keep pecking . ”

Bill and Fleur : A minor storyline is left out of the movie : Eldest Weasley sibling Bill and his relationship with Fleur Delacour .
Fleur is from the Beauxbatons school and was one of the champions who competed against Harry in the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire .
At the beginning of the book , Bill is there at Order headquarters and we find out that he ’s Bill is back from his job in Egypt and is now working a desk job .
A relationship between Bill and Fleur is implied , as Fred tells the group that Bill ’s been giving Fleur private English lessons .

Percy Weasley : Another storyline omitted from the movie : Another Weasley son , the ambitious Percy , who works for the Ministry of Magic , has excommunicated his family .
Percy has sided with his boss , Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic who ’s made it clear to his employees that anyone siding with Dumbledore ( thereby believing that Lord Voldemort has returned ) would be out of a job .
Percy eventually writes a letter to Ron warning him to sever all ties with Harry Potter and NOT to follow the path of his parents and other siblings .

Scourgify :
While at the headquarters , the book goes into detail about how the members of the Order have been trying to “ scourgify ” ( clean up ) the house , which belonged to Sirius Black ’s family .
There ’s parts where they are trying to get rid of boggarts ( shape - shifters that take the form of their victim ’s worst fear ) and the paintings of Black ’s ancestors on the walls are making derogatory comments at them .
In the book , Kreacher , the house - elf bound to the Black family , has a lot of dialogue , where he openly disapproves of the Order members taking over the house .

Black Family Tree :
The movie does have a scene where Sirius shows
Harry the tapestry of the Black family tree and explains why he was disowned by his family ( they were pure - blood wizards loyal to Voldemort , while Sirius aligned himself with Dumbledore and had mixed - blood friends ) .
The book goes into detail as to what Black ’s mother was like and about other relatives that were disowned ( turns out Tonks was too — she ’s Sirius ’s cousin ) .
It also explains why the Order ca n’t get rid of certain items in the house ( Black ’s mom put a lot of sticking charms on these items ; also , Kreacher keeps taking the items out of the trash ) .
The Ministry of Magic and the Hearing — Back to Top
Kingsley Shacklebolt :
In the book , we find out that not only is Kingsley Shacklebolt a member of the Order , but he also works at the Ministry of Magic and is the person in charge of finding Sirius Black , who is still “ at large ” for his escape from Azkaban ( we learned in Prisoner of Azkaban that he was convicted of killing Harry ’s parents James and Lily , even though it was really Voldemort who did it . )
It ’s Shacklebolt who keeps the investigation in limbo by passing on false information about Sirius ’s whereabouts , hence the reason why Sirius has not yet been caught .
Even so , Sirius must stay hidden at headquarters and cannot even go out as Padfoot , the dog he ’s able to transform into ( he ’s an Animagus ) because it ’s assumed that people are aware of his capabilities by now .

Fudge ’s Fear :
This is touched upon in the movie , but Fudge is afraid to admit that Voldemort is back .
He ’d rather ignore the truth and persecute everyone who tries to bring it to light .
His cause is helped along by the Daily Prophet newspaper , which consistently prints derogatory information about Dumbledore , as well as about Harry ( we see in the movie the headline “ The Boy Who Lies ? ” on the paper ’s front page ) .
In the book , we learn that thanks to Fudge , Dumbledore has been voted out of his position as Chairman of the International Confederation of Wizards , demoted from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot ( the Wizard High Court ) , and there was talk of taking away his Order of Merlin , First Class .

The Hearing :
In the movie , Mr. Weasley brings Harry to the disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic ( Mr. Weasley works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts division ) .
The movie does a great job of bringing us into this magic place and the hearing goes along much like the events in the book ( though the book , of course , has a lengthier hearing ) .
There ’s extra information about the MoM building and all of its floors and we see an area for Auror Headquarters .

Sturgis Podmore : He ’s a member of the Order .
He does n’t appear in the film , but in the book we see he ’s part of the team rescuing Harry .
Later on in the book , we find out that he ’s been arrested and sentenced to six months in the prison Azkaban for trying to go through a door at the Ministry of Magic .
Harry realizes that Sturgis was trying to get into the Department of Mysteries , where the Prophecies are kept ; Hermione deduces that Sturgis — who was actually stationed to guard the Prophecy about Harry — must have been under the Imperius Curse cast by Lucius Malfoy , who was at the Ministry the day of Harry ’s hearing .

Escape from Azkaban :
In the film , we see there ’s a breakout in Azkaban , which frees Bellatrix Lestrange .
The book explains the prison break and talks about the nine other prisoners who escaped and why they were in Azkaban to begin with .
The night before the escape , Harry gets the sense that Lord Voldemort is the happiest he ’s been in 14 years .
The next day is when he finds out the convicted Death Eaters escaped .
The Ministry blames Sirius Black for the breakout .
The Woes of Mrs. Weasley — Back to Top
Chapter 9 “ The Woes of Mrs. Weasley ” :
This chapter contains extra information that is not in the movie .
The gang at headquarters celebrates Harry ’s acquittal ; talk about how Fudge is in league with Lucius Malfoy ( a known Death Eater ) , especially after Malfoy and Fudge are seen together at the Ministry of Magic after Harry ’s hearing ; a discussion about how Sirius wants Harry to remain with him at headquarters and how Sirius sometimes thinks that Harry is actually James ( who was best friends with Sirius ) ; a debate about S.P.E.W ; talk about everyone ’s new classes and schoolbooks and pondering who would be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher this year ( a position that appears to be cursed ) ; talk of how Harry gave George and Fred his Triwizard Tournament winnings to open their joke shop , and that is still being kept from Mrs. Weasley ; Ron and Hermione getting their Prefect notices , but Harry does n’t get one ( a storyline left out of the movie completely ) ;
Ron getting a new broom from his parents as a reward for making Prefect ; Harry ’s internal resentment of his friends for making Prefect , something he should have gotten and yet another thing that makes him an outcast from his friends .
In this chapter , we learn that Tonks , James , and Sirius never made Prefect ( because they were always in detention ) , but Lupin did .
Ron ’s appointing makes him the fourth Weasley child to make Prefect ( all of the sons made it except for the troublemaking twins George and Fred ) .
One scene in the movie from this chapter is Harry seeing the photo of the original Order of the Phoenix from 15 years prior , which included many people killed by Voldemort and his followers , including his own parents .
In the film , it ’s Sirius who shows Harry the photo ; in the book , it ’s Moody and we learn the names of everyone in the photo — which includes Dumbledore ’s brother Aberforth .
Hogwarts Express and Arrival at Hogwarts — Back to Top
Hogwarts Express : Harry , Hermione , Ron , Ginny , Fred , and George take the Hogwarts Express to get to the school .
In the film , there ’s a quick view of them on the train and Harry has a short altercation with Draco Malfoy .
In the book , it ’s on this ride that they meet up with Luna Lovegood , the quirky little blonde girl whose father is the editor of The Quibbler .
Harry , Ginny , and Neville Longbottom ride in the train car with Luna while Ron and Hermione do their Prefect duties .
Neville talks about his love of Herbology and accidentally squirts Harry with the juice of a Mimbulus mimbletonia cactus .
The juice , which smells like “ rancid manure , ” drenches Harry just as his crush Cho Chang stops by to say hello to him .
Also , it ’s on this ride that we find out that Draco Malfoy has also made Prefect and is already harassing the first - years with his new position .

The Sorting Hat :
It did n’t make it into Goblet of Fire and not into OotP either .
This is the magic hat that decides which of the four houses — Gryffindor , Slytherin , Hufflepuff , or Ravenclaw ) — a first - year will be placed .
In the book , the Sorting Hat does something unusual :
It typically sings a tune describing the different qualities it looks for and its rule of sorting .
This time , the Hat gives advice and warnings and goes so far as to say , “ For our Hogwarts is in danger , From external deadly foes . ”

Dolores Umbridge :
She works for the Ministry of Magic and is very loyal to Fudge .
She becomes the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher .
In the movie , she gives a speech about how “ progress for the sake of progress should be discouraged . ”
The film only touches on what she had to say .
In the book , her speech is quite lengthy and in both mediums , it ’s Hermione who understands the new professor ’s implications — that the Ministry of Magic is interferring at Hogwarts .

Weasley Twins : Throughout the book , George and Fred continuously attempt to test out their joke projects on the students and it ’s Hermione who is constantly trying to stop them ( because it ’s her duty as Prefect ) .
Much later in the film , we see the Weasley twins fed up with what ’s happening at the school , so they decide to quit their academic studies and concentrate on their joke shop business .
We see them setting off amazing fireworks while flying around Umbridge ’s classroom while a test is in progress .
In the book , the twins set the fireworks off throughout the school on Umbridge ’s first day as Headmistress .
Any attempts to extinguish the fireworks only makes them stronger and / or duplicated .
It ’s at this time that Hermione says she ’s feeling “ rebellious . ”
The twins continue on at school and it ’s not until weeks later when Umbridge becomes Headmaster that they decide to drop out for good ( complete with yet another spectacular send - off ) .

Harry and Luna :
In the movie , Harry and Luna have a conversation in the forest .
Luna tells him that Voldemort wants him to feel isolated from everyone because that way he ’s not as much of a threat .
They talk about the black horses that only they can see ( actually , only people who have seen death can see them ) called Thestrals .
This scene is not in the book , but the Thestrals are explained during Hagrid ’s Care of Magical Creatures class ( one that Umbridge comes to evaluate him ) .
Also , in the movie , after the Hogwarts train ride , Harry and Luna shared a ride up to the school and only the two of them could see the winged - horses pulling the cart ( though , in the book , Neville is supposed to be able to see them , but he does n’t seem to be able to in the movie ) .
Quidditch — Back to Top
Quidditch :
The sport is completely gone from the film .
In the book , Harry is back on the team and this time , Ron is on it too .
This is a big deal and comes into play in their relationship .
Ron is a good player , but he messes up a lot when he ’s nervous .
Some of his disastrous moments prompt the other teams to mock him with chants of “ Weasley is our King . ”

When they return , the game is over .
Hearing the familiar mocking chant of “ Weasley is our King ” they assume that Gryfinddor lost the match .
Turns out they won and Ron was the star of the game .
The cheers were actually “ Weasley is our King , he did n’t let the Quaffle in . ”

Banned For Life :
At one point , Harry gets into so much trouble with Umbridge that she bans him for life from playing Quidditch and takes his broom , keeping it locked up in the school ’s dungeon .
O.W.L.s and Defense Against the Dark Arts — Back to Top
O.W.L.s :
As fifth - years , Ron , Hermione , and Harry have to study for these tests , the score of which will decide whether they can continue to study a certain course .
The film does very little to show the importance of these tests and how studying for them takes up most of the students ’ time .
There ’s an entire chapter devoted to the O.W.L. examinations and it goes into how Harry did on certain exams and how the students prepped for them .
Most importantly , Harry , who wants to be an Auror when he graduates , must get high marks in several subjects to do this .
This makes all the suffering he goes through this year even worse , because his studies are so much harder .

Defense Against the Dark Arts :
In the first session of Defense Against the Dark Arts with Umbridge teaching , Harry clashes with the professor ’s new teaching style ( all theory , no practice ) and gets detention .
In the book , although he ’s the only one to get detention , a lot of other students raise their objections to the new course study .
Harry gets sent to his head - of - house , Professor McGonagall , and we find out that although she ’s very unhappy with how Umbridge is handling things and disapproves of her representing the Ministry of Magic .
McGonagall realizes that Umbridge is dangerous and warns Harry to keep out of trouble with her for his own sake .

Hogwarts High Inquisitor : Eventually , Umbridge is made ( by the Ministry of Magic ) the Hogwarts High Inquisitor and we see in the movie that she questions all the professors , looking to get rid of any of them she does not deem fit for the position .
She also makes declarations against a lot of student activities and it ’s in the book that she eventually bans for life Harry and the Weasley twins from playing Quidditch .
The movie also shows her giving out physically painful punishments , even to the younger students .
She appoints several students to be part of her Inquistorial Squad .
In the book , we see that it ’s mainly the children of Death Eaters , like Draco Malfoy , all of whom take pleasure in harassing the other students with their powerful position .
Harry and Cho — Back to Top
Harry ’s Isolation :
In the movie , we see that Harry has written a letter to Sirius about how he feels lonelier than ever .
In the book , he also inquires about the whereabouts of Hagrid .
He goes to the Owlery to get Hedwig to deliver the message and it ’s there he bumps into Cho ( much like he did in Goblet of Fire ) .
Cho tells
Harry that he was brave to stand up to Umbridge at the first session of their Defense Against the Dark Arts class .

The Kiss :
In the film , we see Harry and Cho standing under the mistletoe and that ’s when they kiss .
In the book , the same scene occurs , except it ends BEFORE the kiss .
Later on , Harry admits to Ron and Hermione that he kissed Cho and he explains his feelings about it the same way it ’s shown in the movie .
( I wanted to point this out , because I ’m glad the actual kiss was not in the book , because it makes what happens in Book 6 so much better , and that ’s all I ’ll say on that til Movie # 6 comes out ) .

In the book , there ’s a scheduled trip to Hogsmeade on Valentine ’s Day and Harry asks Cho to go with him .
It ’s here we see that although Harry has had feelings for Cho since he first started Hogwarts , they really are not comfortable around each other .
They go to have coffee at Madam Puddifoot ’s Tea Shop and Cho talks about other guys asking her out .
She continuously brings up her former boyfriend Cedric ( who Harry saw getting killed in GoF ) and mentions that she went to this Tea Shop with Cedric the previous year .
Cho cries over Cedric a lot and wants Harry to talk about Cedric with her .
She gets angry to find out that Harry confides in his feelings about what happened to Cedric to Ron and Hermione , acting jealous of only Hermione .
She gets angry that Hermione asked Harry to meet her over at the Three Boomsticks to discuss business on Valentine ’s Day .
Cho eventually storms out of the shop , leaving Harry behind utterly confused about what the hell just happened .

The Breakup : After the disastrous Valentine ’s Day ( not shown in the film ) , Harry and Cho have another a falling out after Umbridge discovers the secret D.A. meeting ( in the book , it ’s because Cho sticks up for her friend Marietta , who is the one who tells Umbridge about the meetings ; in the movie , they make Cho the snitch , which makes Harry lose respect for her — see section below “ Dumbledore ’s Army ” ) .
After this , it ’s obvious that their relationship is over for good .
In the book , Harry and Cho see each other on the train going back home for a brief second , but neither says anything .
Hermione tells Harry and Ron that Cho is going out with someone else , and much to Harry ’s surprise , the news does n’t bother him .
Dumbledore ’s Army — Back to Top
Hogsmeade :
On a day trip into Hogsmeade , all the students interested in having Harry teach them practical application of defense against the dark arts gather at Hog ’s Head , an out - of - the - way dingy pub .
It ’s here that they form the D.A. , “ Dumbledore ’s Army . ”
In the movie , no one appears to be at the pub , not even the barkeeper .
It looks more like an abandoned shack .
Also , everyone eagerly signs on without much hesitation .
In the book , there are certain people that are skeptical about it and even Harry himself took a lot of persuading by Hermione to agree to be the teacher .
And unbeknownst to the students , a man at the bar with his head wrapped in dirty bandages is eavesdropping on their conversation and reports back to Umbridge about it .
( That man was Willy Widdershins , a petty criminal who we find out is responsible for all those regurgitating toilets that Mr. Weasley is investigating for his job .
Umbridge cut a deal with him in exchange for the information . )

First D.A. Meeting :
At the first D.A. meeting in the film , we see the students signing in , but it ’s never explained why .
In the book , we find out that it ’s an agreement to keep the meetings a secret and unbeknownst to the signers , anyone who rats out the D.A. will be revealed to everyone .
We see that Cho ’s friend Marietta really does n’t want to be in the D.A. , but is only going for Cho .

The Marauder ’s Map :
Not shown in this film , but in the book Harry uses it to check for teachers when coming in and out of the Room of Requirement , which is where the D.A. lessons take place .
Not shown in this film , but in the book Harry uses it to check for teachers when coming in and out of the Room of Requirement , which is where the D.A. lessons take place .
Room of Requirement :
In the film , we see Umbridge discovers the Room of Requirement with the help of caretaker Filch and her Inquisitorial Squad ( which includes Draco Malfoy ) .
We see Cho along with them , implying that she is the one who told Umbridge about the D.A .
In the book , it ’s actually Cho ’s friend Marietta , whose mother works for the MoM , who is the informant .
We find out that after she told , the word “ SNEAK ” appeared on her forehead .
That ’s because she signed the paper to join the D.A. , which unbeknownst to the people signing it , was hexed by Hermione to reveal anyone who told about the D.A .
Dumbledore ’s Army : Dumbledore takes responsibility for the creation of the D.A. and we see in the film that he tells
Fudge that he will not “ go quietly ” if Fudge tries to arrest him .
Fudge and Umbridge are accompanied by Aurors Shacklebolt and Dawlish , and Fudge ’s junior assistant Percy Weasley .
Dumbledore than claps his hands over his head and disappears along with the phoenix Fawkes .
In this part of the book , since Cho ’s friend Marietta is the snitch , she ’s there too and they are attempting to question her , but it turns out that Shacklebolt ( who we know is secretly a member of the Order ) modifies Marietta ’s memory so that she does n’t remember the six months ’ worth of illegal D.A. meetings .
Dumbledore hexes everyone who ’s there to arrest him and then escapes in a flash of fire along with Fawkes .

Detention : After Dumbledore escapes , we see that Umbridge gives the D.A. members — except for Cho — detention and they are later seen serving detention by being forced to write with Umbridge ’s special quills that etch words onto the back of the students ’ hands .
This subsequent detention does not happen in the book , because Dumbledore makes an argument that there ’s no proof that any wrong doings had occurred .
In this situation , there ’s no proof that the meetings have been taking place for the last six months , they only had evidence that there was a meeting that night .

Sneak :
In the film , Harry does n’t speak to Cho anymore after he finds out she was the one who told Umbridge where the D.A. meetings were .
At the end , we find out she only told because she was given the truth serum Veritaserum .
In the book , it ’s Cho ’s friend Marietta who ’s the “ sneak ” but Harry argues with Cho over it because she defends her friend .
Cho also criticizes Hermione for putting a jinx on the sign - up list to begin with , and this is the last time they speak .
S.P.E.W. and the House - Elves — Back to Top
S.P.E.W. : Once again , in the film , there ’s no mention of S.P.E.W. — Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare — the group Hermione founded because she disapproved of the harsh treatment House - Elves receive .
In the book , she knits clothing for the house elves that work at Hogwarts and leaves it around the school for them ( a house - elf can gain freedom if it ’s given clothing ) .

Kreacher :
Not shown in the film is Kreacher ’s involvement in tricking Harry into going to the Ministry of Magic to rescue Sirius ( see more on this in section “ To Rescue Sirius ” ) .
It ’s also revealed in the book that Kreacher injuries Buckbeak , the hippogriff that ’s living at the Order headquarters ( in Prisoner of Azbakan , Buckbeak is supposed to be put to death , but Ron , Harry , and Hermione help the hippogriff escape , then Sirius — also wanted — rides off with Buckbeak ) .

Dobby : Dobby the free house - elf does not appear in the movie .
In the book , Dobby brings Hedwig back to Harry after the owl recovered from her injuries .
Dobby is the one who finds the Room of Requirement for Harry ’s D.A. meetings and it ’s Dobby who warns Harry that Umbridge has found the Room of Requirement he ’s using to hold the D.A. lessons .
In the film , Neville Longbottom happens upon the room and Umbridge finds the room and blasts the wall open after the caretaker Filch along with her Inquisitorial Squad find the room .
Hagrid ’s Return and The Giants
The Giants :
In the movie , Hagrid returns and explains how he went to visit the Giants to get them to join Dumbledore ’s cause .
The Dark Lord is trying to sway the Giants to his side as well .

Centaurs :
The meeting with the centaurs does not happen on film .
On their way out of the forest , Hagrid , Hermione , and Harry run into the centaurs , who are still angry that one of their own , Firenze , took a job with Dumbledore at the school .
The centaur Bane allows them to pass , because Hagrid has children with him ( “ they are innocents ” he says , and that they do not harm foals ) .
But Hagrid is no longer welcome in the forest ( he helped Firenze escape his herd when they were attacking him ) .
That means Hagrid ca n’t go back to be with his brother .
Harry and Hermione , along with Ron , must now look after Grawp .
Harry ’s Dreams and Occlumency — Back to Top
Attack on Mr. Weasley : Harry dreams that Mr. Weasley is attacked by a snake .
We learn that this really occurred and thanks to Harry , Mr. Weasley is gotten to in time to be taken to the hospital .
In the film , next we hear about this , Mr. Weasley is home from the hospital and doing fine .
In the book , there ’s a confrontation between Sirius and the Weasley twins , because Fred and George feel like their father is always at risk doing things for the Order , while Sirius stays in hiding .
Later , a bunch of them dress as Muggles and go to visit Mr. Weasley at St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries .
On another trip to the hospital , Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Ginny see Neville and his grandmother there , who are visiting Neville ’s parents ( his parents have been there since he was a baby and were put there after the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange inflicted the Cruciatus Curse on them ) .

Also , they see their former Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart .
Occlumency :
It becomes apparent that the Dark Lord is trying to penetrate Harry ’s thoughts ( through Legilimency ) , so Snape gives Harry lessons in Occlumency — the magic of sealing your mind against magical influence and intrusion .
It ’s implied that Harry and Snape only have one lesson before Harry is able to penetrate Snape ’s mind and see his father James bullying Snape when they were Hogwarts students .
Angered by the intrusion to his own thoughts , Snape ends the lessons completely .
In the book , the two have many lessons together and they were held in secret once a week .
Harry has to tell everyone he ’s taking Remedial Potions .
It ’s during one of these sessions that Harry realizes that the corridor and door he ’s been dreaming about all year is one that leads to the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic ( and this is where the prophecies are kept , including the one that the Dark Lord is looking for ) .
Also , it ’s at the Order headquarters that Snape tells Harry about starting up the lessons .
Sirius is there at the time and he gets into an argument with Snape .
Sirius tells
Snape that he does n’t believe he ’s reformed and that he still follows the Dark Lord .

Snape ’s Pensieve
It is through Snape ’s pensieve that Harry is able to find out Snape ’s embarrassing memories from when he was a teenager which show Harry ’s father James bullying Snape .
In the film , it appears that Harry ’s able to see these memories during an Occlumency lesson .
In the book , it ’s been months of lessons with Snape , and Harry at one point is left alone in Snape ’s office .
He comes across a pensieve there and it ’s while looking into it that Harry sees events from when Snape was a student at Hogwarts .
He sees many memories of his father bullying Snape , with the encouragement of Sirius .
But , he also sees his mother Lily , who comes to Snape ’s defense and she even tells James , “ You make me SICK . ”
In the memory , even though she defended him , Snape tells Lily he does n’t need help from a “ mudblood ” like her .
Snape then catches Harry with the pensieve and that ’s when he tells Harry never to return to his office again .
Other Elements Missing From the Movie — Back to Top
The Three Broomsticks meeting : Not in the film , but Harry meets Hermione and Luna there on Valentine ’s Day ( after his argument with Cho ) .
The girls are with reporter Rita Skeeter ( this is the reporter from GoF who ’s an unregistered Animagus who can take the form of a beetle .
It ’s in her beetle form that she was able to eavesdrop on people , then print the stories ) .
Hermione made a deal with Rita , who will interview Harry and print the truth about the Dark Lord ’s return and Luna ’s dad will publish it in The Quibbler , and the kids agree NOT to report Rita as an unregistered Animagus .

What we do n’t see is who replaces her as Divination teacher .
In the book , Dumbledore hires Firenze , a handsome centaur who lived in the Forbidden Forest near the school until he was banished by his herd for taking the job Dumbledore offered .
( Firenze ’s hiring is especially disturbing to Umbridge , who despises half - breeds . )

Truth Serum :
This is the part in the movie where Snape is called on to supply Umbridge with the truth serum Veritaserum , but he says she used up the last of it on Cho .
In the book , Snape says she ’s used the last of it on Harry ( she put it in his tea to try and get from him the whereabouts of Dumbledore and Sirius , but he knew better than to drink it ) .
An important tidbit is revealed in the book at this time : Umbridge admits that she was actually the one who sent the Dementors to attack Harry in Little Whinging .
( She is an employee of the MoM , and since the dementors are under the Ministry ’s control , she had access to them . )
In both mediums , Umbridge then decides to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry , but Hermione stops her by saying that Harry has a weapon hidden in the forest .
The two of them bring Umbridge into the forest , while Ron , Neville , Ginny , and Luna are left behind under the guard of the Inquisitorial Squad .
In the forest , they meet the hostile Centaurs .

To the Ministry : After escaping from Umbridge , Harry and Hermione meet up with Ron , Luna , Neville , and Ginny .
In the movie , Luna suggests they ride to London to go rescue Sirius at the Ministry of Magic .
She does this in the book too , saying that they can get there on the Thestrals , but the magical winged - horses do n’t just appear so easily .
It takes a while , but thanks to the blood on Hermione and Harry ( from when the centaurs attack Grawp in the forest ) , the Thestrals arrive ( we learned in the book during Hagrid ’s class that they are attracted by the smell of blood , thinking it ’s a fresh kill for them to eat ) .
While only Harry , Luna , and [ in the book ]
Neville can see the Thestrals , all of the children ride one each .
Ron has some trouble riding them and is glad when they get to London ( and vows to never ride them again ) .

Rescue Mission :
In the book , the gang must get into the Ministry of Magic .
Harry brings them to the visitor ’s entrance ( the phone booth we see him and Mr. Weasley use in the film to get to Harry ’s hearing ) and tells the person closest to the receiver to dial “ 62442 ” ( M - A - G - I - C ) .
The automated voice asks him to state his name and business , and Harry replies with everyone ’s names with their business being “ We ’re here to save someone … ” Six visitor passes are issued , and we see that Harry ’s reads , “ HARRY POTTER , RESCUE MISSION . ”
This part does n’t happen in the movie .
After the ride there , the group is seen heading into the Department of Mysteries .
The Prophecy — Back to Top
Voldemort ’s Army : Voldemort sends his Death Eaters out to recruit new followers for his cause — this includes trying to ally with the Giants .
The Dark Lord ’s personal army will aid in his plans to kill Harry and all others who oppose him ( like Dumbledore and the other members of the Order of the Phoenix ) .
It ’s implied that Voldemort ’s army will also help overthrow the authorities ( like the Ministry of Magic ) .
Aside from one character mentioning Voldemort gathering his forces , this subject is n’t really addressed in the film .

The Prophecy : Part of what Harry keeps dreaming about is a room in the Department of Mysteries .
This room is where the prophecies are kept , including the one that talks about a boy who has the power to defeat the Dark Lord .
( That prophecy is located in row 97 ) .
Voldemort desperately wants to get this prophecy , but only the person the prophecy is about can take that prophecy , which is why Voldemort lures Harry there with a false dream of capturing Sirius .
In the book , when Harry finds the prophecy , it ’s labelled “ Dark Lord and ( ? ) Harry Potter ” and we see that it was from “ S.P.T . ” ( Sybil P. Trelawney ) to “ A.P.W.B.D. ” ( Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore ) .

In the book , it ’s told that Nott , Jugson , Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange , Dolohov , Crabbe , Macnair , Avery , Rookwood , and Mulciber are the hooded Death Eaters there .
Battle at the Ministry — Back to Top
First Battle : Much like the book , Harry and his friends try to battle the Death Eaters , but are quickly losing .
In the book , the children are seriously harmed in the battle , which goes on for a lengthy time , while the movie makes it seem like they only suffered a few scrapes .

Neville : After the Order members arrive , in the book , Harry attempts to gather his injured friends and get them to safety .
He gives his prophecy to Neville , who drops and breaks it after a Death Eater attack .
In the movie , Harry ’s friends are n’t badly injured , so Harry stays to try and fight first alongside Sirius , then with Dumbledore ; here , it ’s Lucius Malfoy who accidentally breaks his prophecy right after the members of the Order arrive and Sirius attacks him ( “ Get away from my Godson , ” Sirius tells Lucius in one of the coolest scenes in the film ) .

Bellatrix Kills Sirius : Just at a moment where it seemed like Sirius was winning the battle , Bellatrix appears and casts the killing curse on him .
Harry then chases her to the entrance hall and hits her with the Cruciatus curse .
In the book , she tells him he is incapable of inflicting torture .
They have a brief conversation prior to Voldemort ’s arrival and she attempts to get the prophecy from him , but it ’s already been smashed .
This is the point where Voldemort shows up at the scene and tries to hit Harry with the Avada Kedavra curse .
Dumbledore appears and brings the nearby golden statue to life and moves it in front of Harry to block the spell .
In the movie , Voldemort is the one who encourages Harry to torture Bellatrix , then tells Harry that he can’t make the curse work because he ’d have “ to mean it . ”
This is when Dumbledore arrives to battle Voldemort in the movie .
He ’s not there before when the Order members are fighting the Death Eaters and the enchanted statue is not involved .

Bellatrix Flees :
In the movie , Bellatrix appears to Disapparate while Dumbledore battles Voldemort .
After the battle , Voldemort possesses Harry , telling him that he “ will lose everything . ”
Harry fights him off , and Voldemort then Disapparates just as Fudge and his staff arrive to see a glimpse of the Dark Lord .
In the book , this happens the same ( though the possession is much shorter ) , except Voldemort takes Bellatrix with him when he Disapparates and there ’s a few pages of Fudge asking questions about the events of the evening .
Dumbledore answers some of them , then tells Fudge to make some changes ( like removing Umbridge from Hogwarts ) .
Dumbledore ’s Revelation — Back to Top
Anger :
This is not portrayed in the movie at all , but the day after the big battle , Harry is extremely angry with Dumbledore for distancing himself from Harry all year ( Dumbledore explains that it was to protect him ) and goes so far as to smash some of Dumbledore ’s possessions .
They argue over Sirius and no matter how humble Dumbledore tries to be , Harry is still furious .
It takes a long time for him to calm down and to listen to what Dumbledore has to say .
The Chosen One : Dumbledore tells Harry at the end of the book that Voldemort did not know who the “ chosen one ” would be to rise up against him with the power to defeat him — Harry or Neville Longbottom .
Dumbledore speculates that because Harry was half - blood like the Dark Lord , Voldemort chose him , thereby creating his own adversary who could defeat him .
The prophecy states that one cannot live while the other one survives .
Dumbledore also explains that the prophecy with Harry ’s name on it was renamed so after Voldemort tried to kill him as an infant , because it was then assumed by the keeper of the hall of prophecies that it must be about Harry .
In the film , Dumbledore explains the prophecy to Harry , but the part about Neville and the renaming is excluded .

Snape :
In the movie , Dumbledore apologizes to Harry for the mistakes he made throughout the year by not confiding in him .
In the book , Dumbledore goes on to explain how Kreacher tricked Harry and how Snape was the one who alerted the Order when Harry never returned from the forest with Umbridge .
While the rest of the Order went to look at the Department of Mysteries for Harry , Snape went to look for him in the forest .

A Mother ’s Love :
In the book , this is when Dumbledore tells Harry why he ’s had to live with his Aunt and Uncle at Privet Drive all these years .
He explains that because Harry ’s mother died at the hands of Voldemort in an effort to save her son , Harry was protected by ancient magic — a mother ’s love .
That is why Dumbledore chose to leave Harry with his mother ’s sister .
He believed their shared blood would protect Harry , and even though his Aunt did n’t really want to take him in , she did it anyway , which sealed the charm protecting Harry .
“ While you can still call home the place where your mother ’s blood dwells , there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort , ” Dumbledore tells Harry .
Harry only has to return to that house once a year for the protection to continue and his Aunt knows this , which is why she let Harry stay at the beginning of the book .
The Aftermath — Back to Top
Umbridge Saved :
In the movie , after the centaurs drag her off , we do n’t see Umbridge again in person , only her image in the newspaper in one of the last scenes .
In the book , we see her again at the Hogwart ’s hospital ward where Ginny , Ron , Hermione , and Neville are all recovering from the injuries they sustained during the final battle with the Death Eaters .
( Dumbledore somehow saved Umbridge from the centaurs . )
Luna arrives to show them the Daily Prophet newspaper , which re-ran the story Rita Skeeter did with Harry earlier that year for the Quibbler .

Remembering Sirius :
While everyone is getting ready to return to their homes for the summer , Harry feels isolated from everyone again .
In the book , Harry has a hard time thinking about Sirius .
While he ’s packing , he finds the two - way mirror that Sirius gave him to use to contact him and laments that he had forgotten all about the gift .
He tries to reach Sirius with it then , but nothing happens .
Harry then goes in search of the ghost Nearly Headless Nick to find out if Sirius can come back as a ghost .
Nick tells him no , that learned wizards often do not choose the half - life path .

She ’s looking for her lost possessions and he offers to help her find them .
In the book , this is when Luna confides to Harry that she saw her mother die .
She tells him that the room with the Archway in the Department of Mysteries — which is where Sirius disappeared into after he was killed — is where the dead lurk .

When the gang disembarks from the train , the members of the Order greet them .
They are there to have a chat with Harry ’s Aunt and Uncle , to tell them that if they find out that Harry ’s being mistreated by his Aunt and Uncle , they ’ll have to answer to the Order .
They then give their good - byes to Harry , telling him to that if they do n’t hear from him for three days , they ’ll send someone to see him and that his friends will write to him and that they ’ll get him out of this Aunt and Uncle ’s house as soon as possible .
This show of support comforts Harry and means a lot to him .
He then leads the way out of the train station , with his Aunt , Uncle , and Cousin following behind him .

It 's no wonder the federal government did not want to release details for a year , because once again , it 's all handouts to Big Oil who set new records in profitability while sticking the middle class with the bill .
Good grief , can we re-set priorities and worry about the middle class again and quit giving more welfare and handouts to the richest ?
If Exxon can give half a billion dollars to the CEO , I see no reason why taxpayers should have to fund their business since they seem to be doing pretty well without taxpayer handouts .
These are not small companies who need help to get started , but very mature companies who bathe their executives with lavish compensation packages and then pass on the bill to governments around the world , rich and poor alike .
I do n't know what is worse between them asking or governments actually giving over the money .
The study , which the Interior Department refused to release for more than a year , estimates that current inducements could allow drilling companies in the Gulf of Mexico to escape tens of billions of dollars in royalties that they would otherwise pay the government for oil and gas produced in areas that belong to American taxpayers .
But the study predicts that the inducements would cause only a tiny increase in production even if they were offered without some of the limitations now in place .
It also suggests that the cost of that additional oil could be as much as $ 80 a barrel , far more than the government would have to pay if it simply bought the oil on its own .
" They are giving up a lot of money and not getting much in return , " said Robert A. Speir , a former analyst at the Energy Department who worked on the report .
" If they took that money , they could buy a whole lot more oil with it on the open market . "
Oil closed Thursday at $ 62.66 a barrel in regular trading .
In the United States , the federal government '?s take -?
royalties as well as corporate taxes - is about 40 percent of revenue from oil and gas produced on federal property , according to Van Meurs Associates , an industry consulting firm that compares the taxes of all oil - producing countries .
By contrast , according to Van Meurs , the worldwide average " government take " ? is about 60 to 65 percent .
And that figure , of course , excludes countries that do not allow any private ownership in oil production .
Despite all of the claims by the GOP that we have to drill in coastal waters , the end result for consumers and taxpayers is limited .
The GOP continues to give away public natural resources , well above international standards .
Hash functions .
Why look at hash functions ?
In a previous job , I was asked to look at hashing functions and got into a dispute with my boss about how such functions should be designed .
I had advocated the used of LFSRs or CRCs that would be customized to the size of the table , as discussed in " Numerical Recipes " .
My boss advocated simply performing a modulo by prime operation and cited Knuth 's 30 years old " the Art of Computer Programming " .
I showed him examples where modulo by prime had extremely bad collisions , but this did not seem to sway him at all .
It seems Knuth 's rewrites have come too late .
A coworker " settled " the dispute by discovering Bob Jenkin 's hash function .
This outperformed both of our suggestions while being based on better analysis regarding collisions .
I had bookmarked the webpage and occassionally referred to it in future projects , and noticed the two additions of the " One at a time Hash " and " FNV hash " as updates to the page over time .
The thing about the Bob Jenkin 's function is that the code is messy , and uses a large number of mystery constants whose construction I did not understand .
Both the " One at a time Hash " and " FNV Hash " are extremely elegant with very few magic constants .
Bob Jenkins himself indicated that FNV outperformed his own function , so at first I simply took his word for it , and started using the FNV hash blindly on all occassions .
After that , I had finally had the occassion to measure the real performance inside of a project .
After a number of miscalculations and mismeasurements , I decided that I needed to study the problem for real .
Analyzing existing hash functions
The first thing I noticed was that on my system ( an Athlon XP ) the Bob Jenkins function outperformed basically everything else ( including the FNV function ) by a large margin .
How do we resolve this contradiction with Bob Jenkins ' claim ?
Simple -- he was measuring on a " Pentium " .
Intel 's latest Pentium IV is known to have very slow shifters which slows down every hash function except the FNV function which uses a multiply instead .
The Opteron / Athlon 64 architecture has a vastly improved integer multiplier ( unchallenged by any other architecture , save perhaps the Itanium ) which suggests that the FNV hash should do well on that system as well .
But at a more fundamental level I wanted to understand what the real performance limiters were for these functions to see if a recoding of them might help ( I performed a similar exercise for some reference MD5 code and got a drammatic performance boost , so I was optimistic . )
The Bob Jenkins ' code is too convoluted and it seemed that the compiler or out - of - order CPU architectures could easily find the parallelism that was there ( and there is some to be had . )
But the CRCs and One at a time Hash are completely instruction after instruction dependent .
So I split the input data into odd and even bytes and calculated two parallel CRCs and One at a time Hashes then at the end combined one into the other as if it were more data .
This markedly improved the performance of these functions , but not quite up to the point of outperforming the Bob Jenkins hash .
So I did not completely pursue the task of proving the suitability of these modified functions .
If I was going to try to outperform Bob Jenkins ' function , I would have to take a step back and understand the functional nature of the bottleneck in these functions .
The functions other than Bob Jenkins ' basically operated on the idea of consuming one 8 - bit byte at a time of input data and mixing each in some injective way into some 32 - bit accumulator which , after possible post processing , is simply output .
One can see the motivation of this idea -- each input byte can be mixed twice with a large degree of freedom in the 32 bit accumulator without self overlapping .
Thus in successive steps its only really required to sort of " spread out " consecutive sequences of at most 8 bits in such a way that previous bytes do n't obviously cancell out .
This is explicitely seen in the " One at a Time hash " function .
In fact , for each byte only a few very simple operations are performed -- a final short sequence of operations is required at the end .
These operations at the end are required to make sure the bits in the last few bytes fully " avalanche " to all the output bytes .
Avalanching is the property between an input and output bit where the output bit will flip with a probability p ( " close " to 0.5 ) if the input bit is flipped relative to any random input data .
A good hash function requires avalanching from all input bits to all the output bits .
( Incidentally , Bob Jenkins overly chastizes CRCs for their lack of avalanching -- CRCs are not supposed to be truncated to fewer bits as other more general hash functions are ; you are supposed to construct a custom CRC for each number of bits you require . )
Creating a new hash function
Using the One at a Time hash function as a model , the next obvious question to ask is " why not try to use fewer operations between data fragments " ?
The idea would be to rely more heavily on fixups at the end to produce the final avalanching which adds a constant time overhead in hopes of reducing the linear overhead .
I.e. , the mixing function would in fact operate much more slowly relative to the stream of input bytes , but this would not matter to the bulk of the early bytes because they would eventually reach a maximal point of avalanching anyway .
So my thought was to use fewer instructions per input fragment and to increase the size of the input fragment from 8 bits to 16 bits .
On the x86 this latter idea has a particularly high impact on performance since these architectures have hardware support for unaligned 16 bit word accesses .
Using Bob Jenkin 's definition of avalanching , I chose an inner loop instruction sequence that I thought might work by interleaving two 16 bit words , then wrote a program to search for parameters which gave the greatest amount of avalanching before requiring a fix up for the end .
I then added instructions that would be equivalent of unrolling the inner loop corresponding to padding the input with a fixed number zeros , then scanned for the set of parameters which could complete the avalanching for all the real input bits .
I was shocked to find that there were no significant impediments to this exercise , and I easily found a hash function with all these properties after a few hours or work .
I then subjected all realistic sub - bit patterns of the hash output to a simple statistical test and verified that it had a distribution equivalent to a uniformly random map .
The moment of truth came with the performance test -- but given the architecture , it was a forgone conclusion .
My hash function performs around 66 % faster than Bob Jenkin 's functions tested with various compilers .

For the hash function to have the correct properties , it is assumed that CHAR_BIT is 8 and computations use 2s complement arithmetic .
I was initially worried that using a portable way of accessing 16 bits at a time would erode the performance significantly .
Although none of the x86 compilers correctly reduced the portable version to the direct version ( something worth complaining about ) , subsequent testing showed that this did not lead to the drastic performance drop that I thought it would ( only about 20 % ) .
This leads me to believe that even on RISC architectures that this function should perform very well versus the Bob Jenkins , or other hashes .
Update ( 1 ) : David C. wrote : I tested your hash function against all of the popular ones , including Bob Burtles .
It turns out it was not only the quickest but had the best distribution ( I created histograms of the chain lengths ) .
The architecture I work on is IBM Z/OS ( S/390 mainframes ) .
Well done mate , will be using your code from now on !
Ok , not exactly RISC , but at least this demonstrates that this function is good beyond the x86 architecture .
Update ( 2 ) : I have recently gained access to a Power4 based Linux machine , as can be seen in the updated performance table above .
( Interestingly , even normalizing for clock rate differences , the Athlon XP is 35 - 40 % faster than the Power4 architecture ) .
I did not see any appreciable performance difference between gcc and the native cc compiler , so I just reported the results from gcc .
The performance ratio between SuperFastHash and Bob Jenkins is only slightly less impressive , so the main point about its advantage still holds .
Update ( 3 ) : Feedback from Tim Rentsch suggested that to be fair , Bob Jenkin 's hash should leverage the x86's unaligned access feature as well ( this helps it even more than for my function because it accesses 32 bits at once . )
I have also rescheduled the operations of SuperFastHash to maximally leverage the pipelines of modern CPUs .
I have made the code more uniform in its treatment of integers , so besides being portable from a compilation point of view , it is now more portable from a semantic point of view .
And finally I have added results from an alpha numeric hash that has been discussed on USENET .
Update ( 4 ) :
It seems that this hash function has gotten a little bit of attention lately .
The function has been tested , and implemented in Apple Corporation 's open source WebKit ( used in safari ) sources .
Presumably this may mean that the code will eventually make its way back into Konqueror as well .
In addition , MacroMedia appears to have adopted it and will use it in a future deployment .
I guess people think there 's something to this .
( Update ( 4a ) : Google 's Chrome Browser is based on Webkit and which continues to use this hash function . )
Update ( 5 ) : People have been asking for an incremental version of the hash function .
Here is a simple diff sequence that shows how to do this :
13,14c13,14 < uint32_t SuperFastHash ( const char * data , int len ) { < uint32_t hash = len , tmp ; --- > uint32_t SuperFastHash ( const char * data , int len , uint32 _t hash ) { > uint32_t tmp ;
You initialize it , by initially setting hash to some constant ( like 0 , or some other number if you want to avoid 0 sinking ) and you keep it going by feeding the incremental output of each call into the hash parameter of each successive call .
This will make the algorithm functionally comparable to Bob Jenkin 's hash from an incremental point of view .
You can improve this by splitting out the final avalanching code into a kind of " finalization step " .
But it should be pointed out that if you split the same data in two different partitionings , then the hash value that you get out will not necessarily be the same ( Bob Jenkin 's hash has the same problem ) .
If you wish to use an incremental hash which is partition independent and has very low " per-call " overhead , then the Bob Jenkin 's " One - At - A - Time " hash is recommended .
Update (6 ) : In Google 's open source " sparse hash table " project , the documentation makes the following observation : " ... in one test of the default SGI STL string hash function against the Hsieh hash function ... , for a particular set of string keys , the Hsieh function resulted in hashtable lookups that were 20 times as fast as the STLPort hash function .
The string keys were chosen to be " hard " to hash well , so these results may not be typical , but they are suggestive . "
Future work to be considered
The newest generation of CPUs are capable of 64 bit computation and certainly in a few years we can expect that there will be widespread development with tool availability for 64 bit software .
So should this idea work by reading 32 bits at a time within a 64 bit accumulator ?
Probably , and we could expect the result to have roughly twice the asymptotic performance .
There 's also the question of the inline dependencies .
There are 6 instruction dependencies in the inner loop , so its quite possible that the odd and even word splits and recombination might lead to a substantial performance boost .
( Rescheduling the operations actually saturates even the 3 - pipeline Athlon , so unrolling is not necessary . )
Update (1 ) : There have been some requests for an incremental version of SuperFastHash .
This is straightforward enough to do , by accepting the " hash " value as a parameter , and initializing it with some non-zero constant ( since the point is to assume that the length is not available until all the data is read ) .
The only sticking issue , is which constant to choose .
Update ( 2 ) : Tim Rentsch has noticed that the bit avalanching probability of SuperFastHash deviates from 50 % more than Bob Jenkin 's hash -- this is true , in fact it is between 5/12 and 7/12 ( by design ) , while Bob Jenkin 's hash appears to be far closer to 50 % .
There are some easy hacks limited to adding to the avalanche code at the end ( for example , adding hash += ( hash << 16 ) | ( hash >> 16 ) to the end ) to make all the bits of my hash function avalanche with a probability between .485 and .515 , however its probably best that I revisit this to see how to achieve this with the least additional impact .
( See next note . )
Update ( 3 ) : Following comments by Tim Rentsch and Bob Jenkins I have revisted the final tempering code and have updated it to reduce the bit correllation range to between .485 and .515 without introducing other anomolies .
It now also directly passes Bob Jenkins ' looku p2 test .
A 24 - year - old singer and guitarist named Marié Digby has been hailed as proof that the Internet is transforming the world of entertainment .
What her legions of fans do n't realize , however , is that Ms. Digby 's career demonstrates something else : that traditional media conglomerates are going to new lengths to take advantage of the Internet 's ability to generate word - of - mouth buzz .

The last thing I want to do is defend George Tenet .
The slick , self - serving , and stunningly unrepentant Tenet should at best have been fired on September 12 , 2001 ; at worst , he should be in jail .
Instead , he has a Presidential Medal of Freedom , a best - selling book , and an excuse for everything .
Nonetheless , when the former CIA director suggests , as he has in numerous interviews over the last week , that he is a fall guy for the twin disasters of 9/11 and the Iraq War , he ’s right .
He ’s a fall guy for the failings of two administrations — for the timidity of a scandal - ridden Clinton and for the far worse incompetence and perfidy of Bush & Co .
He ’s also the perfect scapegoat for the longstanding and endemic problems of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the political system it serves .
The CIA ’s role in 9/11 — the less discussed of the two intelligence disasters , but in many ways the more telling — began 20 years before the attacks .
In the early 1980s , under Director William Casey , the agency took the lead in recruiting and equipping a guerrilla army to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan ; it was during these years that Al Qaeda was born .
Casey had dreams of not only pushing the Soviets out , but following them over the border and bringing open fighting to their own territory , in the Central Asian republics .
The Soviets quit Afghanistan before things got to that point , and the CIA promptly exited as well , leaving behind thousands of revved up mujahedeen — some of whom , with support from the CIA ’s partner , the Pakistani Intelligence Service , were instrumental in forming the Taliban .
Meanwhile , the CIA was seemingly unable to adjust to a changing world after the Soviet Union collapsed — an event which , incidentally , Langley failed to either anticipate or predict .
After the first World Trade Center attack of 1993 , it was clear that the intelligence community had to adjust to world where the primary threat came from freelance terrorists , not a monolithic communist nation - state .
Its Soviet specialists were useless in this world , and the agency had relatively few experts , and even fewer linguists , qualified to deal with the Middle East and Central Asia .
The consequences became clear after 9/11 : As the 2002 Joint Inquiry by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees documented , the CIA was simply unable to penetrate Al Qaeda .
James Bamford , in his book A Pretext for War , has pointed out that John Walker Lindh , along with at least seven other young Americans , was able to walk right into Al Qaeda camps , join their training operations , and learn enough about their plans that he could later tell investigators that there were originally meant to be 5 — not 4 — flights on 9/11 , with the fifth aimed at the White House , but the pilot for that flight was unable to get a visa .
Another American volunteer sat down with Bin Laden himself for an interview , as did Mother Jones contributor Peter Bergen .
The CIA ’s inability to crack Al Qaeda meant the U.S. intelligence community had to rely on second - and third - hand informants ( who often had their own concealed agendas ) and on foreign intelligence services like the corrupt Pakistani ISI .
Even this imperfect network brought ample warnings from friendly intelligence services in the months leading up to 9/11 — from the Jordanians , the Italians , the British , the Germans , and the Egyptians .
Former Senator Bob Graham , who headed the Congressional Joint Inquiry , reports in his book Intelligence Matters that there were no fewer than 12 instances “ in which we had learned of terrorist plans to use airplanes as weapons . ”
The Joint Inquiry found that , beginning in 1998 and continuing through the summer of 2001 , the intelligence community “ received a modest , but relatively steady stream of intelligence reporting that indicated the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United States . ”
The National Security Agency , with its extraordinary surveillance network , reported “ at least 33 communications indicating a possible , imminent terrorist attack in 2001 . ”
The intelligence community knew enough to advise senior government officials , in June and July of 2001 , that the attacks were expected , among other things , to “ have dramatic consequences on governments or cause major casualties ” and that “ attack preparations have been made .
Attack will occur with little or no warning . ”
How is it possible that the CIA could be so spectacularly incompetent in obtaining vital intelligence , or act upon the intelligence it did have ?
The agency was , after all , created in 1947 to ensure the nation would not fall victim to a second Pearl Harbor .
But as historian and political analyst Chalmers Johnson has noted , from the beginning the agency ’s leadership “ saw intelligence analysis as a convenient cover for subversive operations abroad . ”
In his view , “ intelligence collecting and analysis would quickly become camouflage for a private secret army at the personal command of the president devoted to dirty tricks , covert overthrows of foreign governments and planting disinformation — as well as efforts to counter similar operations by the Soviet Union . ”
In 1960s Washington , former CIA officials spoke glowingly of how they ’d pulled off the overthrow of Mohammaed Mossadegh , the elected nationalist premier of Iran , replacing him with the Shah .
They eagerly participated in the destabilization of governments in Afghanistan , Chile , Congo , El Salvador , Guatemala , Greece , Indonesia , Nicaragua , and Vietnam ( a partial list ) , and did their very best to kill Castro .
During the same Cold War period , the agency was far less successful in gathering intelligence , losing numerous agents behind the Iron Curtain and proving unable to detect Soviet spies within its own top ranks .
Yet the CIA was often not forced to account for its failings .
Its activities are secret ; its budget and personnel list are off the books .
Congressional oversight is limited , and classified .
Tenet , like other CIA directors before and after him , answered only to the president .
Why should it have been so surprising to find out that his answer was always yes ?
Tenet may have told Clinton to bomb Al Qaeda bases , only to be turned down because of the Lewinsky scandal .
He may even have been , in terrorism czar Richard Clarke ’s words , “ running around with his hair on fire ” trying to warn Condi and Cheney and Bush about terrorist threats in 2001 , when they were already getting busy planning the invasion of Iraq .
But he did n’t stake his pension on it .
As inadequate as the CIA ’s intelligence was , before both 9/11 and the Iraq War , it was often still more than Bush and his colleagues wanted to hear .
So the pieces that did n’t fit their agenda were discarded , or replaced by others .
Some dedicated agents and analysts may well have objected to such practices — in the past week , a group of retired officers has attacked Tenet , charging that “ by your silence you helped build the case for war . ”
But in the end , the CIA director , like all members of the executive branch , serves at the pleasure of the president .
And if the president ’s pleasure is to exploit 2,973 deaths in America to advance his agenda in the Middle East , then it is the director ’s job to support that agenda — as Tenet did so well .
The fruits of this closed system are obvious : a 16 - acre hole in Lower Manhattan , and tens of thousands dead in Iraq .
“ None of this work lessens the imperative to loosen federal and state restrictions that currently slow progress in this area , ” said Dr. Sean J. Morrison , director of the Center for Stem Cell Biology at the University of Michigan .
While lawmakers who support more federal financing of embryonic stem cell research also hailed the research development , they said such advances should not stop Congress from expanding research that could lead to treatments for a litany of diseases , including Alzheimer ’s and juvenile diabetes .
“ We welcome these advances as we welcome all advances in ethical life - saving research , ” said Representative Diana L. DeGette , a Colorado Democrat and a sponsor of the bill .
“ However , this new scientific research should not be used as an excuse to say that it is a substitute for embryonic stem cell research . ”
Many scientists agree , saying they need to generate new lines of embryonic cells from discarded human blastocysts , or very early embryos .
They also want to develop embryonic stem cells by nuclear transfer , the replacement of an egg nucleus with one from an adult cell .
A major benefit of nuclear transfer would be to walk a patient ’s cell back to an embryonic state so disease processes could be better understood .
“ I would find it immoral to delay the research to see if egg nuclear transfer or this method gets to our goals first , ” said Dr. Irving L. Weissman , a Stanford University researcher , referring to the new technique .
Democrats urged the president to change his mind and sign the legislation .
Their campaign to override the expected veto began only hours after the bill was passed , with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , staging a ceremony to send the legislation to Mr. Bush .
They invited a few dozen children and adults — many of them in wheelchairs — who say they could benefit from stem cell research .
Any effort to override a veto would begin in the Senate , where the bill passed April 11 on a 63 - 34 vote .
Even counting the three Senate Democrats who were not present for the vote , passage was one vote shy of the two - thirds majority needed to override a veto .

Perched on the edge of her sunlounger , the young Jamaican man picks up the woman 's hand and lavishes it with kisses .
" You is very beautiful , you know that , girl ? " he says .
The ' girl ' giggles as she sips her cocktail .
Somewhere in her early 40s , she hardly qualifies for the description .
Nor is her beauty strikingly obvious .
Yet the flattery certainly works its magic .
As dusk falls , the somewhat mismatched pair can be seen smooching together to a backdrop of pulsating reggae music at a beachfront bar .
Yet another example , you may think , of a lonely and vulnerable British divorcee falling for the charms of a silvertongued holiday Romeo .
In fact , on this occasion , it is the woman - 42 - year - old Carol , an office administrator from Birmingham - who is in the driving seat .
And , as she confides to a girlfriend , there are " plenty more where he came from " .
And in case there is any doubt what she is in the Caribbean for , she is more than happy to tell you .
She is , she emphasises with a knowing wink : " Just here to have a bit of fun . "
She is not the only one .
On the seven - mile beachfront which forms the Jamaican resort of Negril , this somewhat unsavoury scene plays out time and again every day .
A longfavoured destination for British package tourists drawn to its white sand and turquoise sea , Negril has become the destination of choice for another kind of visitor : the female sex tourist .
Like supercharged Shirley Valentines , these women see casual sex with the locals as just as much a part of their Caribbean holiday as the beach and the sun .
And they are prepared to pay for it - one way or another .
Sex tourism , of course , is more usually associated with the men who visit the seedy fleshpots of the Far East .
Yet with rising divorce rates and young professionals remaining single for much longer , the number of women travelling abroad for sex has boomed over the past few years .
So much so , in fact , that the phenomenon is increasingly being seen as part of mainstream culture .
At the cinema , Vers Le Sud ( Heading South ) features actress Charlotte Rampling as a 55 - year - old sex tourist enjoying the attention of a parade of muscled locals during a holiday in 1980s Haiti .
Even Radio 4's Woman 's
Hour - a forum of middle - class discussion - this week featured a segment about the rights and wrongs of sex tourism for women , featuring a self - confessed female ' sex traveller ' .
In London , a new play , Sugar Mummies , opened this week at the Royal Court theatre , focusing on the antics of four middleaged women who visit Jamaica to sample male prostitutes , or ' rent - a- dreads ' .
Among the cast is Lynda Bellingham - previously the wholesome face of family values in the Oxo television commercials - playing Maggie , a divorcee and habitual sex tourist with a rampant libido .
One glance along the soft white sands of Negril beach this week could confirm that there was plenty of material for her to draw upon for the role .
Every year , the flights to nearby Montego Bay disgorge thousands of unaccompanied women who make the hour - long onward journey to the beach resort .
Some are single career women , others are divorcees ; some are married .
Nearly all have one thing in common : the desire for , as one woman put it , in terms as distasteful as they were explicit , ' black bamboo ' .
Among them is Carol , who is on her first visit to the island with her 44 - year - old friend Helen .
Both have children in their late teens and are on holiday to recover from fraught divorces .
Both , too , have wasted no time in ' getting to know ' the locals .
Indeed , the pair chose Jamaica because they knew , as Carol told me , that they could easily get ' no strings fun ' here .
They have found it in the forms of 26 - year - old Byron and 22 - yearold Rafael , who approached the women as they soaked up the sun on the first day of their holiday , asking if they wanted to take some island ' excursions ' .
The excursions progressed into drinks , dinners and , inevitably , sex .
" Neither of us is kidding ourselves about what 's going on , " Carol says .
" But the fact is that in England , men our age are n't remotely interested .
They all want 22 - year - old blondes .
" Here , the men make us feel like gorgeous , sexy women again .
As far as I 'm concerned , you can't put a price on that . "
Helen , a catering manager , giggles in agreement .
That night , the pair were preparing for another heady night of rum cocktails and reggae with their lovers .
' Price ' is of course a key word .
Most women do not like to make it explicit that they are paying for the sexual services of the local boys .
Instead , the gigoloclient relationship - for in most circumstances that is what it undeniably is - unfolds in a more subtle manner .
Sex is concealed under a veil of romance and ' fun ' .
Byron - who , when he is not squiring female tourists of a certain age around the island , sells jet - ski rides on the beach - explains : " We are like their boyfriends while they are here .
They pay for everything , sometimes they give us money to help us out , and in return we treat 'em right .
" These women say they would n't get looked at twice back home , but we make them feel like queens of the island .
That 's gotta be worth the green ( money ) . "
Older women are best , Byron says , because they have more money and are willing to spend it .
" We tell them we like a cat , not a kitten , " he grins .
" We is like the Foreign Service .
We give good lovin ' .
Why should we not get the good money ? "
In a country where an estimated 16 per cent of the population live below the poverty line , the favours of a Westerner can make all the difference to a local 's standard of living .
Even in the better class of hotels , the monthly wage is no more than U.S. $ 200 ( around £ 130 ) a month .
Little wonder that Negril beach has an estimated 200 or so men on the lookout for ' milk bottles ' - as the white tourists are known locally .
Each morning , as the tourists head for their loungers scattered along the breathtaking stretch of white sand , the men set out , cruising up and down , sauntering over to make chit - chat when they spy any unaccompanied women .
A security guard for one of Negril 's middle - range hotels confides that he is rarely called upon to shoo the ' rastitutes ' away .
Most women , he says , do n't welcome his intrusion .
" I know now if the women do n't send them away immediately , they usually got something going , " he says .
" They do n't want me breaking it up . "
He points out two ladies camped further down the beach topping up their already deep tans .
' Like them .
They here every year , man . '
In fact , 52 - year - old Jill and her sister Pippa , 54 , both from the Nottingham area , have been coming to the same hotel on Negril beach for the past decade .
On their first visit in 1996 , they had merely come to unwind in the sun , but both ended up embarking on a holiday romance with men 20 years their junior - despite being married .
They returned to England amid promises of divorce , organising visas and money for their young lovers - only to find that the moment they left for the airport they could never get hold of the men again .
" There were lots of promises made then , but we soon learned our lesson , " Jill confides .
" Now we come just for some fun .
We are very careful and we see it as two weeks out of our lives for a bit of romance .
It 's not harming anyone . "
While Jill , who runs a small hairdressing salon , is now divorced , Pippa remains married , so this is questionable .
By way of defence , Pippa , who works in IT , reveals that her husband of 25 years had an affair in the early 1990s .
" What 's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander , " she says .
" Anyway , what he does n't know can't hurt him . "
Tellingly , while both Jill and Pippa agree there is an ' economic element ' to their liaisons in Jamaica , both were horrified to have it defined as barely - concealed prostitution , preferring instead to see their antics as ' helping ' the local economy .
" We have fun - and if it helps the locals out financially , then where 's the problem ? "
Jill says .
It is a depressing and ridiculous self - deception , and no doubt their children , both in their early 20s , would see it another way .
( Not that they know - they apparently remain blissfully oblivious to their mothers ' antics . )
Certainly , one imagines they would probably find Jill 's assertion that she is ' helping race relations ' rather risible .
Yet such sentiments were echoed by many of the women I spoke to this week .
In some cases , indeed , ' helping race relations ' seems to extend to enjoying the attentions of a number of different men during their stay .
At one of the grander hotels at the north end of Negril beach , two British women in their late 30s are giggling over the charms of one of the waiters at the poolside bar .
" He 's just so young , though , " one says .
" The younger the better , " says the other .
" That way they have more stamina . "
The two roar with laughter as they engage in some crude banter about the rumoured sexual prowess of the local men .
Later , one of the two , who gives her name as Anne and says she is an accountant , admits that she came away with a girlfriend for a fortnight 's holiday with the express desire to bed a local man .
After a few cocktails at the bar , she admits that she has ' fooled around ' with three hotel workers during the course of the week , although her latest lover is ' by far the cutest ' .
Such liaisons are , of course , frowned upon by the hotel , but for many of the young workers it is an unspoken perk of the job .
For the past three nights ,
Anne has waited until 3 am , when her latest lover finishes his shift , for him to visit her in her room .
With astonishing , not to mention unedifying frankness , she happily describes her young lover 's physical attributes in explicit detail .
" He 's a baby really , " she laughs .
" There 's not a flaw on him .
" He 's told me he 's 25 but I think he 's nearer 20 .
But what the hell .
I 've never experienced anything like it .
He makes me feel like a teenager . "
Yet Anne is married and nearing 40 , her teenage years long gone .
So , too , surely , should be such unsavoury , self - indulgent behaviour - After all , while many of the women here see their holiday as harmless fun , a mutually beneficial transaction , such sexual freedom often comes , inevitably , at a price .
Many of the women find themselves nonetheless falling for their young lover 's pillow talk - only to discover they are just one of many of his ' special girls ' once the gifts and the money have dried up and they prepare to return home .
As a barman at Alfreds Ocean Palace , a popular reggae bar in the heart of Negril , confides : " We see it time and again , man .
It starts out as fun , then the women start talking about staying in touch .
They want to think they 're the only one .
" But these guys have got a number of different women on the go .
Some of them have got three , four different women sending them money from back home . "
The previous month , one besotted holidaymaker in her 50s had flown back from Scotland just a month after she left in order to see her 27 - year - old lover again - only to find him canoodling with her replacement at the very same bar where they had shared a number of heady nights .
For the local community , meanwhile , the behaviour of the Western tourists can cause resentment and anger .
" These women come here and chew up our men , " one young waitress tells me .
" By the time they 've finished romancing them , there 's nothing left for us . "
Then there 's the risk of Aids and other sexual infections .
While the women I talked to all claimed to have taken due precautions , the fact remains that the HIV rate in the Caribbean is second only to sub-Saharan Africa .
None of this , of course , is likely to dissuade the likes of Carol , Jill or Anne .
Fuelled by the promise of a potent cocktail of sex and sun , they wrap themselves in a shroud of selfdelusion as they book their Caribbean sojourn .
After all , this is Jamaica , where the unofficial motto is ' No problem ' .
When you stop to contemplate the unedifying reality , however , it is hard to see it that way .

A team of European and American astronomers has announced the discovery of the best evidence yet for the nature of the star systems that explode as type Ia supernovae .
The team obtained a unique set of observations with the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope and the Keck I 10 - meter telescope in Hawaii .
The researchers were able to detect the signature of the material that surrounded the star before it exploded .
The evidence strongly supports the scenario in which the explosion occurred in a double - star system where a white dwarf is fed by a red giant .
" The powerful 10 meter Keck Telescope with its recently refurbished high - resolution spectrograph finally gives us the capability to follow these supernovae for months , as we have done here .
We are now busy taking advantage of this new window of opportunity , " says Avishay Gal - Yam , an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology who led the Caltech research team .
" This is really an exciting avenue that Keck opens up to us . "
Because type Ia supernovae are extremely luminous and quite similar to one another , these exploding events have been used extensively as cosmological reference beacons to trace the expansion of the universe .
However , despite significant recent progress , the nature of the stars that explode and the physics that governs these powerful explosions have remained poorly understood .
In the most widely accepted models of type Ia supernovae , the pre-explosion white dwarf star interacts with a much larger companion star .
Because of the proximity of the two stars and the strong gravitational attraction produced by the very compact white dwarf , the companion star continuously loses mass , " feeding " the white dwarf .
When the mass of the white dwarf exceeds a critical value slightly higher than the mass of the sun , it explodes .

" To shed some light on the systems that explode as type Ia supernovae , we decided to search for signatures of the material transferred to the white dwarf in the surrounding material , " says Ferdinando Patat , lead author of the paper reporting the results in this week 's issue of Science Express , the online version of the research journal Science .
The team of astronomers studied in great detail SN 2006X , a type Ia supernova that exploded 70 million light - years away from us , in the stunning spiral galaxy Messier 100 .
The observations were made with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph mounted at ESO 's 8.2 meter Very Large Telescope on four different occasions , over a time span of four months .
A fifth late - time epoch spectrum of SN 2006X was secured with the Keck Telescope .
The astronomers also made use of radio data obtained with National Radio Astronomy Observatory 's Very Large Array as well as with images extracted from the NASA / European Space Agency Hubble Space Telescope archive .
The most remarkable finding is the clear evolution seen in the absorption profile of the sodium lines over the few months following the explosion .
This , the astronomers deduce , is linked to the presence of a number of expanding shells surrounding the system .
These shells are left over from the star that was force - feeding the white dwarf until its sudden catastrophic and spectacular death .
" The material we have uncovered probably lies in a series of shells having a radius of the order of 0.05 light - years , or roughly 3,000 times the distance between Earth and the sun , " explains Patat .
" The material is moving with a velocity of 50 km /s , implying that the material would have been ejected some 50 years before the explosion . "
Such a velocity is typical for the winds of red giant stars .
The system that exploded was thus most likely composed of a white dwarf that acted as a giant " vacuum cleaner , " drawing gas off of its red giant companion .
In this case , however , the cannibal act proved mortal for the white dwarf .
This is the first time that any clear and direct evidence for material surrounding the exploding star has been found .
" We are still not certain whether SN 2006X is a unique case , or is instead representative of all type Ia supernovae .
Additional studies of similar objects will be crucial for determining that - and we are already working on observations of another type Ia supernova , " says Caltech astronomer Josh Simon , who is leading a similar study of the recent event SN 2007 af using observations collected at Keck and other
facilities .
" We should know even more within the next year , " he concludes .
The team is composed of Patat and Luca Pasquini ( ESO ) , Poonam Chandra and Roger Chevalier ( University of Virginia ) , Stephen Justham , Philipp Podsiadlowski , and Christian Wolf ( University of Oxford ) , Gal - Yam and Simon ( Caltech ) , Ian Crawford ( Birkbeck College London ) , Paolo Mazzali , Wolfgang Hillebrandt , and Nancy Elias - Rosa ( Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics ) , Adi Pauldrach ( Ludwig Maximilians University ) , Kenichi Nomoto ( University of Tokyo ) , Stefano Benetti , Enrico Cappellaro , Alvio Renzini , Franco Sabbadin , and Massimo Turatto ( INAF - Astronomical Observatory ) , Douglas Leonard ( San Diego State University ) , and Andrea Pastorello ( Queen 's University Belfast ) .

Sex Does n’t Sell ( Neither Does Violence )
• Next article in this series : • Previous article : Barry Schwartz on Why Too Much Choice is Bad for Us
People think sex sells .
Advertisers know it , TV and film producers believe it and the internet was built on it .
But does sex really help sell products , or is it just one of those expressions ad execs use so they can wile away an afternoon choosing models ?
Parker and Furnham ( in press ) decided to test whether sex really does sell using an experiment with a total of four conditions .
In the first two conditions participants watched an episode of ‘ Sex in the City ’ specially chosen for its even higher than normal sexual content .
Apparently it ’s the one where :
“ Charlotte panics about her ‘ bed - manner ’ when her lover Dr. Bram Walker dozes off in bed once after a gruelling day of surgery , so she takes a tantric class – signing up all four girls ; it ’s given by hands - on demonstration by a couple of psychologists . ”
In one of these two conditions participants were shown ads with high sexual content ( e.g. an ad for Budweiser ) .
In the other the ads had low sexual content ( e.g. one for Fosters lager ) .
Then in the second two conditions the TV programme chosen was Malcolm in the Middle , also a comedy drama , but one that is suitable for the whole family .
The ads embedded in this again either had high or low sexual content .
After watching the programmes participants were tested for their recall of the ads .
The results are a blow for our budding ad execs .
There was no significant difference in ‘ brand recall ’ between the adverts that used sexual content and those that did n’t .
Worse ( for our beloved ad execs ) the sexual content of ‘ Sex in the City ’ actually reduced the recall of the embedded adverts .
Actually , surprising and counter - intuitive as this finding may seem , the researchers had been expecting it .
Previous work by Bushman ( 2005 ) , using a similar experimental design also suggested sex does n’t sell .
Not only that but Bushman ( 2005 ) also tested how violence in the television programme affected ad recall .
Again , they found it had no beneficial effect on selling products .
There was , however , one finding from Parker and Furnham ’s study that was absolutely in line with expectations .
They found men were more likely to remember ads with sexual content than women .
Well , at least there are some intuitions we can rely on .

LA Times Kills Editorial On How To Revitalize Both Music And Newspaper Industries To Avoid Pissing Off Both

" Giving music away does n't mean it has lost its value , just that its value is no longer moored to the price of a CD .
Like it or not , the CD is dying , as is the culture of newsprint .
People want their music -- and their news -- in new ways .
It 's time we embraced change instead of always worrying if some brash new idea -- like giving away music -- would tarnish our sober minded image .
When businesses are faced with radical change , they are usually forced to ask -- is it a threat or an opportunity ?

Last month , when the news first came out that Prince did a deal to have a UK newspaper give away a free copy of his latest CD with every paper , we noted that this showed a great way to increase the value for both the music industry and the newspaper industry in one single move .
Apparently , I was n't the only one to think so .
A columnist for the LA Times , Patrick Goldstein , felt the same way as well -- and actually had some fantastic ideas to improve on Prince 's experiment in a way that would add tremendous value to a bunch of musicians and the LA Times in a single move .
Of course , the LA Times sometimes is known for catering to the incumbent established entertainment industry which so dominates LA -- and perhaps that 's why the LA Times ' new associate editor killed the column and refused to run it ( found via Romenesko ) .
Of course , in true Streisand Effect fashion , the column has leaked and it's hard to see any reason why the LA Times would spike it , other than it was afraid of pissing off the established recording industry .
You can read the whole spiked column at the link above , and it's a worthwhile read .
The smart changes Goldstein proposed were that it be a regular series of free CDs distributed with the newspaper ( encouraging more subscriptions and positioning the paper as a " tastemaker " ) .
And rather than have the newspaper pay the musicians directly ( which is how the Prince deal worked ) , have a sponsor pony up the money to be associated with the musician ( this is exactly how much music is already created ) .
Everyone wins in this deal ... except stubborn record labels who do n't understand that they should be in the music promotion business and think they 're only in the business of selling plastic discs .
The musicians get paid , get a lot more attention and are likely to make even more in terms of a wider audience willing to go to more shows , buy more merchandise and increase the amount future sponsors will be willing to pay .
The newspaper gives people a fantastic new reason to subscribe and reinvents the role of the newspaper as a tastemaker .
Sponsors get a great way to associate their brand with hot musicians .
And , most importantly , everyone else benefits by getting access to more good music .
Yet , in a town where the entertainment industry rules all , apparently , protecting obsolete business models is more important than publishing interesting columns with fantastic suggestions for creating a great new service .
Goldstein 's final paragraph is too good not to repeat ( especially since the LA Times does n't think it 's worth even printing once :

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon ’s independent watchdog has launched a probe into the military ’s inability to account for weapons in Iraq after reports that Kurdish militants were using U.S. arms to attack Turkey , the Defense Department said on Wednesday .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said the department ’s inspector general will go to Iraq next week with an 18 - member assessment team to investigate the problem .
“ Since January , the inspector general ’s office has been thoroughly investigating reports of unaccounted - for weapons as well as allegations of arms ending up in the wrong hands , ” Morrell said .
“ Secretary Gates , who since May has twice received lengthy briefings on the progress of the probe , is deeply troubled by the reports and the allegations . ”
Turkey , an important ally for Washington in the Muslim world , has repeatedly said the U.S. government has not done enough to clamp down on Kurdish militants based in northern Iraq .
In July , Turkey ’s ambassador said Kurdish leaders were diverting weapons meant for local Iraqi security forces to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) militants .
Morrell said he did not know if evidence existed to show U.S. weapons were being used by insurgents in Iraq .
“ It is unclear , and that ’s why there ’s an investigation taking place . ”
CONTRACTING PROBES
Separately , the Army has launched two investigations into possible fraud involving thousands of contracts for services in Iraq and Kuwait after 20 civilian and military Army employees were indicted on charges that included bribery .
The scope of the fraud remains unknown , but Army Secretary Pete Geren called the problem significant .
More than 18,000 contracts valued at about $ 3 billion have been awarded by the Army to support the Iraq war since 2003 .
As of August 28 , there were 76 ongoing criminal investigations involving possible contract fraud , the Army said .
A U.S. Army major , his wife and sister were indicted this month in a suspected scheme to accept $ 9.6 million in exchange for contracts for bottled water and other goods and services for troops in Kuwait and Iraq .
An Army captain also has been charged with accepting a $ 50,000 bribe to steer military contracts in Iraq , according to prosecutors .
“ The reports suggest that we ’ve got serious issues in this area , particularly coming out of the Kuwait contracting community , ” Geren told reporters .
“ I do n’t know how to describe the scale , but it ’s significant . ”
The first Army investigation will examine the overall contracting organization , which Army officials say lacks the resources needed to handle the sharp rise in contracts following the start of the Iraq war .
A commission appointed to investigate the operation will deliver a report in 45 days .
The Army also charged a new task force with examining all 18,000 contracts awarded by its contracting office in Kuwait .
Most of those covered support services at Army facilities in Kuwait , like laundry and dining services .

Walden
A man 's touch : flower in a vase beside the stream
Daniel Price lives in a hole in the ground .
I follow him on my bike to his dwelling of 11 years , off the main street , down a forestedtrack , in a little hamlet called Joseph , way out in the boonies of Eastern Oregon .
' Come and have a sweat lodge , around 9 pm tonight , I built it myself .
'I was riding with 1200 others in Cycle Oregon 2003 , the renowned 7 - day bike ride for folks who likecompany and camping in a cheerful crowd .
But the night wore on and the idea of shlepping aboutin the damp darkness trying to find the track to his house became less and less appealing .
My headhit my camping pillow and Daniel faded into yesterday .
But this morning , as we headed out of Joseph , yet there he was , waiting on the cornerto grab me as I whizzed by .
The significance of this doused me like a warm wave .
Here is a man who has the time and space inhis life to watch and wait patiently to bring a new friend into his hobbit - like world .
In third world countries where people value people slightly more than money , this is common .
In a white western middle class America , to stumble across it is a delightful anomaly .
We arrive at a small mound of thickly intertwined sticks , resembling a bowerbird 's lair .
Parked neatly insideis Dan's WheelWiz tricycle , given to him by the manufacturer who wanted his free spirit to spin their wheelsand go tell it on the highways and byways .
Further along is a tiny arched door set into the side of a grassy embankment .
The door is about twoand a half foot square , and though it 's just big enough to crawl through on one 's stomach , it 'ssolid and curiously inviting , He pushes back a flap of flywire and turns on a light , motioning for me to crawl in .
I enter the a circular space , about eight feet round as he described , and lined with pine slats .
There 's just enough height to sit against the wall with legs straight out in front of me .
The low ceiling is punctuated by a square skylight framing an overcast sky , and there is plush carpet underbutt .
Going counter - clockwise around the space I see a stove , skillet , pantry , pictures , me on a mat .
To my right - photocopier , little book case , CD player , phone , answering machine .
Clothes hung on a stick .
Then the door again .
There are no cupboards or chests of drawers .
' Everything is at arm 's length when you are sitting there .
It 's human scale , says Dan .
'
The idea is that you can see everything , no fumbling for stuff - that creates stress ' .
Dan is not living completely off the grid - though he 's definitely off the gridlock .
There 's underground electricity powering his lamps , and photocopier .
'But next year , I 'm switching to propane so I can be completely off the grid .
I 'll do my photocopying in town .
' So what does he do to pay the miniscule electric bill and fill his small frypan ?
He doodles .
Since 1992 , Dan 's reclusive days and nights have been meticulously recorded in an ongoing seriesof pocket - sized journals called the Moonlight Chronicles , www.moonlightchronicles.com
His mission : to draw the world as he strolls , hikes and trikes through life .
He has a varying subscriber base of 100 or so fans across the country , who post him $ 5 per issue tolive vicariously through his minimalist life while slogging it out in the city by day , suburbia by night .
Each Chronicle is a compendium of drawings , writings , observations , quotes and things you mightnever notice because you drove past them too fast , like the corners of buildings seen at a strange angle .
Whatever Dan is doing today , you might read about in the next edition .
' I 've worked out it you can live on around $ 5000 a year , ' he says .
' All you need is a piece of land , and a source of fresh water , and you can make a life .
'Yes , this is America .
Even a hobbit has to pay that electric bill .
He rents the piece of land he 's living on for $ 100 a year .
He also supplements his income with a casual job maintaining the lawns of a cemetery - you can read the bureaucratic - sounding job description and letter of offer in one of his Chronicles .
'
It 's a non-stressful , outdoor job , ' he says .
' And one where people around you are unlikely to do your head in with office politics ... ' Dan is no vagrant hippie with his hat permanently upturned .
Once a professional photographer who ran SHOTS , a black and white photography magazine , he knows how to appeal to semi-corporate types to help pay his minimal dues and fillhis skillet with nourishing organic veggies .
Sierra Designs gave him a tent .
Patagonia gave him a jacket .
Simple Shoes shod him for several years until there was a change of management .
A sad day for Dan , the boardroom meeting probably went like this :
WizWheels gave him a $ 2000 K trike to explore the world and draw what he saw by trike - cam .
He embarked on a 3 - wheeled odyssey around the perimeter of the States , but got as far asFlorida before road rage drove him to turn around and flee back to his hole .
Sakura provide him with a supply of Pigma Micron archival quality pens to felt - tip his forays into eternity .
We continue the tour .
Outside , I inspect a composting toilet in its own enclosure , decorated wild - west style with a cow 's skull and Thoreau - like quotes .
We head for the nearby stream , past some ponds which he made by diggingout channels in the former swamp , thus making a meadow out of marshland .
I always admired people who can build a house and re-shape land , How did he know where to start ' ' I just read books on it and surfed the internet for ideas , ' he says .
Beside the stream is gravity fed shower , heated by an electric current .
Nearby is a tiny pebbly beach , and a little flagstone patio sets off an easychair made from found objects and sticks , and a graceful pottery vase with a single fresh bloom .
But wait , there 's more .
Over there , past his jocks and socks drying on a rope between two trees , is a sweat lodge made of shingles .
A propane burner gets the little hothouse hotter 'n jalapenos and the lodge is just big enough for two people and a prodigal son .
Shades of Henry David Thoreau 'sshuffle to mind .
He buys a copy of my book The Handsomest Man in Cuba and reads it that day .
When you structure your life by putting you first , you have time to do things , like read books .
'I used to work as a photojournalist with regular crazy hours .
The problem is , people have their lives organized so they are the slaves .
Basically , the average person spends a ton of their time working for very little money , just to survive .
I spend a very little of my time working for enough money to not just survive , but do what I love - draw and travel .
' For some reason I am reminded of the quote , ' You can have my heart and soul but you can't have my body .
' Dan 's heart and soul are in his Chronicles , but his body is not slumped over a desk anddriving to and from work in the dark in a traffic jam .
His body is precisely where he wants it to be - in his cozy hobbit hole , on his trike , doodling all the way .

Forest fires in the Mediterranean are spreading unchecked .
Vaster and vaster stretches of land are falling victim to the flames .
Experts are not surprised .
This week I have been playing around with threading in MzScheme … I like it !
( thread ( lambda ( ) … ) )
is enough to create a thread and start it running .
You can use channels to pass data between threads safely with ( make - channel ) , ( channel - get < channel > ) and ( channel - put < channel > < data > ) .
Just to prove you can write Java in any language … say I wanted to have a connection manager .
The API is pretty simple – I want to add connections and remove connections .
Also , it might be useful to be able to start and stop the connection manager and display the number of connections .
There are a number of ways I could implement this , e.g. have a global variable and synchronise access to put and get connections .
Alternatively , I could have a thread that looks after connections and send messages to that thread via a channel .
Just for fun , let me choose the second option .
The functionality is encapsulated and available through the following API .
( connection - manager - start )
( connection - manager - stop )
( connection - manager - clear - connections )
( connection - manager - show - connections )
( connection - add < input - port > < output - port > )
( connection - remove < input - port > )
If this was production code , I should put the code in a module and only make the above functions available using ( provide… ) .
Outside a module , we can of course by - pass the API and put messages in the channel directly .
;; Support function LOG ( define ( pad n ) ( substring ( number - > string (+ n 100 ) ) 1 3 ) ) ( define ( now ) ( let* ( ( date ( seconds - > date ( current - seconds ) ) ) ( secs ( date - second date ) ) ( mins ( date - minute date ) ) ( hour ( date - hour date ) ) ) ( format " ~a:~a : ~a " ( pad hour ) ( pad mins ) ( pad secs ) ) ) ) ( define ( LOG . args ) ( printf " [ ~a ] : " ( now ) ) ( for - each display args ) ( newline ) ( flush - output ) ) ;;
First of all , we define a struct for the connection which has ; ; an input and an output port ( define - struct connection ( input output ) ) ;;
Globals for the channel , and the thread - it is a singleton obviously ( define * connections - channel * ( make - channel ) ) ( define * connection - manager - thread * # f ) ;;
The actual manager function ; ; this constantly loops and accepts messages via * connections - channel * ;; possible messages are : ;; ' stop , ' add - connection , ' remove - connection , ; ; ' show - connection , ' clear - connections ( define ( connection - manager ) ( letrec ( ( show - command ( lambda ( command ) ( LOG " Received command [ " ( symbol - > string command ) " ] " ) ) ) ( show - connections ( lambda ( connections ) ( let* ( ( num ( length connections ) ) ( plural ( not ( = num 1 ) ) ) ) ( LOG " There " ( if plural " are " " is " ) num " connection " ( if plural " s " " " ) ) ) ) ) ( loop ( lambda ( connections ) ( let * ( ( command ( channel - get * connections - channel * ) ) ( head ( car command ) ) ) ( cond ( ( eq ? head ' stop ) ( LOG " Connection manager stopping ... " ) ) ( ( eq ? head ' add - connection ) ( loop ( cons ( cadr command ) connections ) ) ) ( ( eq ? head ' remove - connection ) ( let ( ( c ( cadr command ) ) ) ( LOG " Removing connection [ " c " ] " ) ( loop ( remove ( lambda ( e ) ( eqv? ( connection - input e ) c ) ) connections ) ) ) ) ( ( eq ? head ' show - connections ) ( show - connections connections ) ( loop connections ) ) ( ( eq ? head ' clear - connections ) ( loop '( ) ) ) ( else ( LOG " Error : unrecognised - command [ " head " ] " ) ( loop connections ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( LOG " Connection manager starting ... " ) ( loop '( ) ) ) ) ;; connection - manager - running ?
checks if the connection - manager ; ; is currently running - it is a belt and braces effort ( define ( connection - manager - running ? ) ( and ( thread ? * connection - manager - thread * ) ( thread - running ? * connection - manager-thread* ) ) ) ;;
We always check if the connection - manager is running before ;; trying to send a message as ( channel - put ... ) waits until there ; ; is a corresponding ( channel - get ... ) on another thread .
When ;; testing at the REPL , this can cause problems .
We could use an ; ; asynch stream which would n't have this problem but I prefer ;; the explicit check ( define ( connection - manager - send - message message ) ( if ( connection - manager - running ? ) ( channel - put * connections - channel * message ) ( begin ( LOG " WARN - Connection manager is not currently running " ) # f ) ) ) ;;
The actual API functions .
Most of these simply check if the ; ; connection manager is running , and if so , put the appropriate ;; message in the channel .
( define ( connection - manager - start ) ( if ( connection - manager - running ? ) ( LOG " WARN - The connection manager is already running " ) ( set ! * connection - manager - thread * ( thread connection - manager ) ) ) ) ( define ( connection - manager - stop ) ( connection - manager - send - message ( list ' stop ) ) ( set ! * connection - manager - thread * # f ) ) ( define ( connection - manager - clear - connections ) ( connection - manager - send - message ( list ' clear - connections ) ) ) ( define ( connection - manager - show - connections ) ( connection - manager - send - message ( list ' show - connections ) ) ) ( define ( connection - add input - port output - port ) ( connection - manager - send - message ( list ' add - connection ( make - connection input - port output - port ) ) ) ) ( define ( connection - remove input - port ) ( connection - manager - send - message ( list ' remove - connection input- port ) ) ) ;;; Connection Manager Test ;;
The test ... ( define ( test- connection - manager ) ( connection - manager - start ) ( connection - manager - clear - connections ) ( connection - manager - show - connections ) ( connection - add 1 2 ) ( connection - manager - show - connections ) ( connection - remove 1 ) ( connection - manager - show - connections ) ( time ( begin ( do ( ( i 0 (+ i 1 ) ) ) ( ( = i 100000 ) # t ) ( connection - add 1 2 ) ) ( connection - manager - show - connections ) ) ) ( connection - manager - stop ) ) ;; ( test - connection - manager )
From slick sci - fi to tired nerd clichés , the networks ' " geek TV " offerings run the gamut from engaging eye candy to unwatchable dreck this fall .
Read these reviews of show pilots , then set your DVR on " geek out . "

Chuck ( NBC , Sept. 24 )
Chuck ( Zachary Levi , left ) and Morgan ( Joshua Gomez ) get their geek on in Chuck .
A Geek Squad - like techie for an electronics retailer accidentally downloads the nation 's top secrets into his brain .
The National Security Agency and CIA suddenly want a piece of this guy and , natch , send their top agents to go undercover as fellow big - box drones .
The action sequences work best when they 're part of the geek plot rather than a drop - in from some spy drama a few sound stages over .
When all cylinders fire – most of the time – the fun is infectious and the hit - making potential is palpable .
WIRED : Pitch - perfect Zachary Levi channels his worker - bee equivalents from The Office and Office Space .
TIRED : Forgets its core audience at times and pushes the action - adventure angle too far , like some network suit never figured out this is n't Alias : The Geek Years .

The Big Bang Theory ( CBS , Sept. 24 )
Leonard ( Johnny Galecki , left ) and Sheldon ( Jim Parsons ) struggle through The Big Bang Theory .
The IT Crowd handily demonstrates that the premise of two hard - core ( male ) geeks plus one lust - worthy ( female ) babe has all the comedy potential any show could need .
( See below . )
But the studied humorlessness of The Big Bang Theory is made all the more painful by the fact that a solid cast ( including the versatile Johnny Galecki as alpha nerd Leonard ) has been assembled to recite 22 minutes of pandering Revenge of the Nerds duds for the camera .
WIRED :
The most technically nerd - centric of the crop , with scarcely a minute passing by without at least one reference to physics , computers , sci-fi or undue attention to pointless optimization .
TIRED : Fortunately , it 's just a theory .

Journeyman ( NBC , Sept. 24 )
Journalist Dan Vasser ( Kevin McKidd , left ) travels through time in Journeyman .
San Francisco journalist Dan Vasser ( Kevin McKidd , who played Lucius Vorenus in HBO 's Rome ) becomes unstuck in time , Slaughterhouse Five - style , to visit his one - time fiancée and prevent a murder .
Drama , theoretically , ensues .
But it 's mostly paint - by - numbers stuff , with the added confusion of randomly placed trips down the wormhole .
WIRED : Vasser sports an iPhone , and then it 's something else , and then ... is that an iPhone ?
An accidental documentary , perhaps , of the Apple - NBC divorce .
TIRED : Time - wanderer Vasser seems forever fixed with a gaze that does n't so much say , " Whoa ... time travel ! " as " What page are we on again ? "

Reaper ( The CW , Sept. 25 )
The devil ( Ray Wise , left ) shepherds his slacker prodigy Sam Oliver ( Bret Harrison ) toward a bright future in Reaper .
Writers Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas hit the mark with this The 40 - Year - Old Virgin / Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossbreed .
Sam , the demon - killer in this case , lives with his parents and works in a chain hardware store .
His parents sold his soul to the devil before he was born , and the poor schlub is stuck recapturing damned souls for the dark lord himself .
And he 's using , at least in the pilot , a handheld vacuum cleaner .
Reaper delivers the best pure comedy of any of this season 's geek offerings .
WIRED : Ray Wise is deliciously diabolical as the pinkie - ring - wearing devil .

Mission partially accomplished .
Moments of enjoyable television do pull off a daring escape from this mostly tedious pilot .
The show suffers the same problem as CDs coming from major labels these days :
When every note in a song ( or every beat in a script ) is pushed to the hilt , there 's no dynamic range , no build - ups or take - downs .
In other words , it 's boring .

Pushing Daisies ( ABC , Oct. 3 )
Stylized dramedy Pushing Daisies pushes the envelope , the color palette and all the right design - geek buttons .
Attention , design geeks :
This is a beautifully crafted ( and plotted and acted ) pilot .
Good for ABC :
The network took a chance on a great " outsider " show that actually can't be described as Something meets Something Else .
But the premise – a clever contrivance involving a baker who can bring back the dead – may run out of steam before the writers and cast can build up theirs .
I hope I 'm wrong and this winner becomes the hit it deserves to be .
WIRED : Sets , costumes and props as luscious as strawberry pie .
TIRED : Saturated , hypercolored palette is a bit over the top ; designers should get in touch with their inner grayscale .

New Biofuels Process Promises To Meet All U.S. Transportation Needs
In the H2CAR concept , hydrogen would be harvested by splitting water molecules , possibly with a well - known method called electrolysis .
Then the hydrogen would be added during the gasification step , making the process more efficient by suppressing the formation of carbon dioxide and converting all of the carbon atoms to fuel .
When conventional methods are used to convert biomass or coal to liquid fuels , 60 percent to 70 percent of the carbon atoms in the starting materials are lost in the process as carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , whereas no carbon atoms would be lost using H2CAR , Rakesh Agrawal said .
" This waste is due to the fact that you are using energy contained in the biomass to drive the entire process , " he said .
" I 'm saying , treat biomass predominantly as a supplier of carbon atoms , not as an energy source . "
by Staff Writers
West Lafayette IN ( SPX ) Mar 20 , 2007
Purdue University chemical engineers have proposed a new environmentally friendly process for producing liquid fuels from plant matter - or biomass - potentially available from agricultural and forest waste , providing all of the fuel needed for " the entire U.S. transportation sector . "
The new approach modifies conventional methods for producing liquid fuels from biomass by adding hydrogen from a " carbon - free " energy source , such as solar or nuclear power , during a step called gasification .
Adding hydrogen during this step suppresses the formation of carbon dioxide and increases the efficiency of the process , making it possible to produce three times the volume of biofuels from the same quantity of biomass , said Rakesh Agrawal , Purdue 's Winthrop E. Stone Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering .
The researchers are calling their approach a " hybrid hydrogen - carbon process , " or H2CAR .
" Further research is needed to make this a large - scale reality , " Agrawal said .
" We could use H2CAR to provide a sustainable fuel supply to meet the needs of the entire U.S. transportation sector - all cars , trucks , trains and airplanes . "
The process , which would make possible the dawning of a " hydrogen - carbon economy , " is detailed in a research paper appearing online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The paper was written by Agrawal , chemical engineering doctoral student Navneet R. Singh , and chemical engineering professors Fabio H. Ribeiro and W. Nicholas Delgass .
A conventional method for turning biomass or coal into liquid fuels involves first breaking down the raw material with a chemical process that " gasifies " it into carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide and hydrogen .
Then those constituents are turned into a liquid fuel with other processes .
In the H2CAR concept , hydrogen would be harvested by splitting water molecules , possibly with a well - known method called electrolysis .
Then the hydrogen would be added during the gasification step , making the process more efficient by suppressing the formation of carbon dioxide and converting all of the carbon atoms to fuel .
When conventional methods are used to convert biomass or coal to liquid fuels , 60 percent to 70 percent of the carbon atoms in the starting materials are lost in the process as carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , whereas no carbon atoms would be lost using H2CAR , Agrawal said .
" This waste is due to the fact that you are using energy contained in the biomass to drive the entire process , " he said .
" I 'm saying , treat biomass predominantly as a supplier of carbon atoms , not as an energy source . "
Power for the electrolysis would be provided by carbon - free energy sources , such as solar , wind or nuclear power .
And , unlike conventional methods of producing liquid fuels from plant matter and coal , H2CAR would not emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
" The goal is to accomplish the complete transformation of every carbon atom in the feedstock to liquid fuel by supplementing the conversion process with hydrogen from a carbon - free energy source , " Agrawal said .
Other researchers have estimated that the United States has a sustainable supply of about 1.4 billion tons of biomass each year that could be used specifically for the production of liquid fuels .
With conventional methods , that quantity of biomass would provide 30 percent of the fuel required for the nation 's annual transportation needs .
But the same quantity of biomass would provide enough fuel to meet all transportation needs using the new H2CAR method , Agrawal said .
" This is possible without using any additional land , " he said .
A federal study indicates that 1 billion tons of biomass is potentially available every year from agricultural sources such as crop wastes , animal manure , grains and other crops .
The remaining biomass could come from sources including fuel wood from forests , wastes left over from wood processing mills and paper mills , and construction and demolition debris .
The process also offers potential advantages over producing liquid fuels from coal using conventional methods , which emit carbon dioxide .
Because H2CAR would not emit this additional carbon dioxide , the process would eliminate the need for proposed carbon dioxide " sequestering . "
Sequestering would involve pumping carbon dioxide emissions into saltwater aquifers and hollow underground pockets that used to contain oil , natural gas and coal deposits .
But the procedure poses several potential pitfalls .
" Clearly , massive quantities of carbon dioxide would be sequestered during a century - long production of liquid fuels from coal , " Agrawal aid .
" This would place extreme demands on the carbon dioxide capture , storage and monitoring systems . "
The new process also would be more practical than all - electric or hydrogen - powered cars , in part because of the limited storage capacity of batteries and hydrogen storage tanks .
" The tremendous convenience provided by the existing infrastructure for delivering and storing today 's fuels is a huge deterrent to introducing technologies that use only batteries or hydrogen alone , " Agrawal said .
" A major advantage of our process is that it would enable us to use the current infrastructure and internal combustion engine technology .
It is quite attractive for hybrid electric vehicles and plug - in hybrid electric vehicles . "
To grow enough biomass for the entire nation 's transportation needs using the conventional method for producing biofuels would require a land area 25 percent to 55 percent the size of the United States , compared with about 6 percent to 10 percent for the H2CAR process .
" This large reduction of land area needed for H2CAR provides an opportunity for sustainable production of hydrocarbon fuel for the foreseeable future , " Agrawal said .
A major reason less land would be needed is because of the overall higher efficiency of generating hydrogen by splitting water molecules using solar energy to drive the electrolysis .
Usually , the hydrogen in liquid fuels made from biomass comes from the plant matter itself .
But it typically takes more than 10 times the solar energy to grow crops than it does to produce the equivalent quantity of hydrogen possessing the same energy content by using the solar - power electrolysis method , he said .
" So providing hydrogen derived from water through solar electrolysis reduces the amount of biomass needed , " Agrawal said .
" The average energy efficiency of growing crops is typically less than 1 percent , whereas the energy efficiency of photovoltaic cells to split water into hydrogen and oxygen is about 8 - 10 percent .
I am getting hydrogen at a higher efficiency than I get biomass , meaning I need less land . "
Using coal exclusively to produce liquid fuels for the nation 's transportation sector could deplete all coal deposits in the United States in about 90 years , whereas H2CAR would enable the known coal reserves to last 140 years .
The researchers suggest in the paper the chemical processing steps needed to make the new approach practical .
But making the concept economically competitive with gasoline and diesel fuel would require research in two areas : finding ways to produce cheap hydrogen from carbon - free sources and developing a new type of gasifier needed for the process .
" Having said that , this is the first concept for creating a sustainable system that derives all of our transportation fuels from biomass , " Agrawal said .
Purdue has filed a patent for the concept .
The approach is in the conceptual stages , and a plan for experimental research is in progress .
Report details US refusals of foreign aid after Katrina Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 27 , 2007
Print This Email
This A new report reveals the US government turned down offers of help from across the globe in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , telling one diplomat " human assistance of any kind is not on our priorities list . "
The report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington relies on a review of 25,000 documents obtained from the State Department .
The report reveals the US was interested mostly in cash assistance and materials , rather than direct aid from foreign relief workers and doctors , after Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005 .
" A review of the State Department documents reveals distressing ineptitude , " CREW 's executive director Melanie Sloan said in a prepared statement .
" Countries were trying to donate desperately needed goods and services , but as a result of bureaucratic bungling and indifference , those most in need of these generous offers and of aid never received it . "
Offers to help came from 145 countries and 12 international organizations .
The US did accept help from its top allies around the globe , but CREW 's report shows it left unclaimed hundreds of thousands of prepared meals , water pumps , doctors and medicine .
Many of the offers were turned down because of a strict adherence to bureaucratic regulations , the report reveals .
For example , questions about medical licensing prevented foreign - trained doctors from helping in the Gulf Coast .
" All , The ( sic ) word here is that doctors of any kind are in the ' forget about it ' category , " read an e-mail from the State Department responding to an offer of assistance from Argentina .
" Human assistance of any kind is not on our priorities list ...
It 's all about goods , not people , at this point . "
A ban on British beef in place over fears of Mad Cow disease prevented Meals Ready to Eat from the UK being given to Katrina refugees .
The uneaten MREs were kept in a storage unit at a cost of $ 16,000 per month , according to the report .
The disorganization that plagued Katrina cleanup efforts also strained diplomatic relations , when the US ignored offers of aid from other countries .
" It is getting downright embarrassing here not to have a response to the Estonians on flood relief , " Jeffrey Goldstein , a U.S. Embassy official in Estonia , wrote in an e-mail to several State Department officials . " ...
We know that what the Estonians can offer is small potatoes and everyone at FEMA is swamped , but at this point even ' thanks but no thanks ' is better than deafening silence . "
An Israeli plane filled with supplies for the relief effort sat fully loaded on an airport tarmac for more than 48 hours because of a lack of communication from the US , according to another e-mail released with the report .
" The vendors are getting restless .
They offered this stuff 48 hours ago , and the government has n't responded , " wrote an unidentified State Department official .
" I 've been on the phone with the [ Israeli ] attache every couple of hours since noon ... they 're patient , but not amused by our delay , obviously . "

Online ' Pandemic ' a Virtual Gold Mine for Epidemiologists
Computer Glitch in Popular Game Offers Glimpse of Pandemic Spread
Widespread quarantines .
Bodies by the hundreds lying dead in the streets .
A mass hysteria that converted once - bustling cities into ghost towns .
Such was the scenario in the fall of 2005 , when a plague known as Corrupted Blood swept across the land .
Do n't remember it ?
You might not have been logged on .
The calamity did not occur in the real world , of course .
But the pandemiclike event that occurred in September 2005 in the online multiplayer realm of World of Warcraft has some researchers interested in whether such online environs could be used to predict the spread of infectious diseases in the real world .
" There are actually parallels between what would happen in the real world and what happened in this game , " said Nina Fefferman , professor of applied mathematics at Rutgers University .
Fefferman is lead author of a research paper released Monday in the journal the Lancet Infectious Diseases examining the lessons of the Corrupted Blood pandemic and how they might be applied to real world disease control efforts .
" This gives us the opportunity in the future to tailor infections in the virtual world to see what would happen in the real world , " she said .
World of Warcraft is a game in which players from around the world log on , interact and develop their characters in a fantasy setting .
For these players , it 's the ultimate in interactive recreation .
But for researchers , the game holds tantalizing promise as a social model in which the conditions may be readily manipulated .
" Here , we have a large - scale computer simulation where we know everything about the disease , but its spread is determined largely by human behavior , " said study co-author Eric Lofgren , a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
" This is all free from the fact that you can't do this sort of thing in the real world because it would be horrifyingly unethical . "
Some epidemiologists agreed that while the Corrupted Blood incident might not bear a direct similarity to a real - world infection , the spread of the online " disease " was an intriguing occurrence .
" I think it 's interesting , and fun , " said William Schaffner , chair of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville , Tenn .
" To the degree that any of these simulations and some of these games have utility , this can have utility also . "
" We should n't overinterpret the results , but it is instructive to a degree . "
A Virtual Pandemic
In the time of the Corrupted Blood pandemic , the parallels , though spiked with fantasy gaming flavor , were uncanny .
As with many real - world epidemics , the symptoms of the disease were nightmarish .
" Once infected there would be an animated gush of blood , " Lofgren said .
" The infected character would lose health at anywhere from a trivial rate , all the way to nearly instant death if you had just started playing the game . "
However , it was the fashion in which the disease was spread that many researchers find fascinating due to its similarity to potential real - world situations .
On its most basic level , being infected with the " disease " depended on your proximity to a character that was infected — and subsequently gushing diseased blood in all directions .
But as with many real - world viruses such as bird flu , the many virtual animals and pets present in the game could also act as carriers of the disease , facilitating its spread .
Travel was also an important element ; though international airports are absent from the medieval setting of World of Warcraft , infected characters often " teleported " from battle areas into crowded town squares , often infecting the dozens of characters unfortunate enough to be near their points of entry .
When game developer Blizzard Entertainment Inc. of Irvine , Calif. , grasped the devastating nature of the disease , it set up voluntary quarantines , which , predictably enough , were summarily violated by many , allowing the illness to spread further within the virtual realm .
" Probably the single most interesting thing for me was the player resistance to the notion of quarantine , " Schaffner said , adding that the event could hold further interest for pandemic researchers due to the nature of the infection .
" This is a highly contagious infection they created , " he said .
" That 's reminiscent of influenza . "
The resulting pandemic spread , contained only by the separate servers on the game 's mainframe .
And though Lofgren said the event was so unexpected that an accurate account of all of the deaths could not be made , the character death toll over a few short days likely reached into the thousands .
" A lot of capital cities on servers that were infected had to be abandoned for a while , " he recalled .
" There were major disruptions of commerce . "
" You had whole cities that essentially became uninhabitable . "
A New Tool ?
Fortunately for World of Warcraft 's varied populace of warriors , orcs and mages , the Corrupted Blood pandemic was short - lived — ultimately solved by a few timely lines of code and a click of the reset button to instantly resurrect all who had perished .
" We were able to fix it within a week of discovery , " said a Blizzard spokesperson .
" During this time , we worked closely with our community to inform them about the bug and let them know that a fix was in the works . "
But Fefferman said the online realm 's tragedy could be the real world 's gain if such a tool could be harnessed for infectious disease research .
" That 's my hope — that it will become a new framework for scientific experimentation , " she said .
" Without actually putting anyone in danger , we can see these behaviors occur . "
Lofgren agreed .
" It 's a compelling idea . … A computer simulation relies on a series of assumptions .
Most researchers recognize , however , that people are n't governed by a rigid set of rules . "
If such a " planned pandemic " occurs , however , do n't expect to see it on World of Warcraft .
A Blizzard spokesperson said that there are no current plans to replicate the experience .
" Since World of Warcraft is first and foremost a game , our design decisions are determined by what will provide the most entertaining and enjoyable experiences for our players , " the spokesperson said .
It 's an odd combination of Navier - Stokes equations and NASCAR driving .
Computer scientists at the University of Washington have developed software that is incorporated in new technology allowing television audiences to instantaneously see how air flows around speeding cars .
The algorithm , first presented at a computer graphics conference last August , was since used by sports network ESPN and sporting - technology company Sportvision Inc. to create a new effect for racing coverage .
The fast - paced innovation hit prime time in late July when ESPN used the Draft Track technology to visualize the air flow behind cars in the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard , a NASCAR race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
Zoran Popović , an associate professor in the UW 's department of computer science and engineering , and two students wrote the code that dramatically speeds up real - time fluid dynamics simulations .
Working with ESPN , a Chicago - based company named Sportvision developed the application for NASCAR competition .
The Draft Track application calculates air flow over the cars and then displays it as colors trailing behind the car .
Green , blue , yellow and red correspond to different speeds and directions for air flow when two or more cars approach one another while driving at speeds upward of 200 miles per hour .
" What ESPN wanted to do is tell the story for the viewer of how drafting works because it 's such a big part of the event , " said Rick Cavallaro , chief scientist at Sportvision .
" How the drivers use drafting to save gas , pick up speed , et cetera . "
The UW researchers ' breakthrough was figuring out how to simulate and display complex systems very quickly .
Studios such as Pixar already use physical laws , such as the Navier - Stokes fluids equations , in their animations .
This allows the studios to create realistic pictures of how smoke curls , how a fire 's flames lick , and even how hair or fabric blows in the wind .
But these calculations take hours to run on many high - performance computers .
And increasing the speed of the image is only one challenge of moving to a real - time setting .
advertisement
" The studios shoot a two - second special effect and if it does n't work they just change the parameters and try again , " Popović said .
" But in a real - time context the simulation has to run indefinitely , and for an unforeseen set of inputs . "
To make the simulation work in real time and be interactive , " you kind of need to rethink the math problem , " he said .
" The method that ended up being used is drastically different from what people have done before . "
The new algorithm first simulates all the ways that smoke , fire -- or in this case , modified stock cars -- can behave .
Then it runs the simulation for a reduced number of physically possible parameters .
This allows the model to run a million times faster than before .
The researchers presented the work at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference in August 2006 .
Popović imagined that the first applications would be introducing interactive simulations in video games that would allow players to drive through a smoky fire , interact with the weather in a flight simulator , or drive racecars in a virtual wind tunnel .
Other research results from his lab were licensed to the game industry and then adopted in video games .
But in March , Sportvision approached the researchers to see whether it could license the software for use in NASCAR visualizations .
The two parties agreed to a nonexclusive , open - source agreement where the company would be allowed to use the technique .
" What 's interesting is how the flow from the car in front is affecting the cars behind , " Popović said .
" When there are two cars behind , then the interaction becomes very complex . "
advertisement
Sportvision creates technology to enhance sports coverage .
It introduced the glowing puck for National Hockey League telecasts in the mid 1990s and later came up with the yellow lines that drag a virtual highlighter over the first - down line in football .
The company has already developed add - ons for ESPN 's NASCAR coverage , placing Global Positioning System receivers , inertial measurement systems and telemetry on each car that can determine each car 's speed and position several times a second .
Now company engineers will use data from those sensors to model and display the air flowing over the cars .
" This is certainly not an application that had occurred to me , " admitted Adrien Treuille , a doctoral student who co-authored the software .
He , like Popović , said he had not previously been a NASCAR fan .
The group hoped the work might be used for realistic training simulations such as firefighters entering a smoke - filled building .
" But once [ Sportvision ] called us and started describing what they wanted to do , " Treuille recalled , " We said , ' Yes , that would totally work . ' "

Australia creates wildlife corridor
July 25 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
Australia ’s Prime Minister is yet to put his autograph on the Kyoto Protocol but at least the Federal Government is smart enough to figure out that wildlife on the world ’s driest continent is going to have a pretty rough time as the planet heats up .
Australian State and Federal Governments have agreed ( a shock in itself really ) to create a 2,800 kilometre wildlife corridor according to a piece in Reuters .
The entire East Coast of Australia – from the Australian Alps ( south - eastern Australia ) to the tropical north – will link national parks , state forests and Government land .
Clearly , there ’s going to have to be some snappy negotiation with private landowners who might be in the path of the proposed corridor .
Not sure either how the animals and plants will find this magical corridor , but presumably as the Land Down Under sizzles under temperatures rising by up to 6.7 degrees Celsius ( 12 degrees Fahrenheit ) by 2080 , the preserved areas will function as protective ecosystems .
As one of the scientists involved in the proposal said : “ The effects of climate change will likely to be less severe in systems that have some resilience and that we have n’t gone in and buggered - up ” .
A thumbs up to the Australian Government for this initiative !
And in related news from National Geographic : the heat is off the sun .
A favourite argument of those denying climate change has been that cyclical changes in solar activity have periodically resulted in warmer periods throughout history .
The beginning of the 20th Century , particularly the 1930s , experienced warmer temperatures .
But that trend reversed after 1985 and cannot explain the rapidly increasing temperatures the world is facing .
As one climate scientist quipped :
“ Think of the sun as a criminal suspect who has a long record , but a cast iron alibi for the latest crime …..
And meanwhile , the fingerprints of CO2 are all over the murder weapon ” .

Martin Plante , hot off his gig at Xceed has created slimKEYS , a " universal hotkey manager " with a simple .NET plugin architecture .
If you 've got ideas or thoughts , visit the slimCODE Forums .
Have you ever wanted to bind something to Shift - Ctrl - Alt - Window - Q but did n't know how to grab a global hotkey ?
This will launch programs , watch folders , and find files .
It has great potential as more and more plugins appear .

Humanized Enso -
Unquestionably the smoothest and most interesting user interface of the launchers , Enso pops up as the Caps - Lock key is held down , and performs the command when the key is released .
It takes a minute to understand , but it 's a very clean UI metaphor .

Colibri -
The closest thing so far , IMHO , to Quicksilver on Windows , although this little gem has a slow startup time , it runs fast !
It 's being actively developed and promises integration with a dozen third party programs .
It also formally supports " Portable Mode " for those of you who like to carry your apps around on a USB key .

DashCommand -
The world continues to try to make QuickSilver for Windows and the very fresh DashCommand is a good start .
Dash does a nice job of using the current context ( like the currently selected folder ) for it 's commands .
Select a folder in Explorer , call up Dash and say Zip and it's zipped .

ActiveWords - Arguably the most minimal of these launchers ( as it can have no UI at all if you like ! ) , but the most configurable .
ActiveWords watches everything you type , in every application , so anything you 've just typed could potentially be used by you to launch a program , a macro , send email , or give you Auto - Correct in any application .
Check out their screencast / demos and their scripting language .
It also is the only launcher ( I 've seen ) with explicit support for the Tablet PC and allows ink to trigger an " Active Word . "

New research to be published in the Journal of Management Studies reveals that employees in the US are bullied up to 50 % more often than workers in Scandinavia .
However , just 9 % of employees were aware that the negative acts they experienced constituted bullying , suggesting that bullying behaviour is ingrained in the culture of the US workplace .
The study , led by Pamela Lutgen - Sandvik , is also one of the first to investigate the impact of bullying on non-bullied employees , and finds that the negative effects are widespread : employees who witness others being bullied suffer secondary harm , reporting high levels of stress , and low levels of work satisfaction .
Lutgen - Sandvik explains why this study is so significant : " Workers suffering on the job and thinking they 're ' going crazy ' learn that the phenomenon has a name , what it looks like , that it happens to many workers , and potentially , what they might do about it . "
The study concludes that US organizational and cultural structures frequently enable , trigger , and reward bullying .
U.S. companies stress market processes , individualism , and the importance of managers over workers , which discourages collaborative efforts and enables powerful organizational members to bully others without recrimination .
Steven Floyd , an editor at JMS says " This paper helps to surface a problem that plagues far too many employees and that too few people are willing to speak openly about .
It is also an exemplar of top quality academic research that meets the test of relevance . "

Mathematician John Todd , a pioneer in numerical analysis and computing , died Thursday at age 96 at his home in Pasadena , Calif .
Todd , an emeritus professor at the California Instate of Technology , helped shape the foundation for today 's computer science field , Caltech said in a news release .
Todd , who was born in Ireland and raised in Belfast , served with the British Admiralty during World War II .
He is referred to by some as the " Savior of Oberwolfach " for preventing the destruction of the Mathematical Research Institute at Oberwolfach in Germany .
In an oral history for Caltech , Todd called the incident as " probably the best thing I ever did for mathematics . "
In 1947 , he and his wife Olga came to the United States to help establish the National Applied Mathematical Laboratories at UCLA , part of the National Bureau of Standards .
They later moved to the NBS headquarters in Washington , where they helped launch the field of high - speed computer programming and analysis and also became U.S. citizens .
The couple began teaching at Caltech in 1957 .

Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters led by Buddhist monks have rallied in Burma 's main city of Rangoon .
The peaceful rally was launched from the golden Shwedagon Pagoda , and many civilians soon joined in .
Demands ranged from calls for the military government to step down to requests for negotiations and economic reforms .
Among those who joined in were members of the opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party .
Columns of protesters stretched for about a mile ( 1.6 km ) , some participants said .
They said as many as 100,000 people marched , making it the biggest protest in the past several days .
Rallies were also reportedly held in other cities .
Security forces were not in evidence for most of the march in Rangoon , but Burma 's military junta later warned it was ready to " take action " against protesters .
Monks are revered in Burma , but there are fears of a repeat of 1988 , when a pro-democracy uprising was brutally crushed by the army .
On Saturday , protesters greeted pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , who is under a house arrest , but police blocked access to her house on Sunday and Monday .

What are these ?
This message is so important that I have decided to repost it with some extra information .
SaveNetRadio.org has declared a Day of Silence for internet radio broadcast on Tuesday June 26th .
The stations that participate will give listeners only a taste of what it will be like after July 15th if the increased royalty rate is upheld .
Stations that go silent will likely include Pandora , Live 365 , Yahoo LAUNCHcast , and MTV Online , and NPR member stations .
These stations , plus others like AccuRadio , Radioio , Digitally Imported , Rhapsody and many more would be seriously impacted by retroactive royalty increases equal to 50 - 300 % of the station ’s current revenue income .
In Rhapsody , Pandora and Live365 ’s cases , the increase would also penalize their multiple channels platform , causing rate increases equal to more than 1000 % of their current revenue .
1000 % !
According to the RAIN ( Radio And Internet Newsletter ) :
Webcasters will be alerting their listeners that “ silence ” is what Internet radio may sound like on or shortly after July 15th , the day on which 17 months ’ worth of retroactive royalty increase payments are due to the SoundExchange collection organization under the terms of a recent Copyright Royalty Board ( CRB ) decision .
Read more about the situation on the RAIN website and check out SaveNetRadio.org for more options of what you – the listener , the musician , the dj , the webcaster – can do to help .

Ruby やRailsは遅いから使えるんです。
言語のパフォーマンスを重視してみたところで無駄
- 開発者はみんなフレームワークを欲しがる：
やはりフレームワークが欲しくなってくる
残念なことに野良フレームワークの誕生で、パフォーマンスが低下していく：
新規に開発する分量を減らすためにフレームワークが大部分の処理を賄うようになっていきます
自分で作ったCの野良フレームワークと比較するとRailsの方が遥かに優秀
天才のあなたはパフォーマンスと引き換えに結局Ruby on Railsを作ることになります
本当にパフォーマンスを得たいのであれば、フレームワークなんか使わない・作らないこと：
かも知れな い
昨今のビジネスプランの風潮は 「 さっさとリリース 」 ：
開発フェーズに時間をかけてしまうと、その間に同じサービスが出てきてしまいます。
数多く色々なサービスを短期にリリースして試してみる方が重要です。
長く運用しなければならないような大ヒットサービスが出てくるのは稀です。
プロジェクト全体の期間は決まっているけど、開発フェーズに限って急ぐ必要は特にありません。
一品物をしっかり動く状態でリリースするのが重要です。
長く運用できるほうが嬉しい。業務上どうしても使わなければならない必要悪なサービスすらあります。
補足：
もう全 部Rubyでいいじゃないか！
逆でしょう。論点を整えますが、設計者、主にプログラマから見て「使える」と表現しています。経営やプロジェクトマネジメントの観点まで広げると、Railsを採用するということは端的に言えば、「開発フェーズを効率化して運用フェーズでコストとして被る」ということです。ビジネスプランも加味した上でのトレードオフになります。文句無しにパフォーマンスが良いので、Cで全てを書くとどうなるかです。設計の初期段階で似たような処理が存在することを想定できたり、開発したりしているうちに、狭い開発グループでしか使わないようなフレームワークなので、もはやこれは野良フレームワークですね。多分に独自な設計で作られ、テストケースは通したから想定する範囲では普通に動く。リリース後の荒波に揉まれていないので、バグやらセキュリティの問題も潜在的にはいっぱい含まれている何とも野良なフレームワーク。でもそいつはある程度の形になって完成する。企業規模によっては野良フレームワークを開発プロセス組み込み、自社方法論と銘打てるまで昇華させたりもします。僕が2000年辺りに作って今でも細々と運営している「 ぴのこ村 」の９割はCで書かれています。当時は実験的な意味合いから作っていたのですが、それでもやっているうちに野良フレームワークが出来上がっていきました。正確な数字は計測していませんが、汎用性を切り捨ててモリモリ実装したコードの実行時間と比較すると、10倍程度遅くなるのは仕方ないでしょう。僕は常に思うんですが、Rubyのようなスクリプト言語は、Cで作られた新しいフレームワークと同一ではないかと。コーディングとは突き詰めていけば新たに言語を設計するようなものですし。Ruby on Rails は 「 Cで作られたフレームワーク( =Ruby ) 」をベースとし た 「 Webのためのフレームワー ク ( =Rails ) 」
です。天才が作ったこともあり当初から輝いてはいましたが、万人に晒されて更に磨かれ、Twitterのような実績も生まれました。どう考えてもです。野良フレームワークを作っている時間や費用の方がもったいない。仮にあなたは設計者でありプログラマで、万物を生み出せる無二の天才的頭脳の持ち主だとしましょう。もし、そこがCしか無い世界であれば、Rubyを採用することで失ったパフォーマンスはスケーラビリティのコストとして後々表面化します。またスケールアウト時にはマシン台数が増えて、メンテナンスのランニング費用が特に脹らむことでしょう。これが先に表現した「開発フェーズを効率化して運用フェーズでコストとして被る」話になります。結局Cを採用しても野良フレームワークを作ってしまうとパフォーマンスの低下が起こるわけで、あとは所詮程度の問題です。あるプロジェクトは満足するかも知れないし、しないかも知れない。これはここで議論しても仕方ないので、本当にパフォーマンスを得たいのであれば、野良を含めあらゆるフレームワークは諦めるしかないんじゃないかと思うわけです。そのURLへのリクエストのためにどう処理するかを丹念に作っていけばパフォーマンスは劇的に向上しますよ。すると今度は逆のことが起こります。「開発フェーズにコストをかけた分、運用フェーズのコスト削減ができる」と。だったらRails使っちゃうよね！しかし、日本のエンタープライズ分野の殆どがこれとは真逆。それでも今後は三角合併だとかM&Aが増えたり、SOAなどの観点が入ってきてエンタープライズ分野も少しずつアプリケーションのあり方が変わってきていますから、さっさとリリースすることが重要なケースも増えてくるのではないでしょうか。遅ればせながら、その時Ruby on Railsを採用する意味が出てくるのではないか、と思います。まつもとゆきひろさんの日記にもありますが、
YARVが今後パフォーマンスを改善していくだろう とのこと。失うパフォーマンスを最小にするという改善活動には頭が下がります…。もう野良フレームワークを作る意味は全く無い。
Exactly 20 years ago on this day , June 12 , 1987 , President Ronald Reagan stood at the Brandenburg Gate of the Berlin Wall in West Berlin where he gave what would become one of his most famous speeches .
This was the speech where President Reagan encouraged Mikhail Gorbachev to drop the Iron Curtain and release Eastern Europe from Soviet oppression .
The following line is the most memorable and the most powerful :
There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable , that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace .
General Secretary Gorbachev , if you seek peace , if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , if you seek liberalization :
Come here to this gate !
Mr. Gorbachev , open this gate !
Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall !
Reaganâ€™s speech writers and advisors repeatedly told him that he should strike this line from the speech .
They feared it was to bold .
Indeed , this was a bold statement but I for one , am glad Reagan did not listen to his advisors .
To this day , when I hear the recording of Ronald Reagan delivering this line , it brings me chills up and down my spine .
President Reagan instinctively knew that he was standing before individuals who had families and friends on the other side of the wall or had previously escaped the oppression found on the other side themselves .
These were people who hungered for freedom for their friends separated by a wall which was a symbolic as well as physical barrier to the hopes and dreams of an oppressed people .
On November 9 , 1989 , the wall came down allowing some 10,000 East Germans to join the free world .
Many factors contributed to the wallâ€™s ultimate demise and President Ronald Reagan played no small part .
Read the entire speech below the fold .
Thank you very much .
Chancellor Kohl , Governing Mayor Diepgen , ladies and gentlemen : Twenty four years ago , President John F. Kennedy visited Berlin , speaking to the people of this city and the world at the city hall .
Well , since then two other presidents have come , each in his turn , to Berlin .
And today I , myself , make my second visit to your city .
We come to Berlin , we American Presidents , because it ’s our duty to speak , in this place , of freedom .
But I must confess , we ’re drawn here by other things as well : by the feeling of history in this city , more than 500 years older than our own nation ; by the beauty of the Grunewald and the Tiergarten ; most of all , by your courage and determination .
Perhaps the composer , Paul Lincke , understood something about American Presidents .
You see , like so many Presidents before me , I come here today because wherever I go , whatever I do : “ Ich hab noch einen koffer in Berlin . ” [ I still have a suitcase in Berlin . ]
Our gathering today is being broadcast throughout Western Europe and North America .
I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the East .
To those listening throughout Eastern Europe , I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the American people .
To those listening in East Berlin , a special word :
Although I can not be with you , I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before me .
For I join you , as I join your fellow countrymen in the West , in this firm , this unalterable belief : Es gibt nur ein Berlin .
[ There is only one Berlin . ]
Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city , part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe .
From the Baltic , south , those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire , concrete , dog runs , and guardtowers .
Farther south , there may be no visible , no obvious wall .
But there remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same–still a restriction on the right to travel , still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women the will of a totalitarian state .
Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most clearly ; here , cutting across your city , where the news photo and the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world .
Standing before the Brandenburg Gate , every man is a German , separated from his fellow men .
Every man is a Berliner , forced to look upon a scar .
President von Weizsacker has said : “ The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed . ”
Today I say :
As long as this gate is closed , as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand , it is not the German question alone that remains open , but the question of freedom for all mankind .
Yet I do not come here to lament .
For I find in Berlin a message of hope , even in the shadow of this wall , a message of ( Pg. 635 ) triumph .
In this season of spring in 1945 , the people of Berlin emerged from their air raid shelters to find devastation .
Thousands of miles away , the people of the United States reached out to help .
And in 1947 Secretary of State–as you ’ve been told - George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall plan .
Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month , he said : “ Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine , but against hunger , poverty , desperation , and chaos . ”
In the Reichstag a few moments ago , I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the Marshall plan .
I was struck by the sign on a burnt - out , gutted structure that was being rebuilt .
I understand that Berliners of my own generation can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the Western sectors of the city .
The sign read simply : “ The Marshall plan is helping here to strengthen the free world . ”
A strong , free world in the West , that dream became real .
Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant .
Italy , France , Belgium–virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth ; the European Community was founded .
In West Germany and here in Berlin , there took place an economic miracle , the Wirtschaftswunder .
Adenauer , Erhard , Reuter , and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty –that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech , so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom .
The German leaders reduced tariffs , expanded free trade , lowered taxes .
From 1950 to 1960 alone , the standard of living in West Germany and Berlin doubled .
Where four decades ago there was rubble , today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in Germany - busy office blocks , fine homes and apartments , proud avenues , and the spreading lawns of park land .
Where a city ’s culture seemed to have been destroyed , today there are two great universities , orchestras and an opera , countless theaters , and museums .
Where there was want , today there ’s abundance–food , clothing , automobiles - the wonderful goods of the Ku’damm .
From devastation , from utter ruin , you Berliners have , in freedom , rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on Earth .
The Soviets may have had other plans .
But , my friends , there were a few things the Soviets did n’t count on Berliner herz , Berliner humor , ja , und Berliner schnauze .
[ Berliner heart , Berliner humor , yes , and a Berliner schnauze . ]
[ Laughter ]
In the 1950 ’s , Khrushchev predicted : “ We will bury you . ”
But in the West today , we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well - being unprecedented in all human history .
In the Communist world , we see failure , technological backwardness , declining standards of health , even want of the most basic kind - too little food .
Even today , the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself .
After these four decades , then , there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion : Freedom leads to prosperity .
Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace .
Freedom is the victor .
And now the Soviets themselves may , in a limited way , be coming to understand the importance of freedom .
We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness .
Some political prisoners have been released .
Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed .
Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control .
Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state ?
Or are they token gestures , intended to raise false hopes in the West , or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it ?
We welcome change and openness ; for we believe that freedom and security go together , that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace .
There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable , that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace .
General Secretary Gorbachev , if you seek peace , if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , if you seek liberalization :
Come here to this gate !
Mr. Gorbachev , open this gate !
Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall !
I understand the fear of war and the pain ( Pg. 636 ) of division that afflict this continent–and I pledge to you my country ’s efforts to help overcome these burdens .
To be sure , we in the West must resist Soviet expansion .
So we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength .
Yet we seek peace ; so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides .
Beginning 10 years ago , the Soviets challenged the Western alliance with a grave new threat , hundreds of new and more deadly SS - 20 nuclear missiles , capable of - striking every capital in Europe .
The Western alliance responded by committing itself to a counterdeployment unless the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution ; namely , the elimination of such weapons on both sides .
For many months , the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness .
As the alliance , in turn , prepared to go forward with its counterdeployment , there were difficult days–days of protests like those during my 1982 visit to this city–and the Soviets later walked away from the table .
But through it all , the alliance held firm .
And I invite those who protested then –I invite those who protest today –to mark this fact : Because we remained strong , the Soviets came back to the table .
And because we remained strong , today we have within reach the possibility , not merely of limiting the growth of arms , but of eliminating , for the first time , an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth .
As I speak , NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons .
At the talks in Geneva , we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons .
And the Western allies have likewise made far - reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons .
While we pursue these arms reductions , I pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter Soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur .
And in cooperation with many of our allies , the United States is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative - research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation , but on defenses that truly defend ; on systems , in short , that will not target populations , but shield them .
By these means we seek to increase the safety of Europe and all the world .
But we must remember a crucial fact : East and West do not mistrust each other because we are armed ; we are armed because we mistrust each other .
And our differences are not about weapons but about liberty .
When President Kennedy spoke at the City Hall those 24 years ago , freedom was encircled , Berlin was under siege .
And today , despite all the pressures upon this city , Berlin stands secure in its liberty .
And freedom itself is transforming the globe .
In the Philippines , in South and Central America , democracy has been given a rebirth .
Throughout the Pacific , free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth .
In the industrialized nations , a technological revolution is taking place–a revolution marked by rapid , dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications .
In Europe , only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom .
Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth , of information and innovation , the Soviet Union faces a choice :
It must make fundamental changes , or it will become obsolete .
Today thus represents a moment of hope .
We in the West stand ready to cooperate with the East to promote true openness , to break down barriers that separate people , to create a safer , freer world .
And surely there is no better place than Berlin , the meeting place of East and West , to make a start .
Free people of Berlin : Today , as in the past , the United States stands for the strict observance and full implementation of all parts of the Four Power Agreement of 1971 .
Let us use this occasion , the 750th anniversary of this city , to usher in a new era , to seek a still fuller , richer life for the Berlin of the future .
Together , let us maintain and develop the ties between the Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin , which is permitted by the 1971 agreement .
And I invite Mr. Gorbachev :
Let us work to bring the Eastern and Western parts of the city closer together , so that all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with life in one of the great cities of the world .
To open Berlin still further to ( Pg. 637 ) all Europe , East and West , let us expand the vital air access to this city , finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more convenient , more comfortable , and more economical .
We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe .
With our French and British partners , the United States is prepared to help bring international meetings to Berlin .
It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of United Nations meetings , or world conferences on human rights and arms control or other issues that call for international cooperation .
There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds , and we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges , cultural events , and other programs for young Berliners from the East .
Our French and British friends , I ’m certain , will do the same .
And it ’s my hope that an authority can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the Western sectors .
One final proposal , one close to my heart : Sport represents a source of enjoyment and ennoblement , and you many have noted that the Republic of Korea–South Korea - has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place in the North .
International sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city .
And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold the Olympic games here in Berlin , East and West ?
In these four decades , as I have said , you Berliners have built a great city .
You ’ve done so in spite of threats –the Soviet attempts to impose the East - mark , the blockade .
Today the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall .
What keeps you here ?
Certainly there ’s a great deal to be said for your fortitude , for your defiant courage .
But I believe there ’s something deeper , something that involves Berlin ’s whole look and feel and way of life –not mere sentiment .
No one could live long in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions .
Something instead , that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them , that continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian presence that refuses to release human energies or aspirations .
Something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation , that says yes to this city , yes to the future , yes to freedom .
In a word , I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love–love both profound and abiding .
Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter , to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West .
The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit , thwarting the human impulse to create , to enjoy , to worship .
The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront .
Years ago , before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches , they erected a secular structure : the television tower at Alexander Platz .
Virtually ever since , the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower ’s one major flaw , treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind .
Yet even today when the Sun strikes that sphere –that sphere that towers over all Berlin –the light makes the sign of the cross .
There in Berlin , like the city itself , symbols of love , symbols of worship , cannot be suppressed .
As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag , that embodiment of German unity , I noticed words crudely spray - painted upon the wall , perhaps by a young Berliner , “ This wall will fall .
Beliefs become reality . ”
Yes , across Europe , this wall will fall .
For it cannot withstand faith ; it cannot withstand truth .
The wall cannot withstand freedom .
And I would like , before I close , to say one word .
I have read , and I have been questioned since I ’ve been here about certain demonstrations against my coming .
And I would like to say just one thing , and to those who demonstrate so .
I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek , no one would ever be able to do what they ’re doing again .
Thank you and God bless you all .
Citing shortage of armored humvees , Army has soldiers train on simulators Julie Weisberg
Published : Wednesday August 8 , 2007
Print This Email This U.S. Army bases have begun to use computer simulators to familiarize soldiers with combat driving techniques for the " up- armored "
Humvee because the military has not provided enough of the vehicles to allow for troop training , a RAW STORY investigation has found .
Manufactured by Virginia - based military contractor MPRI , the virtual vehicle is a computerized convoy and combat patrol drivers training program for the M - 1114 , a more heavily armored ( " up- armored " ) version of the militarys standard Humvee .
The simulators are now in use by the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum in New York to train soldiers going to fight in Iraq .
The Third Army Forward also has several of the machines at its Kuwait base .
Dick Gerding , vice president of business operations for MPRI s simulator group and a former longtime Army infantryman , said most new Humvees are delivered straight to the front lines overseas and therefore are unavailable for troop training .
Therefore , the company  which also conducts in - theater convoy driver training for the Army  worked with the military to develop the simulator to help fill the gap .
 We dont have enough of them built to train [ soldiers ] ... so , drivers dont get training on them until they get to Iraq ,  Gerding said .
But Army Public Information Officer Major Thomas McCuin said that soldiers do receive some sort of combat driving training before they deploy .
 Combat driving training is always something that they do ,  McCuin said .
 Maybe not as much as we would like ... maybe not with the up - armored Humvee .
Major Tom Alexander , a public affairs officer for Third Army , said that while  the best opportunity to train is prior to deployment , soldiers conduct training even while they are deployed .
 They are getting some type of training in Kuwait ,  Alexander said .
 We dont send soldiers into harms way without training .
He added that while the Armys Kuwait base is technically within the Iraq War theater , it is a much more controlled environment .
Alexander said that to his knowledge , the combat driving simulators  which he says are part of a wider driver training program in the Army  have not yet been put to use in Kuwait .
When asked if the shortage of up - armored vehicles has affected the Armys ability to properly prepare troops behind the wheel before deployment , McCuin declined to respond , instead saying he would pass on the information to RAW STORY at a later time .
He did not .
The up - armored Humvee serves as an integral part of the Armys combat , convoy and reconnaissance missions in the Middle East .
In 2005 , the Pentagon ramped up production of the vehicle to help protect troops from insurgents increasing use of improvised explosive devices  or IEDs  along Iraqs roadsides .
Make - shift bombs are now the leading cause of death and injury of soldiers in Iraq .
McCuin told RAW STORY that some 14,000 of the vehicles currently are in use in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But while the up - armored vehicle does offer soldiers enhanced protection , the M - 1114 weighs some 2,000 pounds more than the standard Humvee , making it more difficult to maneuver in streets and in the sand .
It is also top heavy , which has led to numerous accidents and rollovers .
In a recent MPRI press release , Lt. Col .
Mark Meadows of the 10th Mountain Division said the Army has identified that driving has become a critical combat skill just like shooting , communications and medical skills . 
 As a former battalion commander in Baghdad , I have seen the importance of having confident , competent drivers in the combat zone ,  Meadows said in the release , adding that he is convinced  that the simulated combat driver training for the up - armored Humvee  will save lives . 
Spokespersons for Fort Drum did not respond to RAW STORY requests for comment .
MPRI s simulator , which cost about $ 100,000 apiece , trains soldiers on three virtual vehicles : a standard commercial vehicle , a standard Humvee and the M - 1114 .
According to a company press release , it allows the driver to experience how the vehicles handle differently .
 At a reduced cost to the government , simulators have a greater through - put than actually going through the process of assigning a driver , dispatching a vehicle and assigning an instructor to manually take notes as is currently being done during the [ military ] driver training and licensing process ,  Alexander said .
 Further , it gives soldiers the experience of driving  without the risk of accident or injury  much the same as flight simulators do for pilots . 
Gerding said most of the non-commissioned officers who participated in the programs run-through this spring at Fort Drum said they support the use of the simulator in pre-deployment training .
 They said to me ,  If only we had this two years ago ,  he said .
Gerding added that the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell in Kentucky and Fort Polk in Louisiana are also interested in using the simulator in their pre-deployment training programs .
Congressman wants to censure Bush over Libby commutation RAW STORY
Published : Thursday July 5 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Robert Wexler , D - Fla. , plans to introduce a resolution that would censure President Bush over his decision to commute the prison sentence faced by former vice presidential aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , the congressman said Thursday .
" This presidential intervention is an unconscionable abuse of authority by George W. Bush , and Congress must step forward and express the disgust that Americans rightfully feel toward this contemptible decision , " Wexler said in a statement released by his congressional office .
Wexler , who sits on the House Judiciary Committee , plans to introduce his resolution when Congress returns from its Independence Day recess next week .
The five - term congressman said Bush 's decision was " nothing short of [ a ] political quid pro quo , and Congress must go on record in strong opposition . "
The resolution is likely to be introduced first for consideration by the Judiciary Committee before it would be considered by the full House , a Palm Beach Post blog reported Thursday morning .
The non-binding resolution simply expresses the sense of the House that Bush acted improperly and does not carry any other penalty .
Libby was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice related to a criminal probe into the Bush administration 's leaking the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame , whose husband Joseph Wilson was critical of administration claims on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction capabilities .
" This deceitful chain of events began with the Administrations falsifying of intelligence on Iraqi nuclear capabilities , " Wexler said .
" It is clear that the perjury of Mr. Libby in this case effectively protected President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other Administration officials from further scrutiny regarding the clear political retaliation against former Ambassador Joseph Wilson and his wife , Valerie Plame Wilson , a covert CIA agent . "
The full text of the resolution is reprinted below : # Resolution relating to the censure of George W. Bush Whereas President George W. Bush has failed to comply with his obligations under Executive Order 12958 concerning the protection of classified national security information in that the covert identity of Valerie Plame Wilson as a Central Intelligence Agency operative was revealed to members of the media , and in June 2003 Bush Administration officials discussed with various reporters the identity of Ms. Wilson as a covert Central Intelligence Agency operative ; Whereas on July 14 , 2003 , the name of Ms. Wilson and her status as a CIA operative was revealed publicly in a newspaper column by Robert Novak , and on September 16 , 2003 the Central Intelligence Agency advised the Department of Justice that Ms. Wilsons status as a covert operative was classified information and requested a federal investigation ;
Whereas knowingly leaking the identity of a covert agent is a criminal violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act ( P.L. 97-200 ) ; Whereas Arthur Brown , former Asian Division chief of the CIA , stated that , cover and tradecraft are the only forms of protection one has and to have that stripped away because of political scheming is the moral equivalent to exposing forward deployed military units " ; Whereas Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , effectively stopped the investigation into this potentially grave national security crime by lying to FBI investigators , and Mr. Libby 's perjury shielded the Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush from further inquiry ; Whereas on March 6 , 2007 , in U.S. District Court a jury found Mr. Libby guilty on four counts of perjury , obstruction of justice and making false statements to FBI investigators regarding an investigation into the actions of the White House regarding leaking the identity of Ms. Wilson in retaliation for her husband 's contention that the Bush administration twisted intelligence facts to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq ; Whereas on June 5 , 2007 , Mr. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined $ 250,000 ; Whereas President George W. Bush had appointed both the Special Prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald , and the US District Court Judge , Reggie Walton , who were involved in the trial of Mr. Libby ; Whereas in February 2004 , President George W. Bush stated that if anyone in his Administration has violated [ the ] law , that person will be taken care of ;
Whereas on July 2 , 2007 , President Bush commuted the portion of Mr. Libbys sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison ;
Whereas in commuting Mr. Libbys sentence , President Bush has finally and unalterably breached any remaining shred of trust that he had left with the American people and rewarded political loyalty while flouting the rule of law : Now , therefore let be it -- Resolved ,
That the United States Congress does hereby censure George W. Bush , President of the United States , and does condemn his decision to commute the portion of Mr. Libbys sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison , his unconscionable abuse of his authority with regard to the deceitful chain of events concerning the falsifying intelligence on Iraqi nuclear capabilities and the exaggeration of the threat posed by Iraq , his involvement in the clear political retaliation against former Ambassador and Ms. Wilson , and his decision to reward the perjury of Mr. Libby , which effectively protected President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other Administration officials from further scrutiny . #
Gibson 's anti-Semitic remarks caused a media furore
The bill imposes criminal penalties if money is exchanged for information relating to police investigations .
The governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , will have the final say before the measure becomes law .
The legislation was prompted by leaked reports about Mel Gibson 's arrest last July on drink driving charges .
Within hours of the star being stopped , a celebrity website , TMZ.com , managed to get hold of a confidential police report about his arrest .
The document revealed the actor had made anti-Semitic remarks to the sheriff 's deputy who arrested him .
Rights violated
The revelations sparked global outrage and Mr Gibson later apologised for any offence he had caused .
The 51 - year - old was ordered to receive treatment in August after admitting to driving while drunk .
Although the website has said it did not pay for the information , politicians in California say the website 's actions violated Mr Gibson 's legal rights .
They are also concerned that competitive media organisations might be prepared to pay for information before it is released in the future .
" For the sake of a few dollars or to get someone their ' 15 minutes of fame , ' it 's not appropriate to sacrifice people 's rights , " assembly member Greg Aghazarian said .
In addition to imposing criminal penalties on any law enforcement officials who sell information about a case , those who pay for it could also be charged with a misdemeanour and be fined up to $ 1,000 .
Thanks principally to the War in Iraq , the U.S. military is woefully unprepared to respond to a serious military crisis elsewhere in the world :
Four years after the invasion of Iraq , the high and growing demand for U.S. troops there and in Afghanistan has left ground forces in the United States short of the training , personnel and equipment that would be vital to fight a major ground conflict elsewhere , senior U.S. military and government officials acknowledge .
More troubling , the officials say , is that it will take years for the Army and Marine Corps to recover from what some officials privately have called a “ death spiral , ” in which the ever more rapid pace of war - zone rotations has consumed 40 percent of their total gear , wearied troops and left no time to train to fight anything other than the insurgencies now at hand .
The risk to the nation is serious and deepening , senior officers warn , because the U.S. military now lacks a large strategic reserve of ground troops ready to respond quickly and decisively to potential foreign crises , whether the internal collapse of Pakistan , a conflict with Iran or an outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula .
Air and naval power can only go so far in compensating for infantry , artillery and other land forces , they said .
An immediate concern is that critical Army overseas equipment stocks for use in another conflict have been depleted by the recent troop increases in Iraq , they said .
“ We have a strategy right now that is outstripping the means to execute it , ” Gen . Peter J. Schoomaker , Army chief of staff , testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday .
This is , of course , entirely unsurprising .
We ’ve got more than 100,000 troops in Iraq , and thousands more in Afghanistan .
After four years of rotating deployments and a situation on the ground in Iraq especially that is active and threatening , troops and equipment are getting burned out .
What happens , then , if a crisis breaks out in Korea , or if China starts threatening Taiwain , or ( more likely than the other two ) the situation in Pakistan finally reaches a boiling point and we ’re faced with the possibility of radical Islamists with ties to al Qaeda acquiring a very significant stockpile of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them throughout the Middle East ?
Well , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has the answer :
Gen . Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was asked last month by a House panel whether he was comfortable with the preparedness of Army units in the United States .
He stated simply : “ No . . . I am not comfortable . ”
“ You take a lap around the globe — you could start any place : Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , Yemen , Somalia , Sudan , Venezuela , Colombia , Philippines , Malaysia , Indonesia , North Korea , back around to Pakistan , and I probably missed a few .
There ’s no dearth of challenges out there for our armed forces , ” Pace warned in his testimony .
He said the nation faces increased risk because of shortfalls in troops , equipment and training .
In earlier House testimony , Pace said the military , using the Navy , Air Force and reserves , could handle one of three major contingencies , involving North Korea or — although he did not name them — Iran or China .
But , he said , “ It will not be as precise as we would like , nor will it be on the timelines that we would prefer , because we would then , while engaged in one fight , have to reallocate resources and remobilize the Guard and reserves . ”
And it ’s not just the troops that are the problem :
The troop increase has also created an acute shortfall in the Army ’s equipment stored overseas — known as “ pre-positioned stock ” — which would be critical to outfit U.S. combat forces quickly should another conflict erupt , officials said .
The Army should have five full combat brigades ’ worth of such equipment : two stocks in Kuwait , one in South Korea , and two aboard ships in Guam and at the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean .
But the Army had to empty the afloat stocks to support the troop increase in Iraq , and the Kuwait stocks are being used as units to rotate in and out of the country .
Only the South Korea stock is close to complete , according to military and government officials .
“ Without the pre-positioned stocks , we would not have been able to meet the surge requirement , ” Schoomaker said .
“ It will take us two years to rebuild those stocks .
That ’s part of my concern about our strategic depth . ”
“ The status of our Army prepositioned stock . . . is bothersome , ” Cody said last week .
Some might say that we ’ve been lucky over the past four years that a major crisis has not flared up elsewhere in the world that would require us to make a choice that the military really should n’t need to make .
One wonders how long that luck will last .
Daily
Show explores mysteries of missing stuff in Iraq

Daily Show host Jon Stewart has a novel explanation for the fact that the military has lost nearly 200,000 firearms in Iraq .
The military says the misplacement of 190,000 AK - 47s and pistols was just a " clerical error . "
Stewart tries to clarify that explanation by displaying " Army Field Weaponry Procurement Form 1 - A - 3 , " which has two boxes ; check one for " lose these , " and another for " do n't lose these . "
Turns out the Army just checked the wrong box .
" This is not the first mysterious happening of our four - year venture in Iraq , " Stewart notes , citing previous disappearances of 380 tons of explosives , $ 12 billion in cash and 300,000 barrels of oil per day .
" How does this happen ? " he asks .
" Explosives , guns , oil , money .
These are n't things people would just take for no reason , and they they 've vanished without a trace in Iraq .
Coincidence ?
Or profound incompetence ?
" I say neither , " Stewart continues .
" As a geographical cartologist -- amature -- I believe the unique topographical features of Iraq form a natural -- but extremely powerful -- magicians hat . "
The satirical host says if we could just " reach our hands deep enough into the sands of the Euphrates , we would find the money , the weapons , the oil and -- let 's say -- 40 percentage points of President Bush 's approval rating . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 8 .
Palast published this on Griffin in March :
Timothy Griffin , Karl Rove ’s assistant , the President ’s pick as US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas .
Griffin , according to BBC Television , was the hidden hand behind a scheme to wipe out the voting rights of 70,000 citizens prior to the 2004 election .
Key voters on Griffin ’s hit list : Black soldiers and homeless men and women .
( snip )
Targeting voters where race is a factor is a felony crime under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
Recall that Palast , as a BBC reporter , was the ultimate recipient in 2004 of numerous emails that had been intended for ... @GeogeWBush.com , but were sent instead to ... @GeorgeWBush.org , a spoof site .
At that time Griffin was Research Director for the Republican National Committee .
Emails show that Kyle Sampson did n't want Bud Cummins , the US Attorney Griffin replaced , testifying to Congress because he worried that Cummins would testify that Griffin had been blabbing about a Patriot Act provision that said his appointment was possible without Congressional approval .
It appears the wagons circling the embattled administration must draw a little closer to protect such a close ally of Rove .
It started out innocently enough .
Concerned about global warming and her family 's energy consumption , Michelle Baker wanted to hang her wash outside .
She scoured stores for a clothesline durable enough to withstand Vermont winters and classy enough for her Waterbury backyard .
She came back empty - handed every time .
So Ms. Baker and her husband made their own : a few lines of pristine white rope hung between two Vermont cedar poles .
Soon , friends and neighbors were enviously asking where they got it .
Born of enterprise , enthusiasm , and wet shirts flapping in the breeze , the Vermont Clothesline Co. debuted in April .
And just in time , as a national clothesline – or " Right to Dry " – movement escalates .
In fact , Vermont is the latest state to introduce a bill that would override clothesline bans , which are often instituted by community associations loath to air laundry even when it 's clean .
Now , clothesline restrictions may be headed the way of bans on parking pickup trucks in front of homes , or growing grass too long – all vestiges of trim and tidy hopes that may not fit with the renewed emphasis on going green .
" This trend ... is about people making a little change to help the environment as opposed to something like solar panels which is much more of an investment , " Baker says .
Baker 's orders have steadily risen .
While most initial buyers were fellow Vermonters , the company now receives orders from across the United States , including such places as Tennessee , Texas , and Arkansas .
Over in New Hampshire , clothesline activists have asked for legislative advice from Project Laundry List – the first US clothesline activist group – according to the group 's founder , Alexander Lee .
And North Carolina recently passed a law invalidating city or county limitations on " energy devices based on the use of renewable resources . "
In addition , the clothesline movement there is hoping to find a " test case " to legally establish clothesline rights in North Carolina , Mr. Lee says .
" We get e-mails and calls every day from people wanting to know where they can get the materials to hang out their clothes or how to deal with homeowners ' association rules , " says Bryan Wentzell , the group 's chairman of the board .
" [ The Right to Dry movement ] could take off all across the country , " he says , noting that independent states like Vermont will be the first to jump on the bandwagon . "
Maybe .
In June , Vermont 's Gov. Jim Douglas ( R ) vetoed an energy bill with Right to Dry language – though not because of the clothesline clause , according to state Sen. Dick McCormack ( D ) . Proponents are now revising a bill to be introduced in January , one similar to legislation in Florida and Utah that prohibits " state or local laws or regulations or private contracts from limiting the ability of dwellers to erect and use clotheslines for the drying of clothes . "
Dryer data
At last count , in 2005 , there were 88 million dryers in the US , according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers .
Annually , these dryers consume 1,079 kilowatt hours of energy per household , creating 2,224 pounds of carbon - dioxide emissions .
Besides the global - warming and cost - saving aspects of clotheslines , proponents say hanging out clothes requires exercise and time outside – elements that are missing from many Americans ' lives .
" So much of our lives have become automated , " Mr. Wentzell says .
Plus , using a clothesline makes " your clothes last longer and smell better . "
Despite clotheslines ' purported benefits – and a scent that can rival dryer sheets ' " fresh rain " fragrance – " the overwhelming majority " of community associations regulate or ban them , says Frank Rathbun , vice president of communications for the Community Associations Institute in Virginia .
Sixty million Americans belong to one of 300,000 homeowners ' associations , according to the institute , a national organization of community association leaders and management firms .
The rules exist for aesthetics , residents ' expectations , and property values , Mr. Rathbun says : Environmental leanings have to be balanced against the desires of those who find their neighbors ' blue jeans , khakis , and the occasional flannel nightgown to be unseemly , unsightly , or both .
Senator McCormack dismisses such concerns .
Amid growing concern about global warming , he says , governments have a responsibility to protect people 's right to voluntarily conserve , if not actively support energy conservation .
Protesters and quilters
On Sept. 14 , Project Laundry
List will participate in an event at the energy company Hydro - Québec , protesting the diverting and damming of the Rupert River .
Such damming would not have to occur , Lee says , if people adopted energy - saving methods like clotheslines .
The group will display messages on T - shirts and sheets hung from – what else ?
– a 400 - foot clothesline .
The group is getting the word out through other art forms , too .
Several painters and quilters who specialize in depictions of clotheslines have donated work to Project Laundry List to be auctioned off , with proceeds going to the cause .
And , hoping for more , Wentzell is thinking outside the box and beyond the laundry room : " Hey , maybe we 'll get some celebrities taking up the cause by hanging out their laundry behind their mansions ! "
Earlier this year Google made a big splash when they added a video clip search to their battery of search tools , yet in all fairness , Yahoo did beat them to the punch .
Nevertheless , we began to ponder just what this service was really aiming for , and we even fantasized a bit about a searchable database of full TV shows that could possibly be streamed on demand .
Then , last week Google posted a job description that made it sound like they were heading slowly but surely into the TV realm .
The posting , which has now been removed , read ( in part ) :
You will identify key market trends that are shaping user behavior when watching Television .
These include but not limited to the intersection of Internet and Television technologies , Video - On - Demand , Personal Video Recorders and emergence of next generation set - top - boxes with IP connectivity .
You will then identify areas where use of Google 's search and advertising technology can enhance this user experience and define appropriate products to deliver these user benefits .
You will work with UI designers and software engineers to conceptualize and develop these features .
As part of this role , you may also be required to interact with strategic partners in the telecom and cable segments across the world .
As part of these interactions you will be required to present product and business strategy to senior executives at these companies and work with them to deploy these products in their network .
And this brings us to today 's announcement that Google and UPN would be providing exclusive online access to the series premiere of " Everybody Hates Chris . "
If you 're like us and still wondering why DirecTV does n't carry UPN , you 'll be able to watch the entire pilot via streaming video until this Thursday , September 29 .
Also in the announcement were additional enhancements to the Google Video service , including support for Macintosh and Linux users , in - browser video controls , and search results displayed as playable video thumbnails .
It also looks like Google is using Flash to deliver content , which allows users to view high - quality video without needing to download a separate media player .
A VLC - derived browser plugin was used during the Google Video debut , but switching to Flash means being able to tap into its near - 100 percent installed base .
With Flash 8 's video capabilities , Google 's adoption of the format might help make it the method of choice for video on the Web .
The ease and popularity of podcasts , blogs , and other Web - accessible media has lowered the barriers to entry to becoming an independent news or entertainment source , but video has yet to take off ; the main difficulty being the the immense amounts of bandwith and storage space needed .
It 's been an obstacle that media corporations with deep pockets have been able to overcome , but now that Google 's in the mix , that video of your first piano recital might be rubbing shoulders with mainstream network shows .
With video on demand services , P2P applications such as BitTorrent , and now Google , is the television industry looking like a less important node of content distribution ?
Tom DeLay tells College Republicans that abortion , illegal immigration are linked

Former Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay told a gathering of College Republicans that a link exists between legal abortion and illegal immigration in America .
The remarks were included in a video produced by writer Max Blumenthal and posted at The Huffington Post .
" I contend [ abortion ] affects you in immigration , " DeLay told the Washington - area gathering .
" If we had those 40 million children that were killed over the last 30 years , we would n't need the illegal immigrants to fill the jobs that they are doing today .
Think about it . "
Blumenthal was later apparently forcibly escorted out of the conference by College Republican staff .
DeLay is currently under indictment for money laundering and conspiracy charges in Texas .
The former number two Republican in the House of Representatives , who resigned his post in 2006 , is not the only prominent former Member of Congress to link abortion with immigration .
Former Georgia Democratic Senator Zell Miller gave a speech to an anti-abortion conference earlier in the year that linked abortion to illegal immigration .
Miller also blamed abortion for other societal ills , such as the state of America 's Social Security system and difficulty in recruiting soldiers for the Armed Forces .
Blumenthal 's full video , in which he engages College Republicans in a variety of conversations on political issues , can be viewed in full at this link .
So now we know .
Springfield , Vermont , has been named official home of The Simpsons .
For this month , that is .
The Simpsons Movie , it has just been announced , will get its world premiere there on July 21 .
The Vermont venue beat 13 other identically named US towns in the competition to host the event , having had to prove how similar they were to the fictional Springfield inhabited by America 's number one animated family .
Vermont citizens clinched the prize with their own video , in which a Homer lookalike gets pursued through the streets by a giant runaway pink doughnut .
Having a nuclear plant nearby no doubt helped the town 's bid .
It 's the kind of stunt that would fit perfectly into the show .
Which is precisely the problem .
The Simpsons of today revels in big , stupid antics , one - note gags and obvious plot twists .
The Simpsons of yesteryear , however , was a different beast , one that would have found no room for over - sized pastries pursuing characters along sidewalks .
That 's why it's hard to greet the arrival of the movie with whoops of excitement .
If it 's anything like the current TV show , this will be one of the greatest misfires in spin - off history .
You can almost hear the panic in the voice of The Simpsons ' creator Matt Groening .
The film will be " deliberately imperfect " .
It contains " everything we could n't show on television " .
His co-producer Al Jean has even boasted that " if you 've never heard of The Simpsons , you can enjoy the film " .
They know expectation is sky - high , even for something that 's been 15 years ( yes , 15 ! ) in the pipeline .
So why the need to qualify the film with so many caveats and premature apologies ?
Could it be that they know , deep down , The Simpsons is but a shade of what it used to be ?
Once , it was the greatest show on TV .
Every episode was brimming with imagination , excitement and some of the sharpest one - liners to come out of America for decades .
But above all it was smart :
The Simpsons knew how to parry crudity with intelligence blow for blow .
Bart 's big - haired nemesis Sideshow Bob stepping on a rake nine times would be followed up with a surreal two - minute performance of HMS Pinafore .
Homer lobbing a lookalike of himself over a waterfall would be followed by a reference to Walt Whitman 's collection of poems , Leaves of Grass .
This was dizzyingly intelligent , daring , exhilarating stuff .
For every burp gag came an arch pop-culture reference .
For every time Homer fell down the stairs or Bart got strangled , we had a nifty TV parody or sly political dig .
And it kept on coming , week after week .
An entire generation did n't understand it .
George Bush senior , then US president , even wished aloud that American families could be more like the Waltons than the Simpsons .
A massive rift opened up between those who " got " The Simpsons and those who hated it .
You chose your side carefully .
To be a Simpsons fan was truly one of the most privileged things in the world .
Then it all changed .
A new guard took over and ripped up the rules .
Veterans of the show with pedigrees on venerated US comedy institutions like Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show - Jon Vitti , George Meyer , John Schwartzwelder - either departed or went part - time .
In came writers who had cut their teeth on sappy teen comedies like Blossom and unsophisticated knockabouts like Beavis and Butt - Head .
A looser , lazier sensibility took hold , given free rein by new executive producer Mike Scully .
And the show became stupid .
You can even put a date on it : 1997 , in the early episodes of the ninth series , where the head of Bart 's school , Principal Skinner , was suddenly , arbitrarily revealed to be an impostor , and his entire life to date had been a lie .
Come again ?
A major character in a long - running series gets unmasked as a fraud ?
It was cheap , idle storytelling .
This was just the start .
The show went on to jettison all interest in pretending to have earthy , avuncular roots : the warm , good - natured centre that , when you scraped away the multi- layered jokes and cerebral grandstanding , had been there from day one was obliterated .
No longer did we see the family bonding , caring for each other , showing emotion .
Instead , it was anything goes .
Plots swung sickeningly from one cliche to another .
Jokes arrived out of the blue for no reason .
No attempt was made to cling to reality .
Now Homer would end up in new employment six or seven times a series .
To date , he 's held 118 ( and counting ) jobs , from missionary to garbage commissioner to grease salesman to fortune cookie writer , which would n't be such a damning statistic had almost none of them been particularly funny .
True , a long - running series has to evolve .
Nobody would expect Simpsons episodes to still be solely about Lisa getting a pony or Bart failing a school exam .
But , in the second decade of its life , The Simpsons evolved into a dreadfully predictable monster .
With each new series came the same questions .
Which foreign country will the family just happen to end up visiting this time ?
Which pop star will the family just happen to encounter while there ?
And what unsubtle bit of physical violence will Homer be subjected to en route ?
Contract leprosy , perhaps ; get raped by a panda ; or maybe get his head trapped between two halves of a lowering drawbridge ?
This was change all right , but change as an excuse for idiocy .
It was desperately disheartening for those who cherished and loved the show 's early years .
Watching Homer hold forth on the topless women he 'd seen on holiday in Florida , or Marge accidentally getting breast implants , you wanted everything to be revealed as a huge wind - up , or a cunning satire on trashy TV .
But there was no hidden agenda .
What you saw was what you got : a base , repetitive , unfunny cartoon .
And now , off the back of such a catastrophic decline , the movie has arrived .
Is it too much to hope that it will , despite everything , turn out to be confoundingly brilliant ?
The omens do n't look good .
The trailers have majored in physical violence , including Homer getting repeatedly battered by a wrecking ball .
And the publicity machine has been grinding away , humiliating into submission anyone who dares doubt the staying power of a show that 's clocked up 400 episodes .
One thing 's for sure .
It 's not the momentous occasion it would have been had the film come out when first planned .
It 's too late for that now .
Indeed , with Channel 4 burying new episodes of The Simpsons on Sunday afternoons , rather than showing them at peak - time on Friday nights as originally promised , it might be too late for the TV show as well .
The residents of Springfield , Vermont , may soon be ruing that giant pink doughnut .
The Simpsons Movie is out on July 27 .
Ian Jones writes for tv.cream.org and offthetelly.co.uk
· This article was amended on Monday July 16 2007 .
The article above mentioned Walt Whitman 's collection of poems , Leaves of Grass , as Leaves and Grass .
This has been corrected .
Medical experiments could be carried out in the United States on uninformed patients under a rule change proposed by the Food & Drug Administration , and a California pro-family group is raising the red flag .
" Informed consent is a touchstone in regards to human freedom in medical issues , " Richard D. Ackerman , of the Pro-Family Law Center , told WorldNetDaily yesterday .
" It 's been held in common law for hundreds of years .
" The minute you allow a doctor to cross that line , between the patient or patient 's representive being in the know , you 've given over complete control to the doctor , " he said .
He described the experiments as being " Nazi - like " and said he used that term intentionally .
" This is reminiscent of the days of Hitler and Dr. Mengele .
The idea that research can be performed on a human being without informed consent is antithetical to the very meaning of human self - determination and dignity , " he said .
Josef Mengele was the Nazi leader who performed a wide range of scientifically - useless and mostly - fatal experiments on humans during Hitler 's era .
The Nazis , led by Mengele 's experimentation desires , " conducted dangerous medical experiments on innocent people without consent .
Many people died as a result of the Nazis ' human experiments and many others suffered a lifetime of post - experimental trauma and injury , " the center said .
One of Mengele 's experiments , for example , reportedly tried to create conjoined people by sewing children together .
The plan is in a rule proposed by the FDA regarding " emergency research " that scientists and doctors could conduct on unconscious or otherwise incapacitated patients , Ackerman said .
The proposed rules , known as " Guidance for Institutional Review Boards , Clinical Investigators , and Sponsors : Exception from Informed Consent for Emergency Research , " are scheduled for a public hearing next month .
The proposal would allow the use of any " investigational new drug application " or " investigational device " on people who have a life - threatening medical condition for which other treatments are unsatisfactory .
It applies in situations where the patients are unconscious and cannot give consent and none of their representatives is available .
" Such ' emergency research ' could be conducted without any informed consent from the patient or their designated representative , " Ackerman noted .
" PFLC does not accept the idea that the U.S. government can order any human experimentation without valid informed consent , " Ackerman said in a statement .
" PFLC is urging all Christians , Jews , and patients ' rights advocates to challenge these proposed regulations . "
This new battle over the value of life is very important , Ackerman said .
" If a human being can be experimented on with absolutely no consent , we have lost all sense of human dignity .
While our nation long ago lost much of its respect for preborn children , we attempted to hold on to the principles of informed consent and human dignity for adults .
These new regulations would chip away at the little remaining respect that our nation has for human life . "
The Pro-Family Law Center is planning an opinion letter to be sent to the president and the FDA , and will be working on a petition drive as well , officials said .
Ackerman said the biggest danger rests for the homeless , or other citizens in marginalized groups , because they often do n't have anyone to act as a representative if they are involved in an accident or become ill .
" There will be a subclass of patients who can't give consent themselves , or do n't have a representative , " he said .
That concept was the same used by the Nazis , who considered some groups of people less than human .
Ackerman , besides leading the Pro-Family Law Center , is a published author and contributing writer to Whistleblower Magazine and WorldNetDaily .
He 's defended the Pledge of Allegiance before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. Supreme Court and battled for religious liberty and to defeat same - sex marriage .
The short , troubled life of a drug - dealing Harlem midget came to a violent end yesterday when he was gunned down while guzzling beer and shooting dice outside a housing project .
Cops found a huge .380 - caliber pistol in the waistband of little person Joshua Agard , 18 , along with 15 vials of crack that he was peddling while hanging out in a courtyard with pal Manuel Zabater , who was also killed in the attack .
“ He was just so big .
So [ I thought ] , how much could he get into ? ” said distraught neighbor Debra Daniels , 61 .
“ He was a good person .
I loved him . ”
Though Agard was just 3 feet tall , he had a police record a mile long .
So far this year , he had been busted twice , once on assault charges for throwing a bottle at a man ’s head and once for trespassing when he was caught inside 425 E. 105th St .
He also had two other arrests , cops said .
The final , fatal trouble for Agard came at about 4:30 a.m. yesterday while he and Zabater , beers in hand , were in the courtyard of the East River Houses project on East 105th Street .
According to cops , three or four black males approached and , without saying a word , blasted Agard several times .
Witnesses told The Post that the project grounds were clear of the usual cast of thugs at the time of the shooting , indicating that many knew the hit would be going down .
As rounds tore through the tiny target ’s head and torso , Zabater committed an act of bravery when he rushed to his friend ’s side and tried to pull him to cover , witnesses said .
That ’s when Zabater – who was on parole for drugs – was hit twice in the torso .
The gunmen fled and were still at large yesterday .
Both victims were taken to local hospitals , where they died .
The bloody end for Agard came after a life in which he struggled to overcome the deaths of his parents , and his size , which sometimes made him the object of mockery .
“ When people would taunt him , he would say , ‘ I ’m a midget , I do n’t want to be called a dwarf , ’ ” said one pal .
“ He did everything normal .
He played ball , everything .
Everybody knew him .
He ’s a loving person . ”
Things were n’t always so bad for Agard .
When he was 9 years old he appeared in a performance of “ A Christmas Carol ” put on by Harlem ’s The Play ’s The Thing Theatre Company .
Fittingly , he played Tiny Tim .

For four months this year , while Congress was overhauling student loan laws , I traveled the country in a beat - up RV meeting with citizens and legislators .
My mission was simple : Persuade Congress to restore consumer protections to student loan borrowers .
After 22,000 miles , 42 states and five flat tires , I ca n’t help but feel that my efforts were a waste of time .
And gas .
Sure , the House and Senate passed HR 2669 , the College Cost Reduction Act .
After reconciliation , it will soon be on its way to the president ’s desk .
The bill includes some attractive provisions for those headed back to campus this fall , including interest rate reductions , loan forgiveness for public service , Pell grant increases and income - contingent repayment plans for future graduates .
But it does n’t fix a fundamental problem : Basic consumer protections were stripped from student loans in the mid-1990s .
This act does nothing to bring them back .
Reacting to much - publicized stories of student - borrower bankruptcies and a default rate of 22 % in the late 1970s , Congress mandated seven years of repayment before borrowers could declare bankruptcy on federal student loans .
In 1998 -- under an extremely business - friendly Congress -- this qualifier was done away with , rendering all federal student loans non-dischargeable except in the most dire circumstances , such as total and permanent disability .
Big lenders , such as Sallie Mae , even persuaded Congress to remove bankruptcy protections for private loans in 2005 -- these are the nongovernmental loans we ’ve been hearing about lately , whose interest rates can exceed 18 % .
Credit card companies and payday lenders could only dream of this kind of congressional giveaway .
Congress also took away the freedom of borrowers to shop their student loans around in a competitive marketplace .
Many college students graduate with two or three types of student loans and choose to consolidate them either to simplify repayment or to pay them back over more time .
But once they ’ve consolidated , borrowers become captive to that one loan company .
They can never refinance again , no matter how interest rates fluctuate or how badly their lenders treat them .
But this is only the tip of the iceberg : Sallie Mae and other student loan interests also had lobbied heavily for legislation that took away other standard consumer protections , including adherence to the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act ( student loan companies were specifically exempted in 1996 ) , and statutes of limitations ( removed for student loans in 1999 ) .
Student loans were also exempted from “ truth in lending ” regulations , the rules that require lenders to point out key information -- annual percentage rate and fees -- to borrowers on all loan documents .
Congress also let lenders levy massive fees -- often as high as 25 % of the balance of the loan -- on those having trouble making payments .
Student loan companies got draconian collection powers , including the right to garnish a borrower ’s wages , tax refunds and Social Security or disability payments .
Some states even got into the act , suspending professional licenses of student borrowers in default .
No other lender has these kind of powers -- not credit card companies , not payday lenders .
This has led to serious abuse .
Between 2001 and 2005 , Sallie Mae ’s fee income ( penalties and fees collected on delinquent debt ) increased by a whopping 107 % .
In 2003 , Albert Lord ( then Sallie Mae ’s chief executive ) actually bragged to shareholders that the company ’s record profits were attributable to this increase .
Financial statements of other lenders show the same trend .
This is no small problem .
Between 3 million and 5 million Americans -- nearly 15 % of all borrowers -- end up in default on their student loans .
And some have taken desperate measures to escape their ballooning debt .
During my road trip , I heard from many of them .
For instance , David , a chiropractor in Texas , could n’t renew his license after he defaulted on his loans , so he now drives a truck in Amarillo for a living .
He says his debt has more than quintupled .
Or Jason , an attorney who -- drowning in fees and penalties -- emigrated to start a new life in Asia .
Finally , I heard from a mother in Oregon whose son , Michele Lorenzo Guidoni , got locked into high 1980s interest rates .
By the time he was approaching his doctorate degree , he owed more than $ 200,000 .
His mother says he saw no end to the compounding debt and took his own life in 2005 .
This cannot be what Congress intended in 1965 when it created the grants and loans programs of the Higher Education Act .
Then , Congress was trying to help Americans achieve the dream of higher education .
Now , it is time to help those whose lives have been turned into nightmares by the student loan industry .
Perhaps when Congress returns in September , I ’ll gas up the old RV and hit the road again .
It ’s obvious that Congress was n’t listening the first time .

One common misconception about GMOs is that their impact on human health is not considered .
20 GMO crops do n’t damage the environment .
Golden Rice is a GMO .
The name comes from the rice ’s golden color , a side - effect of the genetic engineering done on the crop .
Golden rice has modifications to produce beta - carotene during growth , which turns into Vitamin A once digested and metabolized .
Research and development of Golden Rice aimed to solve Vitamin A Deficiency ( VAD ) , a disease that kills over 600,000 children worldwide every year .
Another 500,000 children also go blind from the disease every year .
With rice a staple for between 30 to 70 % of people in Asia alone , scientists hoped to increase Vitamin A in people ’s nutrition through an easy and effective manner with Golden Rice .
What a resourceful example of GMO facts .
The first GMO food to reach the market was a tomato .
Called Flavr Savr , Calgene developed and sent the tomatoes to the FDA for approval in 1992 .
The FDA granted approval in 1994 , and Flavr Savr appeared on the market until 1997 when Calgene stopped producing the tomato .
Flavr Savr ’s modifications gave it longer shelf life , meaning it lasted longer after getting harvested .
According to the FDA , Flavr Savr had no difference in nutrition and posed no health risks compared to non-GMO tomatoes .
Genentech used GMO bacteria to produce insulin for use by diabetes patients .
Diabetes is a disease of the pancreas that makes it unable to produce the hormone insulin .
This causes sugar to build up in the body , causing a series of complications that can lead to death .
Doctors give insulin injections to manage the disease , with the hormone previously - taken from human donors .
But in 1978 Genentech developed GMO bacteria with human genes to produce insulin with .
The FDA approved GMO bacteria - produced insulin , called humulin , to enter the market .
This made it cheaper and more available to diabetes patients .
A milestone of achievement , no matter how we look at it , here at GMO facts .

The first GMO animal approved as food did so in 2015 .
Called AquAdvantage salmon , AquaBounty Technologies began development as far back as 1989 .
Scientists mixed genes between Atlantic salmon and Pacific Chinook salmon to produce the GMO .
Their goal was a fish breed that bred and grew faster than other breeds .
To keep AquAdvantage salmon from damaging the environment , all examples of the breed are born female and sterile .
This is because if they escape into the wild , they ’ll outbreed other salmon breeds .
AquAdvantage salmon received FDA approval in 2015 , the first time a GM animal received approval as a food source .
Gene guns were the first tool to carry out genetic modifications .
These tools fired microscopic bullets of either gold or tungsten .
Scientists attached DNA fragments to the bullets and then fired them at a target cell sample .
The bullets passed through the cells , leaving their DNA fragments behind them in the cells .
Once inside , the cells incorporated the fragments into their DNA .
Scientists developed many GMOs such as those for wheat using this method .
The main disadvantage of this method is that it damages cells in the process .
The method is also inaccurate , as scientists have only limited control over the genes getting combined .
Bacteria are also used to perform genetic modifications .
This one surprised us here at GMO facts .
These bacteria are agrobacterium .
It ’s a special kind of bacteria , as they modify their target ’s genes to make it more suitable for them .
Scientists used specially - bred agrobacterium to insert desired genes into their specimens .
This method has mixed success , though .
While successful with crops like tomatoes and potatoes , this method is unsuccessful when it came to modifying other crops like wheat .
Other methods for genetic modification include electroporation and microinjection .
Scientists discovered that electrical pulses cause cells to open pores in their membranes .
They then use those pores to introduce new genes into the target cells .
Microinjection is the simplest method of genetic engineering , by injecting new genes directly inside a target cell .
One of the most advanced methods of genetic engineering is CRISPR gene editing .
CRISPR is actually a means with which certain bacteria protect themselves from viral infections .
It works by producing certain biochemicals that cut the bacteria ’s own DNA .
In this way , they remove those parts of their DNA compromised by a virus .
Scientists studied this process , and in 2000 , used it to perform genetic engineering .
Dubbed in science as CRISPR gene editing , scientists used similar biochemicals to cut out unwanted sections from target DNA .
These sections could be the ones causing a disease or make a subject vulnerable to certain infections .
Scientists can also replace removed sections of DNA with news ones to give desirable traits and characteristics .
GMOs are n’t limited to food .
GMOs are also made for purely - physical appeal .
Flowers with colors that do n’t appear in nature were even among the first GMOs ever made .
GMO roses with lavender or mauve petals are popular in countries such as Japan , the USA , and Canada among others .
Other examples of flowers modified to answer demand include chrysanthemums and primroses .
Now that was a surprisingly - colorful example of GMO facts .

GMO animals are also used for research .
GMO mice are the most common of them all , their genes modified to study the effects as part of research into various subjects .
These include the causes of diseases like cancer , as well as possible cures .
Other animals include pigs due to their larger size and closer relationship with humans , and non-human primates .
It was only in 2009 that a marmoset became a test subject for studies on Parkinson ’s Disease .
A goat began producing a drug for use by humans in 2009 .
We ’ve mentioned before how GMO bacteria produce insulin for use by humans .
This time it ’s different .
Insulin is still a natural substance , produced in this case by GMOs as a supplement for people whose bodies ca n’t make enough insulin on their own .
In contrast , ATryn is n’t a natural substance , but a drug used to prevent unwanted clots during operations like surgery or childbirth .
And in 2009 , the FDA approved the use of GMO goats which produced the drug in their milk .
GMO livestock are under study to provide food in more ways than one .
That is , these breeds of animals are n’t meant for eating .
One example is a breed of cow under study to produce milk identical to human breast milk .
Scientists expect this to benefit mothers who are unable to produce breast milk on their own .
Another example is a cow that produces hypoallergenic milk , something they are n’t normally able to produce .
GMOs are a possible means to bring back extinct species .
The current idea is to change the DNA of an existing cousin of the extinct species so that it resembles the latter .
Scientists are also studying the possibility of adding the genes of extinct animals taken from existing samples to the DNA of existing animals .
For example , adding genes from the extinct mammoth to those of African Elephants .
Scientists say though that replacing the whole DNA and even reversing evolution is still a very long - distance goal .
So no matter how much we here at GMO facts wish it were so , a real - life Jurassic Park is n’t likely to happen soon .
Humans as GMOs is a very controversial concept .
Although gene therapy is already used to treat diseases like cystic fibrosis , sickle cell anemia , and heart disease , scientists are skeptic of modifying traits that can be passed down to a person ’s children .
Ethical concerns and incomplete understanding of human DNA as a whole make the idea of GMO humans a premature one at this time .
GMO insects are under study .
A common trait among GMO crops is their ability to resist insects and parasites .
But scientists are also studying if they can solve the problem directly .
Instead of making crops resistant to diseases , or making more and better drugs against diseases carried by insects , why not remove the insects in the first place ?
One species under study is the Aedes aegypti mosquito , infamous for carrying germs that cause dengue and malaria among other diseases .
Scientists produced a male breed of the mosquito carrying a gene that causes death at a certain point .
While not yet available to widespread use , use against test populations saw 80 to 90 % of the mosquitoes wiped out .
Scientists believe this method is usable against other pests like moths .

Whether GMO foods get labeled as such depends on the country .
For example , the European Union requires all GMO foods to have a label informing consumers that they are .
Processed food or drink which has more than 0.9 % of its ingredients as GMOs must also have a label .
In Canada and the USA , producers are not required at the federal level to label their goods as GMO or not .
There ’s no such thing as non-GMO Water or non-GMO Salt .
Some water or salt brands label themselves as non-GMO .
This is meaningless advertising , as neither water nor salt are alive in the first place .
They have no DNA to modify , so they cannot be GMOs .
Talk about strange examples of GMO facts .
GMO crops actually reduce the price of food .
This is because GMO crops have higher yields compared to non-GMO crops .
This allows supply to more easily keep up with demand , dropping prices as a result .
Studies actually show that without GMO crops , food prices would be 5 to 10 % higher than they are today .
One common misconception about GMOs is that their impact on human health is not considered .
This is actually one of the biggest misconceptions about GMOs .
All GMOs undergo case by case testing and certification before getting placed on the market .
In the USA alone , FDA approval for GMO crops and medicines takes years or even decades of study to get .
Even then , they ’re still subject to review and appeal afterward .
Scientists are even frustrated at delays caused by continued testing on the distribution of Golden Rice in places like the Philippines .
