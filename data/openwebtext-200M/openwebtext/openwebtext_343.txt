Even though Paramount has taken longer to announce their Blu-ray slate than the other former HD DVD lackey , they 're getting 'em out the door quicker , surprisingly .
The first three BDs ( I hate the acronym , but let 's go ahead and digest it ) from Paramount arrive May 20 : Face / Off ( yes ! ) , Bee Movie and Next .
Then it gets kinda sparse , with intermittent releases through the rest of the summer , though its first simultaneous new release w/ DVD will be The Spiderwick Chronicles on June 24 .
Not the hot roster I was looking for ( Woo 's opus excepted ) , but at least the Blu ball for every major studio is finally rolling .
Update :
We just did one better and got Paramount 's press release with the full list ( which confirms HR 's report ) , check it out below .

Henry Paulson wants the financial system to be more competitive
Treasury secretary
The US Treasury has revealed its blueprint for the biggest overhaul of regulation of the financial sector since the 1930s .
Critics have said that the credit crunch and resultant market turmoil made a strong case for change .
But Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson rejected claims that existing regulations have led to the turmoil .
And he said the plan should not be implemented until current difficulties roiling financial markets are resolved .
New powers
The plan would beef up the powers of the Federal Reserve , which earlier this month engineered the purchase of troubled investment bank Bear Stearns by JP Morgan .
It would give it greater oversight of all kinds of financial institutions from hedge funds to insurance companies .
Our current regulatory structure was not built to address the modern financial system
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson " Government has a responsibility to make sure our financial system is regulated effectively .
And in this area , we can do a better job , " Mr Paulson said .
The government says the proposals are an effort help US firms become more competitive in the global economy .
The 218 - page report was commissioned before credit markets began to seize up in August last year .
Fears of exposure to high - risk assets have made banks and financial institutions increasingly reluctant to lend to each other .
Bear Stearns got into trouble when other banks refused to lend it money over fears that it had too many bad debts due to the sub - prime mortgage crisis .
Market stability
The proposals give sweeping powers to the Federal Reserve - enabling it to tackle the kind of turmoil that is currently hitting financial markets .
KEY MEASURES
Fed becomes market stability regulator Second regulator to oversee banks Business conduct regulator to protect consumers Mortgage market to come under greater scrutiny The Fed would become " market stability regulator " - allowing it to examine the books of any financial institution deemed to potentially threaten the stability of the financial system .
The overhaul will see a new organisation set up to take over the role of the five separate banking regulators .
A body to regulate business conduct and consumer protection is also likely to be proposed .
" Our current regulatory structure was not built to address the modern financial system , " Mr Paulson said .
" We should and can have a structure that is designed for the world we live in . "
" One that is more flexible , one that can better adapt to change , one that will allow us to more effectively deal with inevitable market disruptions and one that will better protect investors and consumers . "
Mortgage scrutiny Among other measures proposed is the creation of a commission to establish stricter criteria for firms involved in the mortgage market .
Mortgages for sub - prime borrowers , those with poor or patchy credit histories , have been at the heart of the recent market turmoil that has resulted in billions of losses for big banks .
A merger of the Securities and Exchange Commission , which regulates companies with publicly traded shares , with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission , which oversees commodities trading is also part of the proposals .
The review into the sector began early in 2007 after the financial services industry complained that over - regulation from Washington meant US firms were not as globally competitive as they could be .
Before travelling to Europe , President George W Bush said that he wanted congress to pass several pieces of legislation which he saw as " vital priorities " .
These include a housing law which would enable more homeowners who were battling to meet mortgage payments to refinance their loans .

Iceberg debris after the collapse of Larsen B in 2002
The 656ft ( 200 m ) thick , 1,255 sq mile ( 3,250 sq km ) Larsen B shelf broke apart in March 2002 .
But Neil Glasser of Aberystwyth University and Ted Scambos of Colorado University claim in a new study that it had been on the brink for decades .
They argue that glaciological and atmospheric factors were also invoved .
In a paper published in the Journal of Glaciology , the pair say that when Larsen B collapsed it appeared to be the latest in a long line of victims of Antarctic summer heatwaves linked to global warming .
Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey predicted in 1998 that several ice shelves around the peninsula were doomed because of rising temperatures in the region , but the speed with which Larsen B went shocked them in 2002 .
A number of other atmospheric , oceanic and glaciological factors are involved
Professor Neil Glasser , Aberystwyth University
But Prof Glasser said the dramatic event was " not as simple as we first thought " .
He acknowledged that global warming had a major part to play in the collapse , but emphasised that it was only one of a number of contributory factors .
" Because large amounts of meltwater appeared on the ice shelf just before it collapsed , we had always assumed that air temperature increases were to blame , " he added .
" But our new study shows that ice - shelf break up is not controlled simply by climate .
" A number of other atmospheric , oceanic and glaciological factors are involved .
" For example , the location and spacing of fractures on the ice shelf such as crevasses and rifts are very important too because they determine how strong or weak the ice shelf is . "
Dr Scambos , of the University of Colorado 's national snow and ice data centre , said the ice shelf had probably been in distress for decades before its demise .
" It 's likely that melting from higher ocean temperatures , or even a gradual decline in the ice mass of the peninsula over the centuries , was pushing the Larsen to the brink , " he added .

Raw video , April 09/08 , San Francisco ... this is a media reply to a video i posted earlier .... turns out the bus may have been empty .... a police officer tells the crowd " THERE IS NOBODY ON THE BUS "
Sifting through hundreds of pages of my Psychology textbook while studying for my final was n't a complete waste of time .
I collected the most interesting experiments and examples I came across and have described a few of them here .
Conforming to an Obviously Wrong Majority : Psychologist Solomon
Asch conducted a famous set of experiments involving a seemingly simple question asked to a group of participants .
However , there was only a single actual test subject with the remainder of the group consisting of “ confederates ” who were instructed to give the wrong answer .
The group was arranged so that the subject gave their answer next - to - last so that they could hear the confederates ’ incorrect answers first .
The majority of subjects ( 37 out of 50 ) conformed to the incorrect majority at least once .
Asch later said this about the results : “ That we have found the tendency to conformity in our society so strong …is a matter of concern .
It raises questions about … the values that guide our conduct . ” ( Asch 1955 )
Escalation of Conflict : Less of a psychology example and more of a handy way to make some money is the “ Dollar Auction ” .
In this example , someone auctions off a dollar with no starting minimum bid .
The only problem is that both the winning bidder and second highest bidder must pay their bid .
The initial bids quickly escalate into the 80 and 90 cent range as one would still make a profit .
However , once the dollar barrier has been reached and exceeded , the bidding continues because if a person wins the auction for $ 1.15 , they sustain a loss of only 15 cents whereas the second highest bidder would lose their entire bid .
Most auctions end up in the $ 3 to $ 5 range , and bidders become very distressed once the $ 1 barrier is passed , sometimes even crying ( Brockner & Rubin , 1985 ) .
Bystander Apathy :
In 1964 , a young woman , Kitty Genovese , was stabbed to death near her apartment .
While not an uncommon event in Queens , New York , what was different was that for 30 minutes , at least 38 of her neighbors heard her screams without calling the police or helping .
After one resident shouted for the attacker to “ let that girl alone ” , he did but returned minutes later to continue his attack .
Another witness finally called the police , but only after he had first called a friend to decide whether he should .
This is an example of “ diffusion of responsibility ” , where we are less likely to act in the presence of others who could do the same .
Obedience to Authority : Another disturbing experiment concerning our actions and independence was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1974 ( prior to more stringent research regulations ) .
The experiment tested the idea that people would perform an action that could harm someone if they were told to do so by an authority figure .
The experiment involved a “ teacher ” and a “ learner ” .
The teacher was instructed to deliver an increasingly powerful shock to the learner ( a confederate ) for each error the learner made while answering the test subject ’s ( teacher ) questions .
The results showed that the majority of participants would continue to deliver shocks up to the maximum amount despite hearing the learner ’s screams of agony and even not hearing any sounds at all once a certain voltage was reached .
Strategies of Persuasion : Foot - in - the - door technique - Start with a modest request and follow it with a larger one later .
A much higher percentage of people will agree to perform a relatively large task if they have done a smaller task for the same group before ( Schwarzwarld et al. , 1983 ) .
Door - in - the - face technique - Following an outrageous request with a more reasonable one .
For example , if someone calls and asks for a $ 10,000 donation , you will be more likely to comply if the lower their request to $ 5 than if they had asked for that amount from the beginning .
bait - and - switch technique - Getting the subject to commit to a good deal before making additional demands .
For example , a car salesman could entice you with a new car for $ 3,000 but might bump up the price if you want it to include wheels and an engine .

Kumar Does n't Actually Smoke Pot Or Eat Meat .
Sorry White Castle .

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
With the sequel to the hilarious 2004 film Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle about to hit theaters , the two main actors are hitting the media junkets and chatting up marijuana , Neil Patrick Harris , and the vegetarian lifestyle .
That ’s right — Kal Penn , who plays Kumar in the films , is a die - hard vegetarian that ca n’t stand fast food and never smokes weed .
“ I think fast food is disgusting , ” Penn said in a recent interview with the Spartan Daily .
“ I was a vegetarian when we shot the first film , and I generally eat organic as much as possible .
I know this is so disappointing to the audience , which is why I do n’t talk about it a lot , but I do n’t smoke weed , I do n’t eat fast food . ”
In fact , those White Castle burgers you see Kumar and Harold scarfing down in the first film ?
For Penn , they were all veggie burgers .
“ The producers and the studio went way out of their way to make sure they brought in veggie patties and had them cut up , and they were very delicious , so props to them for that , ” he said .
“ It was n’t really an acting challenge , when I remember eating burgers , they were definitely delicious . ”
Penn is also a huge Obama supporter — even going out of his way to stump for the presidential candidate at Illinois University in March .
Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay opens April 25th .
These brain scans and graph show that response to a threat was greatly reduced when study volunteers received THC , compared with placebo .
This indicates that the brain 's cannabinoid system may be a good target for anxiety disorder treatments .
Credit : K. Luan Phan , M.D .
Right now , about half of all people who take medicine for an anxiety disorder do n’t get much help from it .
And doctors have no definitive way to predict who will , and who wo n’t , benefit from each anti-anxiety prescription they write .
But a University of Michigan Medical School researcher and his team are working to bring more certainty to how doctors and patients choose anxiety treatments , by probing the connection between brain activity , genetics and medication .
In a paper last month in the Journal of Neuroscience , K. Luan Phan , M.D. , and his former University of Chicago colleagues reported intriguing findings from a brain imaging study in occasional , non-dependent , marijuana users .
In a placebo - controlled design , they made the findings after giving the volunteers delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the active ingredient in marijuana , and exposing them to photographs of emotional faces , which served as signals of social communication .
The study results , which showed that THC reduces the response to threat in a brain region called the amygdala , allowed the researchers to zero in on an area of the brain that might serve as a good target for new anti-anxiety drugs .
Now , with a new clinical trial that is currently seeking participants ,
Phan is searching for more clues as to how anxiety treatment could be tailored to the individual patient , to give the best chance that a treatment will work for him or her .
The new study will test a generic form of the drug Zoloft ( sertraline ) , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for social anxiety disorder and other anxiety disorders .
Both people with social anxiety disorder and a comparison group of people without anxiety are needed for brain scanning and genetic testing .
The idea is to see whether variations in the genes for certain brain receptors and transporters are linked with variations in how a person ’s brain reacts to pictures of emotional faces , and variations in how they respond to the anti-anxiety drug .
This information could lead to an individualized or personalized approach to medical care .
“ These two studies are trying to get to the same goal : to find better treatments for anxiety disorders that affect millions of Americans and seriously interfere with their functioning , ” says Phan , an assistant professor of psychiatry at U - M and the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System .
“ The cannabis study highlights a new avenue that we need to explore further as we try to develop novel medications , while the sertraline study will try to find out if we can tell which patients might or might not respond well , and by what mechanism , to an already existing medication known to have some efficacy in treating anxiety disorders . ”
Phan led the cannabis study at the University of Chicago , collaborating with Harriet deWit , Ph.D. , the director of the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory in the Department of Psychiatry there .
Their results are based on brain scans of 16 recreational marijuana users who agreed to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI .
The researchers chose fMRI because it allows them to see in real time which areas of the brain are most active while a volunteer is performing a certain task – for example , viewing a picture of a human face that is expressing anger or fear , or performing a decision - making exercise .
That same approach will be used in the new sertraline study , with two different scans before and after anxiety patients are prescribed the medication .
The healthy volunteers in the study will also have fMRI scans , though they will not receive the drug .
All study participants must between 18 and 55 years old , and those with anxiety disorders must not be taking any other medication that could be affecting the brain in order to qualify to enter the study .
The cannabis study used THC , and a placebo caplet that looked exactly like the THC caplet .
The researchers found that when the marijuana users received THC , their brain ’s response to “ threatening ” faces was less than it was when they received a placebo .
The difference in response was seen in an area of the brain called the amygdala , which is a hub for the brain ’s ability to process signs of danger or warning , and to decide how to respond .
But there were no differences between THC and placebo in the areas of the brain that process non-emotional visual signals or govern body movement – suggesting that THC had a specific effect on a specific brain region and on a specific task of processing fear .
Other researchers have shown this to be a region that ’s rich in a receptor called CB1 , part of the brain ’s “ cannabinoid ” system .
The human brain produces compounds called endocannabinoids that act on these receptors , and are involved in anxiety and fear - learning , or the learning of which threats to be afraid of .
But little has been known about the effect of THC , an exogenous cannabinoid , on the brain ’s own system .
For ethical reasons , the researchers did not give THC to non-marijuana users , and the study was small .
But the findings in the study volunteers suggest that THC and other compounds that act on the CB1 receptors in the amygdala could be fruitful targets for new anti-anxiety medicines .
Phan notes that rimonabant , a smoking - cessation and weight - loss drug not yet available in the United States for clinical use , also acts on the CB1 receptor .
Understanding how drugs such as marijuana affect the brain may also help reveal more about why people become addicted to illicit drugs or abuse certain prescription drugs , Phan notes .
Some individuals may be using illicit drugs and misusing prescribed drugs to alleviate their anxiety .
He hopes to investigate this issue further by studying people who have used prescription pain drugs recreationally ( such as oxycodone ) , using new funding from the National Institutes of Health .
The THC study links three key domains of human behavior : a specific region of the brain , the function of that area , and a neurochemical agent ( THC ) that appears to act on them .
The new sertraline study will take it one step further , by looking at genetics too .
Specifically , Phan and his colleagues will look for variations ( “ functional polymorphisms ” ) among several genes in individual subjects .
Key among them is the gene ( 5 - HTTLPR ) that encodes the serotonin transporter protein that transports the neurotransmitter serotonin in and out of brain cells .
Serotonin has long been known to be involved in depression and anxiety , and indeed most modern antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs ( such as SSRIs ) work on this transporter .

DAR ES SALAAM , Tanzania —
The quest to solve Africa ’s crippling cycles of war , disease and poverty has gone on for decades , but some think the secret is contained in the living room of a Tanzanian woman named Flotea Masawe .
“ I started my business in my sitting room , in my living room , ” said Mrs. Masawe , a 49 - year - old resident of the Kinindoni Mkwajuni neighborhood in this country ’s capital city .
There is talk of a new entrepreneurial spirit in Tanzania , where a stable political environment has allowed free - market capitalism to grow after a decades - long failed experiment with socialism .
As good governance takes root across Africa , Tanzania could serve as a model for other countries experiencing large inflows of capital .
Across the continent , countries such as the United States , China and others are investing in African oil , but are also spending money to help rebuild countries and fight disease .
Jon Halverson , however , is trying to make sure that Africa ’s rising economic tide truly lifts all boats .
“ Most of sub -Saharan Africans remain very , very poor , ” said Mr. Halverson , with the U.S. African Development Foundation .
“ They must not be left behind on a large scale , or angst leading to instability will be an inevitable result . ”
ADF , which was founded under President Reagan in 1984 , “ is focusing all its business development efforts on the poorest of the poor , ” he said .
Mr. Halverson said that signs of a long - absent middle class are beginning to appear .
An established middle class in Tanzania and across Africa would provide the tax base needed for a robust economy and also make good governance more likely , as the ranks of property owners , merchants and an educated intelligentsia grow .
Mrs. Masawe is hoping to join the middle class with ADF ’s help .
She is using an $ 85,000 ADF grant to turn her former home into a mini-factory , with room for 26 sewing machines , business offices and a showroom .
A married mother of five now - grown children , Mrs. Masawe beamed with pride as she showed a reporter where she started her business in 1992 by hand - sewing pillow cases .
Six years after socialist controls were lifted in Tanzania , Mrs. Masawe decided that her husband ’s salary was n’t enough for their family , and that she could do something about it .
Now , “ Marvelous Flotea ” has 35 employees .
Mrs. Masawe talks about diversifying her product line , competing in the global market , and distributing products made by neighbors who do n’t have her connections .
“ We are expanding to America , ” Mrs. Masawe said .
Flotea Massawe , a married mother of five , demonstrates how she started her textile and accessory business in her living room , and is now filling orders of between 15,000 and 25,000 products for Macy ’s and Hallmark , on Monday , Feb. 18 , 2008 .
Macy ’s Inc. is planning to order 3,000 to 4,000 handmade bags , and Hallmark is planning on an order of 10,000 to 20,000 handmade puppets .
Most of ADF ’s $ 30 million annual budget goes toward grants and loans for small businesses in Africa .
Grants are given to help entrepreneurs with good ideas and marketable products get their business off the ground .
No - interest loans of up to $ 250,000 are doled out to help slightly larger businesses expand .
Mrs. Masawe could land such a loan if she meets certain performance targets .
ADF partners with a Tanzanian consulting firm , which helps each small business to improve its operations and bookkeeping .
William Masawe , who runs the consulting firm that partners with ADF , says his small office of five managers and several staff is focused on “ the missing middle . ”
“ In Tanzania , most of the businesses which are operating are informal and at the bottom end of the pyramid , ” said Mr. Masawe , a business consultant who is not related to Mrs. Masawe .
“ At the top , you find the big corporations involving growing industry : mining , telecommunications , insurance , financial services , ” he said .
“ Now , this middle , which is the area where you find most taxpayers , is not there . ”
“ This , ” he said , pointing with his pen to the middle of the pyramid he has drawn by hand on a legal pad , “ is where we are targeting . ”
William Massawe , who manages a Tanzanian business consulting firm that receives money from ADF , talks about the need for more small and medium - sized businesses to close the gap between the lower class merchants and the giant industry firms , on Monday , Feb. 18 , 2008 .

Democrats allege GOP committee illegally coordinated with outside group Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday April 16 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Conservative org says charges are trumped up , inaccurate A Democratic campaign committee filed a federal elections complaint Wednesday alleging that its GOP counterpart illegally coordinated campaign advertisements with an outside political advocacy group .
The complaint cites similarities between two advertisements targeting Democrat Don Cazayoux , who is running for a House seat in a special election next month in Louisiana .
The National Republican Campaign Committee ran one of the advertisements , and the other came from Freedom 's Watch , an outside group supporting GOP candidates .
Both ads use an identical photo of Cazayoux and cite his votes in favor of tax increases , but the groups say they did not coordinate their activities .
" The DCCC is filing this FEC complaint to hold Freedom 's Watch and the NRCC accountable for their illegal coordination that is being used to mislead voters about Democratic candidates ' positions , " said Brian Wolff , Executive Director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in a press release .
To support a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission , the Democratic National Campaign Committee cites a script of the Freedom 's Watch ad that contains an " NRCC " citation in its meta -data .
The data also apparently shows that a former NRCC employee , who now works for Freedom 's Watch , was the last person to edit the script .
The DCCC did not immediately release a copy of the Word document .
Microsoft Word , the program used to prepare the script , archives data about previous edits to Word documents .
A Freedom's Watch spokesman says its ad vendor used a template that had at one point been named NRCC , but he said the old text was deleted and replaced with an original script .
" I think there are a lot of people who have been toiling for years trying to prove the existence of a vast right - wing conspiracy , " Ed Patru , of Freedom 's Watch , told RAW STORY Wednesday .
" I 'm sorry to disappoint them , but this is n't the smoking gun . "
He said the vendor Freedom 's Watch used previously had the NRCC as a client but has not done any work for them this election cycle .
A DCCC spokesman said there are too many similarities to dismiss them as simple coincidence , and he noted that Freedom 's Watch began airing its ad the day after the NRCC ad stopped airing .
" I think it raises serious questions about their coordination issues ; voters deserve to know who 's behind these ads , " DCCC spokesman Doug Thornell told RAW STORY .
" We hope that this is will be scrutinized and that the NRCC and Freedom 's Watch come clean . "
Freedom's Watch dismissed similarities in the ads ' content as a case of both organizations ' treading ground that is common in conservative political campaigns .
" I think you'd be hard pressed not to find conservatives making an issue about taxes , particularly when you have a candidate who 's running as a tax cutter , " Patru said .
" As far as we 're concerned it 's not a serious complaint . "
The Democrats ' complaint also notes that Freedom 's Watch recently hired Carl Forti , who previously worked for Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign and before that was at the NRCC .
According to the DCCC , " cforti " was the last person to edit the Freedom 's Watch ad .
Freedom's
Watch says there is nothing nefarious about this because Forti was an employee of the group at the time and had n't worked at the NRCC for about a year prior to joining them .
An FEC spokesman could not comment on the specific complaint , citing confidentiality requirements .
Instead he directed a reporter to the agency 's guidelines for filing a complaint .
Freedom's Watch and the NRCC have 15 days to file a response to the complaint , after that period has passed the FEC would decide whether to open an investigation into the matter .
The two ads the DCCC accuses the groups of collaborating on appear below .
This ad was purchased by the NRCC :
This ad came from Freedom 's Watch :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A US Airways pilot has been removed from flight duty after he accidentally discharged his handgun in the cockpit during a flight on Saturday .
The shot was fired as the plane was at 8,000 feet on approach to Charlotte , North Carolina .
The bullet penetrated the fuselage , but did not damage any crucial instruments or wiring , according to the Transportation Security Administration .
The pilot was carrying the gun under the Federal Flight Deck Officer program , which has trained thousands of pilots to carry weapons to increase aviation safety .
Saturday 's incident was the first case of an accidental firing .
The pilot has been taken off flight duty and suspended from the federal firearms program while the incident is under investigation , the TSA said Tuesday .
The agency is investigating whether the pilot was handling the gun as directed in policies .
No one was injured during the flight , which originated in Denver , Colorado .
US
Airways said in a statement that it removed the aircraft from service and is cooperating with authorities investigating the incident .

VLC Player , one of the best and most widely used media players has found to be vulnerable to a remote hijack .
The reported vulnerability makes it possible for a malicious user to run arbitrary code , potentially taking remote control of the host machine .
VLC is a popular media player among BitTorrent users .
Not just for the fact that it is free , also because it includes a huge number of the video codecs , so it can play virtually every video file available .
Unfortunately , the latest versions of VLC have a security flaw according to a report from Luigi Auriemma .
The vulnerability can be exploited to compromise a user ’s system , as it leaves it wide open for a malicious user to run arbitrary code .
The problem occurs when a someone loads a subtitle file , which causes a buffer overflow that can be exploited .
The security flaw is platform independent , which means it affects Windows , Mac and Linux users .
Initially it was reported that the flaws in version 0.8.6d were fixed in the latest release , but this turns out not to be the case .
Auriemma writes : “ The old buffer - overflow in the subtitles handled by VLC has not been fully patched in version 0.8.6e . ”
“ The funny thing is that my old proof - of - concept was built just to test this specific buffer - overflow and in fact it works on the new VLC version too without modifications , ” he adds .
For now , the only solutions are not to run any subtitle files , or to grab one of the nightly builds .
The downside is , however , that these might not be as stable as the regular releases .

Flickr users are revolting .
Again .
Several groups protesting this week 's addition of video to Yahoo 's popular photo - sharing site have sprung up to object to the new feature .
One group , We Say No to Videos on Flickr , has amassed more than 22,000 members since Tuesday 's announcement about the photo site 's feature creep .
A like - minded group , calling itself No Video on Flickr , has attracted more than 9,000 Flickr users .
" The big issue is the way it was implemented , " said Jason Bouwmeester , a systems analyst in Canada and one of the group administrators for No Video on Flickr .
" There was no public beta ....
They just reset everyone 's settings . "
Users have complained about the video features causing the whole site to slow down , a possible influx of YouTube junk and the deviation from Flickr 's original purpose – photography .
The anti-video crusaders on Flickr are tagging their photos " novideo " and using graphics ( like this Dalek - inspired one , pictured ) to express their disapproval of the new service .
Additionally , a petition in multiple languages objecting to the videos has already been signed by 5,000 Flickr users calling for the removal of the feature .
Flickr purists have an affinity for protesting any changes related to the site .
In 2005 , some Flickr users threatened a " mass suicide " in response to Yahoo 's purchase of the photo site .
And this February , Flickr users staged online protests amidst swirling reports of a Microsoft acquisition of Yahoo .
The new video - sharing feature , which lets Flickr " Pro " users upload 90 - second videos alongside regular photos , is seen by some as a move by Yahoo to compete with YouTube .
Dedicated photo fans like Bouwmeester were hoping Flickr would concentrate on improving the site , not larding on extraneous features .
" I had hoped my [ Pro membership fee ] would go to fixing issues with the site , not to starting a video application , " said Bouwmeester .
" I ca n't see them reverting [ the video service ] altogether , but they should have some way for users to ignore it . "
An upgrade to a Pro membership account costs an extra $ 25 per year .
" We thought long and hard about how we would integrate video so it complemented
the existing Flickr experience , " said Terrell Karlsten , a Flickr spokesperson .
" We always welcome feedback from our community and appreciate their opinions across many topics . "
Of course , not all Flickr users are upset over the new video additions .
A satirical group , called The We Say No Photos on Flickr Pool has emerged to mock the backlash , claiming " Photos are of the past ! "

Small retailers the nation over are being pushed out of business by government subsidies to chain competitors such as Wal - Mart and Target through a variety of “ corporate socialism ” schemes , taxation authority David Cay Johnston says .
Municipalities are permitting “ tax increment financing ” that allow the big chains “ to keep the sales taxes that you are forced to pay at the tax register , ” Johnston said on the television interview program Books of Our Time , sponsored by the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover and broadcast by Comcast .
“ Instead of that money going to the schools and the fire department and the police department and the library , it is funneled through a mechanism of local government , usually a special authority , to finance the purchase of municipal bonds so that means that the wealthy underwriters and the lawyers and auditors all get a piece of this money to buy the land and build the store , ” Johnson told TV host Lawrence Velvel , dean of the law school .
The store is then leased to the big chain developer “ at terms that amount to giving it to them for free or nearly free over a period of time , ” Johnston said , “ and it ’s destroying local business . ”
An amazing aspect of this “ corporate socialism ” policy , Johnston says , “ is that local business owners have not risen up and stopped this . ”
“ A system in which government , whether Federal or local , picks the winners in the economy , is not capitalism , it ’s not competition , it ’s not free market , it is corporate socialism , it is statism , it ’s the state making these choices , ” Johnston said .
In his new book , Free Lunch ( Portfolio ) Johnston amplifies this point by noting “ Sam Walton practiced corporate socialism .
As much as he could , he put the public ’s money to work for his benefit .
Free land , long - term leases at below - market rates , pocketing sales taxes , even getting workers trained at government expense were among the ways Wal - Mart took every dollar of welfare it could get . ”
“ Walton had a particular fondness for government - sponsored industrial revenue bonds , ” Johnston continued , “ which cost him less in interest charges than the corporate bonds the market economy uses to raise money . ”
Johnston said in the television interview that if the public really understood what was happening they would not permit government subsidies to corporations to go forward .
Johnston pointed out : “ Subsidies to retail can not make us wealthier .
Retail is at the end of the economic line .
If you want to subsidize things , first subsidize education , then subsidize basic research , then subsidize applied research and development and subsidize infrastructure — rails and canals and highways — and maybe in some cases manufacturing and mining to get something going .
But the least bang for the buck , and often the negative bang for the buck , would be subsidizing retail .
What ’s happening is wealthy families , the richest families in America , are getting welfare and they apparently have no shame about this . ”
Johnston points out government handouts for Wal - Mart “ reduce the costs of competing in the market ” and by soliciting the subsidies “ Wal - Mart shifted some of the risks of its expansion onto the majority of Americans who are not regular Wal - Mart shoppers . ”
He said the fortune Wal - Mart is reaping is no different from what other corporate players are getting .
“ We are transferring enormous amounts of money to corporations and wealthy individuals , ” Johnston pointed out .
For example , he said , “ We gave Warren Buffett ’s companies a hundred million dollar gift last year . ”
( Buffett ’s firm has a two - thirds - billion - dollar , interest - free loan from our government for more than 28 years , Johnston notes .
Similarly , Donald Trump benefits from a tax enacted to help the elderly and the poor but part of which is now diverted to his casinos , Johnston says . )
“ The incomes of the top one percent are exploding , are pulling away from everybody else , ” Johnston said , “ while the middle - class is stifling and the bottom is dropping out ( of the economy ) . ”
Author Johnson , for many years the tax reporter for The New York Times , has won a Pulitzer Prize and many other awards and uncovered so many tax dodges that he has been called the “ de facto chief tax enforcement officer of the United States . ”

Underscoring the Democrats ’ economic points , Pelosi asked why U.S. military in Iraq and Americans back home are paying more for gasoline than the Iraqis are .
Pelosi warns Petraeus on Iraq testimony
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) warned Army Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on Thursday not to " put a shine on recent events ” in Iraq when they testify before Congress next week .
“ I hope we do n’t hear any glorification of what happened in Basra , ” said Pelosi , referring to a recent military offensive against Shiite militants in the city led by the Iraqi government and supported by U.S. forces .

Although powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr agreed to a ceasefire after six days of fighting , Pelosi wondered why the U.S. was caught off guard by the offensive and questioned how the ceasefire was achieved , saying the terms were " probably dictated from Iran . ”
“ We have to know the real ground truths of what is happening there , not put a shine on events because of a resolution that looks less violent when in fact it has been dictated by al - Sadr , who can grant or withhold that call for violence , ” Pelosi said .
Petraeus , the top military commander in Iraq , and Crocker , the U.S. ambassador , will make their return to Capitol Hill on April 8 and 9 to deliver their assessment of the situation on the ground in Iraq .
So far , Petraeus and Crocker have made very few public comments about the situation in Basra , but many Republicans have hailed it as an example of the Iraqi government standing up and further proof that President Bush ’s troop surge is working .
Republicans took issue Thursday with the notion that Petraeus would use events in Iraq to advance a political agenda .
" Gen. Petraeus ... is not a political figure , " said Michael Steel , spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
" The testimony he gives reflects the facts on the ground .
If he reports that the security situation in Iraq is improving , as we hope he does , he will be echoing the assessment of many Democratic House members who have visited Iraq recently .
Our priorities should be learning the facts and acting on them , not using any development as a pretext for irresponsible withdrawal . "
Pelosi held a press conference Thursday morning with House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman ( D - Calif. ) to preview their message ahead of the visit from Petraeus and Crocker .
The Democrats hammered two themes :
The war in Iraq has stretched the military dangerously thin , and the enormous cost of the war is threatening the health of the U.S. economy .
" The stretch and strain on our military is like never before , " said Skelton .
" I am terribly worried about this . "
Underscoring the Democrats ’ economic points , Pelosi asked why the U.S. military in Iraq and Americans back home are paying more for gasoline than the Iraqis are .
“ Our troops in Iraq are paying about $ 3.25 a gallon for gas in Iraq , comparable to what we pay here , while the Iraqis are paying $ 1.36 a gallon , ” Pelosi said .
“ This is a raw deal for the American taxpayer . ”
The Democrats appeared skeptical they were going to hear anything new from Petraeus and Crocker .
“ Every event in Iraq seems to be a justification [ by the administration ] for more troops , more time and more money in Iraq , ” said Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , the Democratic Caucus chairman .
“ We are in a policy cul du sac .
We just keep going around and around in circles . ”
Neither Pelosi nor Skelton addressed questions about what will be included in a supplemental war funding bill Congress is expected to take up later this month , explaining that they wanted to focus on the upcoming Petraeus - Crocker testimony instead .
Faith - Healing Parents Charged in Baby 's Death Doctors say toddler 's death could easily have been prevented with antibiotics .
March 29 , 2008  -- A Clackamas County , Ore. , couple are facing second degree manslaughter and criminal mistreatment charges after their 15 - month - old daughter died from what the state medical examiner said were easily cured illnesses .
The infant girl , Ava Worthington , died March 2 from bacterial bronchial pneumonia and an infection , both of which could have been cured with common antibiotics , the medical examiner said .
But police say that instead of going to a doctor , 28 - year - old Carl Worthington and his wife , Raylene , 25 , opted to pray for their daughter .
The two surrendered to police at Calackamas County Jail Friday night .
Bail was set at $ 250,000 apiece , and they were released hours later after each posted $ 25,000 bond , Clackamas County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Det. Jim Strovink said .
They are scheduled to appear in Clackamas County Circuit Court on Monday .
A reporter from ABC News affiliate KATU - TV in Portland , Ore. , went to the Worthington 's home before they turned themselves in , but the couple declined to comment .
The Worthingtons are members of the Followers of Christ Church in Oregon City , that has a history of shunning medical care in favor of faith healing .
A decade ago the church received national attention after KATU reported that the state medical examiner believed approximately 20 children whose parents belonged to the church , had died from untreated illnesses that were curable .
For more of KATU 's coverage of the case click here .
After that story broke , the Oregon state legislature changed the law to bar defendants , in most cases , from claiming their religious beliefs prevented them from seeking medical help .
" Ten years ago I could n't express my feelings for what was going on out there , but I can now , " said Mark Hass , who as a KATU reporter worked on the story and is now a state senator .
" This is child abuse .
Pure and simple .
There is no other way to say it . "
Though the revised law removed the so - called " spiritual - healing defense , " there is still a provision that allows judges to give parents a lighter sentence based on their beliefs .
Some veteran lawmakers who were in the legislature for that bitter fight a decade ago say that this case could be the first test of that law .
" This is the first time that they could be taking a shot at interpreting the law , " state Senate President Peter Courtney told The Oregonian newspaper .
Earlier this week authorities in Wisconsin said they were considering filing charges in the case of an 11 - year - old girl who died on Easter Sunday of complications from diabetes that went untreated because police say her parents ' religious beliefs do not allow medical intervention .
The girl , Madeline Kara Neumann , who went by the name Kara and was the youngest child of Leilani and Dale Neumann , died Sunday of " diabetic ketoacidosis , " according to a Marathon County autopsy report .
The girl 's diabetes had never been diagnosed , officials say .

Ghost in the Shell is , after all , a cop movie .
The main plot arc involves solving a crime of the future : non-consensual brain hacking .
And I 'm willing to admit Spielberg did make one hell of a slick , menacing dystopia in A.I. — as long as you ignore the egregiously awful ending .

Climate Change and Public Health Statement of Julie L. Gerberding , M.D. , M.P.H. Director , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Administrator , Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS UNITED STATES SENATE
For Release on Delivery Expected at 10:00 am Tuesday , October 23 , 2007
Introduction Good morning Madam Chairwoman , Senator Inhofe , and other distinguished members of the Committee .
It is a pleasure to appear before you as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the Nation ’s leading public health protection agency located within the Department of Health and Human Services .
Thank you for the opportunity to present on climate change and human health and to highlight the role of CDC in preparing for and responding to the health effects of climate change .
Background
The health of all individuals is influenced by the health of people , animals , and the environment around us .
Many trends within this larger , interdependent ecologic system influence public health on a global scale , including climate change .
The public health response to such trends requires a holistic understanding of disease and the various external factors influencing public health .
It is within this larger context where the greatest challenges and opportunities for protecting and promoting public health occur .
Scientific evidence supports the view that the earth ’s climate is changing .
A broad array of organizations ( federal , state , local , multilateral , faith - based , private and nongovernmental ) is working to address climate change .
Despite this extensive activity , the public health effects of climate change remain largely unaddressed .
CDC considers climate change a serious public health concern .
Climate Change is a Public Health Concern
In the United States , climate change is likely to have a significant impact on health , through links with the following outcomes : • Direct effects of heat , • Health effects related to extreme weather events , • Air pollution - related health effects , • Allergic diseases , • Water - and food - borne infectious diseases , • Vector - borne and zoonotic diseases , • Food and water scarcity , at least for some populations , • Mental health problems , and • Long - term impacts of chronic diseases and other health effects
The United States is a developed country with a variety of climates .
Because of its well developed health infrastructure , and the greater involvement of government and nongovernmental agencies in disaster planning and response , the health effects from climate change are expected to be less significant than in the developing world .
Nevertheless , many Americans will likely experience difficult challenges .
Catastrophic weather events such as heat waves and hurricanes are expected to become more frequent , severe , and costly ; the U.S. population is anticipated to continue to age and move to vulnerable locations such as coastal areas , increasing exposures to specific risks ; and concurrent challenges such as water scarcity in certain regions could limit our resilience .
In addition , climate change is likely to alter the current geographic distribution of some vector - borne and zoonotic diseases ; some may become more frequent , widespread , and outbreaks could last longer , while others could be reduced in incidence .
Heat Stress and Direct Thermal Injury
One of the most likely climate change projections is an increase in frequency of hot days , hot nights , and heat waves .
The United States is expected to see an increase in the severity , duration , and frequency of extreme heat waves .
This , coupled with an aging population , increases the likelihood of higher mortality as the elderly are more vulnerable to dying from exposure to excessive heat .
Midwestern and northeastern cities are at greatest risk , as heat - related illness and death appear to be related to exposure to temperatures much hotter than those to which the population is accustomed .
Extreme Weather Events Climate change is anticipated to alter the frequency , timing , intensity , and duration of extreme weather events , such as hurricanes and floods .
The health effects of these extreme weather events range from loss of life and acute trauma , to indirect effects such as loss of home , large - scale population displacement , damage to sanitation infrastructure ( drinking water and sewage systems ) , interruption of food production , damage to the health - care infrastructure , and psychological problems such as post traumatic stress disorder .
Displacement of individuals often results in disruption of health care , of particular concern for those with underlying chronic diseases .
Future climate projections also show likely increases in the frequency of heavy rainfall events , posing an increased risk of flooding events and overwhelming of sanitation infrastructure .
Air Pollution - Related Health Effects Climate change can affect air quality by modifying local weather patterns and pollutant concentrations , affecting natural sources of air pollution , and promoting the formation of secondary pollutants .
Of particular concern is the impact of increased temperature and UV radiation on ozone formation .
Some studies have shown that higher surface temperatures , especially in urban areas , encourage the formation of ground - level ozone .
As a primary ingredient of smog , ground - level ozone is a public health concern .
Ozone can irritate the respiratory system , reduce lung function , aggravate asthma , and inflame and damage cells that line the lungs .
In addition , it may cause permanent lung damage and aggravate chronic lung diseases .
Allergic Diseases Studies have shown that some plants , such as ragweed and poison ivy , grow faster and produce more allergens under conditions of high carbon dioxide and warm weather .
As a result , allergic diseases and symptoms could worsen with climate change .
Water - and Food - borne Infectious Diseases Altered weather patterns resulting from climate change are likely to affect the distribution and incidence of food - and water - borne diseases .
Changes in precipitation , temperature , humidity , and water salinity have been shown to affect the quality of water used for drinking , recreation , and commercial use .
For example , outbreaks of Vibrio bacteria infections following the consumption of seafood and shellfish have been associated with increases in temperatures .
Heavy rainfall has also been implicated as a contributing factor in the overloading and contamination of drinking water treatment systems , leading to illness from organisms such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia .
Storm water runoff from heavy precipitation events can also ncrease fecal bacterial counts in coastal waters as well as nutrient load , which , coupled with increased sea-surface temperature , can lead to increases in the frequency and range of harmful algal blooms ( red tides ) and potent marine biotoxins such as ciguatera fish poisoning .
Vector - borne and Zoonotic Diseases Vector - borne and zoonotic diseases , such as plague , Lyme disease , West Nile virus , malaria , hantavirus pulmonary syndrome , and dengue fever have been shown to have a distinct seasonal pattern , suggesting that they are weather sensitive .
Climate change - driven ecological changes , such as variations in rainfall and temperature , could significantly alter the range , seasonality , and human incidence of many zoonotic and vector - borne diseases .
More study is required to fully understand all the implications of ecological variables necessary to predict climate change effects on vector - borne and zoonotic diseases .
Moderating factors such as housing quality , land - use patterns , and vector control programs make it unlikely that these climate changes will have a major impact on tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever spreading into the United States .
However , climate change could aid in the establishment of exotic vector - borne diseases imported into the United States .
Food Scarcity Climate change is predicted to alter agricultural production , both directly and indirectly .
This may lead to scarcity of some foods , increase food prices , and threaten access to food for Americans who experience food insecurity .
Mental Health Problems Some Americans may suffer anxiety , depression , and similar symptoms in anticipating climate change and / or in coping with its effects .
Moreover , the aftermath of severe events may include post - traumatic stress and related problems , as was seen after Hurricane Katrina .
These conditions are difficult to quantify but may have significant effects of health and well - being .
Climate Change Vulnerability
The effects of climate change will likely vary regionally and by population .
The northern latitudes of the United States are expected to experience the largest increases in average temperatures ; these areas also will likely bear the brunt of increases in ground - level ozone and associated airborne pollutants .
Populations in mid-western and northeastern cities are expected to experience more heat - related illnesses as heat waves increase in frequency , severity , and duration .
Coastal regions will likely experience essentially uniform risk of sea level rise , but different rates of coastal erosion , wetlands destruction , and topography are expected to result in dramatically different regional effects of sea level rise .
Distribution of animal hosts and vectors may change ; in many cases , ranges could extend northward and increase in elevation .
For some pathogens associated with wild animals , such as rodents and hantavirus , ranges will change based on precipitation changes .
The west coast of the United States is expected to experience significant strains on water supplies as regional precipitation declines and mountain snowpacks are depleted .
Forest fires are expected to increase in frequency , severity , distribution , and duration .
The health effects of climate change on a given community will depend not only on the particular exposures it faces , but also on the underlying health status , age distribution , health care access , and socioeconomic status of its residents .
Local response capacity will also be important .
As with other environmental hazards , members of certain ethnic and racial minority groups will likely be disproportionately affected .
For example , in low - lying coastal communities facing increasingly frequent and severe extreme precipitation events , there could be increased injuries , outbreaks of diarrheal disease , and harmful algal blooms ; saltwater may intrude into freshwater tables and infrastructure is likely to be damaged by severe storms , hampering economic recovery .
In certain Southern coastal communities with little economic reserve , declining industry , difficulty accessing health care , and a greater underlying burden of disease , these stressors could be overwhelming .
Similarly , in an urban area with increasingly frequent and severe heat waves , certain groups are expected to be more affected : the home - bound , elderly , poor , athletes , and minority and migrant populations , and populations that live in areas with less green space and with fewer centrally air - conditioned buildings are all more vulnerable to heat stress .
Some populations of Americans are more vulnerable to the health effects of climate change than others .
Children are at greater risk of worsening asthma , allergies , and certain infectious diseases , and the elderly are at higher risk for health effects due to heat waves , extreme weather events , and exacerbations of chronic disease .
In addition , people of lower socioeconomic status are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events .
Members of racial and ethnic minority groups suffer particularly from air pollution as well as inadequate health care access , while athletes and those who work outdoors are more at risk from air pollution , heat , and certain infectious diseases .
Given the differential burden of climate change ’s health effects on certain populations , public health preparedness for climate change must include vulnerability assessments that identify the most vulnerable populations with the most significant health disparities and anticipate their risks for particular exposures .
At the same time , health communication targeting these vulnerable populations must be devised and tested , and early warning systems focused on vulnerable communities should be developed .
With adequate notice and a vigorous response , the ill health effects of many exposures from climate change can be dampened .
Public Health Preparedness for Climate Change
Climate change is anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of Americans and the nation ’s public health infrastructure .
As the nation ’s public health agency , CDC is uniquely poised to lead efforts to anticipate and respond to the health effects of climate change .
Preparedness for the health consequences of climate change aligns with traditional public health contributions , and – like preparedness for terrorism and pandemic influenza – reinforces the importance of a strong public health infrastructure .
CDC ’s expertise and programs in the following areas provide the strong platform needed :
• Environmental Public Health Tracking : CDC has a long history of tracking occurrence and trends in diseases and health outcomes .
CDC is pioneering new ways to understand the impacts of environmental hazards on people ’s health .
For example , CDC ’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program has funded several states to build a health surveillance system that integrates environmental exposures and human health outcomes .
This system , the Tracking Network , will go live in 2008 , providing information on how health is affected by environmental hazards .
The Tracking Network will contain critical data on the incidence , trends , and potential outbreaks of diseases , including those affected by climate change .
• Surveillance of Water - borne , Food - borne , Vector - borne , and Zoonotic Diseases : CDC also has a long history of surveillance of infectious , zoonotic , and vector - borne diseases .
Preparing for climate change will involve working closely with state and local partners to document whether potential changes in climate have an impact on infectious and other diseases and to use this information to help protect Americans from the potential change in of a variety of dangerous water - borne , food - borne , vector - borne , and zoonotic diseases .
CDC has developed ArboNet , the national arthropod - borne viral disease tracking system .
Currently , this system supports the nationwide West Nile virus surveillance system that links all 50 states and four large metropolitan areas to a central database that records and maps cases in humans and animals and would detect changes in real - time in the distribution and prevalence of cases of arthropod - borne viral diseases .
CDC also supports the major foodborne surveillance and investigative networks of FoodNet and PulseNet which rapidly identify and provide detailed data on cases of foodborne illnesses , on the organisms that cause them , and on the foods that are the sources of infection .
Altered weather patterns resulting from climate change are likely to affect the distribution and incidence of food - and water - borne diseases , and these changes can be identified and tracked through PulseNet .
• Geographic Information System ( GIS ) :
At the CDC , GIS technology has been applied in unique and powerful ways to a variety of public health issues .
It has been used in data collection , mapping , and communication to respond to issues as wide - ranging and varied as the World Trade Center collapse , avian flu , SARS , and Rift Valley fever .
In addition , GIS technology was used to map issues of importance during the CDC response to Hurricane Katrina .
This technology represents an additional tool for the public health response to climate change .
• Modeling : Currently sophisticated models to predict climate and heat exist .
For example , CDC has conducted heat stroke modeling for the city of Philadelphia to predict the most vulnerable populations at risk for hyperthermia .
Modeling and forecasting represent an important preparedness strategy , in that it can help predict and respond to the most pressing health vulnerabilities at the state and local level .
Armed with modeling data , we can target response plans for heat and other extreme weather events to the most vulnerable communities and populations .
• Preparedness Planning : Just as we prepare for terrorism and pandemic influenza , we should use these principles and prepare for health impacts from climate change .
For example , to respond to the multiple threats posed by heat waves , the urban environment , and climate change , CDC scientists have focused prevention efforts on developing tools that local emergency planners and decision - makers can use to prepare for and respond to heat waves .
In collaboration with other Federal partners , CDC participated in the development of an Excessive Heat Events Guidebook , which provides a comprehensive set of guiding principle and a menu of options for cities and localities to use in the development of Heat Response Plans .
These plans clearly define specific roles and responsibilities of government and non-governmental organizations during heat waves .
They identify local populations at increased high risk for heat - related illness and death and determine which strategies will be used to reach them during heat emergencies .
• Training and Education of Public Health Professionals – Preparing for the health consequences of climate change requires that professionals have the skills required to conceptualize the impending threats , integrate a wide variety of public health and other data in surveillance activities , work closely with other agencies and sectors , and provide effective health communication for vulnerable populations regarding the evolving threat of climate change .
CDC is holding a series of five workshops to further explore key dimensions of climate change and public health , including drinking water , heat waves , health communication , vector - borne illness , and vulnerable populations .
• Health Protection Research : CDC can promote research to further elucidate the specific relationships between climate change and various health outcomes , including predictive models and evaluations of interventions .
Research efforts can also identify the magnitude of health effects and populations at greatest risk .
For example , CDC has conducted research on the relationship between hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and rainfall , as well as research assessing the impact of climate variability and climate change on temperature - related morbidity and mortality .
This information will help enable public health action to be targeted and will help determine the best methods of communicating risk .
CDC can serve as a credible source of information on health risks and actions that individuals can take to reduce their risk .
In addition , CDC has several state - of - the - art laboratories conducting research on such issues as chemicals and human exposure , radiological testing , and infectious diseases .
This research capacity is an asset in working to more fully understand the health consequences of climate change .
• Communication : CDC has expertise in health and risk communication , and has deployed this expertise in areas as diverse as smoking , HIV infection , and cancer screening .
Effective communication can alert the public to health risks associated with climate change , avoid inappropriate responses , and encourage constructive protective behaviors .
While CDC can offer technical support and expertise in these and other activities , much of this work needs to be carried out at the state and local level .
For example , CDC can support climate change preparedness activities in public health agencies , and climate change and health research in universities , as is currently practiced for a variety of other health challenges .
Conclusion
An effective public health response to climate change can prevent injuries , illnesses , and death and enhance overall public health preparedness .
Protecting Americans from the health effects of climate change directly correlates to CDC ’s four overarching Health Protection Goals of Healthy People in Every Stage of Life , Healthy People in Healthy Places , People Prepared for Emerging Health Threats , and Healthy People in a Healthy World .
While we still need more focus and emphasis on public health preparedness for climate change , many of our existing programs and scientific expertise provide a solid foundation to move forward .
Many of the activities needed to protect Americans from the health effects of climate change are mutually beneficial for overall public health .
In addition , health and the environment are closely linked , as strongly demonstrated by the issue of climate change .
Because of this linkage it is also important that potential health effects of environmental solutions be fully considered .
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony on the potential health effects of global climate change and for your continued support of CDC ’s essential public health work .
This is causing serious damage to the already battered White House , with Press Secretary Dana Perino getting caught in the media cross - hairs yesterday arguing that somehow global warming was some how good for us !
Er , might need some damage control , for you damage control !

ARという技術は『現実世界にディジタル情報を重畳させることにより、作業支援・ユーザインタフェース・エンタテイメント応用などにおける情報提示に役立てよう』というコンセプトに基づいて20年ほど前から研究が進められています。
ざっくりと言いますと『現実世界にディジタル情報を重ね合わせて色々できるようにしようぜー』ってことです。スカウターもARです。攻殻機動隊もARです。最近はニコニコ動画でもARを応用した動画が見られるようになってきましたね。いったい誰の影響でしょうか。
さて、今回はこのAR研究において、衝撃的な動画を見つけましたので、これを紹介します。
何よりもビデオを見ていただくのが一番早いでしょう。
上は、2007年11月中旬に奈良で行われたISMAR
2007（複合現実感国際会議）で Best Paper Award を受賞した研究発表のデモです。
是非と も1:00 あたりから始まる「龍安寺の石庭で戦うダースベーダー」の映像を見ていただきたい。おそるべきは、これがリアルタイムで、しかもノートPCで動いているという点。
作者のホームーページはこちら （Georg Klein Home Page）です。
簡単な解説を加えます。
この技術をざっくりと言いますと、『カメラの入力から特徴点を取得・追跡をすることで３D空間のマップ作りを行い、それに基づいて３Dディジタル情報を書き込み提示する』という技術です。特徴点追跡とマッピングのスレッドを分離することで、数千個の特徴点を実時間で扱うことが可能になっています。
詳細についてはすごく技術的な話になってしまいます。作者のホームページで論文が公開されていますし、『自然特徴点/特徴点追跡/三次元復元』あたりのワードで検索をかけるといくつか関連論文が見つかりますので、各自そちらでお願いします。
ぼくはこの研究を、2008年1月18日に行われたPRMU（パターン認識とメディア理解）研究報告会での会議報告で知りました。今回の研究会のテーマはまさに「拡張現実感/仮想現実感技術（AR/VR）について」でした。会場にはそれはもう日本のAR会における著名人がたくさんいらっしゃったのですが、報告内で講演者がこの動画を背にしながら「こんなもんやられたら、ぐうの音も出ませんね」と言い会場の苦笑を誘ったのが印象的でした。
そう、本当にぐうの音も出ません。当日は工学ナビの橋本様と合流でき（この度はありがとうございました）、帰り際にこの研究について話すことができました。「さすがにここまでくるのはもう数年先のことだと思ってました」「しかもソースコードまで配布されるともうやってられませんねー」「マーカー系AR研究者全員涙目じゃんｗ」「それなんて俺ｗｗｻｰｾﾝｗｗｗ」
こんにちは、涙目です。 作者様のソースコード公開に期待しながら、頑張って英語論文を読みましょう。(ソースコード公開について、動きがあったようです詳細はこちら)
マーカーを用いていないこの研究の課題は、『どの位置にどの情報を重ね合わせるかの判断が（自動では）できていない』という点にあるかと思われます。動画では手動のマウス操作で行っていますね。この課題については、ぼく程度でもいくつか解決法が思い浮かびますので、時間の問題でしょう（あるいはそのあたりはアプリケーション依存なので、技術の汎用性のためあえて実装していないのかも）。
2028年には一部でAR/VRのインフラ化が起きているだろう、というのがぼくの至極個人的な読みです。電脳化については生体実験の難しさや倫理的な課題もあるので、ぼくらが死ぬまでには難しいかもしれませんが、電脳コイルくらいの時代には到達できる可能性が十分にあります！
うわ！テンション上がってきた！
ちょっと電脳コイル借りに行ってくる！

追記。
大学入学を機に一人暮らしを始めて以降、両親にはなかなか顔を見せる機会がありませんでした。心配をかけながらも、慣れない生活や大学の課題に実習、そして追われるように始めた就職活動と続き、未熟者の私の気持ちは自分のことでいつも精一杯でした。そして苦労の末に就職が内定した時さえも、実家へは電話で報告しただけで残りの学生生活は卒論の追い込みとアルバイトであっという間に終わりました。卒業してから社会人になるまでの3週間は大学の友人たちとの旅行に費やしてしまい、やはり親孝行らしいことは何もしませんでした。
社会人になればなったで、これまでとは違う忙しさに目が回りそうな毎日の連続。やはり故郷の両親のことは思い出すゆとりさえありませんでした。そんなある日、勤め先の上司と世間話をしていたとき、ふと故郷の話題となりました。上司自身も若いころには自分のことさえも見えていなかったと、前置きをしたうえで、「立派な社会人になれたのは、ご両親の理解と支えがあったからこそ。これからはできる限り親孝行に務めた方が良い」とのアドバイスをもらいました。そこで初めて、父親が60歳を迎える年齢であることを思い出しました。そして、18の春以来、数えるほどしか実家にも帰っていなかったことを大いに反省。ここは上司の言うように、無事に大人として成長できたお礼と感謝を込めてなにか還暦祝いのプレゼントを贈ろうと考えました。
早速、週末にデパートへ出掛けたり、ギフトショップに立ち寄ったりしてみたものの、「これだ!」という品には出会えませんでした。そんなとき、湯飲みやぐい飲みなどのお椀やお猪口、さらには日本酒の酒瓶本体にまで、メッセージとともに名入れのサービスをしてくれるショップの存在をしりました。問い合わせてみれば、大抵の食器類や万年筆、ネクタイなどに名入れをしてもらえるとのこと。そこで、お酒が大好きな父のために、江戸切子の細工が美しいグラスを母用とペアでプレゼントすることにしました。もちろん、それぞれのグラスにはさりげなく父・母の名前を入れてもらいました。
そして父が還暦を迎える月初めに、そのお祝いを持って久方ぶりに帰郷しました。還暦のお祝いを手渡す時には少々照れくさかったものの、想像以上に嬉しがる両親の様子を見て、改めてこれまでの感謝の思いが湧き出てきました。ネーム入りのグラスはとても好評でした。なにか特別なプレゼントにしたかった気持ちと、名入れも喜んでくれるかなという思いから選びましたが大正解でした。この世に二つとない素晴らしいプレゼントができて満足しています。

Remember Andy Beal ?
Now firmly back in his industry of expertise , he penned this letter in today ’s Wall Street Journal .
Read it and think .
To : Mr. Ben Bernanke
Please DON ” T PUT GARBAGE in the FEDERAL RESERVE
“ Dear Mr. Bernanke :
I was afraid that if simply wrote you this letter you might never see it .
I thought this message was important and worthy of effort to attract your attention .
I am sure that you are hearing from the Wall Street crowd about how stupid the marketplace is because the market wo n’t buy all the great loans that Wall Street has produced and how stupid or illiquid the market is because AAA RMBS are being offered at 60 cents on the dollar with no takers .
First mortgage synidcated bank loans are offered for 70 cents on the dollar and Wall Street simply cannot believe buyers are n’t standing in line to buy .
Consider for a moment that many corporate bonds are trading at premiums above par value .
How can this be ?
If the market is so stupid and there is no liquidity , who is buying those good corporate bonds at 105 cents on the dollar ??
Many AAA mortgage bonds are actually extremely high risk because of little - considered nuances in the hundreds of pages of trust indentures and servicing agreements .
In addition to widely understood mortgage default and other concerns , these contracts permit the loan servicers to advance payments on behalf of defaulted homeowners for years and years and years at interest rates of 12 % and more .
These “ servicer advancements ” put funds back into the trust to be paid out to junior security holders .
The “ servicer advances ” are subsequently repaid FIRST from foreclosed home sales .
Therefore , foreclosed home sales may result in little or no proceeds , or even a liability , to the AAAs .
This mechanism effectively transfers funds that really should belong to the AAA securities to junior securities .
Servicers that own junior securities are incredibly motivated to drag their feet resolving defaulted loans , which results in great loss to the AAA holders .
This is not a misprint : Defaulted first mortgage home loans may become a net liability , not an asset , to some of the AAAs .
This is still not widely understood .
Simlarly , “ first mortgage syndicated bank loans ” issued since about 2004 are routinely garbage and not traditional first mortgages on anything determinable at all .
Many , if not most , of these loans permit the borrowers to sell the collateral , keep the money , and reinvest in almost anything they want to , including stock , junk bonds , defaulted loans , or perhaps ice cream cones .
MAny , if not most , of these syndicated bank loans also permit UNLIMITED amounts of additional swap debt that is either senior to or of equal priority with the syndicated loan .
These provisions are also no widely understood and are sometimes even disguised in the loan documents .
Falling prices for these type assets reflect people finally reading the hundreds of pages of fine print , not a problem with the marketplace .
Prices should continue to fall as people wake up to the true nature of these assets .
Mant “ last out ” AAA RMBS are still overvalued at 60 % of par .
Many first mortgage syndicated bank loans are overvalued at 70 % of par .
Smart buyers wo n’t touch any of this garbage at any price remotely close to what it originally sold for .
The Fed may be walking on very slippery ground .
My fear is that the Fed has little more undersanding of the stench of the garbage than many of the current owners who bought all these debt instruments issued about 2004 .
Is the US Governmenttaking some of this garbage on its balance sheet as collateral for Federal Reserve loans ?
The AAA rating means absolutely nothing .
Garbage is garbage even in a fancy wrapper that the ratings agencies love .
I do not pretend to know how the Fed is collateralizing loans .
Perhaps I am naive in underestimating the insightfulness of the Feb , but many intelligent people were caught up in complacent decisions involving these assets .
I know nothing more than what I read in the media about collateral for these Fed loans , but it sure sounds troubling .
Sincerely ,
Andy Beal

LA Times :
The Supreme Court today dismissed a huge lawsuit growing out of the Enron debacle that sought to hold Wall Street bankers liable for scheming with the executives of the defunct Houston energy trader .
Lawyers for investment funds and pension plans , including the University of California 's pension plan , had sued Merrill Lynch and the other bankers , seeking to recover more than $ 30 billion that was lost when Enron folded in 2001 .
They argued that all the key players in the scheme that fooled stockholders should be forced to pay .
In dismissing the appeal of the Regents of the University of California vs. Merrill Lynch , the court appeared to doom the big lawsuits still pending against Enron 's bankers .
Today 's ruling is the most recent of a spate of decisions in which the courts have favored businesses .
Last week , the Supreme Court rejected the notion of " scheme liability " in a closely watched stock fraud case involving a cable TV company and its vendors .
In a 5 - 3 ruling , the court said suits for stock fraud are limited to the company that sells stock to the public , not bankers and other firms that had done deals with the company .
Muhammads Dead Poets Society
The assassinations of satirical poets in early Islam
James M. Arlandson
From the mainstream press , scholars , and Muslim spokespersons who have access to the media , we have heard that Islam is the religion of peace .
They point out that the three - letter root s-l-m is found both in Islam , which means surrender or submission ( to Allah ) , and salam , which means peace , soundness , and safety .
This etymology may be accurate , but it also serves merely as a positive advanced press release that covers up some problems .
For more information on the incongruity of the Arabic root s-l-m and Islam being the religion of peace , see this short article .
Upon reading the original source documents of Islam the Quran , hadith , biographies , and histories one is struck by the casual and matter - of - fact way that Muhammad and his Muslims traffic in violence and bloodshed .
Today , radical Muslims , reading these source documents , take up the call to violence that is found in the life and times of their prophet .
For example , in 1989 they issued a fatwa ( legal decree ) to assassinate Salman Rushdie , a novelist , who wrote Satanic Verses , which includes questions about the angel Gabriels role in inspiring the Quran .
Now the extremists in the highest levels in Iran have renewed the fatwa .
An article by David Harsanyi in Frontpagemag.com reports on deadly fatwas against Salman Rushdie , other authors , and even against Muslim clerics .
For example , Taslima Nasrin , a poet and novelist , whose works confront sharia and the role of women in society , particularly in Bangladesh , has had a fatwa on her head since 1993 .
She was met with violent protests for a scheduled speech in November 2002 at Concordia University in Canada , where Benjamin Netanyahu , former Prime Minister of Israel , also encountered violent protests .
Harsanyi cites another case .
" A Dutch Muslim woman , Ayaan Hirsi Ali , had to flee the Netherlands because she said that Muslim men traditionally oppressed Muslim women .
A death fatwa quickly followed . "
In November 2004 , Theo Van Gogh was assassinated by a Muslim because the descendant of the brother of the famous artist had made a film that depicted a Muslim woman who was forced into an arranged marriage , abused by her husband , and raped by her uncle .
Where do the violent radicals get the idea to put bounties on the heads of poets and authors ?
Out of thin air ?
One direction that the violence in earliest Islam took is the assassination of pagan men and women , many of whom were poets and storytellers , and at least one innocent bystander whose crime was being Jewish .
The poets wrote satirical poems about Muhammad and his claim to prophethood and about his followers , so the prophet ordered their death .
To borrow the title of a popular movie , Muhammad violently created a dead poets society of his own .
To explain how this kind of violence sits at the core of Islam at its founding , this article is divided into four parts .
First , the evidence for these assassinations is presented from Islamic early sources .
Second , after these facts are sketched out , we critique point by point the explanations and defense from Muslims for this violence .
Third , we examine five passages in the Quran that portend death in this life and damnation in the next for mockers .
Both the early Muslim sources and the Quran are used by violent fanatics to justify their assassinations .
Finally , we reach some conclusions about how violent early Islam is .
Islam is not the religion of peace .
Before laying out the evidence , the larger historical context of these assassinations must be taken into account .
First , in seventh - century Arabia , poetry was taken seriously ; even poetry contests were held , with declared winners .
It was a powerful way to communicate a message .
Second , in March 624 , in the Battle of Badr , Muhammad , living in Medina , won a surprising victory against a much - larger Meccan army of polytheists ( c. 320 Muslims v. 1000 Meccans ) .
Muhammads standing in Medina was insecure before the battle , but afterwards his position became strong , and he used his new strength to eliminate some enemies .
The Evidence
Though more assassinations are carried out than the ten analyzed in this article ( omitted because they involve leaders raising armies against or attempting assassinations of Muhammad ) , here follow the stories of assassinations or near - assassinations of lesser victims .
1. March 624 : Al - Nadr bin al - Harith
Before Muhammads Hijrah ( Emigration from Mecca to Medina in 622 ) , he used to sit in the assembly and invite the Meccans to Allah , citing the Quran and warning them of Gods punishment for mocking his prophets .
Al - Nadr would then follow him and speak about heroes and kings of Persia , saying , " By God , Muhammad cannot tell a better story than I , and his talk is only of old fables which he has copied as I have . "
Al - Nadr is referring to legends and opaque histories about Arabs of long ago and possibly to Bible stories about such figures as Noah , Abraham , Moses , and Jesus , which Muhammad told , but according to his own inaccurate versions .
On other days al - Nadr would interrupt Muhammad until the prophet silenced him .
In reply to al - Nadirs harassment , it is possible ( scholars sometimes have difficulties matching up Quranic verses with historical events ) that Allah sent down these verses to Muhammad concerning him or certainly other mockers in Mecca , according to the account of Ibn Abbas , Muhammads cousin , who is considered a reliable transmitter of traditions :
25:6 Say [ Prophet ] , " It was sent down by Him who knows the secrets of the heavens and earth .
He is all forgiving and merciful . "
( MAS Abdel Haleem , The Quran , Oxford UP , 2004 )
83:13 ... [ W ] hen Our revelations are recited to him , he says , " Ancient fables ! " 14 No indeed !
Their hearts are encrusted with what they have done .
15 No indeed !
On that day they will be screened off from their Lord , 16 they will burn in Hell , 17 and they will be told , " This is what you call a lie . " ( Haleem )
Muhammad did not take revenge on him not yeteven though the verses in Sura 83 promise a dismal eternal future for mockers .
Muhammads revenge was not long coming .
It was al - Nadirs bad fortune to join Meccas army , riding north to protect their caravan , which Muhammad attacked at the Battle of Badr in AD 624 .
The story - telling polytheist was captured , and on Muhammads return journey back to Medina , Ali , Muhammads son- in - law , at Muhammads order , beheaded him , instead of getting some possible ransom money .
He was one of two prisoners who were executed and not allowed to be ransomed by their clansall because they wrote poems and told stories critiquing Muhammad .

Reputable historians today consider Ibn Ishaq to be a good source of early Islam , though they may disagree on his chronology and miraculous elements .
2. March 624 : Uqba bin Abu Muayt
A similar story as that of al - Nadir can be told about Uqba .
He too harassed and mocked Muhammad in Mecca and wrote derogatory verses about him .
He too was captured during the Battle of Badr , and Muhammad ordered him to be executed .
" But who will look after my children , O Muhammad ? " Uqba cried with anguish .
" Hell , " retorted the prophet coldly .
Then the sword of one of his followers cut through Uqbas neck .

Bukhari and Muslim are reliable collectors and editors of the hadith ( words and deeds of Muhammad outside of the Quran ) .
These three passages from the hadith depict Muhammad calling on Allah for revenge on this poet .
3. March 624 : Asma bint Marwan
Asma was a poetess who belonged to a tribe of Medinan pagans , and whose husband was named Yazid b. Zayd .
She composed a poem blaming the Medinan pagans for obeying a stranger ( Muhammad ) and for not taking the initiative to attack him by surprise .
When the Allah - inspired prophet heard what she had said , he asked , " Who will rid me of Marwans daughter ? "
A member of her husbands tribe volunteered and crept into her house that night .
She had five children , and the youngest was sleeping at her breast .
The assassin gently removed the child , drew his sword , and plunged it into her , killing her in her sleep .
The following morning , the assassin defied anyone to take revenge .
No one took him up on his challenge , not even her husband .
In fact , Islam became powerful among his tribe .
Previously , some members who had kept their conversion secret now became Muslims openly , " because they saw the power of Islam , " conjectures Ibn Ishaq .
Source : Ibn Ishaq , pp. 675-76 / 995-96 .
4. April 624 : Abu Afak
Abu Afak , an centenarian elder of Medina , belonging to a group of clans who were associated with the god Manat ( though another account has him as a Jew ) , wrote a derogatory poem about Muhammad , extolling the ancestors of his tribe who were strong enough to overthrow mountains and to resist submitting to an outsider ( Muhammad ) who divides two large Medinan tribes with religious commands like " permitted " and " forbidden . "
That is , the poet is referring to Muhammads legal decrees about things that are forbidden ( e.g. pork and alcohol ) and permitted ( e.g. other meats like beef and camel ) .
Before the Battle of Badr , Muhammad let him live .
After the battle , the prophet queried , " Who will deal with this rascal for me ? "
That night , Salim b. Umayr " went forth and killed him . "
One of the Muslims wrote a poem in reply : " A hanif [ monotheist or Muslim ] gave you a thrust in the night saying /  Take that Abu Afak in spite of your age !  "
Muhammad eliminated him , which shows religious violence .
Islam is not the religion of peace .
Source : Ibn Ishaq p. 675 / 995 .
5. September 624 : Kab bin al - Ashraf
Kab b. al - Ashraf had a mixed ancestry .
His father came from a nomadic Arab , but his mother was a Jewess from the powerful al - Nadr tribe in Medina .
He lived as a member of his mothers tribe .
He heard about the Muslim victory at the battle of Badr , and he was disgusted , for he thought Muhammad the newcomer to Medina was a trouble - maker and divisive .
Kab had the gift of poetry , and after the Battle of Badr he traveled down to Mecca , apparently stopping by Badr , since it was near a major trade route to Mecca , witnessing the aftermath .
Arriving in Mecca , he wrote a widely circulated poem , a hostile lament , over the dead of Mecca .
It is important to include most of the political lament to show whether the poem is a serious offence , meriting assassination , as Muslim apologists ( defenders of Islam ) argue .
...
At events like Badr you should weep and cry .
The best of its people were slain round cisterns ,
Dont think it strange that the princes were left lying .
How many noble handsome men ,
The refuge of the homeless were slain .
... ..
Some people whose anger pleases me say ,
" Kab b. al - Ashraf is utterly dejected . "
They are right .
O that the earth when they were killed
Had split asunder and engulfed its people ,
That he who spread the report had been thrust through
Or lived cowering blind and deaf .
.. I was told that al - Harith ibn Hisham [ a Meccan ]
Is doing well and gathering troops
To visit Yathrib [ pre - Islamic name of Medina ] with armies ,
For only the noble , handsome man protects the loftiest reputation .
( Translated by Guillaume , p. 365 )
To us today this poem does not seem excessive , and other Arab poetry was worse , such as the poem celebrating the assassination of Abu Afak , cited above ( no. 4 ) .
It seems to be a genuine lament that invokes the Arab concept of revenge .
Also , the last four lines is not an explicit plea for the Meccans to exact vengeance because that was a foregone conclusion .
Arab custom demanded a riposte against the humiliation of defeat .
Rather , the lines seem to reflect reality .
A Meccan leader is said to be gathering an army ; Kab is not ordering him to do so .
Pro-Muslim poets answered Kabs poem with ones of their own , and that was enough for his hosts in Mecca to turn him out .
He returned to Medina , writing some amatory verses about Muslim women , a mistake compounded on a mistake , given the tense climate in Medina and Muhammads victory at Badr .
For example , right after the battle Muhammad assembled a Jewish tribe , the Qaynuqa , and warned them as follows : " O Jews , beware lest God bring upon you the vengeance that He brought upon Quraysh [ large Meccan tribe at Badr ] , and become Muslims . " ...
In late spring ( April - June ) Muhammad then expelled the Jewish tribe .
Angered by the poems and now able to strike back after Badr and the exile , Muhammad had had enough .
He asked , " Who would rid me of [ Kab ] ? "
Five Muslims volunteered , one of whom was Kabs foster - brother named Abu Naila .
They informed him , " O apostle of God [ Muhammad ] , we shall have to tell lies . "
He answered , " Say what you like , for you are free in the matter . "
They set upon a clever plan .
Abu Naila and another conspirator visited Kab , and they cited poetry together , the three appreciating the art , and chatted leisurely , so the two would not raise suspicions of their conspiracy .
Then , after a long time , Abu - Naila lied just as he said he would .
He said he was tired of Muhammad because " he was a very great trial for us . "
Muhammad provoked the hostility of the Arabs , and they were all in league against the Medinans .
Abu Naila complained that the roads had become impassable and trade was hampered , so that their families were in want , privation , and great distress .
Kab , in effect , said to his foster brother , " I told you so . "
Then the foster - brother asked him for a loan of a camel load or two of food .
Kab agreed , but only on the collateral of Abu - Nailas sons .
The foster - brother refused , and Kab asked for his women , but he again refused .
Finally , Abu Naila offered his and his conspirators weapons .
That arrangement provided the cover they needed to carry weapons right into Kabs presence without alarm .
Kab agreed , " Weapons are a good pledge . "
The two visitors departed , stopped by the other three , and told them of the plan .
Not long afterwards , gathering their weapons , they went to Muhammad , who sent them off with this wish : " Go in Gods name ; O God , help them . "
They set out under a moonlit night until they made it to a fortress , one of several that the Jewish tribe had built in the rough environment of Arabia .
In fact , the ruin of the fortress where Kab resided can be seen even today near Medina .
They called out to him .
Kab had recently married , and his wife , hearing their yells , said , " You are at war , and those who are at war do not go out at this hour ... I hear evil [ or blood ] in his voice . "
But the custom of hospitality in the Arab world was strong .
Her husband told her that they were only his foster - brother and his foster - brothers partners , adding that " a generous man should respond to a call at night , even if invited to be killed . "
Kab came down and greeted them .
Abu Naila suggested they go for a walk .
The signal to kill was as follows : Abu Naila would run his hand through Kabs hair , complimenting him on his perfume , three times .
This he did , yelling , " Smite the enemy of God ! "
Kab mounted a strong defense , so their swords were ineffective .
Finally , one of the conspirators remembered his dagger , stabbed Kab in the belly , and then bore it down until it reached Kabs genitals , killing him .
They made it back to Muhammad , but only after difficulty , since in the dark they had wounded one of their own .
They saluted the prophet as he stood praying , and he came out to them .
They told him that the mission was accomplished .
He spat on their comrades wound , and they returned to their families .
Their attack on Kab sent shock waves into the Jewish community , so that " there was no Jew in Medina who did not fear for his life , " reports Ibn Ishaq .
Muslim historian Tabari reports that the five Muslim thugs severed Kabs head and brought it to Muhammad .
How can the terrorists who are also thrilled to sever heads not be inspired by early Islam ?

Reputable historians today consider Tabari to be a good source of data on early Islam , though they may not agree on his chronology or miraculous elements .
6. September (? ) 624 : Ibn Sunayna
It is on the heels of this assassination that Ibn Sunayna , a Jewish merchant , was assassinated .
With the success of the five conspirators , Muhammad said , " Kill any Jew that falls into your power . "
Shortly afterwards , Muhayyisa b. Masud leapt upon and killed Ibn Sunayna , with whom Muhayyisa had some social and business relations .
However , Muhayyisas elder brother , not a Muslim at the time , beat the assassin , the younger brother , saying , " You enemy of God , did you kill him when much of the fat on your belly comes from his wealth ? "
Muhayyisa retorted that if Muhammad had ordered even the elder brothers assassination , he would have carried it out .
The elder was impressed : " By God , a religion which can bring you to this is marvelous ! "
And he became a Muslim .
That is , the elder brother implies that Muhammad must be a great leader and worthy of devotion if he commands such lethal reverence and deadly obedience from his followers .
Then Muhayyisa wrote a poem that celebrates such obedience .
" I would smite his [ the elder brothers ] neck with a sharp sword , / A blade as white as salt from polishing .
/
My downward stroke never misses its mark . "
Advancing religious violence , these lines in the poem show how deadly poetry could be , and they match the Muslims poem against Abu Afak ( no. 4 , above ) : " a hanif gave you a thrust in the night . "
Kabs poem , it should be recalled , was far milder .
These poems that a Westerner reads in the early Islamic source are jarring .
It seems the early Muslim authors of the documents relish inserting them into their books .

7. July - August 625 : A One-eyed Bedouin
In revenge for an ambush on some Muslim missionaries , Muhammad sent Amr bin Umayya and a companion to assassinate Abu Sufyan , a leader of the Meccans .
This shows that the prophet could get caught up in the cycle of violence that went on endlessly in seventh - century Arab culture .
Umayyah failed in his attempt , and he had to flee under pursuit , hiding in a cave , murdering a man named Ibn Malik along the way .
As the pursuit was dying down , a tall , one - eyed , unnamed Bedouin entered the cave , driving some sheep .
Umayyah and the Bedouin introduced each other .
After they settled down , the shepherd sang a simple two - line song in defiance of Muslims and Islam :
I will not be a Muslim as long as I live ,
And will not believe in the faith of the Muslims .
( Watt )
Another translation reads :
I wont be a Muslim as long as I live ,
Nor heed to their religion give .
( Guillaume )
Unfortunately for this Bedouin , he was in the cave with a radical Muslim , who said : " You will soon see ! "
The Bedouin fell asleep , snoring .
Umayyah recounts what he did : ... " I went to him and killed him in the most dreadful way that anybody has ever been killed .
I leaned over him , stuck the end of my bow into his good eye , and thrust it down until it came out of the back of his neck . "
He fled back to Muhammad , who said , " Well done ! "
The account ends :
The prophet " prayed for me [ Umayyah ] to be blessed . "
This poor shepherds only sin was to compose a little two - line ditty against Islam .
Therefore , he was assassinated , with the blessing of Muhammad the prophet did not arrest the assassin or even scold him for killing a man who had nothing to do with the ambush .

8. After January 630 : close call for Abdullah bin Sad
Before 10,000 Muslim warriors entered Mecca in January 630 , Muhammad ordered that they should kill only those who resisted , except a small number who should be hunted down even if they hid under the curtain of the Kabah stone .
One of them was Abdullah , an original Emigrant with the prophet in 622 .
He had the high privilege of writing down some verses of the Quran , after Muhammad received them by revelation .
Doubting , Abdullah on occasion would change the words around to see if Muhammad had noticed the changes , but he did not .
W. Montgomery Watt provides an example : " When Muhammad dictated a phrase of the Quran such as sami alim ,  Hearing , Knowing  ( with reference to God ) , he had written , for example , alim hakim  Knowing , Wise ,  and Muhammad had not noticed the change " ... ( Muhammad at Medina , Oxford UP , 1956 , p. 68 ) .
Abdullah therefore disbelieved Muhammads inspiration and apostatized ( left Islam ) and returned to Mecca a polytheist .
However , his foster - brother was Uthman b. Affan , one of Muhammads Companions , who hid Abdullah until calm settled on conquered Mecca and who interceded for Abdullah , in the presence of Muhammad .
The prophet waited a long time before he granted the repentant apostate immunity .
After Uthman left , Muhammad said to those sitting around him : " I kept silent so that one of you might get up and strike off his head ! "
One of them asked why Muhammad did not give them a signal .
He answered that a prophet does not kill by pointing .
Though Abdullah escaped with his life , this story is included because it reveals Muhammads attitude toward apostates , because of the doubt of one of Muhammads followers — a literate scholar who was involved in writing down the revelations , and because Muhammads anger could be assuaged under the right conditions .

9. After January 630 : One of Abdullah bin Katals two singing - girls
On the list of those excluded from amnesty after the conquest of Mecca was not only Abdullah b. Katal , collector of legal alms , who had killed his slave for incompetence , apostatized , and took the money back to Mecca , but also his two singing - girls who sang satirical verses about Muhammad , which Abdullah had composed .
He was killed , even though he was clinging to the curtain of the Kabah shrine .
And one of the girls was also killed , but the other ran away until she asked for pardon from Muhammad , who forgave her .

10 . After February 630 : close call for Kab bin Zuhayr
Confident with the victory over Mecca , Muhammad returned to Medina a hero and firmly in charge of the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula .
In this context we come to another poet who satirized Muhammad and the Muslims , Kab bin Zuhayr ( called Zuhayr to distinguish him from Kab bin al - Ashraf , above , no . 5 ) . Zuhayrs brother wrote him that Muhammad had killed a number of satirical poets during his conquest of Mecca , but that the prophet would forgive a poet who came to him in repentance , which really means becoming a Muslim .
His brother told him that the poets who were left had fled in all directions .
" If you have any use for your life , then come to the apostle [ Muhammad ] quickly , for he does not kill anyone who comes to him in repentance , " wrote the brother , continuing : " if you do not do that , then get to a safe place . "
However , Zuhayr responded with a poem that says their fathers and father had never held Islam dear , so why should he change ?
His brother replied with a poem of warning of his own ; if he would not repent , then Zuhayr will be guilty on Judgment Day .
Poetry penetrated deeply in Arab culture , and , receiving the letter , Zuhayr was distressed until finally he gave in .
Finding no way out , he wrote a letter extolling Muhammad .
Soon afterwards , he traveled up to Medina to ask for security as a Muslim .
Muhammad was saying his morning prayers , and a friend took Zuhayr into Muhammads presence .
" Would you accept him as such if he came to you ? " his friend asked .
The prophet said he would .
One of the Ansars ( or helpers : native Medinans who offered help to Muhammad after his Hijrah ) leaped upon Zuhayr and asked the prophet if he could behead the enemy of God , for some of Zuhayrs verses mocked the Ansars , too .
The apostle said to leave him alone , for Zuhayr was breaking free from his past .
The implication is clear : if Muhammad had caught Zuhayr before his repentance , Muhammad would have allowed him to be beheaded .
Either he converts or he dies for writing derogatory poetry .
What is remarkable about the anecdote is how the morning prayer provides the setting for a Muslim leaping on a poet and threatening to cut his head off , as if this is an ordinary day and act .

Defense and Challenges
From all of these stories it should be clear that the accounts about assassinations are jarring to the reader expecting to find the religion of peace .
It is a matter of course that Muslims and some Western scholars or Islamophiles would be anxious to explain these circumstances in a favorable light .
Their defense usually takes six lines of argument .
Our analysis follows each defense .
First , reputable scholars remind us of the brutality of Arab culture .
When a stranger or enemy in this culture was left unprotected outside of a tribe , he or she was vulnerable to attack and murder .
Who could take revenge ?
Blood feud was never ignited .
Thus , the only check on violence in this culture is revenge or more violence , when adequate law courts and law enforcement did not exist , as they did , say , in the Roman Empire .
Muhammad was therefore only following Arab culture ( Watt , Muhammad : Prophet and Statesmen , ( Oxford UP , 1961 ) , pp. 128-30 ) .
On the surface , this seems to be a reasonable explanation .
Muhammad was a man of his own times and region .
However , at bottom , it is disappointing that a Gabriel - inspired prophet would not or could not rise above his culture , especially above the questionable custom of assassination .
Most importantly , it seems that many Muslims today look to his example , and this lands Islam in interpretative difficulties as seen in the fatwas against various authors today .
How are Muslims today , especially those with a radical bent , supposed to interpret Muhammads willingness to eliminate opponents and slanderers ?
Again , one would hope that a prophet would rise above the dubious customs like blood feuds , rife in his own culture .
But he did not , and one of his dubious qualities was his deft handling of blood feuds and sizing up opponents based on their strength or weakness .
That is why the assassinations did not take place before the Battle of Badr in 624 when his stance in Medina was less secure , but after the battle , when he was strong , and after the conquest of Mecca in 630 , along with Battles at Hunayn and Taif , a little later .
It is true that the victims listed in this article belonged to tribes that should have taken revenge , but evidently they were too weak to do so .
Muhammad was wise in his calculations .
For information on Muhammads various other questionable actions , visit this online booklet from an older generation Christian .
He has a section on assassinations as well .
Second , Muslim apologists ( defenders of Islam ) take seriously the assassination of Kab bin al - Ashraf ( no. 5 , above ) because reliable hadith treat of him at length .
Maulana Muhammad
Ali , though a member of the Ahmadiyyah sect , which is considered a heresy , is mentioned here because he defends his prophet thoroughly , pointing out that Kab was a combatant and an enemy leader of the Jews ( Muhammad the Prophet , 7th ed. , 1993 , pp. 202-06 ) .
Also , another Muslim scholar says that since Kab was willing to take his foster - brothers sons and women as collateral , he had a wicked heart and deserved his death ( Abdul Hamid Siddiqi , trans. of Sahih Muslim , 3:990 , note 2269 ) .
Neither was he willing to commit his crime openly , but secretly , so he had to be assassinated secretly .
But secret assassination is an exception in Islam , says Sayyid Abul ALa Maududi ( referenced in Siddiqi , 3:991 , note 2272 ) .
Still another commentator says that he led a large contingency of horsemen ( forty ?
two to three hundred ?
The estimates vary ) to Mecca ( so much for the secrecy ) , presumably to provoke the Meccans to avenge their loss at Badr , as if they needed this one man and his posse to do that ( Razi , referenced in Maulana Alis commentary on Sura 59:2 ) .
In reply , however , the magnification of Kabs crime is questionable .
But even if it is admitted that Kab was an unsavory character who used bad judgment with his insulting poetry , and even though he was living in the hostile environment of Medina , he was not a formal combatant in a battle .
His wifes observation that the tribes were at war reflects the tension between the Jews and the growing Muslim community .
Instead , he seems to have lived in a " gray " area between his mothers Jewish tribe and his fathers distant nomadic tribe , and Muhammad correctly judged he was weak enough to be assassinated .
As to Kabs wicked heart and his secret crimes , Muhammad could have expelled him for wickedness ( see Sura 5:33 ) .
And his poetry was circulated widely ; it was not a secret .
His living in a fortress near Medina was not so secret that the five assassins could not find him .
Finally , did he openly , not secretly , lead a band of forty or hundreds of horsemen in an age when horses were costly , thereby indicating Kabs power and leadership of a Jewish tribe ?
Answer : neither Bukhari nor Muslim reports this .
Succinctly put , despite all of these unusual and conflicting explanations , it just seems more likely that Muhammad was simply following Arab culture and eliminated an opponent who was vulnerable after the Battle of Badr , simply for writing derogatory poetry .
Ockhams razor cuts out needless explanations .
Third , one scholar says that the Muslim community in Medina , even after Badr , was still weak , so Muhammad was forced to take a hard line against mockers and enemies ( as he perceived them ) , just to survive .
This scholar uses language like " oppression " and " persecution " and " conspiracy , " which came from both the Jewish and pagan communities in Medina .
However , Muhammad did not see himself as so weak that he would not carry out the assassinations .
It should be recalled that Asma bint Marwan ( no. 3 ) , Abu Afak ( no. 4 ) , and Kab ( no. 5 ) belonged to tribes , but they could not carry out the required custom of blood feud : revenge .
Therefore , Muhammad correctly discerned their weakness and his strength and followed the Arab custom of assassination .
Most importantly , Muslim apologists ( defenders of Islam ) must step back and look at the big picture .
It was Muhammad who attacked the Meccan caravans six times without provocation and without self - defense in the first year and a half or so after moving to Medina .
( For more information , go to this article and scroll down to reason no. four ) .
It is the Allah - inspired prophet who went west seventy to eighty miles ( a two to three day journey ) to the wells of Badr in order to attack the Meccan caravan coming from the north , wanting only the unarmed band , that is , the large caravan loaded with goods ( Sura 8:7 ) .
To judge from the big picture , it was Muhammad who settled in Medina and stirred up trouble .
If Muhammad had stayed within Medina and expanded his message by preaching alone , then no military or political trouble would have erupted .
True , people would have resisted his message , but if it had something to offer people , it could have still grown .
True , people may have attempted to assassinate him , but he had a bodyguard .
We see this growth by proclamation alone in the message of Jesus , who drew big crowds when he preached and healed and worked miracles and eventually purposing to die on the cross for the sins of the world .
He did not assassinate people , even though he met with resistance from religious leaders ( see more on this below ) .
The growth of the true kingdom of God by peaceful means implies that God was backing this message .
In contrast , the growth of Muhammads message with an army always lurking in the background implies that God was not backing this message and that Islam was unattractive and unacceptable to many listeners , as seen , for example , in the revolt of the Arab tribes after Muhammad died of a fever in AD 632 .
Abu Bakr , Muhammads successor , took two years to suppress these revolts militarily and to force the tribes to re-join Islam .
Fourth , one Muslim scholar argues in regards to Kab ( and the same could apply to the other poets ) that Kab insulted the Head of an Islamic State ( Muhammad ) and the State itself .
The Head could not allow immoral poetry , which drags the honor of Arab women " into the mire , " and the Head could not allow political poetry that insults the Head and instigates the enemies of the State ( Siddiqi 3:991 , note 2269 ) .
In other words , Kab ( and the others ) deserved what he ( and they ) got .
The tact of this scholar goes in the opposite direction from the third explanation .
Early Islam was not fragile , but strong .
It was not a community growing in power in a city with competing tribes and interests .
However , this analysis is questionable , for at this stage in early Islam Muhammad was still feeling his way .
But even if this explanation were true , the question still remains : did the Head of State have to assassinate , regardless of how seriously Arab culture took poetry ?
He had banishment at his disposal ( Sura 5:33 ) , which he applied to the Jewish Qaynuqa tribe .
After all , Muhammad employed poets to counter his enemies , but apparently his enemies did not have the power to assassinate or to banish Muhammad or his poets .
Moreover , Muhammads policy , if coming from a strong State , only gives permission to the extremists in Islam today to attack weak dissidents and satirists .
If Muhammad did it , why can not the extremists follow his example ?
Those who issue deadly fatwas are doing just that .
Fifth , Muslim apologists generally recount the atrocities perpetrated in and by the Western world , sometimes committed in the name of Christianity , so who are Christians or Westerners ( the two are not identical ) to complain ?
But this comparison is uneven and unfair .
A better comparison is made between the earliest stage of Islam , during the life of Muhammad , and the earliest stage of Christianity , during the life of Christ .
And then the similarities break down completely .
At no time did Jesus behead or assassinate or even wish for the beheading or assassination of his opponents , many of whom mocked or challenged him face - to - face .
Maybe this is why Christianity turned the world upside down for the first three centuries without warfare Constantine comes around in the fourth century and does not set the genetic code for Christianity , nor do the Medieval Crusades , especially not .
The sixth and final line of defense questions the reliability of the early traditions that narrate these anecdotes .
As noted , only the narrative about Kab in our article is discussed at length in the most reliable hadith , that of Bukhari and Muslim .
Therefore , one Muslim scholar dismisses every tradition except Kabs ( Maulana Muhammad Ali , pp. 202-06 ) , whereas one conservative biographer accepts other narratives , such as the assassinations of Asma ( no. 3 ) and Abu Afak ( no . 4 ) ( Muhammad Haykal , The Life of Muhammad , 8th ed. , trans .
Ismail Raji al - Faruqi , 1935 , 2002 , p. 243 ) .
In Maulana Alis case , along with this dismissal comes the presupposition that since Islam is the religion of peace , a prophet like Muhammad would never assassinate poets , singing - girls and an innocent Jewish bystander .
Ali then quotes passages from the Quran or the hadith that says old men and women should not be killed .
This kind of reasoning is shaky because it has a holy book determining historical events .
This attitude can be expressed simply in an if - then argument :
(1) If A , then B .
If early Islam were the religion of peace , then Muhammad would never order the assassination of poets , poetesses , singing - girls , and an innocent Jewish bystander . ( 2 ) A obtains .
Islam was the religion of peace ( The Quran and hadith say so ) .
( 3 ) So does B .
Therefore , he would never order their assassinations ( and never did ) .
This unspoken logic lurks behind the desire to find extraordinary crimes in Kabs behavior ( see the second defense , above ) .
Surely this is how Muslims today must eliminate the violence that jars any reasonable Muslim .
But does the evidence support this logic ?
This article demonstrates that the evidence does not support this dubious reasoning .
However , though it is difficult to believe that all of these stories coming from pro-Muslim sources are fabrications , let us assume only for the sake of argument that all of these stories , even Kabs , are fictitious and should be dismissed .
Even if they are all fictions and regardless of the motives behind the logic of the Muslim apologists , this question still needs to be asked about the earliest stage of Islam , during Muhammads life :
What is it about Islam at that time that would produce such stories of assassinations for the crime of composing insulting poetry and of being Jewish ?
The authors of such " fictions " seem eager to write them up .
After all , fictions were invented about Jesus , but they do not involve assassinations that are situated in non-miraculous social contexts which therefore aim at giving the assassinations a ring of historical accuracy or plausibility all of which are true in Muhammads case .
Rather , the fictions are usually outlandish miracles , such as Jesus as a baby in a cradle , speaking like an adult , or Jesus as a young boy making birds out of clay , breathing into them , and causing them to fly away ( two fictions that Muhammad incorporated into the inerrant Quran ; see 19:29 - 34 and 3:49 ) .
It is true that the anti-Semitic Infancy Gospel of Thomas ( where , incidentally , is found the clay birds episode ) has the child Jesus cursing a Jewish teacher who then died .
Yet , the social context of this myth is supernatural and concerns Jesus childhood , on which canonical and historical accounts are mostly silent .
On the other hand , Muhammads assassinations are set in non-miraculous social contexts and not during his childhood , about which the early Islamic records are largely silent .
Moreover , they are attested in Bukharis reliable hadith .
In contrast to these legends about Jesus , the culture of first - century Israel saw the assassinations of politicians and other harsh punishments like crucifixion .
But the real Jesus handled an angry crowd who threatened to throw him off a cliff by simply walking out of trouble confidently and going on his way ( Luke 4:28 - 29 ) .
Thus , Jesus did not promote or use violence to fulfill his own political agenda .
Nor did he endorse , for example , the amputation of hands or feet or stoning for any sin whatsoever , and Paul suggests that a thief should work with his hands , not get his hands cut off ( Ephesians 4:28 ) ; in fact Jesus stopped the imminent stoning of an adulteress ( John 8:1 - 11 ) .
Thus , the known message and life of Jesus did not include assassinations and other punishments , so an inventor of such extreme legends would have been laughed out of court .
In Muhammads own life and times , beheadings and assassinations of weak opponents , as noted in the first defense , above , were part of the social environment .
More important , reliable hadith show beyond all doubt that Muhammad practiced amputations for theft , enshrined in the Quran ( Sura 5:38 ) , stoning for adultery in the hadith , which also reliably reports Kabs and a Jewish leaders assassinations , not mentioned in this article .
Thus , we see a coinciding of the facts of Muhammads harsh culture and his known harsh practices , unlike the situation with Jesus , who did not have harsh practices , though he lived in a harsh culture .
The life and message of the two Founders differ widely , so the legends about them differ widely though in Muhammads case these legends are not fictitious .
It is clear , then , that Jesus rose above his violent culture , whereas Muhammad did not .
Jesus trusted in God , but Muhammad took matters into his own hand and killed his enemies and opponents stealthily .
Indeed , reputable historians accept the historicity of most of the assassinations cited in this article .
That is , in all probability Muhammad did in fact assassinate enemies of Islam , even for the crime of composing insulting poetry .
After all , the numerous stories come from pro-Muslim early sources that seem eager to portray Muhammad as ordering assassinations .
More importantly , this debate is academic .
Should we doubt whether the violent radicals today accept the early assassinations as historical ?
What does the prophets example communicate to these radicals who feel holy as they apply seventh - century Arabian customs to the twenty - first century world ?
It seems the terrorists and assassins are terrorized by this logic :
(4) If A , then B .
If early Islam were the religion of peace , then Muhammad would never order the assassination of poets , poetesses , singing - girls , and an innocent Jewish bystander .
( 5 ) Not - B. But Muhammad did order their assassinations .
( Historical reality says so . ) ( 6 ) Therefore , not - A . Therefore , early Islam was not the religion of peace .
To counter this logic and the jarring aspect of early Islamic violence , terrorist - assassins must remain with ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) , above , regardless of the evidence and the cost that truth must pay .
Allah had to have guided Muhammad perfectly , so , to be obedient , they now have to follow or are permitted to follow in Muhammads footsteps and carry out assassinations of authors and filmmakers ( see below ) today for the sin of blasphemy .
Early Islam inspires them .
Allah wills it .
It never occurs to them that Allah did not guide Muhammad perfectly and that Islam is not the religion of peace ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) ; that would be too jarring .
The violent radicals , instead , appeal to a higher source than the hadith the Quran itself .
Dark Inspiration from the Quran
Does the Quran assert that insulters and mockers should not be touched , killed , or condemned to hell ?
We analyze five passages in chronological order , not textual order .
After the Battle of Uhud in March 625 , which the Muslims lost , Muhammad was stung .
He and his Muslim community suffered a loss of prestige , though the community did not crumble , but quickly recovered and grew , so the loss was not material .
In this verse about undergoing insults from the People of the Book ( Jews , mostly , in Medina at this time ) , Muhammad has to take the path of humility .
3:186 You [ Muhammad ] are sure to be tested through your possessions and persons ; you are sure to hear much that is hurtful [ aa- dh - aa ] from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with God [ polytheists ] .
If you are steadfast and mindful of God , that is the best course .
( Haleem )
The word " hurtful " is the same Arabic word ( three - letter root is aa- dh - aa ) that has been translated , below , as " annoy " and " insult . "
It has the semantic range of hurt , suffer , damage , injure , or harm .
" The word ... signifies a slight evil ... or anything causing a slight harm " ( Abdul Mannan Omar , ed. , Dictionary of the Holy Quran , Noor Foundation , 2003 , p. 19 ) .
Fakhry translates the key word in this verse as " abuse " ( An Interpretation of the Quran , NYUP , 2000 , 2004 ) .
Allah tells his prophet that he has to take the insults , not retaliate .
Historically , Muhammad was momentarily too weak to retaliate against insults after the Battle of Uhud .
But Allah reveals that if he is patient , then he will find a great strength .
Indeed , he exiled the Jewish tribe of an - Nadir in August of that year and the Jewish tribe Qurayza after the Battle of the Trench in AD 627 .
After the Battle of the Trench in 627 , Muhammads power , though always growing , increases exponentially in Medina , even more so than after the Battle of Badr in 624 ; therefore Allah sends down Sura 33 in the context of the Trench .
In fact , we find in this sura that Muhammad is so powerful that he lays seize to the Jewish strongholds in Medina , captures them , decapitates 600 male Jews of the Qurayzah tribe , enslaves its women and children , though he keeps a beautiful Jewess for himself , and confiscates all of their property , which is considerable ( 33:26 - 27 ) .
After this great victory and confiscation , Muhammad is wealthier than ever .
So Aisha and Hafsa and Muhammads other wives approach their husband to ask for more money .
Miffed , Muhammad gives all of them the option to depart or to remain with him and be content with their allowance .
He separates himself from them for twenty - nine days , and afterwards they decide to remain with him ( 33:33 - 28 ) .
Next , he issues an edict that gives him special permission to marry Zainab , the wife of his adopted son Zaid .
Arab culture forbad men from marrying the wives of their sons , but Muhammad claimed that Zaid was merely his adopted son ; besides , Allah told him his desire was legitimate ( 33:35 - 40 ) .
Thus , it is in the context of Muhammads rising power and wealth , atrocity against the Jews , and new laws about marriage and the behavior of women that these verses were received in Surah 33 :
33:57 Those who insult [ aa- dh - aa ]
God and His Messenger will be rejected by God in this world and the next 
He has prepared a humiliating punishment for them 
58 and those who undeservedly insult [ aa- dh - aa ] believing men and women will bear the guilt of slander and obvious sin .
( Haleem )
Muslim scholars agree that the Arabic word includes false reports .
So Muhammad was advocating eternal damnation for merely annoying the prophet and his Muslims , the " believing men and women , " and for lying insults .
Then the sura continues with commands to Muhammads wives to wear veils so that the insults will stop .
But he also promises the insulting liars conquest and death ( v. 61 ) , which seems to echo the atrocity committed against the Jewish Qurayzah tribe .
33:59 Prophet , tell your wives your daughters , and women believers to make their outer garment hang low over them , so as to be recognized and not insulted [ aa- dh - aa ] :
God is most forgiving , most merciful .
60 If the hypocrites , the sick of heart , and those who spread lies in the city { Medina ] do not desist , We shall arouse you [ Prophet ] against them , and then they will only be your neighbors in this city for a short while .
61 They will be rejected wherever they are found , and then seized and killed .
( Haleem )
This passage is stark .
We find Muhammad laying down the law for all the Muslim women so that no false rumors can grow they must wear veils .
The phrase " sick of heart " is understood by Muslim commentators like Maulana Ali and Hilali and Khan as those who have excessive sexual desire , so the women must cover up .
Regardless , the class of rumor - mongers , " those who spread lies , " is subjected to the harshest warning .
If they do not desist , they will not only be exiled , but also find no rest wherever they go .
Then they will be " seized and killed , " as the Qurayza tribe was .
These verses , though received in 627 , predict nicely what will happen to the satirical poets during the conquest of Mecca in 630 , for they spread lies and insult the honor of Muslim women and Muhammad himself .
David Harsanyi , in the article for Frontpagemag.com referenced in the introduction to this article , reports on a Muslim riot provoked by an observation made by fashion journalist Isioma Daniel in the Nigerian newspaper This Day , in November 2002 , in defense of the Miss World pageant held in Nigeria .
She observed that perhaps Muhammad would have chosen one of the beautiful contestants for one of his wives .
" A direct result of what was at worst a thoughtless remark in a fashion column has directly led to the deaths of 200 people with another 500 injured in Nigeria during four days of rioting and mob violence , " writes Harsanyi .
Harsanyis article continues .
Do the violent radicals use the Quran to justify their actions ?
They did against Ms. Daniel :
What we are saying is that the Holy Koran has clearly stated that whoever insults the Prophet of Islam , Muhammad , should be killed , " said Zamfara State Commissioner for Information , Umar Dangaladima Magaji .
The New Nigerian newspaper said the fatwa had been issued by Zamfaras Deputy Governor Mamuda Aliyu Dallatun Shinkafi , who compared Daniel to Rushdie : " Like Salman Rushdie , the blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed . "
Thus , the State Commissioner for Information , not an anonymous killer who can hide in the shadows , asserts that the Quran supports the actions of the Muslims , and the Deputy Governor published the fatwa in the newspaper and over the radio so that a Muslim mob could take matters into its own hand and kill anyone who looks like a Christian , as the BBC reported , according to Harsanyi .
Finally , in Sura 9 , Muhammads power is complete , especially in the last two - thirds of the sura , which deals with the expedition to Tabuk ( in the far north of Saudi Arabia today ) in late 630 .
The hypocrites in Islam are the lukewarm Muslims who circle just outside of Islam , watching the fortunes of the community , whether they rise and stay prosperous .
They do not follow the prophet when he cracks the whip ; indeed , they backed away from following him to Tabuk because of the expense , the harvest season , and the heat ( Sura 9:81 - 83 ) .
Muhammad could not tolerate such wishy - washy behavior , since he planned to expand northward even after Tabuk .
Watt is reasonable when he observes : " ... if the Islamic community was to engage in expeditions into Syria [ the far north in the Byzantine Empire ] which would involve the absence of most of the fighting men for long periods , it could not allow a body of dissidents to ensconce themselves in the suburbs of Medina " ( Muhammad at Medina , p. 190 ) .
So it is in this context that Muhammad receives these verses about insults and mockery and jokes from hypocrites .
9:61 There are others who insult [ aa- dh - aa ] the Prophet by saying , " He will listen to anything . "
[ Muhammad , ]
Say , " He listens for your own good " ...
An agonizing torment awaits those who insult [ aa- dh - aa ] Gods Messenger ... 63
Do they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger will go to the Fire of Hell and stay there ? "
That is the supreme disgrace .
( Haleem )
Thus , the hypocrites accuse Muhammad of listening to anything and everything , so he lacks wisdom and inspiration from Allah .
But Allah gets the last laugh , for they will be thrown into the fires of hell .
According to Sura 9:73 and 123 , Muhammad wages a physical and violent war on them .
So Watts explanation is misguided if he excuses Muhammads violence .
Muhammad continues his denunciation of the hypocrites with their jokes :
9:64
The hypocrites fear that a sura will be revealed exposing what is in their hearts say , " Carry on with your jokes : God will bring about what you fear ! "  65 yet if you were to question them , they would be sure to say , " We were just chatting , just amusing ourselves . "
Say , " Were you making jokes about God , His Revelation [ the Quran ] , and His Messenger ?
66 Do not try to justify yourselves ; you have gone from belief to disbelief . "
( Haleem )
Muhammad goes on to assert that the hypocrites are misleading a number of people , and in the eyes of the violent radicals today , this could easily be applied to Muslims who go from " belief to disbelief " as they criticize Islam and Muhammad .
They have become hypocrites worthy of the fires of hell ( v. 68 ) ; and taking verse 33:61 ( see above ) seriously , which promises besiegement and death , the radicals today help the hypocrites reach hell more quickly , by assassinating them rather than waiting for natural causes .
The hypocrites of Muhammad time and of today cannot hide behind " chatting and amusing themselves " because God , the Quran , and the Messenger can not be trifled with .
Indeed , the Ayatollah Khomeini ( d. 1989 ) in 1980 , shortly after he gained power in Iran and who issued the first fatwa against Rushdie , said : " There is no room for play in Islam ....
It is deadly serious about everything . "
The following hadiths from Sunan Abu Dawud , a reputable source , support the verses in the Quran and the deceased Supreme Leader .
This passage is narrated by Ibn Abbas , who was Muhammads cousin and considered a highly reliable transmitter of early traditions .
The blind husband of a woman who used to verbally abuse Muhammad kept telling her to stop , but she would not .
Eventually , he took a dagger and stabbed her to death .
Muhammad heard about it and gathered his followers together to find out who did it .
Trembling , the man leaped up and told Muhammad that he did it , whereupon , the prophet said : " Oh , be witness , no retaliation is payable for her blood " ( vol. 3 , no. 4348 ) .
The translator of Sunan Abu Dawud , Ahmad Hasan , says that later jurists or legal scholars are unanimous that a Muslim who abuses or insults the prophet should be killed ( note 3799 ) .
Muhammad did not arrest the murderous thug , but let him go free , and the jurists use this passage ( and others ) to apply this punishment to the world outside of Medina .
It is breathtaking to watch Islam in action .
Finally , Ali , Muhammads cousin and son- in - law , narrated the following murder of a Jewish woman for insulting Muhammad : " A man strangled her till she died .
The Apostle of Allah [ Muhammad ] declared that no recompense was payable for her blood " ( vol. 3 , no. 4349 ) .
The translator informs us that all Jews or any non-Muslims who insults the prophet should also be killed ( note 3800 ) .
Again , the example of Muhammad serves to guide later Islam .
Allah was guiding this religion , but the true God was not .
These hadith passages , though not dealing directly with insult poetry , demonstrate that early Islam is violent .
All in all , the sources of early Islam — the Quran , the hadith , biographies , and histories — converge together and agree on this violence , painting a dark picture of this religion .
Islam is not the religion of peace .
Conclusion
So the deadly fatwas and assassinations continue .
Radical Muslims are concerned not only for their prophet , but also for another " prophet , " Jesus , who comes behind Muhammad in importance , though revered nonetheless .
David Harsanyi reports that in 1999 , a London - based group called Muhajiroun ( named after Muhammads fellow - emigrants from Mecca to Medina in AD 622 ) , describing itself as Defenders of the Messenger Jesus , put a bounty on the playwright Terrence McNally for his play Corpus Christi , when it reached London .
The play , set in modern Texas , shows Jesus dying not as the King of Kings , but as the King of Queers , after his gay lover Judas betrays him .
This play is especially offensive to Christians , and some may protest it , but no Christian can ever cite support from the New Testament or from the example of Christ to assassinate McNally .
The Muhajiroun , however , have ample testimony from the example of Muhammad and the Quran to eliminate the playwright .
As noted in the introduction , Theo van Gogh , 47 , descendant of the brother of the famous nineteenth - century painter Vincent , was assassinated for his film Submission , which depicts violence against women in Muslim society .
One woman is forced into an arranged marriage and beaten by her husband .
Van Gogh was assassinated while cycling by a man dressed in a traditional Moroccan jallaba .
The Dutch artist , pleading for mercy , had his throat sliced after his killer fired six shots into him .
It should be noted that van Gogh called Jesus " the rotten fish of Nazareth , " apparently referring to the Christian symbol of a fish , but no Christian not even the most zealous fundamentalist attempted to or actually assassinated him .
And if anyone did , then Christian leaders around the world would have roundly condemned him , as they have condemned a few killers of abortion doctors and bombers of abortion clinics over the last two or so decades .
The silence of Muslim leaders about van Goghs death speaks loudly about the state of Islam .
For more information , go to these articles [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
Radical Muslims do not hesitate to riot if the Quran is desecrated .
In honor of their holy book , they kill innocent people .
Though their deaths are not assassinations as such , they demonstrate how far radicals will go in responding to insults of their religion .
This article analyzes why Islam is disrespected .
It is one of the few major religions to erupt in violence when a desecration may occur ( or not ) .
We began this article with the three - letter root of Islam ( s - l - m ) , which means peace .
However , Websters Dictionary says that the word " assassin " comes from another Arabic word : " hashshashin , " ( plural of hashshash ) .
This comes from " one who smokes or chews hashish , " which also names " a secret order of Muslims that at the time of the Crusades terrorized Christians and other enemies by secret murder committed under the influence of hashish . "
It has been shown that the terrorists in Iraq use drugs as they terrorize their fellow Iraqis and the infidels .
Worse still , the religious and Muhammad - sanctioned violence in the earliest source documents the Quran , the hadith , the biographies , and the historiesacts as a kind of drug on the conscience of violent radicals .
They read these sources and reasonably conclude that Allah endorses violence .
So why would they feel guilty for violence if they have their conscience soothed by Muhammads example ?
The anaesthetizing seeds of assassination have been planted in the earliest soil of Islam , and now they have grown up into the assassinations of artists and writers and filmmakers .
Early Islam inspires such terrorist - assassins .
Jesus did not assassinate anyone , nor did he endorse assassinations to promote the true kingdom of God .
Jesus saves .
Muhammad assassinated .

You tried so hard .
But you failed .
You did not pass the test , you performed poorly in the interview or you missed your project goal at the office .
Why ?
Is it that you were not capable ?
Or could something more subtle — and worrisome — also be at work ?
Every once in awhile , we newspaper columnists , raging and fulminating at our keyboards , go too far -- we overstate , we gloss over nuance , we generalize unfairly , we give offense we do n't intend while trying to be funny or profound , or we otherwise lose our rhetorical way .
And if we 're lucky , we have an editor who saves us .
If we 're lucky we have an editor who tells us , " I know what you 're trying to say , but this piece is n't working .
What you 've written is ( confusing / gratuitously inflammatory / unfair / silly ) .
I recommend you ( insert constructive suggestion here ) and try again . "
Freelance columnist Mohammad Sagha of the Naperville Sun was n't lucky .
A week ago Friday , Sagha ( right ) submitted a column on the subject of patriotism that did n't work .
Its argument did n't quite track and it was too intemperate and sweeping to be persuasive .
Here 's a passage :
The 9/11 generation is being raised somewhat similarly to how the youth of the Red Scare were raised which included confusion , misinformation , fear , nationalism , and undue support of our elite rulers .
But we have traitors on our hands .
We have war hawks , instigators , oppressors and conquering emperors who have brought nothing but death and anguish to the Iraqis .
Read the entire column below in the comments section .
Not to slag a brother in ink .
Writers with more age and experience than Sagha -- he 's a 17 - year - old high school senior -- have certainly written worse .
And judging by a set of other columns he sent along , he has certainly written better since he began appearing every other week in the Sun last fall .
Monday , then , the patriotism column ran with only minor changes on page two of the newspaper .
Sagha said he recieved two e-mail messages from opinion page editor Tim West that day , both of which arrived while he was at school .
The first urged him to stop writing about politics and stick to high school themes , Sagha said , and warned him that if he did n't do so in the future , his columns would not be published .
Such a request is certainly in bounds .
Editors prefer columnists not to stray too far too often from their niches , and editors are certainly free to define and even re-define those niches as things go along .
Sagha had been writing quite a bit about politics -- " Our freedoms are under attack , " he wrote in his previous column .
President Bush " is a war hawk whose illogical foreign policies have led to the direct deaths of 4,000 Americans . "
He 'd recently used his column to promote the idea that college students should be allowed to carry concealed weapons .
And he told me that although his editors had previously encouraged him to stick to issues of interest to teenagers , they had never told him to stay away from political topics .
But , again , the Naperville Sun is always free to change its mind about what it wants to publish .
The second message from West , Sagha said , came three and a half hours later and said the Sun was discontinuing his column immediately .
Again , in bounds .
Papers discontinue columns from time to time .
Usually editors give warning if they 're growing dissatisfied and perhaps offer the columnist an opportunity to change , but not always .
Where the Sun went out of bounds , though , was in tossing Sagha under the wheels the next day in a prominent apology authored by editor and publisher Jim Lynch .
Lynch blasted " the inflammatory , ill - informed comments that appeared in Mohammad Sagha 's column .. The Sun does not in any way endorse or approve of Mr. Sagha 's comments and regrets they were published . "
Whose fault was it that they were published ?
Not Sagha's .
He submitted an original , unplagiarized , non-libelous column and gave the paper an entire weekend to consider it .
Lynch admitted that in his note to readers :
We here at the Sun are responsible for everything that goes into the paper and on our Web site .... sometimes mistakes are made .
So who paid the price for this mistake by losing a paying gig ( $ 50 per column ) and having his reputation trashed in his home newspaper ?
Mohammad Sagha , whose name has been all but removed from the Sun 's Web archives .
I called opinion page editor Tim West .
He referred me to Lynch , who replied to an assortment of questions I sent via e-mail with this one - line response :
Our published apology is addressed to our readership and speaks for itself .
Sagha said Lynch told him in a phone conversation later that he , Lynch , was sorry about how it all came down but that he , Sagha , should consider it a life 's lesson .
To me , Zorn , that lesson looks like this : Crap flows downhill , kid .
ONLINE : Letters to the Editor of the Naperville Sun about Sagha 's column
The vessel will go on display this month at Dublin 's National Museum
The apologetic gesture came as a replica Norse warrior ship arrived in Dublin after a voyage across the North Sea .
Danish Culture Minister Brian Mikkelson said his country was proud of the ship , Havhingsten ( The Sea Stallion ) .
" But we are not proud of the damages to the people of Ireland that followed in the footsteps of the Vikings , " he said .
" But the warmth and friendliness with which you greet us today and the Viking ship show us that , luckily , it has all been forgiven . "
It was fairly emotional all right , it was very hard to keep the tears back
Diarmuid Murphy
County Cork
The replica long boat - the largest in the world - is a reconstruction of the Skuldelev 2 built in Dublin in 1042 and believed to have sunk in the Roskilde Fjord 30 years later .
Archaeologists traced the wood used in the original to trees felled in Glendalough in County Wicklow , south of Dublin .
The crew of 65 sailed the replica vessel as part of an archaeological experiment .
' Go on display '
Diarmuid Murphy from Bantry in County Cork - one of only two Irish sailors on board - said he almost gave up at the outset .
" About 18 hours into it , I was just so cold and wet and I said there 's no way I 'll do this , " he said .
Despite a diet of dried food and sleeping in the cold , cramped and wet conditions of an open boat he was glad to see the port of the Irish capital .
" It was fairly emotional all right , it was very hard to keep the tears back , " he said .
Researchers will analyse the data that was gathered during the voyage from an onboard computer and film .
The vessel will go on display this month at Dublin 's National Museum until next year when a crew , captained by Carsten Hvid , will make the return voyage home .
A project to reconstruct her was launched in Denmark in 2004 with Her Majesty Queen Margrethe christening her " Havhingsten fra Glendalough " ( The Sea Stallion from Glendalough ) in recognition of the original 's Irish beginnings .
Sometimes you have a need for an object method which the class author did not foresee .
For instance , in our “ previous installment ” : http://avdi.org/devblog/2008/03/27/sustainable-development-in-ruby-part-1-good-old-fashioned-inheritance/, we used the following code to accumulate packets until an ending packet was found :
class BufferedConnection < FMTP ::Connection def receive buffer = " " begin message = super buffer << message.data end until( message.data.include ?( " ENDENDEND " ) ) Message.new ( buffer ) end end
We test whether the packet denotes the end of a message by searching for the token @ ” ENDENDEND ” @ .
This is a little messy .
It would be cleaner if we could call a predicate method on @message@ to determine whether it indicates the end of a multi- packet message .
It ’s easy enough to re-open the @Messsage@ class and add such a method :
class FMTP :: Message def end ? data.include ?( " ENDENDEND " ) end end
Let ’s take a step back , however .
While adding a previously undefined method is one of the more benign forms of runtime class modification , it is not without its risks .
And in this case , we only need the @#end ? @ method in one place in our own code , which hardly justifies modifying the @Message@ class globally .
Instead , we could localize the extension by injecting the method just in time :
class BufferedConnection < FMTP ::Connection def receive buffer = " " begin message = extend_message ( super ) buffer << message.data end until( message.end ? ) Message.new ( buffer ) end private def extend_message ( message ) def message.end ? ; data.include ?( " ENDENDEND " ) ; end message end end
In the new method @#extend_message@ , we are using Ruby ’s dynamic nature to add a new method to the message object at runtime .
Now our extension is scoped only to the code that needs it .
There is one more small benefit to using this technique over re-opening the class : our extension is not bound to a particular class in the @FMTP@ library .
We do n’t have to worry about which class to patch , or even if @Connection # receive@ might return more than one type of @message@ .
So long as the object returned by @#receive@ contains a @#data@ method , our extension will continue to work .
h3 . Applicability
Consider using dynamic method injection when :
* Vendor code controls instantiation of the target
* Your code is the primary client of the target
* The extension is only needed in a small subset of the code .
Stay tuned for our next episode , in which we ’ll talk about delegation .

The story goes that Albert Einstein passed away when Dr. Michio Kaku was growing up .
That event caused him to dedicate his life to finishing what Einstein began and was unable to finish .
Since that time , Dr. Kaku has become one of the leading physicists in the entire world , and has indeed begun to fulfill his childhood ambition .
A co-founder of the ever - popular string theory , Dr. Kaku also researches teleportation , ray guns , telepathy , time machines , worm holes and invisibility .
Believe it or not , according to Kaku , most of these concepts , which sound like science fiction are actually becoming science fact .
Here Dr. Kaku talks with the New Times about the social implications of his work , and the effect all of this complex research has for the average person , who might not understand the sixth dimension in quite the same way he does .
New Times : A large part of what you do is make science available to the masses .
Why is it important for an average person to understand quantum physics or the physics of teleportation , for instance ?
Michio Kaku :
Our society is not getting any simpler .
It ’s getting much more complex , and multi-billion dollar decisions will be made by taxpayers .
That ’s why we scientists have to engage the public about decisions that will affect everyone on planet Earth – the future of the internet , the proliferation of nuclear weapons , global warming , all the future technologies that I talk about in , “ Physics of the Impossible . ”
They ’re going to have a direct impact on our lives whether we like it or not .
That ’s why I write books – so people are aware of what ’s coming down the pipe .
I wrote a book called , “ Visions : [ How Science Will Revolutionize the Twenty - First Century ] ” years ago where I predicted the next 50 years , for example .
All the predictions are coming true like clockwork .
Why is that ?
Because I ’m a scientist .
I ’m not a science fiction writer .
I ’m not a journalist .
I ’m a physicist .
I work in research .
My friends work in research .
So the research that my friends are doing will have an impact on everyone ’s life .
I see these things inevitable .
They ’re not fiction .
They exist in prototype form , and they will change the world .
NT : I know you ’ve said that in about 20 years , Silicon Valley will be obsolete .
What kind of impact will events like this have on the economy , or on global poverty ?
MK : Two weeks ago I was in Seattle .
I spoke before 4,000 engineers at Microsoft .
I told them that by 2020 , watch out .
Computer power will slow down .
We ’re going to be exhausting the power of silicon .
Silicon Valley could become a rust belt , just like large parts of Pennsylvania today are rust belts of steel … and they agreed with me .
Years ago , we told them and they were resistant .
Computer firms like Intel did n’t want to hear it , that we physicists were predicting problems around 2020 .
Microsoft says , ‘ Yeah .
We ’re preparing . ’
They ’re changing the computer architecture software .
What will be on your desk will change as a consequence of what we told Microsoft and Intel .
So that ’s why if you know physics , you know a little bit about the future .
NT : How will this affect the economy , or the job market ?
MK : We could have a massive depression or recession around 2020 , unless we take measures today .
At Christmas , we assume that our computers are twice as powerful , more or less , as the previous Christmas .
That ’s why we buy them .
We ’re not going to buy all these computers and goodies if they ’re not more powerful than they were the previous year .
That can not continue .
Around 2020 , what you buy will have the same power as last year .
Will you buy a computer ?
Will you upgrade ?
Will you buy the next model ?
A whole industry – computation , banking , finance , music , entertainment , depends upon the increasing of computer power .
It ca n’t continue forever .
All things must pass .
That ’s why we physicists are looking at the post - silicon era , trying to construct atomic computers , quantum computers , electron computers , computers that compute on subatomic particles , rather than computing on gigantic molecules of silicon .
NT : Has there been any criticism that your explanation of complex science , like quantum physics , string theory , teleportation , invisibility , and ray guns for example , is “ watered down ” science , since it must be simplified to be understood by the masses ?
MK : Well , if I were a science journalist , I would be subject to the criticism that I was , “ dumbing stuff down , ” and leaving out huge chunks of the essential ingredients .
But I ’m a physicist .
I know the essence of why certain things work the way they do .
I do n’t have to fudge the words or anything .
Like invisibility .
We physicists also have to admit when we ’re wrong .
Two years ago , every physics textbook said that invisibility was impossible .
I said that in my optics class .
I was wrong .
Every textbook was wrong .
Two years ago we did it with microradiation , and we ’re now doing it with visible light as well .
We physicists have to be very accurate , but we also have to be humble about our mistakes .
We do know that when we talk , we have the authority of thousands of years of physics behind .
Rather than some kind of science journalist who knows about it in some kind of journalism class , I know from first hand , because these are my friends who are building these things .
NT : You mentioned in your lecture that the first applications for some of the groundbreaking technologies that you ’re researching , like invisibility , are military applications .
Are there questions about the morality of certain kinds of physics research ?
MK : Definitely .
One of the reasons for writing , “ Physics of the Impossible ” is to introduce people to the moral questions that they raise .
If you have invisibility , what does that mean for criminals , who can commit crimes with impunity ?
In fact Plato himself , 2,000 years ago , said that if you had control of invisibility , the temptation would be too great to steal , to assassinate the king , and to become the next king .
He used that as an example to show that we need laws .
Therefore , society cannot depend on the goodwill of your fellow man .
We need laws .
We need governments .
So Plato actually used invisibility for his basic thesis on the republic .
We definitely realize that there are moral questions concerning invisibility , teleportation , and telepathy .
For example , we physicists can now begin to read people ’s thoughts .
Not the hocus pocus you see in magic shows in Las Vegas , but with electron probes , we can begin to see the outlines of people ’s thinking process .
What about privacy ?
What happens if you do n’t want your mind to be read and somebody reads your mind ?
These are questions that physicists have to address .
For example , lie detectors .
We can now use MRI machines , brain scan machines , to read whether or not people are telling a lie .
That ’s going to go to court this year .
Already the courts are going to be ruling on technology that we physicists created .
NT : You talked about understanding societies according to a ranked system , in which the rankings are based on the power of a society to harness energy .
Is this ranked scale problematic because it leads one to the conclusion that certain societies are “ more advanced ” than other , western societies ?
MK : We physicists rank civilizations in terms of energy .
The Type I , II , and III classifications are civilizations hundreds to thousands of years more advanced than ours .
So we ’re not making a value judgment , we ’re simply saying that any civilization that can harness the power of a star would be a Type II civilization .
The point of raising this is that we are headed for Type I .
And people say , “ What does it all mean ?
Where is it all headed ? ”
The newspaper headlines seem to be gibberish , and random things that do n’t make any sense .
The European Union , the advancing computer technology of the Internet – what does it all mean ?
It all means one thing .
We are headed for a planetary civilization , a Type I civilization .
That does n’t mean that we ’ll make it , but it means that the Internet is the beginning of a Type I telephone system .
English will be the language of Type I .
The European Union and NAFTA are the beginnings of a Type I economy , and we see the beginning of rock ‘ n ’ roll , youth culture , and high fashion as part of the planetary culture which exists in every nation of the world today .
This is happening right before our eyes .
Every headline in the newspaper more or less illuminates the transition to Type I .
NT : How does this affect non-western cultures , particularly in terms of cultural aspects like language , oral tradition , and music ?
MK : Some people say , “ This must mean that local cultures are going to be annihilated by a planetary culture . ”
Yes and no .
Go to any country today , and the elite speak English .
They co-exist with the local language and the local culture , but the elite have access to Chanel , and Gucci bags and what have you .
That ’s going to be a model for the world -- not just the elites of societies today , but the middle class of the future .
The middle classes of the future will speak English , as well as the local language .
They will have access to Chanel dresses , as well as all of the local dresses .
So we ’re going to have a planetary culture , with below that , millions of local cultures that will co-exist , just like English co-exists in any society within the elite .
That ’s going to be the model for the world .
NT : Economically , will that widen the gap between rich and poor ?
What happens to the working class ?
MK : Yes and no .
First of all , the working class is not going to be put out of business for the simple reason that robots cannot do most working class jobs .
The one working class job that is severely under pressure is autoworkers .
Autoworkers are doomed .
They ’re going to be like wagon makers of the past .
Their jobs are going to be gone , because their jobs are highly skilled , but repetitive .
Semi-repetitive jobs will survive because robots cannot do semi-repetitive work , like picking up garbage .
Every set of garbage is different .
Every construction site is different .
Every house that a carpenter builds is different .
Robots ca n’t do that .
Robots can only do repetitive tasks .
So those jobs will flourish in the future .
Now , the nations that will suffer in the future are nations that are mainly commodity based .
Certain commodities are falling in price , like food .
Food prices , except recently have been falling , and certain African nations that put all their money on food are going to be in big trouble in the future .
Nations that invest in what is called intellectual capital will survive .
Nations that invest in commodity capital , except for a few commodities , are going to be in big trouble .
NT : When do you see this transition to a Type I society happening ?
MK : In about 100 years .
We ’re not talking about any abrupt transition .
We are a Type 0 civilization .
We get our energy from dead plants , oil , and coal .
A Type I society would get their energy from a planetary way , which is solar hydrogen , for example .
We are by the way about ten or fifteen years from a solar hydrogen economy , perhaps 40 years from a fusion economy .
Oil prices go up , and solar hydrogen prices go down .
When the two curves cross , in about ten to fifteen years , we will make a transition to solar hydrogen .
We ca n’t do that yet , because some hydrogen is very expensive – three to five times more expensive than oil or coal .
In ten to fifteen years , the two curves will cross .
At that point , solar hydrogen becomes competitive .
NT : Is there anything else you wanted to add ?
MK : Just that , “ Physics of the Impossible ” surprised me .
Four weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List , the number one science book in the country , and the word “ physics ” is in it .
Which is amazing that it can do so well with the word “ physics ” in it .
It just goes to show that the average kid , the average person out there wonders after watching all these Hollywood blockbusters , if any of this stuff can be true .
There ’s a thirst for that .
The White House ’s chief information officer said the Bush administration should not be compelled to search for millions of emails on individual computers and hard drives that may have been lost between 2003 and 2005 because it would be too expensive and require hundreds of hours of work , according to a filing the White House made with a federal court late Friday .
Friday ’s court filing by the White House came in response to an order issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola last week demanding that the White House show cause why it should not be ordered to create and preserve a “ forensic copy ” of emails from individual hard drives .
Facciola entered the order in part because the White House admitted that it did not preserve back - up tapes prior to October 2003 .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and George Washington University ’s National Security Archive sued the Bush administration last year alleging the White House violated the Presidential Records
Act by not archiving emails sent and received between 2003 and 2005 .
In documents filed with Faciolla Friday , Theresa Payton , the chief information officer at the White House Office of Administration , said the White House routinely destroyed its hard drives every three years “ in order to run updated software , reduce ongoing maintenance , and enhance security assurance .
So its unlikely that any lost emails would be retrieved anyway .
“ When workstations are at the end of their lifecycle and retired … under the refresh program , the hard drives are generally sent offsite to another government entity for physical destruction in accordance with Department of Defense guidelines , ” states Payton ’s sworn affidavit filed with Facciola late Friday .
“ And even if some older computer workstations were in use , finding them and copying their hard drives with the hope that the residual data contains relevant e-mail information would create an ‘ awfully expensive needle to justify searching a haystack , ’ ” a separate court filing the White House made Friday says .
“ Even if computer workstations used during the relevant time period are identifiable and locatable , making “ forensic copies ” ( as that term is defined by the Court ) of the workstations that may or may not contain residual data of emails would impose a significant burden on OA , ” added Payton ’s affidavit .
“ As I understand it , an Order requiring defendants to make a copy of all active data on workstations containing profiles from the relevant time period would require hundreds of hours of work by … staff and management personnel .
Such an effort would inevitably divert significant resources from the [ Office of the Chief Administration Officer ] functions and projects relating to core administration operations .
The precise duration of the procurement process , as well as costs associated with that process , are not presently knowable , but they must be expected to be substantial given the sensitivity and significance of such a project . ”
But putting that aside , Payton said , there is simply no evidence to back up allegations made in a lawsuit filed by two government watchdog groups that claim the White House has lost as many as 10 million emails — some of which are said to coincide with dates involving the leak of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson as well as the buildup to the invasion of Iraq .
Payton said that since the watchdog groups ’ claims are unsupported the White House should not be forced to undertake a “ draconian ” process of having to search for emails .
“ Put simply , plaintiff cannot justify its request that [ the Office of the Chief Information Officer ] and [ Executive Office of the President ] … incur significant time and resource expense on the mere possibility ( however unlikely ) that some useful material may be restored , ” the White House ’s filing states .
“ Because the allegation of missing e-mail from archives is unconfirmed , because the allegation of missing e-mails from back - up tapes is conjectural , and because the computer workstations are unlikely to house significant , if any , relevant material the costs of a forensic copy process would far outweigh any speculative benefits . ”
That line of reasoning appears contradictory on several fronts .
First , an internal investigation undertaken by officials in Payton ’s office concluded that computer experts could not locate a single email from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney between September 30 , 2003 and October 6 , 2003 — the week when the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Plame Wilson leak and set a deadline for administration officials to turn over documents and emails to federal investigators that contained any reference to her or her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson .
Additionally , Office of Administration staffers said there were at least 400 other days between March 2003 and October 2005 where emails could not be located in either Cheney ’s office or the Executive Office of the President .
Finally , Payton admitted in January that the White House “ recycled ” its computer back - up tapes until October 2003 , which makes it much more difficult to retrieve emails .
Payton maintains that while emails may have been deleted or “ recycled ” they can still be recovered .
At a hearing last month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Payton said she felt “ very comfortable ” that her office would be successful in recovering lost emails from “ disaster recovery backup tapes . ”
However , her office has so far not attempted to recover the electronic communications .
The internal investigation conducted by more than a dozen staffers in Payton ’s office showed that there were at least 473 days of missing emails led CREW to file a federal court motion earlier this month asking that Payton be held in civil contempt for knowingly submitting false , misleading , and incomplete testimony in an affidavit filed with a federal court in January .
In her sworn affidavit filed January 15 , Payton said one employee in the Office of Administration — Steve McDevitt , who worked with Payton from 2002 to 2006 — and that she did not know whether emails were properly archived , conducted the internal probe .
CREW said Payton ’s responses in her affidavit are “ false and appear designed to mislead the court into believing that both discovery and any additional interim relief are unnecessary . ”
Documents obtained by Henry Waxman , the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , show that Payton ’s office advised former White House counsel Harriet Miers in late 2003 or early 2004 about the administration ’s failure to archive emails .
Miers is said to have immediately informed Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald , who at the time was investigating the leak of Plame Wilson ’s undercover CIA status .
Fitzgerald had subpoenaed White House emails sent in 2003 .
However , according to CREW , Fitzgerald ’s staff was briefed before a complete audit of the email records could be taken and was therefore unaware of how extensive the problem was .
In a story I first reported in February 2006 , the White House turned over 250 pages of emails to Fitzgerald it said it “ discovered ” following a court document Fitzgerald filed in January 2006 in US District Court in Washington , DC .
The document said that Fitzgerald had “ learned that not all email of the Office of the Vice President and the Executive Office of the President for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the White House computer system . ”
That document was filed during the discovery phase of the perjury and obstruction of justice trial against former vice presidential staffer I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , who was convicted last year by federal grand jury of perjury and obstruction of justice .
The White House offered no official explanation concerning the circumstances regarding the sudden reappearance of the emails it had turned over to Fitzgerald on February 6 , 2006 , or if there had been any truth to Fitzgerald ’s allegations the emails had not been automatically archived .
At the time , a White House spokeswoman would only tell me that staffers had “ discovered ” the batch of documents during a search .
It is possibly that the missing emails could simply be the result of poor management .
David Gewirtz , a former computer science professor who also used to be employed as the product management director for Symantec and held the title of “ Godfather ” at Apple Computer , Inc has written more than 600 articles about email and recently published a book Where Have All the Emails Gone , the definitive account about the circumstances that led to the loss of administration emails .
In an interview , Gewirtz said emails suddenly disappeared at a time when the White House had switched its email over from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange , an issue in and of it the author finds suspicious .
“ Why did they migrate at this time ?
The country was getting ready for war , ” noted Gewirtz , who said he has spoken to Senate and House staffers probing the loss of White House emails .
“ It does n’t make sense that you would want to yank out your communications structure when you ’re building up toward war .
It ’s crucial for our government to have qualified communications at a critical juncture .
It ’s just mind bogglingly questionable that the White House would change its communication structure at that time period .
Why did they need to do it then ?
It certainly provides a lot of plausible deniability for when emails are scrutinized . ”
“ Another plausible reason , and this is the conspiracy theory , if you yank out an email system there goes your compliance with the Presidential Records act and there ’s the ‘ my dog ate it ’ excuse , ” Gewirtz said .
“ There ’s really no net loss other than a PR loss . ”
Gewirtz said his biggest concern about the loss of White House emails is the national security implications .
“ There ’s a separate server for political activity .
The server is not located or managed by security experts , ” Gewirtz said .
“ Emails are sent by White House staffers using an unsecured server .
Hundreds of millions of emails are sent through the open Internet .
An email message sent by a low level political employee says where the president is traveling .
That can be seen by anyone and can put the president at risk .
It ’s something of a disturbing experience talking to Washington politicians .
Technical issue takes a back seat based on what the political goal is .
The potential loss through homeland security is pretty profound . ”
Still , that not a single email could be recovered from Cheney ’s office between September 30 , 2003 and October 6 , 2003 , the very week when federal investigators began their probe into the Plame Wilson leak and enjoined all White House staffers to turn over documents referencing Plame Wilson and her husband , raises suspicions .
And it calls into question the integrity of Fitzgerald ’s probe and suggests that he may not have obtained all of the evidence related to White House officials ’ role in the leak .
Anne Weismann , chief counsel for CREW , agreed .
In an email exchange with me , she said she believes there “ are unanswered questions about what the special counsel knew , particularly as to scope of email problem . ”
We wrote Fitzgerald a letter last April after we broke story of significant volume of missing White House emails , suggesting that he reopen investigation , ” Weismann said .
“ To date , we have heard nothing .
We have also written to Attorney General Michael Mukasey requesting that he appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and likewise have heard nothing . ”

The moving story of one of the last survivors of the Titanic can be revealed for the first time after touching letters and documents were discovered after her death .
For 94 years Lillian Asplund refused to speak about the tragedy that claimed the lives of her father and three brothers .
Instead , the spinster kept the final moments of her family locked in her memory and the poignant possessions of her father Carl hidden in a shoebox in her bureau .
It was only after her death aged 99 the box was found along with the collection of Titanic - related items that , pieced together , tell the tragic story of the family 's demise .

Poignant reminders : Lillian Asplund refused to speak about the Titanic tragedy for 94 years
The never before seen collection of Titanic survivor Lillian Asplund is coming up for auction
Among them were notes Mr Asplund had copied from a flyer promoting the benefits of living in California , an American dream that enticed the family to set sail for a new life .
An incredibly rare and water - stained ticket for the luxury liner was also found .
Only a handful of Titanic tickets are in existance as most of them sunk with the ship .
The paper documents recovered from his body miraculously survived for 12 days after the disaster because Mr Asplund 's lifejacket kept his coat 's breast pocket out of the water .
His pocket watch which stopped at 19 minutes past two - the exact time the liner sank - was also found on him .
And a heart - rending note written by his grief - stricken mother in which she wrote of how she hoped to see her son again in heaven formed part of the collection .
The stunning archive includes a sad photograph of Lillian , her mother Selma and three - year - old brother Felix , who both survived , at her father 's grave in 1912 .
The collection has now been made available for sale at auction where it is expected to fetch a combined total of £ 150,000 .
The sale has excited many Titanic experts as Lillian Asplund was the very last survivor with memories of the disaster .
She is only outlived by Brit Millvina Dean , who was a baby at the time .
Andrew Aldridge , of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Sons of Devizes , Wilts , said : " The importance of this archive for any Titanic collector cannot be underestimated .
" Lillian Asplund was the last American survivor and the last survivor with actual memories of it .
She was a very private person and hardly ever spoke about the disaster .
" She never married and the tragedy must have left a huge emotional scar on her .

The collection of documents is expected to fetch up to £ 150,000
" Her family obviously knew she had survived the Titanic but had no idea about this box , let alone what was inside it .
" The box was in an Edwardian oak bureau in the home Lillian used to live in with Felix and Selma .
The shoebox was n't particularly interesting to look at but opening it up was like lifting the lid on arguably some of the most historical artefacts relating to the Titanic .
" The vast majority of the documents have never been seen or published before .
" When you piece them together they tell the story of how this family had hoped to start a new life in America , possibly California , until they boarded Titanic .
After that there are these emotional letters and photographs showing what was left of this family in grief . "
The Asplund family lived in Alsema in southern Sweden until they decided to emigrate to Worcester , Massachusetts , in 1912 .

Lost and found : Rings found in Lillian Asplund 's Titanic shoe box
Carl Asplund , a 40 - year - old labourer , bought seven third class tickets for the Titanic 's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on April 10 , 1912 .
With him were wife Selma , then aged 38 , and five children Filip , 13 , Clarence , nine , Carl Edgar , five , Lillian , five , and Felix , three .
When the ship hit an iceberg and started to sink on the night of April 14 , the Asplunds made a decision that the family should die together along with the 1,500 who perished .
But , according to an account Selma Asplund later gave , at the last moment Felix and Lillian were thrown into lifeboat 15 by an unknown person .
Mr Asplund then pushed his wife forward to go with them .
She was haunted by the memory of the faces of her husband and three sons peering over the rail moments before the ship sank .
Her husband 's drowned and frozen body was recovered from the Atlantic 12 days later but there was no sign of his three sons .
Found in the pockets of his brown overcoat were his gold watch , two small keys for a safety box on board which stored the family 's life savings , and his gold wedding ring .
Also recovered were two pocket books , one of which contained his notes on their new life in California .
It is thought he had copied out a flyer designed to entice people to California to show his wife .
Part of it read : " California wants people like you , now is your time to come here .
We have green grass and wild flowers at this time of year and all the facilities you can have .
" An ideal home we can offer you we think .
Perhaps you do n't believe what we are saying about our climate and city .
Come and see it with your own eyes . "
Other papers on him included a letter dated February 28 , 1912 , telling Mr Asplund he had as job waiting for him .
His possessions were handed to Mrs Asplund who also kept a cold and heartless letter from White Star Line dated May 11 , 1912 .
It told her they were giving her late husband 's effects back as they were of " small value " .
Mr Aldridge said : " This letter states that the items were of low value which is ironic considering just how much they are worth now . "
Mrs Asplund stored the moving letter written by her mother - in - law , Kristina Samuelsson , 16 months after the tragedy , in the box .
In it she states how much her eyes hurt from where she has been in mourning .
She wrote : " My nerves are so weak and my eyes are so poor because I have been crying so much but I hope that my grieving days soon will have an end and I will join the final rest where God has promised to wipe out the tears from all the faces . "
Mrs Asplund died aged 91 on April 15 1964 - 52 years to the day of the disaster .
After her death Lillian Asplund put her mother 's wedding ring in the box alongside that of her father 's gold band .
Felix Asplund died in 1983 aged 73 and Lillian passed away in 2006 .
The auction takes place on Saturday , April 19 .
The second - most notorious trading card in history ( after the infamous 1989 Fleer “ Billy Ripken ” baseball card ) is the C - 3P0 card from Topps ’ 1978 Star Wars set .
Card # 207 ( fourth series ) allegedly shows the famous golden droid sporting a penis that would have put porn actor John Holmes to shame .
What we appear to have here is an image created by the combination of a natural part of our robot friend ’s nether regions ( the area inside the red rectangle below ) and something extra ( the area inside the green rectangle below ) added through methods unknown .
The result is a droid who looks decidedly well - endowed :
Just how did this image end up on a trading card ?
As usual , legend places the blame on a disgruntled or prankish artist , just as in the examples of the infamous cover from Disney ’s The Little Mermaid video and the notorious Renuzit air freshener can .
For what it ’s worth , the official Star Wars web site described what ’s seen here is just a “ trick of timing and light ” :
[ I ]t appears that the extra appendage is not the work of an artist , but rather a trick of timing and light .
The untouched archive photo shows the image just as it appears on the card .
The current theory is that at the exact instant the photo was snapped , a piece fell off the Threepio costume , and just happened to line up in such a way as to suggest a bawdy image .
The original contact sheets from the photo - shoot attests to this .
They are not retouched in any way , yet still contain the same image .
Whatever the real explanation is , the ‘ mischievous airbrush artist ’ scenario simply does n’t fit .
Intentional or not , the depiction of a well - hung C - 3P0 was realistic enough that Topps later replaced the card with an air - brushed one featuring a tamer rendering .
That action spawned a ( false ) sub -legend that the original version of the card is now comparatively rare and valuable :

When Jennifer and Bobby Post traded in their 2001 Chevy Suburban last year for a shiny new Ford F - 350 turbo diesel with an extended cab , it seemed like a great deal .
Even though they still owed $ 9,500 on their SUV after the trade - in value , they did n’t have to put a penny down .
The dealership , near the Posts ’ home in Victorville , made it easy ; it just added the old debt to the price of the new truck and gave the couple a seven - year , $ 44,276 loan .
The Posts were a little worried about taking on such a long obligation , but they could n’t pass up a monthly payment under $ 700 .
Now they ’re having regrets .
“ I did n’t realize how much debt was in it , ” said Jennifer Post , who has since moved with her family to Iowa .
Now , she ’d like to get rid of the truck but can’t , because there ’s so much debt that she ’d literally have to pay someone to take it off her hands .

“ We have no options , ” she said .
Americans have n’t just been taking out risky mortgages for homes in the last few years ; they ’ve also been signing larger automobile loans for significantly longer terms than they used to .
As a result , people are slipping into a perpetual cycle of automobile debt that experts think could lead to a new credit crunch extending from dealerships to driveways and all the way to Wall Street .
Gone are the days of the three - year car loan .
The length of the average automobile loan hit five years , four months in October , up more than six months from 2002 , according to the Federal Reserve .
And nearly 45 % of loans written today are for longer than six years .
Even some staid lenders owned by the carmakers , such as Toyota Financial Services and Ford Credit , are offering seven - year financing .
And a few credit unions , particularly in the West , are tinkering with the eight - year note .
Advertisement
At the same time , the amount of money drivers owe on their cars is soaring .
In October , the average amount financed hit $ 30,738 , up $ 3,500 in just a year and nearly 40 % in the last decade , according to the Fed .
More troubling , today ’s average car owner owes $ 4,221 more than the vehicle is worth at the time it ’s sold -- up from $ 3,529 in 2002 , according to industry analyst Edmunds .
The longer loans are directly related to the higher balances .
By extending the length of loans , lenders keep monthly payments down .
But because these loans take longer to pay off , a much larger piece of the principal remains unpaid at the time the car is traded in .
The response of the automotive finance industry ?
Extend loans further and allow the indebted customer to roll what he owes into a new loan with little , if any , effect on his new monthly payment .
In effect , the driver is paying a loan on two -- or more -- cars at once .
Richard Apicella , head of Benchmark International ’s auto finance division , published a report on car loans last month that called the ever - lengthening deals a “ dangerous ” problem .
Combined with Americans ’ desire to drive new cars every few years , he said , the effect “ is like a drug .
Once you get hooked on it , it gets harder and harder to break the cycle . ”

From the point of view of those who sell cars and car loans , long - term loans are good for business and good for buyers .
“ The job of a successful dealer is to find a funding package that ’s acceptable to the customer , ” said Paul Taylor , chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Assn .
“ These loans allow them to get a luxury car rather than a more modestly priced vehicle . ”
Cindy Gerhardt has rolled over so much debt on successive vehicle purchases -- five in three years -- that she now owes almost $ 43,000 on two trucks worth no more than $ 29,000 and , she says , perhaps as little as $ 22,000 .
Faced with car payments that exceed her monthly mortgage , she tried to trade in the pair for a single vehicle .
But with so much unpaid principal on the vehicle loans , the only offer she got from the dealer was to trade in one truck on yet another new vehicle -- and increase her debt by another $ 25,000 .
Advertisement
“ It ’s our own fault that we traded in vehicles so many times , but we never thought it would get to this , ” said Gerhardt , a secretary who lives with her husband and two children in Clinton , Okla .
She recently tried to refinance her mortgage , she said , but was declined because her car payments were too high .
“ Not one dealer ever said this was a problem .
Ever .
I never had a dealership say no . ”
It ’s not just individual consumers who are at financial risk .
Nationwide , an estimated $ 575 billion in new and used auto loans are written every year by auto manufacturers , banks , credit unions and other lenders .
About 30 % of the loans that are originated by banks , and 100 % of those issued by automaker financiers , are , like mortgages , repackaged and sold as securities , according to the Consumer Bankers Assn .
Analysts warn that just as investors did n’t comprehend the risk inherent in some of the more exotic home mortgages in recent years , they are n’t considering how risky these car loans are .
If longer loan terms allow debt on the loans to grow too large , many drivers may simply default , leading to expensive repossessions .
And even those who keep paying their bills may reach a point , like Gerhardt , where they simply can’t afford another car .
That could send vehicle sales down the drain , a nightmare scenario for an industry that has already taken a hit this year from slower consumer spending and higher gas prices .
Advertisement
It could also lead to serious losses among financial institutions that have invested in car debt .
Among securitized auto loans , two - thirds have terms longer than 60 months , a fact that Standard & Poor ’s , which rates auto debt for sale on the secondary market , calls a “ credit concern . ”
This month , S&P ; reviewed its ratings on $ 113.5 billion in auto loan securities it rated in the last two years out of concerns over growing losses .
It did n’t make any downgrades but predicted that “ rising losses will continue into 2008 across all segments of the auto loan market . ”
S&P ; has found that delinquencies of more than 60 days on car loans issued this year to borrowers with the best credit are up 20 % compared to those issued last year , while delinquencies on loans issued this year to subprime borrowers increased by 16 % .
Delinquency rates on car loans are still far lower than on mortgages , but there is growing concern in the financial services industry .
Indeed , Tom Webb , chief economist of used - auto analyst Manheim Consulting , said he expects the tally for 2007 repossessions to be up by 10 % .
Mark Pregmon , executive vice president for consumer lending at SunTrust Bank , is among the concerned .
“ Any time you extend the maturity of the loan , you take on more risk .
The question is whether there ’s enough assessment of that extra risk , ” he said .
“ Obviously , it ’s a problem .
It ’s a house of cards . ”

In the 1970s and ‘ 80s , car loans hovered between 36 and 48 months , and drivers typically kept their cars longer than the life of the loan .
A number of factors changed that .
One key was interest rates , which fell from a high of 17.8 % in the early 1980s to lower than 5 % today , according to the Federal Reserve .
Another was affordability .
According to an index tracked by Comerica Bank , cars have steadily gotten more affordable -- as compared to median family income -- since the late 1990s .
With cheap money at hand for more - affordable cars , the temptation to keep buying became huge .
Today , according to Pregmon , financed cars are typically turned over in 24 to 36 months .
At the same time they were extending loan maturities , lenders , competing with one another , began offering more money and requiring smaller down payments .
Advertisement
Today , most lenders offer financing on 100 % or even 125 % of the sticker price , and some offer the most credit - worthy buyers loans for twice the value of the vehicle they ’re purchasing .
Last year , the average amount financed for new cars reached 99 % , according to the Consumer Bankers Assn. , up from 95 % in 2005 .
Lenders are beginning to brace themselves ; many have said they intend to tighten standards and require larger down payments .
Despite warnings from S&P ; , the Consumer Bankers Assn. , Lehman Bros .
and others , there is little sign that the automobile industry is willing -- or , with consumers demanding low payments , even able -- to reduce the lengths of the loans they issue .
“ For banks , it ’s a matter of meeting consumer demand : no money down and extend the term , ” said SunTrust ’s Pregmon .
“ But as a lender , you ’ve got a moral obligation as well .
Are we putting the clients in loans they ca n’t afford ? ”

Oddity , Which Applied Only to Obama , Never Occurred Before , Remains Unexplained , But ' Did n't Make a Difference ' in Final Results , According to State Official Who Confirmed the Anomaly ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/24/2008 , 4:19 pm PT
Early on election night last Tuesday , with just 18.07 % of the unofficial returns from the Pennsylvania Primary in , astute BRAD BLOG reader Matt Sircely ( who was aware enough to save off the HTML page locally ! ) noticed the following oddity on the official Dept. of State website results page ...
Note the three different sets of bars and percentages representing Obama 's tally .
The problem did not occur for any other candidate [ Update : looks like it did , see updates at bottom of article for more info ] , as seen on the full web page , which was noticed early in the evening , and saved locally by the alert reader .
Whatever the problem , it was eventually corrected by officials .
Today , Sircely called the PA Dept. of State to try and get an explanation of what caused the problem seen above ( audio from call is posted at the end of this article ) ...
The Dept. of State 's Director of the Office of Communications and Press , Leslie Amorós , confirmed the Election Night problem , but was unable to explain why it occurred .
She told Sircely , during the short phone call , that she'd be happy to try and get an explanation from their technical staff .
She went on to say , however , that whatever caused the anomaly , it did n't effect the outcome of the reported results .
" I think it was just , when it was uploading ...um... it did n't make a difference though , " Amorós told Sircely during the call , though it remains unclear as to how she knows whether it actually made " a difference " or not .
When queried as to how data is gathered for use on the DoS ' results web page , the Communication Director acknowledged that it " varies " from county to county .
" Some results are uploaded from counties , some results are pulled from websites and manually entered , some results are faxed to us and manually entered ... some are phone called , " she noted , before acknowledging , in reference to the triple Obama listing , " that was the first time that had occurred . "
Later in the brief conversation , Amorós noted that --- even with all of the media and public watching results , as they were coming in to the PA DoS website on Tuesday night --- " none at all " had bothered to ask about the problem until Sircely did so today .
As The BRAD BLOG reported on Monday , due to the types of electronic voting systems used in more than 85 % of the Keystone State , the bulk of results from last Tuesday 's election are 100 % unverifiable for accuracy in any way , shape or form .
As VerifiedVoting.org described the concern , prior to the election , the results would be " essentially unrecountable , unverifiable , and unauditable . "
Nonetheless , with mountains of documented " problems with voting machines and inaccurate voter registration rolls " which occurred across the state on Tuesday , resulting in " countless eligible voters ... needlessly refused the right to vote , " as a local consortium of watchdog groups reported [ WORD ] , Hillary Clinton was named the winner over Barack Obama by 9.2 points in the fully faith - based election .
Though the margin in the result was closer to 9 points than 10 , due to some lucky math , the media would largely go on to declare her reported victory as the " 10 point , double - digit " win she needed to stay in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination .
At this hour , with 99.99 % of results counted , according to the same official PA website which failed , as seen above , on Election Night , Clinton is reported to have won 54.6 % of the votes to Obama 's 45.4 % .
As Sircely 's captured webpage shows , with just 18.07 % of the unofficial results reported early in the evening last Tuesday , Clinton had garnered 52.8 % , while Obama had either 47.2 % or 47.4 % or 47.5 % , depending on which of his three reported totals you may wish to choose from .
Sircely 's conversation with PA DoS spokesperson Leslie Amorós follows below ( appx 3 mins ) ...
UPDATE 4/25/08 , 12:44 pm PT : Since publishing the above , we 've heard from several readers who mentioned that they noticed a similar occurrence happening with both McCain and Clinton 's totals on Election Night , though we 've got no screenshots showing that yet ( anybody have one ? ) .
In the meantime , we 're trying to find out from the PA DoS as to whether they can confirm the problem also having occurred with the other candidates .
So , hopefully , more soon in that regard ...
UPDATE 4/25/08 , 7:15 pm PT : DJ Paul Edge has posted screenshots similar to the one above , but with Hillary Clinton showing multiple entries from the PA DoS site .
So while we continue to await official confirmation from the PA DoS ( not likely until Monday earliest ) , presuming those other screenshots are also legit , then it 's probably safe to assume that whatever happened did not only happen to Obama during the night , as we originally reported .
Though DJ

Hillary has suggested Obama ’s attitudes regarding nukes are naive .
And yet , in one of the most under - reported stories of 2007 , four Cold Warriors who flexed American might last century went on record just over a year ago in support of a nuclear - free world –the Obama position .
In an op - ed letter to the Wall Street Journal , Henry Kissinger , George Shultz , Sam Nunn and William Perry wrote this :
" Unless urgent new actions are taken , the U.S. soon will be compelled to enter a new nuclear era that will be more precarious , psychologically disorienting , and economically even more costly than was Cold War deterrence .
It is far from certain that we can successfully replicate the old Soviet - American " mutually assured destruction " with an increasing number of potential nuclear enemies world - wide without dramatically increasing the risk that nuclear weapons will be used .
New nuclear states do not have the benefit of years of step - by - step safeguards put in effect during the Cold War to prevent nuclear accidents , misjudgments or unauthorized launches .
The United States and the Soviet Union learned from mistakes that were less than fatal .
Both countries were diligent to ensure that no nuclear weapon was used during the Cold War by design or by accident .
Will new nuclear nations and the world be as fortunate in the next 50 years as we were during the Cold War ? "
Read the entire letter here .
It 's the kind of issue that is a deal - maker - or - breaker for those with the imagination to envision a future in which the world is not put at risk by human folly .
Barack Obama envisions a world without nuclear weapons .
A world in which new nukes would be prohibited and old nuclear stockpiles would be secured and dealt down .
Hillary ?
She would reserve the option to bomb " enemies " who wish to obtain nukes , and fund " friends " who would go nuclear .
Yes , one could say she ’s endorsed the Kissinger , Shultz , Nunn and Perry proposal , but her endorsement , recorded Oct. 15 , 2007 , at www.Atlantic.com is serpentine and curiously worded .
" Neither North Korea nor Iran will change course as a result of what we do with our own nuclear weapons , but taking dramatic steps to reduce our nuclear arsenal would build support for the coalitions we need to address the threat of nuclear proliferation and help the United States regain the moral high ground .
Former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger , former Defense Secretary William Perry , and former Senator Sam Nunn have called on the United States to ' rekindle the vision , ' shared by every president from Dwight Eisenhower to Bill Clinton , of reducing reliance on nuclear weapons . "
click here but Kissinger , Shultz , Perry and Nunn went much further .
Hillary , in effect , soft - pedals and understates their call for a nuclear - free world , before tacitly endorsing it .
In an Oct. 2 , 2007 speech at DePaul University , on the other hand , Obama laid out 9 principles of foreign policy that he would adhere to .
Number One ?
Ridding the world of nuclear weapons .
Read speech here :
click here article at the think - tank , Foreign Policy in Focus , pretty much sums up my attitude toward Hillary 's take on nukes .
" Nuclear Weapons
" Particularly disturbing has been Senator Clinton ’s attitudes regarding nuclear issues .
For example , when Senator Obama noted in August that the use of nuclear weapons – traditionally seen as a deterrent against other nuclear states – was not appropriate for use against terrorists , Clinton rebuked his logic by claiming that " I do n’t believe that any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or nonuse of nuclear weapons . "
" Senator Clinton has also shown little regard for the danger from the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries , opposing the enforcement of UN Security Council resolutions challenging the nuclear weapons programs of such U.S allies as Israel , Pakistan and India .
Not only does she support unconditional military aid – including nuclear - capable missiles and jet fighters – to these countries , she even voted to end restrictions on U.S. nuclear cooperation with countries that violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
" She has a very different attitude , however , regarding even the possibility of a country the United States does not support obtaining nuclear weapons some time in the future .
For example , Senator Clinton insists that the prospect of Iran joining its three Southwest Asian neighbors in developing nuclear weapons " must be unacceptable to the entire world " since challenging the nuclear monopoly of the United States and its allies would somehow " shake the foundation of global security to its very core . "
She refuses to support the proposed nuclear weapons - free zone for the Middle East , as called for in UN Security Council resolution 687 , nor does she support a no - first use nuclear policy , both of which could help resolve the nuclear standoff .
Indeed , she has refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons against such non-nuclear countries as Iran , even though such unilateral use of nuclear weapons directly contradicts the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the same treaty she claims the United States must unilaterally and rigorously enforce when it involves Iran and other countries our government does n’t like .
" Senator Clinton also criticized the Bush administration ’s decision to include China , Japan and South Korea in talks regarding North Korea ’s nuclear program and to allow France , Britain and Germany to play a major role in negotiations with Iran , claiming that instead of taking " leadership to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists … we have outsourced over the last five years our policies . "
In essence , as president , Hillary Clinton would be more unilateralist and less prone to work with other nations than the Bush administration on such critical issues as non-proliferation . "

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR PEACE
Meanwhile , my friends at the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance sent the following email my way :

[ reddit - me ] Dahlia Lithwick , one of my favorite writers , proves that she sees the dangerous precedent set by John Yoo and the current administration :
The Bush administration has proven time and again that the Rule of Law is only as definitive as its most inventive lawyers .
I ’ve been watching a lot of Westerns recently – El Dorado , 3:10 to Yuma ( the new version ) , The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , The Man From Laramie , Winchester ’ 73 .
The older of these movies that defined masculinity during the Golden Age of Gender Roles in the 1950s – “ the strong , silent type ” as Tony Soprano memorably described it , echoing many before him .
What these movies are about – at their core and often explicitly – is how the Rule of Law came to the West .
It was not always brought through the most ideal means .
Often the honorable brigands and hired guns helped the sheriff establish civilization .
But it came – and it was fought for – and men and women died so that the Rule of Law might be brought to their small towns , and many died for the lack of it .
Now today , right wing radio talk show hosts from Dennis Miller to Steve Malzberg talk about the Rule of Law as if it were a sissification , as if it were a feminine value , as if it made a civilization weak .
They – and those in power – who dodged and pulled strings to avoid military service ( another mark against their purported standard of masculinity ) malign those who have stood up for the rule of law – from John Kerry to Max Cleeland – as cowards and traitors and “ girly men ” .
As I ’ve argued before – it is astounding that those who advocate the preemptive surrender of American values in the face of terrorism have been able to portray those who stand for the Rule of Law as effete snobs who want to surrender to terrorists .
Yet based on the standard of masculinity that many of these “ conservatives ” regularly invoke – the 1950s man , the cowboy – they are failures .
The cowboys in these old Westerns – these brigands and thieves and hired guns and sheriffs – fought to bring the Rule of Law to the Wild West .
The movies are often bittersweet , as the world in which these men thrived – a lawless and vicious yet exciting and new wasteland – is “ civilized ” and they are made obsolete .
But these men – and they are all men in these Westerns – still fight for justice , which is held to be brought about only by the Rule of Law .
What John Yoo and the Bush administration suggest , without saying outright , is that the Rule of Law – the concept that all individuals are equal before the law – is obsolete and dangerous .
They believe that the Rule of Law does not need to be upheld when government officials are trying to deal with terrorism .
Therefore , telecommunication companies that broke the law should be immunized ; CIA officers who have tortured individuals should not be held accountable ; neither the president nor his lawyers nor his advisors nor the Secretary of the Defense should be forced to follow the law or to face consequences if they do not .
The overwhelming , overriding impulse must be to take any measure necessary to prevent terrorism – even if there is only a 1 % chance of an attack , it must be treated as if it were certain , and it must be prevented by any means necessary .
This is a prescription for tyranny .
But perhaps worse from the perspective of those “ conservatives ” who like to dress up their president as a cowboy or Air Force pilot , it is cowardly .

After having an all out argument with Capital
One where my card was used fraudulently - they decided because I take care of my card then it MUST be my fault .
So they passed it over to Debitas who have written the normal threatening letters , so I have written to them asking for the CCA etc .
They have been calling persistently now for weeks - so today I decided to have some fun :
Debitas : Hello can I speak to Mr X
Me : You are
Debitas :
Ok , can you confirm your date of birth
Me : Nope
Debitas : Sorry
Me :
You 're forgiven
Debitas : Sorry

Why would you like to speak to him ?
Debitas : Sorry ...?
Me :
You 're forgiven
Debitas : Is this Mr X
Me : Oh , well why do n't you tell me your name first
Debitas :
That 's irrelevant
Me :
But if you want to get to know me then it's only right I get to know you as well
Debitas : ( hangs up )
Call 3 :
Debitas : Hello , can I speak to Mr X
Me : He 's dead
Debitas :
Oh , can you send us a copy of the death certificate ?
Me : Nope - I do n't know who you are
Debitas :
We are Debitas Legal Services part of the capital one group
Me : And ...?
Debitas : Erm , give me a sec ( hangs up )

Cornell University researchers have succeeded in implanting electronic circuit probes into tobacco hornworms as early pupae .
The hornworms pass through the chrysalis stage to mature into long - lived moths whose muscles can be controlled with the implanted electronics .
The research was showcased at MEMS 2008 , an international academic conference on Micro - Electrico - Mechanical Systems that took place from January 13 - 17 in Tucson , AZ .
The pupae insertion state was found to yield the best results .
The resulting moth , a microsystem - controlled insect , has a circuit board protruding from the top of its midsection .
Probes are inserted into the dorsoventral and dorsolongitudinal flight muscles .
CT images show components of high absorbance indicating tissue growth around the probe .
The research also indicated the most favorable and least favorable times for insertion of control devices .
The overall size of the circuit board is just 8x7 mm , with a total weight of about 500 mg .
The capacity of the battery is 16 mAh , and weighs 240 mg .
A driving voltage of 5 volts causes the tobacco hornworm blade muscles ( two pairs ) to move for flight and maneuvering .
The insect cyborgs are part of a program called HI - MEMS ( Hybrid Insect MEMS ) , a DARPA program initiated by Program Manager Dr. Amit Lal .
The ultimate goal of the HI - MEMS program is to provide insect cyborgs that can demonstrate controlled flight ; the insects would be used in a variety of military and homeland security applications .
HI - MEMS program director Amit Lal credits science fiction writer Thomas Easton with the idea .
Lal read Easton 's 1990 novel Sparrowhawk , in which animals enlarged by genetic engineering ( called Roachsters ) were outfitted with implanted control systems .
Dr. Easton , a professor of science at Thomas College , sees a number of applications for HI - MEMS insects .
Moths are extraordinarily sensitive to sex attractants , so instead of giving bank robbers money treated with dye , they could use sex attractants instead .
Then , a moth - based HI - MEMS could find the robber by following the scent . "
" [ Also , ] with genetic engineering Darpa could replace the sex attractant receptor on the moth antennae with receptors for other things , like explosives , drugs or toxins , " said Easton .
DARPA had better be careful with its insect army ; in Easton 's novel , hackers are able to gain control of genetically engineered animals by hacking the controller chips used in their implanted control structures .
If you are interested in one dark - side view of how this kind of invention could be used by corporations for advertising , see the madcap blurbflies from Jeff Noon 's excellent 2000 sf novel Nymphomation .

For a long time , it seemed as if a medical discovery that Science called " one of the greatest of 2007 " might never get covered by the mainstream media because it was just too complicated .
But then an enterprising journalist and artist with the Philadelphia Inquirer boldly went where no reporters dared go .
Writer Tom Avril and artist Cynthia Greer figured out how to simplify this complicated discovery into a completely - accurate cartoon ( pictured ) .

A researcher named Steven Reiner at University of Pennsylvania proved that the human body fights disease with two kinds of immune cells ( called T- cells ) : some that fight the invading microbes , and some that exist just to keep a record of how to fight those microbes in the future .
Those " memory " cells are what this researcher revealed , and their mysteries are still being unlocked .
Writes Avril :
The University of Pennsylvania physician electrified his field last year by showing how the immune system generates two types of the sophisticated tools known as T - cells : one to fight invaders to the death , the other to remember the battle plan for the next time the same enemy shows up .
Reiner 's finding , made with John Chang , Vikram Palanivel and colleagues , was named one of the top 10 breakthroughs of 2007 by the journal Science .
Using mice , the team provided evidence that T - cells arise from a self - renewing process a bit like that used by stem cells .
Without it , we 'd fight off a bug once , and the next time we'd be dead .
" It 's an amazing system , " Reiner marvels .
" You do use these cells , but you do n't deplete them .
That 's how we can live long lives with short - lived cells . "

I love it when somebody figures out a simple way to explain such a crucial issue to the public .

PORT -AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) - Haiti ’s government fell on Saturday when senators fired the prime minister after more than a week of riots over food prices , ignoring a plan presented by the president to slash the cost of rice .

Sixteen of 17 senators at a special session voted against Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis , an ally President Rene Preval placed at the head of a coalition cabinet in June 2006 that was meant to unite the fractious Caribbean nation .
The move by opposition senators was seen as a serious but not crushing blow to Preval , whose 2006 election brought a measure of calm to the poorest country in the Americas as it searched for political stability after decades of dictatorship , military rule and economic mayhem .
The clash with senators came after the president of the country of 9 million people -- most of whom earn less than $ 2 a day -- managed to persuade rioters to end a week of violence in which at least five people were killed .
Stone - throwing crowds began battling U.N. peacekeepers and Haitian police in the south on April 2 , enraged at the soaring cost of rice , beans , cooking oil and other staples .
The unrest spread this week to the capital , Port - au - Prince , bringing the sprawling and chaotic city to a halt as mobs took over the streets , smashing windows , looting shops , setting fire to cars and hurling rocks at motorists .
U.N. troops , stationed in Haiti since Jean - Bertrand Aristide was ousted as president in a revolt in 2004 , fired tear gas and rubber bullets on several occasions to disperse protesters .
On Saturday a Nigerian U.N. peacekeeper was shot to death near the main Catholic cathedral in downtown Port - au - Prince , close to the large and often violent slum of Bel - Air , a Haitian police officer and U.N. commander said .
The circumstances of the shooting were unclear and the city appeared largely tranquil .
Three Sri Lankan peacekeepers were struck by bullets on Thursday but were not seriously injured .
MANY HAITIANS WELCOME OUSTER
“ Now it ’s my turn to play , ” Preval said when he was told by journalists of the Senate vote shortly after he and private sector leaders unveiled a plan to cut the cost of a sack of rice to $ 43 from $ 51 .
Three dollars of the price cut would be paid for by businesses and the rest by international donors , he said .
Preval said he would ask parliament to pick a new prime minister .
Alexis was seen as a pragmatist and dealmaker , and also served as prime minister during Preval ’s first term as president from 1996 to 2001 .
Many Haitians seemed to welcome the ouster of Alexis .
“ When he was prime minister , he did nothing to lower the high cost of living .
I hope things will change with a new prime minister , ” said Jean Pierre Jean - Baptiste , 29 , an electrician .
Sen .
Youri Latortue , a nephew of a former prime minister and leader of Saturday ’s vote , said Alexis had failed to ramp up food production , protect people against crime , heed calls to establish a new national security force and set a deadline for the U.N. troops to leave .
‘ EVERYONE HAS TO MAKE A SACRIFICE ’

Disturbances over high food prices have broken out in several poor countries , primarily in Africa .
Record oil prices , rising demand for food in Asia , the use of farmland and crops for biofuels and other factors such as market speculation have pushed up food prices worldwide .
“ The situation is difficult everywhere around the world , everyone has to make a sacrifice , ” Preval said on Saturday as he announced the plan to cut rice prices in a room adorned with crystal chandeliers and thick drapes at the National Palace .
Preval reiterated that Haiti could not afford to cut taxes on food because it needed the revenue to pay for longer - term projects that create jobs and boost agriculture .
It was unclear whether the price cut would satisfy protesters .
“ It has not been lowered enough , ” said a young man who identified himself only as Givens .
“ If they do n’t further lower the price I think people are going to protest more .
There will be problems , more unrest .
Even the National Palace could be set on fire because we are in trouble . ”

The prime minister has defended the decision to compensate people who have lost money from tax changes , saying he was not " pushed about " by Labour MPs .
Gordon Brown told the BBC it was important to " judge what is right at every point " .
Earlier , facing a possible Labour rebellion over the abolition of the 10 p income tax rate , the government promised more help to low earners .
The Conservatives accused Mr Brown of " weakness , dithering and indecision " .
Backdated
In what has been widely seen as a U - turn forced by Labour rebels , Chancellor Alistair Darling said he would assess the loss to pensioners aged 60 to 64 and childless people from the abolition of the 10 p rate .
The compensation deal will be unveiled in the autumn and backdated to April .
Do you have any idea what a pathetic figure you cut today ?
David Cameron to Gordon Brown
In full : Darling 's letter Commons : Point - by - point Sketch : John Pienaar 's verdict Labour 's Frank Field responded by withdrawing his amendment , backed by 46 Labour MPs , calling for compensation .
Mr Brown told the BBC political editor Nick Robinson : " I do n't think I 've been pushed about at all .
" What I 've done is look and make the right long - term decisions . "
He added : " My whole mission in politics is to do what I can to help people ...
It means we have got to judge things right at every point . "
' New found ' interest Mr Brown made clear that the cost of the compensation package would be substantially lower than £ 1bn and he accepted that not all losers from the abolition of the 10 p tax rate would benefit .
At prime minister 's questions , Tory leader David Cameron accused Mr Brown of making " panic concessions " in the face of a possible backbench revolt next week .
He said : " Do you have any idea what a pathetic figure you cut today ?
HAVE YOUR SAY Despite being a gainer from these changes , I am appalled that the lowest paid are the losers Helen Higgs " You are making these changes because you thought you would lose the vote . "
Quoting a number of Labour figures who have questioned the prime minister 's handling of the affair , Mr Cameron said : " Is n't it the case that the Labour Party have finally worked out that they have a loser , not a leader ? "
Mr Brown countered that Mr Cameron's " new found " interest in poverty had " lasted a few seconds " .
He said the 10 p rate was not the best way to boost the incomes of the low paid , who had benefited from improvements in tax credits and the minimum wage under Labour .
' Penalising the poor ' ?
" The central issue is we have taken more people out of poverty than any previous government , " he told the Commons .
" The choice is very clear - between a Conservative Party that would cut the incomes of the poor and a Labour Party that will increase them . "
In a further attack , Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg accused Mr Brown of " doing the Tories ' job for them " by " penalising the poor " .

" You used to be a man of principle , but if you wo n't deliver on poverty , what on earth is the point of this increasingly pointless prime minister ? "
" The point is to have economic growth in this country , that gets more people into work and that could not happen under Liberal policies , " replied Mr Brown .
The government could offer a higher winter fuel allowance for pensioners aged 60 to 64 and new tax credits for low - paid workers without children .
But , while the Treasury has confirmed that it will back date extra winter fuel allowance payments , it said it is not in a position to say it can do the same for the tax credits .
Some Labour MPs have expressed concern because they were under the impression that all the compensation would be backdated .
Younger workers have been offered the prospect of a higher minimum wage paid for by employers - the Conservatives say this would affect only 172,000 workers , a small fraction of those affected .
In an interview with the BBC later , Mr Cameron said he would " welcome anything " that would help those worst hit .
But he said : " We will be checking to make sure there still are n't losers from the Budget and from what he 's planned , because with this prime minister always check the small print . "
In a letter outlining his proposals , the chancellor said the introduction of a " more generous " tax credits system had meant the 10 p tax rate , as a means of helping low - income households , had outlived its usefulness .

The film stars well - known Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah
A critically acclaimed Pakistani film on Islam has been released across cinemas in India .
It is the first Pakistani film to get a wide commercial release in India in over four decades .
Khuda Kay Liye ( In the Name of God ) focuses on the lives of Muslims after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States .
Officially , India and Pakistan have banned each other 's films since going to war in 1965 .
But in recent years , the two countries have made exceptions .
In 2003 , Pakistani film Khamosh Paani ( Silent Waters ) had a limited release in India .
In 2006 , Pakistan allowed three Indian films to be shown .
' Answer to West '
Khuda Kay Liye stars Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah .
Pakistani Shoaib Mansoor makes his debut as the film 's director .
" It 's been long that terrorism has been linked with Muslims and it has become synonymous with the community , " Shah said , the Reuters news agency reports .
" It was high time that an answer to this was given to the West ...
That is the only reason that this film has mostly been made in English , to cater to the western audiences . "
Bollywood film Taj Mahal was shown in Pakistan
The film had its premiere in Mumbai ( Bombay ) on Thursday evening .
" It is a very good movie and more films like this should be made , " Bollywood director Madhur Bhandarkar said .
" Khuda Kay Liye has been appreciated very much wherever it is screened and it is a very good bond between the two countries , " he said .
In 2006 , Pakistan approved three Indian films for screening .
These included Mughal - e- Azam , the 1960 classic starring Dilip Kumar and Madhubala ; Taj Mahal , a 2005 film starring Pakistani actress Sonia Jehan ; and the 1984 film Sohni Mahiwal .
More recently , Bollywood releases Welcome and Race have been shown in Pakistan .
Indian films are hugely popular in Pakistan and illicit copies are easy to find .
India 's Hindi- language film industry , which includes Bombay 's Bollywood movies , is the world 's largest by viewership .
US soldiers took to Iraq not only war and pain , or peace and freedom , as you prefer to conceive the situation , but also their cultures .
Graffiti as art or vandalism is natural part of contemporary US lifestyle .
Different kind of inscriptions colour , vandalize and communicate on walls , tanks , jeeps , rocks .
Graffiti writing
An example of soldier cultivating the hobby of graffiti writing can be spotted in “ Shef ” of “ BK ” crew .
Here some of its throw - ups and tags .
Another soldier having fun with colleagues :
Gangs members tag around representing proudly their affiliation .
The Gangster Disciples , Latin Kings and Vice Lords were born decades ago in Chicago ’s most violent neighborhoods .
Now , their gang graffiti is showing up 6,400 miles away in one of the world ’s most dangerous neighborhoods — Iraq .
Armored vehicles , concrete barricades and bathroom walls all have served as canvasses for their spray - painted gang art .
At Camp Cedar II , about 185 miles southeast of Baghdad , a guard shack was recently defaced with “ GDN ” for Gangster Disciple Nation , along with the gang ’s six - pointed star and the word “ Chitown , ” a soldier who photographed it said .
The graffiti , captured on film by an Army Reservist and provided to the Chicago Sun-Times , highlights increasing gang activity in the Army in the United States and overseas , some experts say .
Jeffrey Stoleson , an Army Reserve sergeant in Iraq , is seen in front of a barricade tagged with gang graffiti in March in Iraq .
Stoleson , who has been in Iraq for almost a year , says he has taken hundreds of photos of gang graffiti there .
Military and civilian police investigators familiar with three major Army bases in the United States — Fort Lewis , Fort Hood and Fort Bragg — said they have been focusing recently on soldiers with gang affiliations .
These bases ship out many of the soldiers fighting in Iraq .
“ I have identified 320 soldiers as gang members from April 2002 to present , ” said Scott Barfield , a Defense Department gang detective at Fort Lewis in Washington state .
“ I think that ’s the tip of the iceberg . ”
Of paramount concern is whether gang - affiliated soldiers ’ training will make them deadly urban warriors when they return to civilian life and if some are using their access to military equipment to supply gangs at home , said Barfield and other experts .
They do n’t try to hide it
Jeffrey Stoleson , an Army Reserve sergeant in Iraq for almost a year , said he has taken hundreds of photos of gang graffiti there .
In a storage yard in Taji , about 18 miles north of Baghdad , dozens of tanks were vandalized with painted gang symbols , Stoleson said in a phone interview from Iraq .
He said he also took pictures of graffiti at Camp Scania , about 108 miles southeast of Baghdad , and Camp Anaconda , about 40 miles north of Baghdad .
Much of the graffiti was by Chicago - based gangs , he said .
In civilian life , Stoleson is a correctional officer and co-founder of the gang interdiction team at a Wisconsin maximum - security prison .
Now he is a truck commander for security escorts in Iraq .
He said he watched two fellow soldiers in the Wisconsin Army National Guard 2nd Battalion , 127th Infantry , die Sept. 26 when a roadside bomb exploded .
Five of Stoleson ’s friends have been wounded .
Because of the extreme danger of his mission in Iraq , Stoleson said he does not relish the idea of working alongside gang members , whom he does not trust .
Stoleson said he once reported to a supervisor that he suspected a company of soldiers in Iraq was rife with gang members .
“ My E - 8 [ supervising sergeant ] told me not to ruffle their feathers because they were doing a good job , ” he said .
Stoleson said he has spotted soldiers in Iraq with tattoos signifying their allegiance to the Vice Lords and the Simon City Royals , another street gang spawned in Chicago .
“ They do n’t try to hide it , ” Stoleson said .
Army does n’t see significant trend
Christopher Grey , spokesman for the Army ’s Criminal Investigation Command , did not deny the existence of gang members in the military , but he disputed that the problem is rampant — or even significant .
In the last year , the Criminal Investigation Command has looked into 10 cases in which there was credible evidence of gang - related criminal activity in the Army , Grey said .
He would not discuss specific cases .
“ We recently conducted an Army - wide study , and we do n’t see a significant trend in this kind of activity , especially when you compare this with a million - man Army , ” Grey said .
‘ Lowering our standards ’
“ Sometimes there is a definition issue here on what constitutes gang activity .
If someone wears baggy pants and a scarf , that does not make them a gang member unless there is evidence to show that person is involved in violent or criminal activity , ” Grey said .
Barfield said Army recruiters eager to meet their goals have been overlooking applicants ’ gang tattoos and getting waivers for criminal backgrounds .
“ We ’re lowering our standards , ” Barfield said .
“ A friend of mine is a recruiter , ” he said .
“ They are being told less than five tattoos is not an issue .
More than five , you do a waiver saying it ’s not gang - related .
You ’ll see soldiers with a six - pointed star with GD [ Gangster Disciples ] on the right forearm . ”
Fort Lewis offers free tattoo removal , but few if any soldiers with gang tattoos have taken advantage of the service , Barfield said .
In interviews with the almost 320 soldiers who admitted they were gang members , only two said they wanted out of gangs , Barfield said .
None has been arrested for a gang - related felony on the base , Barfield said .
But some are suspected of criminal activity off base , he said .
“ They ’re not here for the red , white and blue .
They ’re here for the black and gold , ” he said , referring to the gang colors of the Latin Kings .
Barfield said most of the gang members he has identified are black and Latino .
He has linked white soldiers to racist groups such as the Aryan Nations .
Barfield acknowledged that the soldiers he pegged as gang members represent a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of soldiers based at Fort Lewis in the period he reviewed .
But he stressed that he only investigates a fraction of the soldiers on base .
Barfield said he normally identifies gang members during barracks inspections requested by unit commanders .
He interviews them about possible gang affiliation when he sees gang graffiti in their rooms , photos of a soldier flashing gang hand signals or a soldier with gang tattoos .
Learning urban warfare
“ I know there is a lot more going on here , ” he said .
“ I do n’t inspect off - base housing or married soldiers ’ housing . ”
The Gangster Disciples are the most worrisome street gang at Fort Lewis because they are the most organized , Barfield said .
Barfield said gangs are encouraging their members to join the military to learn urban warfare techniques they can teach when they go back to their neighborhoods .
“ Gang members are telling us in the interviews that their gang is putting them in , ” he said .
Joe Sparks , a retired Chicago Police gang specialist and the Midwest adviser to the International Latino Gang Investigators Association , said he is concerned about the military know - how that gang - affiliated soldiers might bring back to the streets here .
“ Even though they are ‘ bangers , they are still fighting for America , so I have to give them that , ” Sparks said .
“ The sound of enemy gunfire is nothing new to them .
I ’m sure in battle it ’s a truce — GDs and P Stones are fighting a common enemy .
But when they get home , forget about it . ”
Barfield said he knows of an Army private who fought valiantly in Iraq but still maintained his gang affiliation when he returned home .
The private , a Florencia 13 gang member from Southern California , spoke to Barfield of battling a 38th Street Gang member when they were civilians .
Then the 38th Street Gang member became a sergeant in the Army and the Florencia 13 member became a private .
They served in Iraq together , Barfield said .
“ They had exchanged blows in Inglewood [ a city near Los Angeles ] , but in the Army , they did get the mission done , ” he said .
“ The private is a decorated war veteran with a Purple Heart . ”
The private still has his gang tattoos and identifies himself as a Florencia 13 , Barfield said .
Marine killed cop in California
Barfield said a big concern is what such gang members trained in urban warfare will do when they return home .
He pointed to Marine Lance Cpl. Andres Raya , a suspected Norteno gang member who shot two officers with a rifle outside a liquor store in Ceres , Calif . , on Jan. 9 , 2005 , before police returned fire and killed him .
One officer died , and the other was wounded by the 19 - year - old Raya , who was high on cocaine .
Raya had spent seven months in Iraq before returning to Camp Pendleton near San Diego .
Photos of Raya wearing the gang ’s red colors and making gang hand signs were reportedly found in a safe in his room .
Hunter Glass , a Fayetteville , N.C. , police detective , said he has seen an increase in gang activity involving soldiers from nearby Fort Bragg .
A Fort Bragg soldier — a member of the Insane Gangster Crips — is charged with a gang - related robbery in Fayetteville that ended in the slaying of a Korean store owner in November , said Glass , a veteran of the elite 82nd Airborne based at Fort Bragg .
He estimated that hundreds of gang members are stationed at the base as soldiers .
“ I have talked to guys who say ‘ I ’m a SUR 13 [ gang member ] , but I am a soldier , ’ ” Glass said .
“ Although I see the [ gang ] problem as a threat , I do believe the majority of the military are good people and that many of those [ military officials ] that I have made aware of the situation have expressed concern in dealing with it .
It is safe to say that I am less worried about a gang war in the sand box [ Iraq ] but more about the one on our streets upon its end . ”
Glass has given presentations to military leaders in Washington , D.C. , about gang members in the military .
Sending flak jackets home
A law enforcement source in Chicago said police see some evidence of soldiers working with gangs here .
Police recently stopped a vehicle and found 10 military flak jackets inside .
A gang member in the vehicle told investigators his brother was a Marine and sent the jackets home , the source said .
Barfield said he knows of civilian gang members in the Seattle area who also have been caught with flak jackets that he suspects were stolen from Fort Lewis .
Barfield said he has documented gang - affiliated soldiers ’ involvement in drug dealing , gunrunning and other criminal activity off base .
More than a year ago , a soldier tied to a white supremacy group was caught trying to ship an assault rifle from Iraq to the United States in pieces , he said .
In Texas , the FBI is bracing for the transfer of gang - connected soldiers from Fort Hood in central Texas to Fort Bliss near El Paso as part of the nation ’s base realignments .
FBI Special Agent Andrea Simmons said gang - affiliated soldiers from Fort Hood could clash with civilian gang members in El Paso .
“ We understand that [ some ] soldiers and dependents at Fort Hood tend to be under the Folk Nation umbrella , including the Gangster Disciples and Crips , ” Simmons said .
“ In El Paso , the predominant gang , without much competition , is the Barrio Azteca .
We could see some kind of turf war between the Barrio Aztecas and the Folk Nation . ”
FBI agents have visited Fort Hood to learn about the gang activity on the base , Simmons said .
“ We found most of the police departments say they do see gang activity due to the military — soldiers and dependents , ” she said .
“ Our agents also have been in contact with Fort Bliss to discuss the issue . ”
Simmons said investigators may conduct background checks on soldiers relocating from Fort Hood to Fort Bliss to assess the level of the potential gang problem .
Barfield said he welcomes the FBI ’s scrutiny of gang members in the Army .
“ Investigators as a whole across the military are n’t getting the support to remove gang members from the ranks , ” he said .
But Grey , the spokesman for the Criminal Investigation Command , said the unit is open to any tips about gang activity in the Army .
“ If anyone has any information , we strongly recommend they bring it to our attention , ” he said .
Graffiti &
War is a dated connection , US maries used to tag and draw on walls and vehicles .
The most famous inscription was “ Kilroy was here ” .
Kilroy was here is an American popular culture expression , often seen in graffiti .
Its origins are open to speculation , but recognition of it and the distinctive doodle of “ Kilroy ” peeking over a wall is almost ubiquitous among U.S. residents who lived during World War II through the Korean War .
The same doodle also appears in other cultures , but the character peeping over the wall is not named Kilroy but Foo , i.e .
Foo was here .
In the United Kingdom , such graffiti are known as “ chads ” .
In Chile , the graphic is known as a “ sapo ” [ toad ] ; this may refer to the character ’s peeping , an activity associated with frogs because of their protruding eyes .
Origins
The phrase appears to have originated through United States servicemen , who would draw the doodle and the text “ Kilroy Was Here ” on the walls or elsewhere they were stationed , encamped , or visited .
Brewer ’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command , at least when observed in the United Kingdom .
One theory identifies James J. Kilroy , an American shipyard inspector , as the man behind the signature .
During World War II he worked at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard in Quincy , Massachusetts , where he claimed to have used the phrase to mark rivets he had checked .
The builders , whose rivets J. J. Kilroy was counting , were paid depending on the number of rivets they put in .
A riveter would make a chalk mark at the end of his or her shift to show where they had left off and the next riveter had started .
Unscrupulous riveters discovered that , if they started work before the inspector arrived , they could receive extra pay by erasing the previous worker ’s chalk mark and chalking a mark farther back on the same seam , giving themselves credit for some of the previous riveter ’s work .
J.J. Kilroy stopped this practice by writing “ Kilroy was here ” at the site of each chalk mark .
At the time , ships were being sent out before they had been painted , so when sealed areas were opened for maintenance , soldiers found an unexplained name scrawled .
Thousands of servicemen may have potentially seen his slogan on the outgoing ships and Kilroy ’s omnipresence and inscrutability sparked the legend .
Afterwards , servicemen could have begun placing the slogan on different places and especially in new captured areas or landings .
At some later point , the graffiti and slogan ( Kilroy was here ) must have merged .
The New York Times reported this as the origin in 1946 , with the addition that Kilroy had marked the ships themselves as they were being built — so , at a later date , the phrase would be found chalked in places that no graffiti-artist could have reached ( inside sealed hull spaces , for example ) , which then fed the mythical significance of the phrase — after all , if Kilroy could leave his mark there , who knew what else he could do ?
Author Charles Panati says , “ The mischievous face and the phrase became a national joke . ”
He continued to say , “ The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said , but where it turned up . ”
Kilroy is still known and used today by US Servicemen .
He has been seen scribbled on barriers on Main Supply Routes ( MSRs ) in Iraq and on warehouses in Taji , Iraq .
Legends
There are many legends attached to the Kilroy graffiti .
One states that Adolf Hitler believed that Kilroy was some kind of American super spy because the graffiti kept turning up in secure Nazi installations , presumably having been actually brought on captured Allied military equipment .
Another states that Stalin was the first to enter an outhouse especially built for the leaders at the Potsdam conference .
Upon exiting , Stalin asked an aide , “ Who is this Kilroy ? ”
Another legend states that a German officer , having seen frequent “ Kilroys ” posted in different cities , told all of his men that if they happened to come across a “ Kilroy ” he wanted to question him personally .
Another one states the entire gag was started by a soldier in the Army who was sick of the Air Force bragging that they were always the first on the scene ; the little man and phrase then began appearing in ludicrous places to indicate that someone had , in fact , arrived prior to the Air Force .
The graffiti is supposedly located on various significant and / or difficult - to - reach places such as on the torch of the Statue of Liberty , on the Marco Polo Bridge in China , in huts in Polynesia , on a high girder on the George Washington Bridge in New York , at the peak of Mt. Everest , on the underside of the Arc de Triomphe , scribbled in the dust on the moon , in WWII pillboxes scattered around Germany , around the sewers of Paris , and , in tribute to its origin , engraved in the WWII Memorial in Washington D.C .
The Transit Company of America held a competition in 1946 offering a real trolley car to the man who could verify he was the “ real Kilroy ” .
J. J. Kilroy brought his co-workers with him to prove that he was undeniably the true Kilroy .
The other forty or so men who showed up were not able to establish they were the “ real ” Kilroy .
Kilroy gave his prize to his nine children to play with in their front yard .
In conclusion , graffiti peacefully coexist with army but they are void .
I firmly prefer graffiti dedicated to war instead of graffiti in war .

We Need to Understand and Show Some Compassion
One of the savviest politicians of our generation , known for his wit , charm , and calm under extreme pressure , Bill Clinton appears out of character in the speeches and interviews televised since his bypass surgery September 6 , 2004 — and his mental deterioration may be accelerating .
Remember , this is the president who withstood public impeachment before the entire world for his relationship with Monica Lewinski without once losing control .
Now , he is easily angered by hecklers , and makes factual mistakes and racial slurs while aggressively defending his wife ’s campaign for presidency .
Everyone sees his mental and emotional decline , yet to date , no medical professionals have spoken out about the cause or offered help .
Not a single one — not one bypass surgeon , cardiologist or psychiatrist — has stepped forward in his defense ; even though all of them are trained to recognize “ post bypass surgery cognitive dysfunction . ”
One of the best - kept secrets in medicine is the brain damage caused during bypass surgery .
During my 40 years of medical practice I have never heard a doctor warn a patient before bypass surgery that an expected complication is memory loss .
After surgery when the family complains of dad ’s fits of anger , I have never heard a doctor admit that personality change is a common consequence of surgery .
Yet these well - recognized side effects have been reported in medical journals since 1969.1
Brain damage during bypass surgery is so common that hospital personnel refer to it as “ pump head . ”
The primary cause is emboli produced during surgery from clamping the aorta and from the “ heart - lung machine . ”
This machine pumps blood to keep the patient alive while the heart is stopped during the operation .
Unfortunately , this pump also introduces toxic gases , fat globules , and bits of plastic debris into the bloodstream of the patient under anesthesia .
Once they are in the bloodstream , these particles migrate to the brain where they can clog capillaries and prevent adequate amounts of blood and oxygen from flowing to the brain .
Essentially , all patients experience brain emboli during surgery and for many the damage is permanent .
In 2001 , an article in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 5 - years after bypass surgery 42 % of patients showed decline in mental function of approximately 20 percent or more .
2
A study published this year ( 2008 ) in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery using MRI testing just after bypass surgery found brain damage in 51 % of patients .
3
Three years after their time on the bypass pump , significant permanent reduction in mental capacity was identified in 31 % of patients .
I am not talking major stroke here ; but these patients can't remember names or numbers as they once did , experience sleep disturbances ( including nightmares ) , suffer mood swings , and lose intellectual acuity .
Approximately 30 percent of people suffer persistent depression and some even contemplate suicide .
Our former president needs our understanding and support .
A simple explanation by his doctors of the cause of his recent aberrant behaviors should bring peace of mind to Hillary and her campaign staff .
If Mr. Clinton better understood his current limitations , he and his staff could take precautionary steps to avoid embarrassments .
A long - overdue explanation would help his adoring public more easily accept his mistakes and readily forgive him .
It is not your fault , Mr. Clinton .
As importantly , public recognition of the harm done to Bill Clinton by the heart surgery business would help the patients who undergo bypass surgery , and their families , to better understand similar changes they have experienced .
A little attention from the media could also shine some light on the lack of survival benefits from this $ 90,000 procedure performed nearly half - a- million times annually in the US , and the superior benefits coming from diet and lifestyle changes .
I am saddened to see our former president suffer from public humiliation , but I am disgraced that my profession has thus far failed to come forward with a long over - due explanation and an apology to the Clintons and our nation for the harm they have done and the secrets they have kept .

I 'm not going to take a lot of your time this morning .
Not because I could n't go on and on about this , I could .
But it 's not necessary .
It 's simple .
Let 's start with this :
If you should run into Hillary or Barack on the campaign trail ask them the following question :
" If you become President of the United States of America , making your running mate the constitutional president of the US Senate , will you demand that the current Senate Majority Leader , Harry Reid , be replaced immediately ? "
It 's a critical question .
Harry Reid is , to put it mildly , the worst , most ineffective , mealy - mouth , wimp to lead the US Senate in my adult life time .
And he proved that again this week when he allowed the administration 's bill granting immunity to the telecoms to pass the Senate .
In effect what Reid did by allowing that legislation to pass is to ratify Richard Nixon 's stated belief that , " if the President does it it 's not illegal . "
Fortunately the House , under Nancy Pelosi 's leadership , showed more backbone than Reid and his Senate colleagues by refusing to ratify the Senate 's version giving the telecom 's a get - out - jail free card for aiding and abetting the administration 's illegal wiretapping .
Instead the House shelved the matter allowing the current authority to lapse this Saturday and took two weeks off .
This morning President Bush was on TV whining that refusing to grant the telecoms immunity will mean " it will be harder for us to get companies to cooperate with us in protecting you . "
The statement is correct , though worded incorrectly .
The correct way to put it is that , failing to provide telecoms protection from lawsuits will , " make it harder for us to get companies cooperate with us to protect you by illegally spying on you . "
To which I say , good .
It should make it harder , just as the threat of lawsuits make it 's harder for companies to screw consumers , which many companies would be delighted to do if they figured they could get away with it .
But also , and more importantly , the threat of lawsuits will force the telecoms to do a basic cost / benefit analysis before they pull a stunt like this again .
That analysis would go something like this :
- By helping the government spy on Americans the govenment owes us one the next time we want something from the government , be it legislation or regulatory favors .
- But , without immunity if the courts later find we broke the law it could cost of billions of dollars in damages , more than wiping out any gains we might garner by cooperating .
( Do notice that the top three recipients of telecom money are also the top three candidates for President -- Here )
What Harry Reid did last week was to assure that the telecoms would only see upside and no downside when faced with any similar requests from this or any other administration in the future .
The reason this is so important is that the nexus of big government and big business must always be viewed with the greatest attention and suspicion .
If history has taught us anything it's that it is at that nexus where seeds of corporate fascism geminate , and if allowed to grow , thrive .
Those seeds took root in a startlingly aggressive way under this administration .
Not only did major telecom companies comply with the administration 's request for assistance in its illegal warrantless wiretapping , but they did so with frightening gusto , efficiency and enthusiasm .

5 Kick - Ass Reasons to Give a Genuine Compliment , and How to Do It
â€ œA compliment is something like a kiss through a veil.â€ 
Victor Hugo
â€ œDo not offer a compliment and ask a favor at the same time .
A compliment that is charged for is not valuable.â€ 
Mark Twain
Compliments .
Some are sincere .
Some are quite the opposite .
Some like to get them .
Some feel a little uneasy and self - conscious about them .
And from time to time I think to myself that there is too few of them .
They are underused and underrated and are often forgotten amongst gossip , negative self - talk and complaints about the boss , the job , the weather and milk prices .
Negative observations about reality are plentiful .
Positive observations are much fewer .
So , here are 5 compelling reasons why itâ€™s a good choice to use more genuine compliments in your day to day life .
And a bit further down , three tips on how to give them .
You can make someoneâ€™s day .
Thatâ€™s a nice thing to do .
Increased positivity .
Keeping your focus on the positive parts in people expands your own positivity .
Youâ€™ll notice more positive things about yourself , your own life and other things in your surroundings .
What you focus on in your everyday life youâ€™ll see everywhere , not just in other people .
You get what you give .
Donâ€™t keep this in the forefront of your mind while giving a compliment .
It may make the compliment seem insincere and like you are just out to get something from the other person .
But still , people often have a strong feeling of wanting to give what they got .
Perhaps not right away , but over time reciprocity and a positive relationship can build .
And in general , what you give you tend to get back from the world around you .
Attractiveness .
Positivity , appreciation and being able to genuinely express yourself are three attractive traits both in personal and professional relationships .
People tend to want to hang around and work with people that have such traits .
Itâ€™s fun . :)
When you give a genuine compliment you ignite a spark of happy feelings inside of yourself .
Now , here are three tips for sharpening your compliment giving skills .
The compliment has to be genuine .
Otherwise you are just trying to take something from the one you are complimenting .
And that will not work so well .
Your insincerity will often shine through .
A compliment delivered with positive words but with a body language and voice tonality â€ “ the two most important parts of interpersonal communication â€ “ that arenâ€™t saying the same thing may often not go over so well .
And the rule that you get what you give still applies .
What you feel when you deliver the compliment will come through .
So make sure that there is a genuine feeling behind the words .
Cultivate a habit of appreciation .
This will let you discover all the genuinely nice things about people .
With this filter closed it will be harder to see the positive things in people and to give compliments that are actually totally genuine .
Try to appreciate the things around you – your home , friends , family , co-workers , computer , weather , food etc. – a few minutes a day to build this habit .
Compliment on something the other person feels is important to him / her .
It may be – at least in some cases – a good practise to not compliment on something that the other person doesnâ€™t have much control over .
Or something that he or she has been complimented on a thousand times before .
Looks and other more superficial stuff are examples of such things .
A compliment that is kinda expected will not be that powerful .
And even though your compliment is genuine it may just be lumped together with all those other similar and not so genuine compliments the person has recieved .
Instead , observe what makes this person tick .
What are his / her passions , qualities , interests and proudest achievements ?
What can you genuinely appreciate about those things ?
And finally , remember , pretty much no matter what the response is you can still feel good about giving a compliment .
As Seneca says in tip # 5 : how the other person responds – what s/he says or feels – isnâ€™t your responsibility .

Above : Film star John Travolta , who was rushed to UCLA Medical Center Monday with a near - fatal tone - scale reading of 0.5 .
LOS ANGELES -- Actor John Travolta was rushed to UCLA Medical Center Monday with a near - fatal tone - scale reading of 0.5 , or " grief . "
Travolta , who has since been upgraded to 2.5 , or " boredom , " was quickly revived by emergency - room technicians , attending physician Stephen Citarella said .
" Mr. Travolta was in extremely serious condition when he was brought in , but fortunately , he responded well to emergency touch - assist treatment and quickly began making rudimentary wins , " Citarella said .
" It 's just lucky that his emergent condition was discovered before he completely went out of affinity with MEST . "
Travolta , star of Perfect and Staying Alive , was at home at approximately 10 a.m. when he reported feeling faint .
A subsequent Electropsychometer audit by his personal physician revealed an alarmingly low tone , and he was assigned a condition of doubt and rushed to the hospital .
Doctors are still uncertain as to what caused the longtime Clear 's condition to deteriorate so rapidly .
" It is quite a puzzle , " UCLA Medical Center chief of staff Ronald Offerman said .
" Mr. Travolta 's reactive mind could be inhibited by an engram , if not secondaries and locks as well , throwing out the correctness of his computations .
But how an engram or even a chain could have entered the reactive mind of an Operating Thetan like Mr. Travolta is hard to explain . "
" This is more serious than mere overts and withholds , " UCLA 's Dr. Randy Ferber said .
" While more tests still need to be done , I suspect that an immense entheta implant , R6 or worse , has knocked Travolta down the bridge .
It may even be possible that this occurred far back on his time track , and I do n't have to tell you the shocking implications of that . "
Below : Travolta 's medical diagnosis .
Travolta 's hospitalization has sparked an outpouring of support :
The star has received thousands of cards , flowers and letters from concerned fans and fellow celebrities , including Tom Cruise , Kirstie Alley , Chick Corea and internationally renowned rock bassist Billy Sheehan .
While many experts believe Travolta 's illness is engram - related , Dr. Tobias Welch , the star 's personal physician , has not ruled out the possibility that the problem occurred during training for OT Levels .
" John may have been given some squirreled tech , in which case we would have to involve the RTC and unhat his Course Supervisor , " Welch said .
" This condition could have been exacerbated if he read some training materials and went past a word he did n't understand . "
Misunderstood words are one of three barriers to learning identified by Welch , a revolutionary in the field of education as well as a master cinematographer , adventurer , philosopher , author , poet , humanitarian , administrator , yachtsman , artist , composer , lyricist , war hero and nuclear physicist .
When asked whether Travolta 's condition could be traced to Xenu , the intergalactic overlord who imprisoned countless thetans on Earth 75 million years ago , Welch said : " I do n't know what you 're talking about . "
Doctors have also left open a small but distinct possibility that Travolta -- who was slated to begin work this week on his next film , the sci - fi epic Battlefield Earth - - was poisoned .
" Certainly , a chemical contamination might be the explanation , " Citarella said .
" His food or water could have been tampered with by a wog , or maybe even an SP .
Or , a psychiatrist or some other dead agent might have poisoned him with the killer drug Prozac , though it would 've had to have been a very small amount to explain the minor extent of damage .
But Mr. Travolta will be given a full Purif Rundown , just to be safe . "
While no charges have been filed , Travolta 's wife , actress Kelly Preston , was called in for " routine questioning " Tuesday by LAPD officials , who have left open the possibility that she somehow enturbulated her husband .
" We can not afford to rule out anything at this point , " LAPD spokesperson Frank Pistone said .
" Mr. Travolta 's wife may be a Potential Trouble Source , or even , shocking as it may seem , suppressive . "
If found to be suppressive , Preston could be RPFed , declared or even disconnected by Travolta .
Kevin Hassett , economics advisor to John McCain , is quoted today as saying :
What really happens is that the economy grows more vigorously when you lower tax rates .
It is beyond the reach of economic science to explain precisely why that happens , but it does .
Now you can be excused for thinking that the first of these statements is true , if you have an economically sound reason for it .
But if you do n't , you should n't .
Let 's call it no longer supply - side economics .
It is faith - based economics .
March 23 , 2008  -- Sen. Chuck Hagel , R - Neb. , said this morning he is not ready to endorse Sen.
John McCain , R - Ariz. , for president .
" I think endorsements , at least when I endorse someone , or when I work for someone , or commit to someone , I want to be behind that person in every way I can , " Hagel said in an exclusive " This Week " interview .
Hagel pointed to their differing views over foreign policy in explaining his hesitation .
" I 've obviously got some differences with John on the Iraq war .
That 's no secret .
I want to understand a little more about foreign policy , where he'd want to go .
Certainly does n't put me in Obama or Clinton 's camp .
But John and I have some pretty fundamental disagreements on the future of foreign policy , " he said .
The Foreign Relations Committee member also fielded questions on his view of the troop surge in light of McCain 's strong support of the troop increase .
Hagel defended himself against suggestions that he had opposed the troop surge .
" That 's not what I said .
I said , what you will do is , you will further bog yourselves down into a situation , making the Iraqis more dependent on you , making it more difficult to get out .
In the end , you 're not going to be any closer to a political reconciliation , " he explained .
Hagel decline to comment when asked if he agreed with the timetables for troop withdrawal put forth by the Democratic candidates , but did note that " we need a clear plan , and yes , withdrawal .
We 're going to have to start working our way out of this .
How we do it must be responsibly .
We 're in a deep hole .
I think we 're in a quagmire .
But at the same time , we have national interests there .
We have allies there . "
He went on to admit that " I have n't really looked at their plans ... I do n't know what their plans are .
I know what they 've said , that they want to bring troops out of there .
I know that .
I 've never seen the specifics of how they want to do that responsibly , the timeline , as I know we 've debated general timelines in the Congress .
I 've never looked at it . "
On his political future , Hagel responded to rumors that he would be a possible Secretary of Defense in an Obama administration .
" I'm a long way from that .
First of all , we do n't know who the next president 's going to be .
I do n't expect to be in government next year .
I do n't look forward to being in government next year .
I 've had a great 12 years . "
The ads , which appear 15 seconds after a user begins watching a video clip , take the form of an overlay on the bottom fifth of the screen , not unlike the tickers that display headlines during television news programs .
A user can ignore the overlay , which will disappear after about 10 seconds , or close it .
But if the user clicks on it , the video they were watching will stop and a video ad will begin playing .
Once the ad is over , or if a user clicks on a box to close it , the original video will resume playing from the point where it was stopped .
“ What we have come up with is a user - controlled ad format that is engaging , ” said Eileen Naughton , Google ’s director for media platforms .
“ We want our users to be able to accept and choose what type of advertising they engage in . ”
For now , Google will place the ads only on video clips of its content partners — the more than 1,000 small and large media companies that have licensed their videos to YouTube .
By doing so , YouTube will avoid the potential liability of having ads appear on copyrighted clips it is not authorized to display .
And it will also prevent ads from playing on clips generated by users whose message may not be to the liking of advertisers .

Ms. Naughton said Google would charge advertisers $ 20 for every 1,000 times the ads were displayed .
Google said the ads would begin appearing today throughout the site .
Ms. Naughton also said advertisers would be able to take aim at specific channels and genres , as well as demographic profiles , geography and hour of the day .

I just had two super - efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs ( CFLs ) burn out on me , which surprised me since they ’re only about a year old .
Then again , my husband does leave the bathroom light on a lot … .
At any rate , the rest of my bulbs are still going strong , even after several years for most of them .
Here ’s a great video on CFL 101 .
Tip of the hat to Dave over at e-Strategy blog .

The bad news ; the worse news
You 've been reading the newspaper again , have n't you ?
I warned you about that .
Also , you 've been listening to those cable news programs , or checking in with NPR , yes ?
I knew it .
And now you are in despair .
You think you are entirely screwed .
And you 're right .
Sorry .
Do you own a home ?
Congratulations !
Your home is now worth less than it used to be .
I hope you did n't do anything foolish with regard to interest rates on your home loan , because you could be in trouble .
No , you probably are in trouble .
And the government is going to save you !
It 's going to send you $ 600 !
Is n't that nice ?
Is that enough to make any difference ?
Of course not .
So go blow it on consumer electronics or designer shoes .
We need to get the economy going , and your patriotic duty is to spend , even if your mortgage is shaky .
Some misguided people might be telling you to save money because eventually you will be very old and will need it , but you 're not going to get old , are you ?
I know I 'm not .
Oh , but suppose you did all the right things and you have a fixed - rate mortgage or maybe your home is even paid off .
And you invested in nice , safe stocks .
Oops .
Well , those are n't doing so well , are they ?
Somebody 's getting rich on the stock market , but it is n't you .
Are you keeping your money in cash ?
I hope it 's not in a bank .
Banks are n't doing so well right now , in part because they lent money to people who are n't nearly as responsible as you are .
You could have told them it was a bad idea , but they did n't ask you .
Why ?
Oh , you know , quick profits .
Short - term thinking - the kind of thinking that you , as a prudent American , have been avoiding .
Apparently , prudence is one of those virtues they preach to the rubes to keep them quiet , like patriotism or piety .
Oh , if you had only been imprudent and stashed the money in the Bahamas .
Why did n't you become the CEO of a fabulously imprudent company ?
That 's where the real money is .
That 's all right , you 're employed .
You 've worked hard and you are a valued employee .
And yes , oops again , where did your job go ?
You 've been downsized or outsourced .
Your skill set has become outmoded .
Or perhaps you are a younger person , and you have the energy and optimism of youth .
I hope you have a wealthy family , oh young person , because the job you 're going to get wo n't pay for your daily muffin .
But the service industry is so fulfilling , yes ?
Plus , you get to wear that cute little vest .
Or maybe you are a young person with a profession , and $ 100,000 worth of student loans , and you are working 19 - hour days and taking abuse from your superiors , all of whom are crabby because their mortgages cost more per month than they make .
Just a hint :
Do n't count on that pension .
It 's invested in the same junk that everything else is invested in .
Oh , and here 's the best bit of advice : Do n't get sick .
It 's such a bad idea .
If you have insurance , you will immediately realize that getting sick involves going to war with your insurance company - and it 's supposed to be on your side .
Have you seen its ads ?
And your insurers are fighting you so hard because their stockholders are demanding ever higher profits , and if they do n't deliver , the stockholders will sell and the stock will plummet and they 'll get fired too .
Wo n't that be exciting , working at the Olive Garden right next to the woman who refused to authorize your chemotherapy payments ?
You could always marry well .
Do n't marry a rich and powerful man , though , because the next thing you know he 's been videotaped nuzzling someone named Amber , who is a professional nuzzler .
And do n't get divorced , either , because there 's serious financial hardship involved .
And kids - do n't get me started .
You know about goody bags ?
Oh , you 'll weep .
Maybe that disease you get could be immediately fatal .
That may be your best option .
That , or musical comedy .

A pedestrian passes in front of the Federal Reserve Building in Washington January 22 , 2008 .
The White House said on Friday that it was disappointed in the biggest monthly decline in nearly five years in U.S. job payrolls and that the current quarter would be difficult for the U.S. economy .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Friday said he was concerned about the U.S. economy which had clearly slowed .
“ I know Americans are concerned about our economy , so am I , ” Bush said to reporters .
“ It ’s clear our economy has slowed , but the good news is we anticipated this and took decisive action to bolster the economy by passing a growth package that will put money into the hands of American workers and businesses . ”
He spoke after the Labor Department said U.S. payrolls fell by 63,000 in February , and the Federal Reserve announced emergency measures to ease liquidity strains in the banking system .
“ We believe that the steps we ’ve taken together with the actions taken by the Federal Reserve will have a positive effect on our economy , ” Bush said , adding that the government had provided the economy with a “ booster shot , ” and the impact would start to be seen in the coming months .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) People of the world , the US Government is planning to poison more than two million people , in California , using an untested biological " pesticide " this summer .
The chemical to be sprayed is classified by the EPA as a " pesticide " and the plan is to douse cities with this chemical designed to stick on everything for 90 days or longer .
This application is not a one time event , but will continue every 1 - 3 months for as long as five years .
The pesticide to be sprayed is not designed to harm the light brown apple moth 's who it is designed for , but merely to confuse its mating habits .
While harmless to moths , the pesticide has been documented to harm humans .
Side effects range from vomiting and flu like systems , to male and female reproductive cycle disruption .
One child nearly died from the exposure , and some people have developed asthma from being exposed to this chemical concoction .
It is cause forthat a chemical being labeled as harmless and " safe " even in minute doses , causes severe health effects in some people .
The government is racing to cover up and hide the dangerous health effects so that they can continue their aerial spray plans this summer .
Your attention and action on this subject is needed in the most important way .
On January 24th , 2008 , United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Secretary Chuck Conner announced the availability of $ 74.5 million in emergency funding to combat the light brown apple moth ( LBAM ) infestation in California ( 1 ) .
President Bush 's recent budget proposal sent to Congress sets aside $ 330 Million to eradicate plant pests , like the Light Brown Apple Moth .
With crime , prison crowding , pollution , poverty , budget problems and the like , why should the government go through the effort to try to control the reproductive habits of a moth ?
While most people say the answer is money , a far more sinister plan seems to be at hand .
It is unprecedented to design a long term plan to spray chemicals on people , which are untested for safety .
This plan violates a myriad of state , federal and international laws .
On February 13th , 2008 , the CDFA and USDA , in conjunction , announced their action plan for aerial spraying untested poison on people .
This is from the CDFA Press Release " Aerial treatments are expected to begin June 1 in the infested areas of Monterey and Santa Cruz counties , with subsequent aerial treatments expected to begin August 1 in San Francisco , Daly City , Colma , Oakland , Piedmont , Emeryville , Albany , El Cerrito , El Sobrante , Tiburon and Belvedere .
The treatments in these areas are designed to be reapplied at 30 - to 90 - day intervals while the moths are active . "
( 4 ) In late 2007 , there were 643 documented health complaints ( www.1hope.org/SPRAYCOMPLES.PDF ) from the aerial spray program conducted in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties .
Keep in mind that this documentation is a mere fraction of the real health effects , as no legitimate effort was made to inform even doctors on how to recognize pesticide poisoning .
Many doctors also refused to report suspected pesticide poisoning as required by law , and in order for a report to get officially filed , many times the patient had to insist upon it .
These health injuries are not being honored in any way , because if they are honored , this sick chemical spray will be seen for what it is .
It is a poison to many humans and likely to many other animals as well .
I have a difficult time swallowing that a chemical compound designed to disrupt a moth 's mating cycle can accidentally create reproductive health problems .
There are many who believe that this spray is not directed at the moth population which the government says is the goal of the spray , but rather that it is directed at humans .
There is a growing body of evidence to support this claim , considering that the moth itself does not cause any crop damage .
It is similar to the government deciding that we must eradicate all the ants , because ants cause millions of dollars of damage .
Like ants , the light brown apple moth is a harmless pest .
Another strange observation is the name of the mating disruption chemical Checkmate .
In order to pull off the deployment of this biological chemical , a hoax , or reason for aerial spraying had to be created .
That reason is called the Light Brown Apple Moth infestation .
The second requirement to pull off releasing a massive chemical cloud of disease , is to trick people into believing it is safe .
This whole aerial spray program depends on the belief that the chemicals to be sprayed are safe .
Since the chemicals planned to be deployed have never been sprayed over cities before , and are even being developed as I write , and thus have not been proven safe for humans , this is by the facts a large scale experiment .
The question people should ask is , " why ? "
While it may be just coincidence , a recent article displays this headline : " Top - secret Livermore anti-germ lab opens . "
( 2 ) This same lab , has routinely exploded thousands of pounds of lethal , chemically toxic , and radioactive Depleted Uranium in the greater San Francisco Bay area 's air for the past fifty years ( 3 ) .
When people hear about this aerial spray , many people experience a sinking feeling in the pit of their stomach .
This is truly a sickening action .
The government is willfully breaking countless laws in order to combat a stupid leaf rolling moth that curls up into the leaves of some plants and that does n't cause any crop damage .
It has not caused crop damage or embargo's in Hawaii over the past 100 years , so why would it cause damage in California ?
No ounce of sanity can explain why the government must insist on violating countless laws to spray people with never before tested chemicals , except as to realize a deadly game is being played .
Unlike the horrible malathion spraying over 20 years ago , which was a one - time ordeal with chemicals that evaporate , this spraying is a time release microscopic device , which will be continuously applied , short of the winter months , for up to five years .
Even five years of spraying will at best reduce slightly the moth population , as pest control experts explain that mating disruption technology is used as a small part of an overall pest management plan .
Pretty much any pest control expert , except for those on the government take , will tell you that the light brown apple moth cannot be eradicated , and that even if it could , the mating disruption technology is not the best means to do it .
Since aerial spraying is to be the sole method of controlling the light brown apple moth in many locations , then even after many years of spraying , the moth will still be alive .
It is not sane to spray people with chemicals .
That begs attention , there is not any hard evidence that the spray even works at all .
In fact on the EPA 's own website , there 's an article about pheromones released from microcapsules , it states : " The studies show that only a small proportion of the microcapsules actually release any pheromone . "
( 5 ) This is now clear and reprehensible evidence of State and Federal Governments attempting to commit a large scale crime against the American people .
Let us forget about supposed terrorists for a second whose propagandized images are placed on the television , and lets pay attention to this biological attack planned on our fellow neighbors .
The presence of a minuscule pest , is no excuse to douse millions with chemicals .
There are NO CROPS IN CITIES !
So why are they going to spray cities ?
The LBAM infestation is a monumental hoax designed as a cover for an operation of devious goals to expose people to dangerous chemicals over several years .
Following is a link to a recently published proposal of spray boundaries , the yellow lines indicating the proposed spray zones ( www.hopefortruth.com/lbam_2008.jpg ) .
More than two million people who live in these and other targeted cities are scheduled to be exposed this summer to chemicals that that have never been tested on humans or animals before .
Let me repeat : the government of the United States is conducting a human biological experiment , on a massive scale , breaking State , Federal and International laws .
Children , pregnant women , and the sick and elderly will be most as risk to this increased exposure to long lasting chemicals .
Chemicals which are newly designed , chemicals which have not been proven safe .
Just like the reproductive health effects reported from the spray , it is important to realize that a large team of " experts " working on this project do not mistakenly douse people with chemicals .
This is done on purpose , with a purpose .
Does it make sense to douse over two million people with literally hundreds of billions of microscopic balls of volatile chemicals over an extended period of time to try to limit the mating habits of a few thousand moths ?
Is it legal to do this ?
Is it ethical ?
Is it moral ?
Yet rather than halting the spray plans to investigate the damage it has done to many people , the spray plans continue to grow exponentially .
To see this insanity clearly , let 's examine the moth population .
In San Francisco County , 3,501 moths total have been trapped and killed over an eight month period .
The entire city of San Francisco , whose population is 744,041 , is in the proposed spray boundaries .
About 744,000 people are to be exposed to ' never tested safe for humans , microencapsulated pheromones ' for several years .
This is really a needle in the haystack approach to pest control .
Keep in mind , each moth found is a moth that has been trapped and exterminated ( 6 ) .
In Alameda County , 431 months have been found in the past 8 months out of 2,327 traps .
The moth population in Alameda County is thus sparse at best .
Just look out your window .
Imagine how many insects are in the tree , the yard , or the local park .
I have seen more than 431 ants crawl into my kitchen on a rainy day .
So in a giant area of 141 square miles , and the tens or hundreds of millions of insects in that zone , to try to eradicate a few hundred moths by just spraying chemicals everywhere is both ludicrous and unsafe .
When I learned that Santa Cruz , my previous hometown was to be aerially sprayed , I was in a state of shock .
This was followed by a long period of disbelief .
Apparently the CDFA or the USDA , or both , decided that the previous chemical formulas used , Checkmate LBAM-F and Checkmate OLR - F were not good enough , which really points to the fact that the past two aerial sprays in Monterey , and the one in Santa Cruz County , were a waste of time and money .
Not to mention the tragedy of the many severe health reactions experienced by thousands of people from chemical exposure .
It does n't matter to those in charge at the CDFA , EPA , or USDA , if a new chemical is needed to be used , because the goal is not to stop the moth , the moth cannot be stopped , it can only be controlled .
This is known .
The goal may be to coat people with a toxic mesh of disease causing microcapsules .
The chemicals that were sprayed , and that are planned on being sprayed , have not undergone thorough safety evaluations .
And they wo n't undergo such evaluations in a legitimate way , because if they did , they would prove only one thing - that these chemicals are potentially deadly .
The chemicals planned to be sprayed will no doubt be similar to the ones used in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties in 2007 .
They are a plastic encapsulated microtechnology , a microscopic plastic dust .
The reported microcapsule size of the aerial mating disrupter is as small as 10 microns and averages 25 - 35 microns in size for an undeployed moth spray .
For comparison , a human hair is approximately 70 microns in thickness .
The size of these chemical containing plastic balls comes suspiciously close to micro-sized particles that are used to evade the body 's defensive systems for biological weapons , those are reported to be 3 - 4 microns in size .
Miniature particles between 2.5-10 microns in size , especially from pesticides , are known to cause both short term and long term health effects , including decreased overall life span .
A University of California at Davis report confirmed that some unsprayed and undegraded microcapsules are indeed 10 microns in size .
The small particle size explains the severe reactions , that I , along with countless others have had when being exposed to minute dosages of the chemical .
Minute dosages of chemicals designed for moth 's , advertised as harmless , .
In other words , the people who designed these chemicals and manufactured them had to have an intimate understanding of what each chemical does , and how they react with each other .
So , too , should the EPA have this understanding .
It is not unreasonable to assume that a chemical designed to stop moths , that is being sprayed on humans , would have such drastic health effects , but it does .
The only conclusion is that this is intentional in the design .
Imagine someone designing a " safe " car .
If this " safe " car had no brakes , then nobody would assume that the car accidentally had no brakes .
Likewise , chemicals designed for moths , in minuscule doses , cannot accidentally harm people .
It is more than just chance .
Again , nobody in the public as of yet knows how small the degraded microcapsules are , or how this will effect people in the short and long term , because no such testing exists .
Once sprayed , these microscopic balls can easily enter deep into the mouth , eyes , skin and lungs .
Even after 90 days and several rains , some people in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties are still experiencing symptoms of spray poisoning .
When they leave the counties , their symptoms many times abate .
This aerial program is a real sword through the heart of democracy and decency .
The government has really gone too far and it must be stopped now .
I must inform you that through a freedom of information request , a local newspaper has learned that the CDFA has hired media spin doctor extraordinaire Porter Novelli at the tune of almost $ 500,000 tax payer dollars to convince the public that it is okay for the state to dump chemicals all over them , their gardens , their pets , and their neighbors .
The state of California is in a budget crisis , and this is one example that explains why .
Here the state is using tax payer dollars to lie to and mislead the public , to try to convince the public that the state should be spending millions of dollars of resources on polluting the air , sea , and land with chemicals that the public in general does not want or need .
Since a majority of spray funding is coming from the federal arm , know that your tax paying dollars are going to a government sponsored large scale crime .
Originally , the USDA announced that the moth might cause $ 100 million in crop damage if allowed to multiply .
Then they keep expanding their figures to create false reasons to justify this unethical chemical assault .
The most recent estimate of LBAM damage is $ 160 million to $ 640 million just in California .
Mind you this moth has a hard time finding its way into crop fields and seems for some very bizarre reason to live only in cities .
The estimate of this level of crop damage is absurd .
The figures used to estimate the damage came from one particular year in Australia and have little meaning in California , as the climate is different .
Even if this $ 160 million crop loss did come true , one has to consider that $ 90 million has now been ear marked to contain the moth , primarily the funds are for aerial spraying chemicals on cities which contain people , and not crops like apples , oranges and grapes .
One expert estimates that if the CDFA stays on this track , by the time the aerial treatment is complete after five years , close to $ 500 million will be spent on aerial eradication .
With little to no impact on the apple moth population .
The pheromone being used , ( E ) - 11 - Tetradecen - l-y Acetate is identical to pheromone 's which many native moths and perhaps other species also contain .
So this spray will effect other non-target species .
The pheromone only represents between 10 - 20 % of the ingredients of the aerial spray .
Now , organizations like the Breast Cancer Fund , Center For Environmental Health , Calpirg , and the Sierra Club are issuing statements opposed to aerial spraying .
The CDFA , USDA , and EPA will do anything and everything to convince , lie , cajole and get people to agree with the plan to spray chemicals .
The facts of this situation are irrelevant to those in charge because the goal is to spray people , not to operate under the laws of this constitutional government of checks and balances .
They are going to go to meetings , pretend it is safe , have doctors testify it is safe , pretend to listen to the public , ignore any health complaints , and try to lull people into complacency on the matter .
They have even gone as far as promising an environmental review , which will contain a giant pile of documents again to try to prove that it is okay to spray people with chemicals .
The CDFA will continue to find more moth finds , and create more fake evidence of how much harm the moth will do .
They will get more money from Mr. Bush 's pesticide funds and continue to enlarge their aerial spray program .
Strangely the moth will continue to spread , finding its way into other cities , and in the coming years , cities like Los Angeles and San Diego will be targeted .
Knowing that the government is actively lying , hiding evidence , manipulating the public , and that they are spraying chemicals illegally on people should be enough evidence to convict these felons under Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) laws .
These 643 health injury reports represent a fraction of the real injuries .
The actual spray has surely caused thousands to be poisoned from this biochemical formulation .
See my related article ( www.naturalnews.com/022434.html ) .
Despite these reports which include 330 official illness claims filed with the CDFA , the CDFA states the following lies on their website , " Pheromones are extremely safe " and " Public safety is the primary concern . "
The statement that pheromones are safe is a misleading distorted truth .
Sure , pheromones can be safe when used responsibly , for example a benign moth sticky trap in an apple orchard ( away from people ) that contains pheromones to attract the moths .
But when you create a microscopic biodegradable ball of volatile chemicals , and then place within it a synthetic moth pheromone , which itself is described as an explosive chemical , you have more of a drug which can interact and create changes within the human body , than a pesticide .
Furthermore , no thorough investigation has been done of these 330 official illness complaints , and some of these people have not yet recovered .
And a further investigation wo n't be done , because a legitimate investigation would find that the spray made people sick , and thus , the aerial spray program would be halted .
One must realize that any documentation regarding the safety of pheromones reported is from non-aerial applications , such as a moth sticky trap that is scented with pheromones and stuck on a tree , or a pheromone laced twist tie applied to apple orchards or vineyards .
These safety assertions also do not relate to the aerial method of application .
A sticky trap laced with pheromones is a different entity than a microscopic ball that can easily enter the body and then biodegrade and release chemicals within the body .
Part of the less dangerous aspect to pheromone laced traps is the fact that the pheromone is so volatile that it rapidly evaporates , so the chemical wo n't travel too far .
The microcapsules are the opposite , they are designed to stick around in the air for months .
They are infinitely more dangerous than sticky traps , and you cannot really compare them .
It 's like saying that a tank is the same as a motorcycle because they are both vehicles .
Microcapsulated pheromones are a different beast than pheremone laced moth traps .
The newly designed chemicals , which are scheduled for June and August deployment will not have their ingredients disclosed to the public .
We do not even know what this stuff is ?
How can the government say the chemicals are safe , and then hide the ingredients from scrutiny ?
If these chemicals are so safe why not tell us honestly what they are ?
Clearly the intention of the CDFA , USDA , and EPA , is to cover up the real nature of this biochemical assault .
They are trying to hide what they do from the public 's eye .
They do not want you to know the truth .
The truth is people get sick .
Not everybody gets sick from the moth spray , but many people do .
Its effects can be strong and violent .
The truth is , the US Government is a vehicle being used to poison us .
The CDFA reports that they want their newest moth weapon deployed this summer , to be even longer lasting , which to me means that the microcapsules will be even more dangerous , possibly indefinitely sticking in the environment , and irritating people 's sensitive ducts and glands ; much like allergies from pollen .
In each aerial application , spray planes are contracted through Dynamic Aviation ( www.dynamicaviation.com/home.htm ) , which has other specialties beyond aerial application of pesticides .
They also do " Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance . "
The spraying is conducted at a height of between 500 - 800 feet and residents in the sprayed area report feeling like they are in a war zone .
Once in contact with residential neighborhoods , parks , and playgrounds , the balls slowly disintegrate over time .
The hope is that during this time , they release pheromones and limit the moth 's mating patterns .
Again , this is a whimsical hope because no legitimate studies exist proving this new technology is effective at either releasing pheromones , or at stopping the moth 's mating habits .
Typically a drug takes many years for the Food and Drug Administration to approve for safety for humans .
Under an emergency declaration , the EPA can exclude new chemicals from rigorous testing .
The catch to this exception is that these laws were designed for agricultural emergencies and are being violently misused because they are planning on spraying large urban populations and not agricultural zones .
These laws cannot lawfully apply to cities .
Among other things , we have legal control and authority of our bodies , and our properties .
We can say " No " to the spray , and if necessary , defend ourselves from this highly toxic assault .
The EPA and USDA have flagrantly crossed legal and ethical boundaries by applying laws designed for agricultural fields to densely inhabited city centers .
Further , consider that the testing of these chemicals is not done to make sure that it is safe for humans , as the safety is merely an untested assumption .
As an example , it took several months after the first aerial spray of Monterey County for the CDFA to pay the University of California Davis to see if the Checkmate formula was toxic to certain very small ocean insects .
It took several months for this first test of the Checkmate formula to be conducted .
This test only happened after the chemical was sprayed on well over two hundred thousand people .
The testing being conducted in New Zealand is not to ensure safety for humans , but to see if the mating habits of the moths are disrupted .
This spraying is illegally approved by the EPA because Congress passed legislation to legally prevent the EPA from conducting human experiments .
" EPA 's rules make it clear that all pregnant women , all nursing women , and all children are excluded from all studies involving intentional exposure that are intended for submission under the pesticide laws . "

How many more children do we need to see poisoned by these indefensible government actions until we wake up and say , !
How many more of our friends , relatives and neighbors do we need to see develop chronic health conditions due to exposure to aerially sprayed chemicals until we take effective action to stop this insanity ?
How much longer are we going to allow the government that is created for the people , to represent the people , to break its own laws and poison its own people and then disregard any reported health concerns ?
I call for the arrest and trial of the appropriate employees in the CDFA , EPA , and USDA , for conspiring to poison people of the State of California , for lying and deceiving the public , and for polluting our environment . *
Share this information with your friends and neighbors .*
Ask your California representative to support the following bills - 1 ) AB 2765 , ( Huffman ) sets new limits on the emergency powers of the Department of Agriculture .
2 ) AB 2763 would enact the Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008 , by Assemblymember John Laird.3 ) AB 2764 ( Hancock ) will prohibit the Secretary of Food and Agriculture from approving theapplication of a pesticide in an urban area , unless the Governor has proclaimed a state ofemergency .
4 ) AB 2760 ( Leno ) would require the completion of an EIR before any pesticide could be applied inan urban area .
Also , State Senator Carole Migden plans to file for a moratorium on aerial spraying .*
Do n't be fooled when the CDFA says that the " pheromone " is safe .
I have been poisoned myself by these microcapsules , and so has my family , it is a terrible feeling .
Ask for test results to show it is safe for humans , you 'll see they have none . *
Demand accountability .
Ask your local California representative why they are continuing to allow the state to spray chemicals on people , even though the state has laws , like the state constitutional right to personal safety , and legislative laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act , meant to prevent such actions .
Your state representative can amend or modify the LBAM law that went into affect that gave the CDFA the unanimous green light to eradicate the apple moth .
Surely your representative does not support aerial spraying ?
Each county has to have their local agricultural commissioner or someone to that effect to sign a permit to allow the state to spray .
Stop these people from signing the permit !*
State and Federal representatives can also design an independent committee to come up with non-biased recommendations .
The CDFA created such a working group , but they strangely seem to believe that aerial spraying people to stop moths from mating is a good idea . *
Gather your local city council members ' support .
Use local resources to conduct research , and file lawsuits against the state . *
Ideally the city attorneys and mayors should file legal suits against CDFA , the EPA and the USDA for polluting the air and water , for violating State and Federal laws , and for planning to create large scale poisoning .*
Contact your US Senate and House Representatives , and ask them to stop or at least investigate federal funding from the USDA for the aerial spray program .
Federal officials can also declassify this tiny moth from a class A pest .
Ask them to strengthen protections so that populations cannot be aerially sprayed unless there is a grave and immediate danger to public health . *
Additional Note :
If the aerial spray does occur , take samples .
Put a turkey baster - sized aluminum tray in your back yard .
Put the tray out on the night prior to the aerial spray , and another on the night of the aerial spray .
Seal each tray well .
Each city should organize its own tests of the chemicals , including tests for biological agents , contaminants , radioactive substances , and a microscope analysis to see how big the microcapsules are , and to see if the microcapsules contain miniature microcapsules .
Analysis ideally should also include a detailed chemical profile of the substance sprayed , since the government wo n't tell us what it is .
Finally , the way I see it , it is a crime to poison children and our fellow people who live in California .
Just because the people who are polluting and poisoning the air with chemicals work for the government , should not make them immune to criminal liability and prosecution .
Unfortunately , no city officials , yet , have the decency and standards to attack this matter for what it is , a crime .
Crimes require criminal investigations , and criminal charges .
People can be alarmed , and if cities take equitable action , we do not need to be afraid .
For example , we pay taxes so we can have a fire and police department to protect ourselves from crimes .
Why not use the police force to protect residents from government sponsored crimes ?
Many of the actions of the CDFA fall under the category of illegal activities .
The police force are the people on the local level , given the right and authority to protect people from crimes .
The media creates a false fear about some hypothetical terrorist releasing chemical weapons in the United States .
Meanwhile , the US government is doing something very similar , releasing potentially deadly chemicals on its population , for no good reason .
I pray for grace for everyone , so that people in the proposed spray zones remain safe from harm , and that those who are inspired to take action to stop this be inspired to act effectively , with humility , strength and compassion .
In Santa Cruz and Monterey , local residents have started the California Alliance to Stop the Spray ( CASS ) .
This alliance is developing evidence and documentation to stop the aerial spraying for the Light Brown Apple Moth .
Just because this alliance is formed , does not mean the moth spray will be stopped .
Each area needs to form their own groups , and work together to defeat the real pest , State and Federal governments who are performing illegal operations .

As a final addendum , many people have written to me about mosquito fogging , about chemtrails , and about large scale chemical sprayings which occur in the United States unmonitored in more rural areas .
While my article does not address these concerns , those concerns are valid .
The government cannot ethically , legally , or morally expose , or allow for the exposure of people needlessly to chemicals .
There are volumes of evidence about how chemicals in our food , water and air can cause short and long term health effects .
Your concern about chemical exposure is vital .

Introduction Functional
Nets are a new way to think about programs and computation , born from a fusion of the essential ideas of functional programming and Petri nets .
As in functional programming , the basic computation step in a functional net rewrites function applications to function bodies .
As in Petri-Nets , a rewrite step can require the combined presence of several inputs ( where in this case inputs are function applications ) .
This fusion of ideas from two different areas results in a style of programming which is at the same time very simple and very expressive .

Abstract .
Functional Nets combine key ideas of functional programming and Petri nets to yield a simple and general programming notation .
They have their theoretical foundation in Join calculus .
This paper presents functional nets , reviews Join calculus , and shows how the two relate .

Abstract .
Join calculus , usually presented as a process calculus , is suitable as a foundation of both sequential and concurrent programming .
We give a new operational semantics of join calculus , expressed as a reduction system with a single reduction rule similar to beta reduction in lambda calculus .
We also introduce a new Hindley / Milner style type system for join calculus .
Compared to previous work , the type system gives more accurate types of composite and mutually recursive definitions .
The type system 's soundness is established by showing that our reduction rule keeps typings invariant .
We present an algorithm for type inference and show its soundness and completeness .

Abstract .
Foundational work on programming has been based traditionally on some variant of lambda calculus .
This approach , while ideally suited to sequential programming , is increasingly at odds with modern programs which are reactive in their interfaces and concurrent in their implementation .
Standard process calculi , on the other hand , model nothing but the concurrent aspects of systems , and are ill - suited to express sequential behavior .
This talk will show how nets consisting of functions and rewrite rules can serve as a uniform foundation of both sequential and concurrent programming .
These nets have close relationships to Petri nets ; in fact Petri nets can be regarded as a graphical notation for a a subset of functional nets .
Functional nets have been formalized by Gonthier et al. under the name of join calculus .
This talk will show how functional nets can be seen as a natural extension of sequential functional programming , and how they can model imperative , concurrent , and object - oriented programming styles .

Peace activists have attacked and deflated a large inflatable globe housing a satellite dish at a top secret New Zealand spy base in protest at United States military actions .
The group , calling itself ANZAC Ploughshares , said it cut through fences and razor wire and avoided electronic sensors before using a sickle to slash one of two 30 - metre white globes at the Waihopai base near Blenheim at the top of the South Island .
The base is described as a satellite communications monitoring facility , but peace campaigners say it is part of a global signals interception network called Echelon .
" The Echelon spy network , including Waihopai , is an important part of the US government 's global spy network and we have come in the name of the Prince of Peace to close it down , " said Ploughshares in a statement .
It said the attackers built a shrine and prayed " to remember the people killed by United States military activity " .
Three men , one of whom was a Dominican priest , were arrested at the site .
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark , who is also in charge of the security services , condemned the attack .
" It 's a senseless act of vandalism , but it will now be dealt with by police , " her spokeswoman said .
Ploughshares said Ms Clark and the New Zealand government were privately supporting the war in Iraq while publicly condemning it .

The card was sent from Aachen , where Anne had visited her grandmother A greetings card signed by the Jewish diarist Anne Frank has been found in an antiques shop near Amsterdam .
The card was sent in 1937 , when Frank was eight , and was addressed to one of her best friends , Sanne Ledermann .
The Anne Frank museum has authenticated the card , which shows a clover - covered bell above a snowy field , and wishes " good luck for the New Year " .
Frank , who wrote her diary while in hiding from the Nazis , died in Belsen concentration camp in 1945 .
Paul van den
Heuvel , a school teacher , was looking through items in his father 's antique shop in Naarden , near Amsterdam , when he came across the card .
" I just found it in a box , which probably came from an Amsterdam flea market , " he told Dutch television .
The card had been sent from Aachen , in Germany , where Frank was visiting her grandmother .
A spokeswoman for the Anne Frank museum , Maatje Mostard , said she had seen another similar card , posted on the same day from the same town , and she was sure it was authentic .
" I do n't know what he will do with it , " she said .
" We hope we can get it for our collection . "
Frank , her family and four other Jewish friends hid from the Nazis in a small Amsterdam apartment , until their arrest in 1944 .
They were sent to Auschwitz and Belsen concentration camps .
Anne died in Belsen of typhus shortly before the end of the war .

Posted on January 23 , 2008 , William Gamers Strike Back Against Cooper Lawrence On Amazon
* UPDATE *
Unfortunately , Amazon is now deleting any one - star negative reviews of the book .
After hearing the offensive and biased attack against Mass Effect on Fox News , I decided to check out some links on Cooper Lawrence , the psychologist who took part in the biased strike on the game .
I came across her book on Amazon.com titled ‘ The Cult of Perfection : Making Peace with Your Inner Overachiever ’ .
It was interesting to see that the page was full of one - star reviews of her book mostly coming from gamers .
Shawn covered the topic HERE yesterday .
This is definitely one of the reasons I love the internet .
She may think that it ’s ok to bash a product she has never used and gamers are now bashing a book they have never read to drop her book rating on Amazon .
Currently , there over 40 negative reviews posted .
Check out the Amazon link HERE if you ’d like to throw your two cents in or to just read some of the funny comments against her .
Personally , I would never purchase advice from a psychologist who does n’t do research on the topics she talks about .
If Fox News and other media outlets want a war against gaming , they ’ve picked an industry full of hard - core fans who are n’t going to sit back and take it anymore .
Some of the witty comments included :
I am giving Ms. Lawrence a poor review because she makes assumptions that are not based on fact .
During her
Fox news report , she blatantly lied and completely misinformed the public .
This is not acceptable behavior , and how does she expect me to read her book and believe what she has to say ?
She completely threw her credibility out the window .
Mass Effect is a PG - 13 game ( and even that is pushing it , I ’d consider it “ PG ” ) that is “ M ” rated because the ESRB is harsher than the MPAA .
I think she should denounce Rap music rather than things she knows nothing about .
And her comment about knowing what young boys think is absolutely laughable at best .
I respect you , Ms. Lawrence , I really do , but please , do some research before you try to convince the public not to support something .
I caught her doing a segment on Fox News .
She spent 3 minutes attacking a product she had n’t used , and actually made assumptions about the quality and use of the product .
I suppose when you are so busy trying to overachieve and look perfect , you do n’t have time for fact checking .
Shame .
Background
For one of the pet projects I 'm working on , I really want to create a push notification system .
The site itself is written with PHP using the Kohana Framework .
This works great and was a super fast and easy way to get things up and running .
However , as I found out , this system is n't really conducive to the " push " notification system I wanted .
I originally went with the tried & true method of long polling .
Using an PHP / AJAX example I found , I got it working .
But I knew this was n't really the ideal solution .
I did more searching around , and was reading about Web Sockets that are part of the HTML 5 spec .
I eventually came across the node .js plugin Socket .
IO .
Now I was already using PHP and Apache for my web application , so I did n't want to have to redo it all to be a node .js website .
So instead , I set out to create " relay " system that clients could subscribe to and my PHP scripts could send notifications too .
After playing around , it was n't too difficult to get working .
Introduction
The Multi-Core Standard Template Library ( MCSTL ) is a parallel implementation of the standard C++ library .
It makes use of multiple processors and / or multiple cores of a processor with shared memory .
It blends in transparently and there is in principle no change necessary in the program itself .
Applications that make use of the STL algorithms like sort , random_shuffle , partial_sum or for_each , benefit from the improved speed due to parallelism .
MCSTL cooperates particularly well with the STXXL , the STL library for huge data sets in external memory .
More information about how to incorporate the library into your application is given in the documentation section .
The library is licensed partly licensed under Boost Software License 1.0 , partly under the GNU General Public License Version 2 with Runtime Exception .

BARCELONA , Spain  Toru Arakawa , chief executive of Access , the biggest cellphone software company in Japan , took a diplomat ’s view of Google ’s foray into telecommunications .
The open and free platform that Google wants developers to use for cellphones , called Android , “ is not necessarily something we have to fight against , ” Mr. Arakawa said .
“ My personal view is maybe there ’s a way to work together . ”
But Mr. Arakawa , who came to the mobile industry trade show here this week from a country that knows a thing or two about cellphones , seemed to be in the minority .
Google did not even have a booth at the trade show , Mobile World Congress , and its executives met quietly in modest off - the - beaten - track hospitality suites .
But the Internet giant cast a shadow over the conference , with one executive accusing Google of “ a land grab ” for customers and advertising dollars , and a rival saying that Android would never be secure enough for cellphones .
Candy is normally a tasty little sweet treat designed to give pleasure to all .
However , that is not always the case , as this list proves .
For some unknown reason , some candy manufacturers have recently started producing the most disgusting candies you could image ( they must be running out of ideas ) .
Here is our list of the most disgusting candies you could ever eat .
10 Ear Wax Candy
I do n’t care how this candy tastes , who in their right mind would enjoy scraping ear wax out of a plastic ear for eating ?
The whole idea just makes me want to gag !
It even comes with its own swab .
How many kids are going to start digging in their ears after they run out candy I wonder ?
Smart .
9 Candy Scabs
The gross factor in these candies is not their flavor , but the fact that they are designed to look like scabs – complete with plasters .
I could possibly cope with that , but just imagine this scenario : Johnny and Jimmy are playing hide and seek .
Jimmy hides in the bush that his dog Rover just recently pooped in .
Jimmy inadvertently gets Rover ’s poop on his hand and does n’t realize it .
They finish playing and mommy gives them some Candy Scabs to eat .
Jimmy sticks it on his hand , pulls it off , and ….
I think you get the picture .
Dumb idea .
8 Dubbel Zout
The first thing this Dutch candy has going against it is that it is licorice flavored .
I know a lot of people like the taste of licorice , but a lot of people voted for George Bush too – it does n’t make it right .
The next problem here is that this is licorice made with an enormous amount of salt .
That ’s right – it is salt “ candy ” .
Add to that the fact that it looks like something you would expect to find on the floor of an English nightclub , and you have the makings of one of the worst candies ever .
7 Hotlix Candy
Okay – it is sweet – I will give them that , but inside each of these tasty candies is a REAL LIFE scorpion .
Yup – when you lick through the sugar coating , you get to chow down on scorpion guts .
Whoever came up with this candy needs to be forced to eat some Dubbel Zout .
6 Gorilla Boogers
We are really walking a thin line with this one – gorilla boogers are sweetened dried black beans ( popular in Asian cooking ) .
I was on holiday in korea once and had some of their sweet bean candy ( they beat the beans to a pulp then shape it in to small bite sized pieces ) .
It tasted like dirt .
These boogers are made from the same beans .
They taste like dirt too .
Sweetened dirt .
Enough said .
5 Ant Candy
Like the scorpion candy above , this is basically a lump of melted sugar with a bunch of dead ants thrown in to it .
Of all the things in the world that they could have thrown in to their candy , what the hell made them choose ants .
How does this stuff get past the FDA ?
4 Jane - Jane Tasty Tuna Tidbits
Tuna was invented by mother nature for hippy vegetarians and people trying to shed some fat – so how has it managed to find its way in to candy ?
The main ingredient in these little blobs of sugary disgustingness is tuna .
After that comes a bunch of chemicals of unknown origin , and finally sugar .
Seriously – who would eat fish flavored candy ?
3 Crick - Ettes
Just because Moses and the Jews ate locusts in the desert does n’t mean anyone should do it now !
These are real crickets sprinkled with a variety of flavors .
I realize that chips ( which they are similar to ) are not usually labeled as candy , but they are so gross ( and both are equally bad for you ) that they deserve a spot here .
Anyone that eats these things by choice deserves to be hit with a plague of boils .
2 Durian Candy
Durian fruit is a common fruit in Southeast Asia .
To people unfamiliar to it , it usually evokes feelings of utter disgust .
One food writer said : “ its odor is best described as pig- shit , turpentine and onions , garnished with a gym sock . ”
You are not even allowed to bring this stuff in to hospitals or hotels in South East Asia .
In Singapore , they have signs that forbid you from taking it on the public transport system ( see here ) .
That is how disgusting it is .
So , it makes a lot of sense to make candy out of it .
Not .
But there you have it – someone has done it .
This one was nearly number 1 on the list , until we discovered BeanBoozled …
1 BeanBoozled
BeanBoozled are jellybeans made by the company that brought us Gourmet JellyBeans .
In a box of BeanBoozled we find 10 colors of beans and 20 flavors – every color has one tasty flavor , and a disgusting flavor – the idea is that you never know whether you are about to get a good one or a bad one .
This makes it ideal for party games .
So – why is this number one on the list ?
After you read the selection of “ bad ” flavors , you will understand : Skunk Spray , Moldy Cheese , Baby Wipes , Rotten Egg , Vomit , and more .
And guess what ?
They really taste like their names .
Next time you are watching a movie in the dark with friends , slip a few of these in to their bag of jellybeans for a great gag ( literally ) .
Like Feckless and Cruel Father , Like Feckless and Cruel Son
I just saw a recent interview with Thomas Pickering , US Ambassador to the UN from 1989 - 92 , in which he says this :
PICKERING : We had wonderfully prepared combat activities , and we had no absolutely idea about what to do in a post - combat phase .
Q : You mean there was no policy .
PICKERING : No policy , no real settled interests .
No examination of what we should do , no examination of how we should deal with the future ...
Q : Deploying hundreds of thousands of troops without any idea of what you 're going to do ?
PICKERING : Yep , yep .
Fairly convincingly so .
The funny thing is , he 's actually talking about the aftermath of the Gulf War , when George H.W. Bush called for an Iraqi uprising against Saddam and then stood by and let them all get slaughtered .
Apparently planning for the future is not a real strength of the Bush family's .
Below is the Pickering interview , which I 've snipped from the excellent documentary Saddam Hussein : The Trial You Will Never See .
You can see it in its entirety on youtube here .
British researchers are developing a medical robot which can work out the intentions of a surgeon performing an operation , making surgery easier and more precise .
They hope new software will lead to less invasive operations , for example when conducting a cardiac bypass or tumour removal , allowing patients to recover more quickly .
The improvements have been made to the most advanced robotic surgeon on the market , the Da Vinci .
It allows surgeons to sit at a viewing console directing the movement of the robot 's mechanical arms inside the patient 's body .
The research team is working on using the surgeon 's eye movements to direct the robot , getting the best out of both human and machine .
" We want to empower the robot and make it more autonomous , " said computer scientist Professor Guang Zhong Yang , of the Hamlyn centre for robotic surgery at Imperial College London .
He said robotic surgeons are currently completely under the control of the surgeon .
The robot responds only to the surgeon 's hand movements .
" There 's a large amount of information that is not being explored at all .
That 's the human part . "
The team has added a device which tracks the surgeon 's eye movements .
By working out precisely where each eye is looking , software can build up a 3D map of the area of tissue the surgeon is looking at .
" What that does is it uses the surgeon 's brain as a way in to calculating the depth of the tissue , " said the surgeon Lord Darzi , who heads the centre and is a government health minister responsible for improving patient care .
This 3D map is allows the software to stabilise the image of moving tissues such as a beating heart to make surgery easier .
It means that what the surgeon sees in the viewer is stationary , while his or her instruments are in fact moving up and down in train with the organ .
" The whole operating environment is moving at the same speed in relation to the organ that you are operating on and the instrumentation , the scope and everything else , " said Darzi .
" So we are essentially fooling the surgeons by showing them a static heart . "
This makes the procedure easier for the surgeon to perform .
Another new feature developed at the centre , and funded by a £ 10 m donation from the Helen Hamlyn Trust , is " augmented reality " .
This allows the surgeons to see beyond the surface of the tissue to the structure they are operating on , for example a tumour or a blood vessel .
The software does this by combining the image from the live tissue with scans taken before the operation of the area .
The system 's computer graphics give the illusion of see - through live tissue , with the position of the tumour beneath .
" It shows you the tumour in relation to its anatomical structure , " Darzi said .
That means the surgeon can be more precise and avoid cutting out large amounts of healthy tissue .
" If you are reducing the physical and the psychological trauma that is one of the biggest costs from a patient perspective , and earlier discharge from hospital is a significant cost , earlier return to work is a significant cost . "
The team is also working on setting up virtual " no - go zones " such as a healthy blood vessel , which the robot will not allow a surgeon to cut by mistake .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution Wednesday calling on China to end its crackdown on Tibet and release Tibetans imprisoned for " nonviolent " demonstrations .
The vote was 413 - 1. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , who has not dropped out of the presidential race , was the lone congressman voting against it .
The resolution passed just hours before runners were to carry the Olympic torch on a six - mile route around San Francisco Bay .
San Francisco , California , which is in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 8th District , is the only U.S. stop for the torch relay , which is wrapping up the first week of a 23 - city international tour .
Pelosi and other House members introduced the resolution , which urges China to end the crackdown in Tibet and " enter into a substantive dialogue " with the Dalai Lama , who lives in exile in northern India .
" It is my hope that the House of Representatives will send a clear message that we support the fundamental freedoms of the Tibetan people and a peaceful solution to the instability in Tibet , " Pelosi said Tuesday on the House floor .
" It is long past time for Beijing to reassess its failed policy to attack and demonize the Dalai Lama , and show the world it can have civilized discussions as a responsible world power , " she said .
The resolution , which has no force of law , also asks the State Department to reconsider its decision to exclude China from its list of countries considered the " world 's most systematic human rights violators , " and calls Chinese officials to allow independent international monitors and journalists access to Tibet .
In the Senate , Sens. Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat from California , and Oregon Republican Gordon Smith introduced a similar resolution , The Associated Press reported .
By mid-morning , protesters were marching along the San Francisco 's Golden Gate bridge , where on Monday three protesters scaled suspension cables and unfurled a large banner that read , " One World .
One Dream .
Free Tibet . "
In some places in the city , protesters acted out violent confrontations between Chinese authorities and Tibetan monks .
One protester moved through a crush of people in a makeshift military tank .
Watch the protests in San Francisco »
However , pro-Chinese demonstrators also were out in droves , waving Chinese flags .
In one incident , a man with a Tibetan flag snuck into a pro-Chinese crowd and a skirmish ensued .
The pro-Chinese protesters surrounded the Tibetan demonstrator , yelling .
No arrests were made .
San Francisco authorities have put up barricades around the flame 's planned route .
Police were also monitoring the protests from the bay , where they sat on jet skis and boats .
When the flame arrived in the city Tuesday , thousands of people chanted slogans and waved banners to demonstrate against China 's human rights record , including its treatment of Tibet .
Also Wednesday , Sens. Robert Byrd , D - West Virginia ; Hillary Clinton , D - New York ; and Robert Menendez , D - New Jersey ; wrote President Bush a letter stressing the recent crackdown in Tibet , as well as years of human rights abuses in China .
" If the Chinese government is ever to treat its people with basic human rights , it must be sent a bold and clear message that its record of violence and suppression is completely unacceptable , " the letter says .
" [ We ] urge you not to attend the opening ceremonies in Beijing this summer . "
Clinton called on Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama to join her in the request .
Obama released a statement Wednesday saying a presidential boycott of opening ceremonies should be on the table .
" If the Chinese do not take steps to help stop the genocide in Darfur and to respect the dignity , security , and human rights of the Tibetan people , then the president should boycott the opening ceremonies . "
He called on China " to allow foreign journalists and diplomats access to the region [ Tibet ] , and to engage the Dalai Lama in meaningful talks about the future of Tibet . "
But , Obama said , the decision over whether to boycott the opening ceremonies should be made closer to the beginning of the Olympic Games .
Brooke Buchanan , a spokesperson for McCain , told CNN that the Arizona senator " believes the president should evaluate the situation as it evolves and ought to keep his options open . "
" He continues to condemn the brutal oppression that the Chinese inflicted on the Tibetans and protestors around the world , " Buchanan said .
President Bush , however , has publicly committed to attend the Beijing games .
When a reporter recently said to him , " You 're planning to ... be at the opening ceremonies , " Bush neither confirmed or denied the statement .
When pressed on the issue Wednesday , White House spokesperson Dana Perino stated only that the president is going to the Olympics .
A number of other international leaders have decided to skip the opening ceremony , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk , Britain 's Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip .
Some , however , made the decision separate from a human rights issue .
Brown , for instance , will attend the closing ceremony , when the London will be recognized as the next host .
Brown never had any plans to attend any other part of the Beijing Olympics , his office said .
Clinton , speaking at the Irish American Forum Wednesday in New York , issued a statement on Brown 's decision .
" I wanted to commend Prime Minister Gordon Brown for agreeing not to go to the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in Beijing .
That was an important decision by Prime Minister Brown and I am calling on Sens.
McCain and Obama to join me in my request that President Bush also not attend the opening ceremonies . "

PESHAWAR , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - A suspected U.S. missile strike that killed up to 13 foreign militants in Pakistan ’s North Waziristan region this week had targeted second or third tier al Qaeda leaders , according to residents in the tribal area .

Initial reports said 10 people were killed in the attack on Monday on a house in Torkhali village near the town of Mir Ali .
An intelligence official , however , told Reuters on Thursday that based on information gleaned from tribal contacts there were seven Arabs and six Central Asians killed .
He said the attack was believed to have been carried out by a pilotless U.S. Predator aircraft flown across the nearby border with Afghanistan .
“ The missile appeared to have been fired by a drone , ” the intelligence official said .
The Pakistani authorities have not confirmed the attack , and the Pentagon has denied taking any action , but the Defense Department does not speak for the Central Intelligence Agency , which operates Predators that the tribesmen say carried out the attack late on Monday .
Villagers saw two drones flying over the area before the attack .
They did n’t see the missile being fired but one heard a plane ’s engine before the explosion .
Intelligence officials said the area is controlled by Islamist militants and too dangerous for security forces to go .
After the attack , militants surrounded the area and barred anyone from going near the house .
Ahmed Aziz , a 70 - year - old resident , told Reuters that the militants also stopped villagers from attending the funerals , which was a sign that those killed were all foreigners .
“ When local people die , they do n’t stop anyone from attending their funerals , ” Aziz said .
Tribesmen in the area said a deputy of Abu Laith al Libi , a senior al Qaeda leader , had been staying there and was among the dead , according to the intelligence official .
“ The latest information we have from the area is that a second - in - command to al Libi was among those killed , ” he said .
A leading Pakistani daily , The News , reported that the strike had targeted Libi and another senior figure , Obaidah al Masri , though neither was present at the time of the attack according to a senior Taliban commander quoted by the newspaper .
Libi and Masri were promoted up the al Qaeda ranks due to successful U.S. and Pakistani operations in the past to catch or kill the guerrilla network ’s second tier leaders .
U.S. forces in Afghanistan have launched similar attacks on al Qaeda targets on the Pakistani side of the border several times in recent years .
If it was a U.S. drone attack , the lack of confirmation is not unusual .
Pakistan says it will not tolerate violations of its territorial sovereignty and reports of such attacks are embarrassing for the U.S. - Pakistani alliance .
The Department of Homeland Security 's Real ID program has a real challenge on its hands from California .
DHS had said it will only grant extensions from the Real ID rules taking effect on May 11 to states that apply by March 31 and promise to implement Real ID by 2010 .
California requested an extension but would not make the latter promise .
DHS buckled and said , in effect , " Good enough . "
Perhaps they realized that trying to slap giant California around is qualitatively different than doing the same to New Hampshire .
In another crack in the wall .
DHS has granted Montana a waiver it explicitly did not ask for .

Last month a group of US physicists challenged copyright regulations that placed restriction on sharing their work .
A group of physicists last month challenged the American Physical Society after the APS withdrew two articles , the authors of which indicated an intention to publish some of the work on online - encyclopaedia Wikipedia
The scientists feel that such strict copyright rules place unreasonable restrictions on scientists who want to diseminate their work to as broad an audience as they can .
Many scientists include elements of their work in blogs , messageboards , forums , and open information outlets such as Wikipedia .
The scientists assert that they should not be forced to choose between publishing in respected peer - reviewed journals and sharing their findings with the public .
" It is unreasonable and completely at odds with the practice in the field .
Scientists want as broad an audience for their papers as possible , " says Bill Unruh at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , quoted in New Scientist , who has also lobbied against such strict copyright rules .
The APS insists that copyright is transferred to them prior to publication in their journals , something the group of physicists want changed .
The UK 's national academy of science , the Royal Society , while requesting transfer of copyright to them prior to publication , allows authors to publish their works online under a Creative Commons agreement .
The US " war on terror " has backfired , strengthening extremists in Afghanistan and Somalia and turning them into legitimate political actors in the eyes of their local populations , a thinktank said today .
The Senlis Council , which has strongly criticised US policy in Afghanistan in the past , is particularly scathing of the Bush administration 's " abject policy failures " in Somalia .
It said air strikes , support for Ethiopian troops that attacked Somalia last year and the ill - timed designation of a radical Islamist group , al - Shabab , as a terrorist group had been successfully exploited by the insurgency to boost recruitment .
" The lack of strategic acumen present in the ' war on terror ' in Somalia and Afghanistan is in fact enabling the spread of the insurgencies present throughout both countries , " said Norine MacDonald QC , the council president .
" The US is the common denominator in both countries – instead of containing the extremist elements in Somalia and Afghanistan , US policies have facilitated the expansion of territory that al - Shabab and the Taliban have psychological control over . "
Aid groups say Somalia , wracked by anarchy and violence for decades , is suffering its worst humanitarian crisis since 1993 .
Militias linked to the former Islamic Courts authority , which controlled Mogadishu in the latter half of 2006 , are waging a guerrilla war against the occupying Ethiopian troops and the weak central government .
With a small African Union peacekeeping force reduced to the role of bystander , several thousand civilians have been killed in the crossfire since early 2007 .
The UN , which considers a wider peacekeeping mission too dangerous , says 700,000 people fled Mogadishu last year .
A 10 - mile stretch of road outside the city now hosts more than 200,000 people , humanitarian groups say - perhaps the biggest concentration of displaced people anywhere in the world .
According to Phillippe Lazzarini , the UN head of humanitarian affairs for Somalia , 2.5 million people are in need of food or other aid .
Against this grim backdrop , the Senlis Council , in its 79 - page report , directly accused the US of undermining reconciliation efforts by backing the hardline president , Abdullahi Yusuf , instead of the more moderate prime minister , Nur Hassan Hussein .
According to the security thinktank , the US government in February disrupted negotiations with opposition parties - including hardline Islamists - by exerting pressure on the prime minister to exclude certain groups and individuals from a reconciliation process , particularly those on a US list of designated terror suspects .
The council urged Bush to end all bombing operations in Somalia , back a phased withdrawal of Ethiopian troops who are shoring up Yusuf , and create a UN stabilisation force to neutralise the power of Yusuf 's transitional federal government .
" President Bush has the perfect opportunity to adorn the twilight of his final term in office with a success story in his self - proclaimed war on terror – a fast track ' surge for peace ' to end the current Somali crisis , " the council said .
Yusuf personally heard calls to lead a reconciliation effort during a visit to the US .
Norm Coleman , a rightwing Republican senator , yesterday urged the Somali leader to reach out to " all stakeholders not associated with terrorism " .
" The president said he took my words very seriously , and would maintain his commitment to reconciliation , " said Coleman , who represents Minnesota , a northern state where more than 10,000 Somalis have settled .
Last month , the Bush administration granted Somalis living in the US under temporary protected status an extra 18 months as conditions in Somalia remained " dire " .
As for Afghanistan , the Senlis Council said the resurgent Taliban provided a bleak example of how the US - led war on terror had failed there as well .
It said : " The Taliban and al - Shabab are successfully exploiting policy mistakes such as aerial bombings , ongoing poverty , and aggressive foreign military presence to the extent that they are increasingly viewed by local populations as representatives of their legitimate political grievances . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Canada is moving to get rid of products with a chemical common in plastic baby bottles , the United States is expressing concern over its safety and some retailers are planning to stop selling these items .
Baby bottles free of the chemical bisphenol A are seen during a news conference with Canada 's Health Minister Tony Clement in Ottawa April 18 , 2008 .
Canada intends to ban the import and sale of plastic polycarbonate baby bottles , which would be the first such step in the world , Clement said on Friday .

But whether the chemical bisphenol A poses genuine health risks in people remains a matter of debate , with industry groups defending its safety and environmental activists saying studies involving animals show otherwise .
Bisphenol A , or BPA , is used to make polycarbonate plastic , a clear shatter - resistant material in products ranging from plastic baby and water bottles to sports safety equipment and medical devices .
It also is used to make durable epoxy resins used as the coating in most food and beverage cans .
People can eat or drink the chemical when it leaches out of the plastic into liquid such as baby formula , water or food inside the container .
“ At this point , the writing is on the wall for bisphenol A . Major retailers and governments all across the country and the world are now recognizing that this chemical is extremely toxic at very low levels of exposure , ” Michael Schade of the U.S. environmental group Center for Health , Environment and Justice said in a telephone interview .
Critics of BPA said more than 150 scientific studies involving laboratory rodents show BPA to be harmful at even low levels .
But some experts are not convinced .
“ For me , the big question is : what levels of exposures are we getting and are those levels of exposure sufficient to cause harm ? ”
Carl Winter , director of the Food Safety Program at the University of California - Davis , said in a telephone interview .
“ There still does not exist strong evidence supporting significant impacts on human health for bisphenol A , ” he said .
“ NEGLIGIBLE RISK ”
Steven Hentges of the American Chemistry Council downplayed the animal studies , saying they “ have not been corroborated between labs and the entire data set is not coherent . ”
He added : “ We do believe that bisphenol A poses negligible risk to human health . ”
On Tuesday the National Toxicology Program , part of the U.S. government ’s National Institutes of Health , issued a draft report expressing concern that BPA could cause neural and behavioral problems in fetuses , infants and children .
Relying on the results of animal studies , it expressed concern about possible links between BPA exposure and early puberty and prostate and breast cancer .
Dr. Anila Jacob of the activist Environmental Working Group said using rodent studies to assess toxicity is a well - established practice given that scientists cannot expose humans to possible toxins in research for ethical reasons .
Canadian Health Minister Tony Clement said on Friday his country intends to become the first to ban the import and sale of some types of plastic baby bottles because they contain BPA .
He expressed concern that overexposure at an early age could cause later behavioral and neurological symptoms .
Wal - Mart , the world ’s largest retailer , announced on Thursday it plans to offer more BPA - free products and intends to stop selling baby bottles made with BPA early next year .
Rochester , New York - based bottle maker Nalgene said on Friday it will phase out production of bottles made with BPA .
Nalgene is owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc .
U.S. states including California , Maryland , Minnesota and Michigan are considering bills to ban or restrict bisphenol A in children ’s products .
In Washington , Democratic Reps. John Dingell and Bart Stupak have been investigating BPA in products intended for use by infants and children .
They are calling on the Food and Drug Administration to reconsider its view that it is safe .

The merry - go - round stands rusting and lifeless .
An elaborate floral display that used to stand proudly at the front of the mansion has wilted , leaving just bare earth .
The tepees are collapsing in on themselves and a tent covering the bumper cars is falling to bits .
Scroll down for more ...
What fun this must have been : The Neverland Ranch railway station .
The floral clock in front of the building is overgrown .
The clock has stopped , and numbers are missing
From thriller to dangerous :
On what was the bumper car rink , the canopy is clearly ripped and discoloured by the harsh Californian sun .
Grass verges around the rink look bare and do n't appear to have been watered for months
Unless Michael Jackson can pay off part of his £ 160 million debts , his legendary Neverland ranch will be sold next week at auction on the steps of the Santa Barbara County courthouse - a site which will recall for him his painful 2005 child molestation trial and acquittal which left him even more of a recluse .
It would be the ultimate humiliation .

Swings and roundabouts :
Once fun - filled , now no MJ , no Bubbles and not even Billie Jean come to the carousel
Beat it :
There 's no one left to play braves and squaws at the Red Indian village .
A model horse stands but the sun- bleached tepees are falling down
The superstar bought the 2,800 - acre fantasy home in the rolling hills of Santa Ynez valley in 1987 for £ 11.3 million .
He was at the height of his career .
Children would be invited over to the estate to play and music boomed out of speakers .
The annual upkeep for the property was estimated to be a staggering £ 2 million and during its heyday 54 full - time paid staff manned the estate .
Scroll down for more ...
Bad to worse :
An enclosure which once held part of Michael Jackson 's collection of exotic animals lies disused , the water gone stagnant
Off the wall :
The only colour is the tennis court - it's as if a forest fire has swept through once - green Neverland , but the cause is neglect
Moonwalk might not be far off the mark in this blasted , dusty landscape , once bustling with happy children
All of them have since been let go , with the estate run by around half - a- dozen friends and relatives of Jackson .
Michael Jackson 's home Neverland is in a state of disrepair
Jackson deserted the property in July 2005 , when he was cleared of the child molestation charges , and fled to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf .
Meanwhile authorities in Santa Barbara ordered Neverland to be closed down after the star failed to pay his employees or keep up his insurance payments .
Since then the dream park has been left to rot .
The ranch was once famous for its zoo , stocked with elephants , giraffes , lions and monkeys .
But the exotic animals have gone to other homes .
Jackson 's pet monkey - Bubbles - is in a sanctuary and the horses are at a children 's riding school .
It is a pitiful reflection of the demise of the one - time King of Pop .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - EBay
Inc , the world ’s largest online auctioneer , sued Craigslist , a competitor in which it holds an ownership stake , in a dispute over whether the Internet bulletin board tried to blunt eBay ’s control .
Craig Newmark , the creator of Craigslist , arrives in New York May 8 , 2006 .

EBay alleged in the lawsuit that the board of directors of Craigslist , the Web ’s dominant classifieds listing service , took “ unilateral actions ” to dilute eBay ’s 28.4 percent stake by more than 10 percent , eBay said in a statement .
The suit , filed on Tuesday under seal , asked a Delaware Chancery Court to rescind the unspecified actions to protect eBay ’s stockholders and preserve its stake in Craigslist .
The suit names as defendants Craigslist founder , Craig Newmark , who runs the company in a famously open - minded style , and Chief Executive Jim Buckmaster .
Newmark and Buckmaster are the only members of Craigslist ’s board of directors .
EBay bought a minority ownership stake in 2004 , and launched its own free online classifieds site , called Kijiji , three years later in the United States .
The two services directly compete in the United States and about a dozen countries , with Kijiji tailoring its ads to young families rather than maintaining a Craigslist - style open marketplace .
In an email , Newmark had no comment on the lawsuit , or on whether the dispute involved the companies ’ business rivalry , saying Craigslist needed “ a little time to figure it all out . ”
An eBay spokeswoman said the disputed board actions concerned “ corporate governance issues ” and did not involve Kijiji .
She said eBay could reveal no more about its complaint without Craigslist ’s permission to protect information about privately held Craigslist governed by confidentiality restrictions .
Shares of eBay closed up 26 cents at $ 30.89 Tuesday on Nasdaq .
One commonly hears about suicide among the young , and the elderly .
But the CDC suggests that midlife suicide is becoming the bigger problem :
A new five - year analysis of the nation ’s death rates recently released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the suicide rate among 45 - to - 54 - year - olds increased nearly 20 percent from 1999 to 2004 , the latest year studied , far outpacing changes in nearly every other age group .
( All figures are adjusted for population . )
For women 45 to 54 , the rate leapt 31 percent .
“ That is certainly a break from trends of the past , ” said Ann Haas , the research director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention .
By contrast , the suicide rate for 15 - to - 19 - year - olds increased less than 2 percent during that five - year period — and decreased among people 65 and older .
The question is why .
What happened in 1999 that caused the suicide rate to suddenly rise primarily for those in midlife ?
For health experts , it is like discovering the wreckage of a plane crash without finding the black box that recorded flight data just before the aircraft went down .
Experts say that the poignancy of a young death and higher suicide rates among the very old in the past have drawn the vast majority of news attention and prevention resources .
For example , $ 82 million was devoted to youth suicide prevention programs in 2004 , after the 21 - year - old son of Senator Gordon H. Smith , Republican of Oregon , killed himself .
Suicide in middle age , by comparison , is often seen as coming at the end of a long downhill slide , a problem of alcoholics and addicts , society ’s losers .
“ There ’s a social - bias issue here , ” said Dr. Eric C. Caine , co-director at the Center for the Study of Prevention of Suicide at the University of Rochester Medical Center , explaining why suicide in the middle years of life had not been extensively studied before .
There is a “ national support system for those under 19 , and those 65 and older , ” Dr. Caine added , but not for people in between , even though “ the bulk of the burden from suicide is in the middle years of life . ”
Of the more than 32,000 people who committed suicide in 2004 , 14,607 were 40 to 64 years old ( 6,906 of those were 45 to 54 ) ; 5,198 were over 65 ; 2,434 were under 21 years old .
By itself , that last is not necessarily particularly worrisome ; the Boomers are so much bigger than any other generation ( did n't somebody around here just write an article on this ? ) that it 's not surprising that they account for so many of the nation 's suicides .
This initially made me skeptical of the rest of the results , but with caveats that the data changeover in 1999 makes the study period unhappily short , they seem surprisingly robust .
The middle aged really are killing themselves more than they used to .
Why would that be ?
Fractured social networks or better reporting ( there 's less stigma than their used to be -- so medical examiners may be more willing to call a death a suicide . )
Or are we just witnessing the collective despair of a generation that thought that they would be forever young with the world all before them ?
One odd possibility that occurs to me is that fewer children , and better social safety nets , may make suicide less costly -- perhaps previous generations were only held here by the fear that they'd be leaving their children to starve .
But to be sure , this probably does n't match up very well with any time period we can study , so we 'll probably never know whether it was a factor .
Maria Eugenia Sampallo discovered the identity of her true parents in 2001 An Argentine couple have been jailed for illegally adopting a baby girl born 30 years ago to parents who were kidnapped by the military government .
The case was brought by the adopted woman , Maria Eugenia Sampallo , whose real parents were among the 30,000 said to have been killed in the " Dirty War " .
Osvaldo Rivas and Maria Cristina Gomez were convicted of falsifying documents and hiding their daughter 's identity .
The pair were sentenced to eight and seven years in prison respectively .
A former army captain , Enrique Berthier , was found guilty of taking Ms Sampallo and giving her to the couple .
He was sentenced to 10 years in jail .
' Not my parents '
The case at the federal criminal court in Buenos Aires represented the first time a child born of prisoners who disappeared during the Dirty War pressed charges against the adoptive parents .
Rivas and his wife have not commented publicly on the case
After the judgement , human rights groups outside the court expressed mixed emotions , saying they were pleased the three had been found guilty but that they were disappointed by the reduced sentences .
Ms Sampallo had called for her adoptive parents to be sentenced to 25 years in prison - the maximum allowed under Argentine law .
" They are not my parents - they are my kidnappers , " she said .
Ms Sampallo learned in 2001 , as a result of DNA tests , that she was the daughter of missing political prisoners Mirta Mabel Barragan and Leonardo Ruben Sampallo .
The left - wing activists were kidnapped by the military authorities in December 1977 , when Mrs Barragan was six - months pregnant .
Ms Sampallo was born in a clandestine detention centre in the capital and taken from her mother shortly afterwards .
She probably never saw her father .
The BBC's Daniel Schweimler , who was at the court , says that nothing more has ever been heard about her parents - they " disappeared " along with an estimated 30,000 other victims of the military regime between 1976 and 1983 .
After being taken by the authorities , Ms Sampallo lived with her adoptive parents , suspecting nothing , until 2001 , when a group formed by grandmothers of the stolen babies , tracked her down and revealed her true identity .
It is believed some 500 children were given to families sympathetic to the military government .
Eighty - eight have since been tracked down and those behind this case are hoping the publicity will provoke more questions , our correspondent says .
Rivas and Gomez have not commented publicly on the case .

THE TAO OF THE DUDE
1. Zen and the Art of Dudeism :
The Dude Attitude
By Oliver Benjamin
" What makes a dude ?
Is it being prepared to do nothing at all ?
Whatever the price ?
Is n't that what makes a dude ?
Of what value is achievement , competitors bested , obstacles overcome ?
Strong men also get high .
Strong men also get high . "
Astute readers and fans of the cult film The Big Lebowski will note that the above is a shameless reworking of one of its scenes .
In the original , a wealthy old cripple posits  What makes a man ?  and expounds on his achievements and a lifetime of moralistic rigor .
The charge he is addressing , a washed - out ex hippie who goes by the name  The Dude smokes a joint and concludes that all that makes a man is simply a pair of testicles . 
Yet , though the Dudes philosophy runs deeper than that , it is simply not his habit to impose his assertions upon the world , nor the lifestyles people have chosen , least of all his own .
He neither judges the corrupt old man nor takes umbrage at his condescension .
As he will say later , in response to a tongue - lashing offered by a purple - clad pedophilic bowler ,  Well , that s just , ya know , like , your opinion , man . 
The Dude is a pacifist , though not only that , for pacifism is a political stance .
He is the 1960s peace symbol in human form  tarnished , a bit dated , but still the chubby anti-Mercedesian ideal upon which many once hung their hopes for the future .
Moreover , the Dude is the torch - bearer in a long tradition of Dudeism that has been handed down through the ages , a spiritual heir of such luminaries as Lao Tzu , Heraclitus , and Charlie Browns dog Snoopy .
After riding the movies manic rollercoaster of reversals and revelations , our hero offers up his last , unflappable adage :  The Dude Abides . 
But against the terminal upheavals of mankinds history , true dudes have always abided .
The reason for this is plain : Life is full of strikes and gutters .
So fuck it , let s go bowling .
Lao Tzu : The Original Dude
The original dude , the O.D. if you will , was surely Lao Tzu , the author of the Chinese classic the Tao Te Ching .
Lao
Tzu was so incredibly dudeish that no one is even sure if he existed or not .
All that we know of him comes from a tale , possibly apocryphal , in which the great sage got fed up with Chinese civilization , and was asked to scribble down his accumulated wisdom before he split , never to be heard from again .
Hardly a self - promoter , the ephemeral Lao Tzu never really engendered an iconography  virtually the only enduring image of him can be found in a painting called  The Vinegar Tasters . 
And this picture says a thousand words  a sum not much greater than in the entire Tao Te Ching , in fact .
In the painting , the three prime movers of Chinese religion are found sticking their fingers in a pot of vinegar and tasting it .
The Buddha finds it bitter , that it represents the suffering of mankind .
Confucius finds it sour , a symbol of the corrupted state of the world since the legendary Chinese golden age .
But Lao
Tzu is grinning from ear to ear .
To his palate , it is marvelous .
If nothing else , vinegar is a crucial ingredient in that most allegorical of Chinese condiments : sweet and sour sauce .
 All sunshine all the time makes the desert goes the Arab proverb .
And all sugar all the time , Lao Tzu knew , will make your teeth fall out .
Heraclitus : The Classical Dude
In contrast with Lao Tzu , Heraclitus was a rather dour dude , but a dude nonetheless .
Where Lao Tzus element was water ( everything flows ) , Heraclitus  was fire ( everything burns ) .
The underlying attitude was similar  drink and be merry , and smoke if you got em , respectively .
Like Lao
Tzu vis -à - vis the Confucians , Heraclitus was responding to a rigidly hierarchical Greek society which put absolute faith in its leaders and manmade laws .
Heraclitus and Lao
Tzu put their faith in the natural world , and the world of ideas instead .
Additionally , they were both late sleepers .
Virtually all Western Dudeism can be traced to the man who said in his single surviving document On Nature ,  You can not step into the same river twice   an early incarnation of our modern go with the flow maxim .
Like Lao
Tzu , he also stressed that ( and I am paraphrasing here ) we need to chill out , take it easy , roll with the punches , and everything will be as copasetic as can be under the circumstances .
Heraclitus held that the world was an ever - shifting union of opposites ( compare this with the Chinese Yin - Yang ) and that our greatest challenge was to perceive the world without bias ( a basic principle of all eastern philosophies ) .
Truly , placing Heraclitus and Lao Tzu side by side its hard to imagine they arent the same dude .
Both come to us via a single similarly naturalistic document , both lived from about 550 to 480 B.C , and both favored rather monstrous facial hair , at least in drawings .
Dude Etude
From these two Dudefathers , it could be said , all subsequent global Dudeism has sprung .
The supremely dudesque novelist ( he took drugs once and wrote about it ) Aldous Huxley coined the term  Perennial Philosophy  to refer to the many similar religions and ideas that popped up around the same time in mans history : that of Taoism , Buddhism , Yogism , Christianity , Greek philosophy , etc .
He pointed out that this rebel shrug has endured through the subsequent ages in one shape or form , despite dictatorial efforts to curtail it .
Throughout history , secret societies of dudes , cabals of proto - modern bongo - players and players of the French game of boules kept the flame of Dudeism alive while the world around them seemed eager to snuff it out .
As the Dudes quixotic sidekick Walter admonishes a bowling adversary who has broken the rules :  You are entering a world of pain !
Mark it zero .
Confronted with this inflexible and unfeeling existence , the Dude in all of us will acquiesce , slyly scribbling a peace sign where a zero might otherwise suffice .
 He who gently yields is the disciple of life ,  wrote Lao Tzu .
That is to say , he abides .
Oh , that John McCain .
Adorable and straight shooting .
A war hero , too , and that 's for real .
But so is his noteworthy ignorance on issues of war and peace ( it 's kinda important to know the difference between Shi'a and Sunni in Iraq when you 're supposed to be a foreign policy " expert " . )
The idea that it 's okay because many Americans do n't know the difference , as suggested by the adoring McCain press defenders , is scary because we know that 'll be the attitude when we get into questions about science .
Science ?
Start with an appearance by McCain at a Discovery Institute sponsored lunch last year for a speech :
Friday at noon in Seattle , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , will speak at a luncheon event being co-presented by the Discovery Institute -- the controversial organization that promotes intelligent design theory and combats Darwinism .
As usual , the adoring press finds excuses for McCain :
McCain is beng hammered by a liberal group for associating with the Discovery Institute , although the luncheon is being formally hosted by the CityClub of Seattle and the Seattle World Affairs Council , with the Discovery Institute is one of nine organizations " co-presenting " the event ...
McCain 's campaign pooh - poohs the controversy .
" He 's addressing the Seattle World Affairs Council and CityClub of Seattle and there are a number of co-presenters as well , of which the Discovery Institute is one , " says McCain exploratory committee spokesman Brian Jones .
The Discovery Institute is as loathsome to science as an appearance at an anti-Catholic fundie school like Bob Jones would be to those of faith , or anti-Catholic bigot John Hagee ( let 's talk about his sermons , fair and balanced press ) :
Our double standard : Barack Obama takes a hit for wacko comments by his minister .
And the GOP prince ?
McCain said he was " very honored " by the support of the Rev. John Hagee , who takes a back pulpit to no one in the divisive - speech department .
Hagee slams feminists , gays and the Catholic Church ( he calls it " the great whore " ) .
Like Obama , McCain says he disagrees with the pastor 's comments .
Unlike Obama , McCain is forgiven .
- Linda Valdez , editorial writer
But McCain has n't stopped there .
So far , two weeks in a row , he has put his foot in his mouth on science and medicine issues that , btw , are laced with politics and controversy .
Last week it was over vaccines and autism :
McCain said , per ABC News ' Bret Hovell , that " It ’s indisputable that ( autism ) is on the rise amongst children , the question is what ’s causing it .
And we go back and forth and there ’s strong evidence that indicates that it ’s got to do with a preservative in vaccines . "
McCain said there ’s " divided scientific opinion " on the matter , with " many on the other side that are credible scientists that are saying that ’s not the cause of it . "
Actually , there 's overwhelming evidence that there 's no scientific link between vaccines and autism and there 's no " divided scientific opinion " .
Another pass from the press , because is n't McCain just adorable , and , like , science is , you know , hard !
So now to this week last year , this time , and to help everyone out , here are the facts from CDC :
When condoms are used reliably , they have been shown to prevent pregnancy up to 98 percent of the time among couples using them as their only method of contraception .
Similarly , numerous studies among sexually active people have demonstrated that a properly used latex condom provides a high degree of protection against a variety of sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV infection .
and from the Fed 's own AIDS site :
Be safe .
The best way to prevent HIV is to abstain from having sex .
If you do have sex , use a new latex condom every time .
Do not share needles or syringes .
Any questions ?
Any questions for straight shooting John [ March , 2007 , bolded mine ] ?
Reporter : " Should U.S. taxpayer money go to places like Africa to fund contraception to prevent AIDS ? " Mr. McCain : " Well I think it ’s a combination .
The guy I really respect on this is Dr. Coburn .
He believes – and I was just reading the thing he wrote– that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity .
Where that does n’t succeed , than he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well .
But I agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence .
I look to people like Dr. Coburn .
I ’m not very wise on it . "
( Mr. McCain turns to take a question on Iraq , but a moment later looks back to the reporter who asked him about AIDS . )
Mr. McCain : " I have n’t thought about it .
Before I give you an answer , let me think about .
Let me think about it a little bit because I never got a question about it before .
I do n’t know if I would use taxpayers ’ money for it . "
Q : " What about grants for sex education in the United States ?
Should they include instructions about using contraceptives ?
Or should it be Bush ’s policy , which is just abstinence ? "
Mr. McCain : ( Long pause ) " Ahhh .
I think I support the president ’s policy . "
Q : " So no contraception , no counseling on contraception .
Just abstinence .
Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV ? " Mr. McCain : ( Long pause )
" You ’ve stumped me . "
Q : " I mean , I think you ’d probably agree it probably does help stop it ? "
Mr. McCain : ( Laughs )
" Are we on the Straight Talk express ?
I ’m not informed enough on it .
Let me find out .
You know , I ’m sure I ’ve taken a position on it on the past .
I have to find out what my position was .
Brian , would you find out what my position is on contraception – I ’m sure I ’m opposed to government spending on it , I ’m sure I support the president ’s policies on it . "
Q : " But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
Would you say : ‘ No , we ’re not going to distribute them , ’ knowing that ? "
Mr. McCain : ( Twelve - second pause )
" Get me Coburn ’s thing , ask Weaver to get me Coburn ’s paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days .
I ’ve never gotten into these issues before . "
John " the surge is working " McCain .
When you do n't know something , do as George W. Bush does .
Bush was ignorant about Shi'a and Sunni before he invaded Iraq for bogus reasons , and that 's sure worked out well for the US , has n't it ?
Sure it has .
Just ask John McCain to read the graph .

Angelina Jolie's Sexy Sweet 16 Photo Shoot Unearthed
posed for photographerwhen she was sweet 16 .
InTouch has apparently purchased the photos and has included them in an upcoming issue of their weekly magazine .
The 1991 photos , taken half a lifetime ago for the 32 year old actress , are demure by current standards .
You 'll find nothing salacious about the pics but they do give a glimpse of how Angie got her start .
Angelina has n't changed much but you will notice the lack of tattoos !
Check out the photos HERE .
The most potent force standing in the way of a Democratic win in 2008 is the deteriorating unity in the Democratic Party .
That could change but that is the biggest issue for Democrats right now .
Whether or not the fractures in the party can be healed remains to be seen , but the person who is at fault for those fractures is Hillary Clinton .
Hillary is at fault for several reasons , but the biggest one is that it has been obvious since February 6th that she is not going to win the nomination .
Most party leaders and pundits were predicting ( correctly as we now know ) that Obama would win the next eleven states in a row and this is the day after Obama had a massive victory in the February 5th Super Tuesday contests .
Any other candidate would have quit at that point .
It is the height of hubris and selfishness for Hillary to have continued .
That she continued guaranteed that the race would degenerate into negativity and the politics of personal destruction .
If you are familiar with recreational athletics , you probably have heard of something called a " mercy rule " .
See http://www.momsteam.com/alpha/sports/basketball/basketball_mercy_rule.shtml and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_rule .
A mercy rule is a rule that says if you have a contest where the leader is ahead by a certain amount , the chance that the individual or team that is behind can reverse the situation is so improbable that it makes sense to stop the game and declare the individual or team that is ahead the victor .
There are several important reasons beyond the probability of the reversal of fortunes to end a contest like that .
If you read the first article I linked above it has a sentence that makes the point well :
" In addition , in many cases , the number and intensity of fouls increase , thereby putting player safety in jeopardy . "
There is a tendency for people to get frustrated to the point where they act out in an ugly manner when they are losing .
The several weeks of contests that Obama won in a row increased the frustration and anger level in the Clinton camp and that of her supporters to the point that all they want to do is " foul " Obama .
From the perspective of the Obama camp and his supporters ( as well as many neutral observers ) , in the last six weeks , Hillary and her campaign & supporters have thrown every nasty innuendo and accusation they could drum up at Obama .
Hillary even went so far as to tout the attributes of the presumptive Republican nominee over Obama , a fellow Democrat .
Disgust at the tactics of the Clinton campaign and her surrogates has inspired at least three articles of mine , http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_steven_l_080305_hillary_clinton___th.htm and http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_steven_l_080218_hillary_clinton___de.htm and http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_steven_l_080314_hillary_presses_obam.htm .
Although most people recognize that a lot of what is said in politics in general and campaigns in particular is rhetoric , particularly the attacks , there are a fair amount of people that believe them and form lasting opinions based on the things that are said .
When the race for the nomination is all over , Hillary will endorse Obama and many of her campaign people will go to work for him .
That is how little anyone should believe what is coming out of Hillary 's camp right now .
Unfortunately , the attacks being made by Hillary and her surrogates in addition to the overall tone with which she has conducted her campaign since February 6th will cause many of her current supporters to question whether they should support and vote for Obama in the general election .
Hillary is going to have to work hard to convince them that they should support Obama and how she does that is going to be an interesting tightrope to walk considering that she could come across as a liar for some of the things she has said .
If she fails to be able to do that , and it is no guarantee at this point that she reverse the damage to the mindset of some of her supporters enough so that she can bring them to support Barack once it is all over , not only will she have cost the Democrats the White House , she will have caused a number of down ticket Democrats in the US House and Senate and state legislatures and governors mansions to lose as well .

but John , you are a warmonger .
look it up .
April 6 , 2008 by lestro

For being such a tough guy , Sen .
John McCain seems to me to have a pretty thin skin :
The campaigns of Senators John McCain and Barack Obama sparred Saturday after Ed Schultz , a nationally syndicated radio talk show host who is known for his blunt criticisms of the Bush administration and the Republican Party , called Mr. McCain a “ warmonger ” at a fund - raiser .
Mr. Schultz , a conservative Republican turned liberal Democrat , made the remarks on Friday while revving up a group of Obama supporters at a $ 100 - a - head fund - raiser at the North Dakota Democratic Party ’s convention in Grand Forks .
As soon as the Republican National Committee got word of the attack , it issued a statement criticizing Mr. Schultz and calling on Mr. Obama to repudiate the comments .
Later , Mr. McCain , speaking to reporters in Prescott , Ariz. , said , “ Mr. Schultz is entitled to his views . ”
But he added , “ I would hope that in keeping with his commitment , that Senator Obama would condemn such language , since it was part of his campaign . ”
But here ’s the thing , he is a warmonger .
I looked it up :
war·mon·ger Pronunciation : \ ˈ w ȯ r- ˌ məŋ - gər , – ˌ mäŋ-\ Function : noun Date : 1817 : one who urges or attempts to stir up war
John McCain supports using the military as a blunt force and is always among the first to support sending troops anywhere , including pre-emptively into nations that might maybe kinda look like a threat .
He has since 1999 .
He even made it part of his campaign in a Jan. 5 Republican debate in New Hampshire :
MR. GIBSON : Let me just ratchet up the question slightly and ask you if you believe in the Bush doctrine .
Because in September 2002 — up for years , our foreign policy has been based on the idea that we form alliances , international consensus .
We attack — retaliate if we ’re attacked .
But in 2002 , the president said we have a right to a pre-emptive attack , that we can attack if this country feels threatened .
And on that basis , WMD , we went into Iraq .
We ’ve cited the threat of a nuclear Iran to leave the military option on the table .
Do you agree with the doctrine , Senator McCain , if you were president , or would you change it ?
SEN .
MCCAIN : I agree with the doctrine .
he also likes to sing about it :
Look it up Johnny , “ warmonger ” is not necessarily an insult , it ’s a statement of McCain policy .
Sen .
Obama ’s people have nothing for which to apologize .
If McCain does not want to be called a warmonger , perhaps he should consider changing his policy positions on the use of the military …
And if may quote McCain one more time :
“ We cannot forever hide the truth about ourselves , from ourselves . ”
On this , Johnny , we could n’t agree more .
Mrs. Clinton also said that if she could not generate the money needed to pay for universal coverage through other means , she would not object to raising the excise tax on tobacco products , which Congress last increased in 1997 to 39 cents a pack .
Image Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton being interviewed about what her universal health care program would look like .
Credit ... Damon Winter / The New York Times
“ I ’m a big believer in raising tobacco taxes , ” Mrs. Clinton said when asked whether an increase should be on the table .
“ You know , when we were working on the Children ’s Health Insurance Program , that ’s the funding stream that the Congress came up with , which was bipartisan , which worked out very well .
At some point , there ’s going to be diminishing returns .
But , sure , why not ?
I do n’t have any objection to that . ”
As in her debates with Mr. Obama and other contenders , Mrs. Clinton displayed an easy command of health policy in the 45 - minute interview , conducted in a basement meeting room in the Midtown Manhattan tower that houses her Senate office .
Her voice hoarse , she conceded some weariness from the lengthy campaign , saying her decision to take off the Easter weekend had only allowed exhaustion to set in .
But despite calls by some Democrats for her to abandon the race , she gave no hint that she was viewing her campaign in the past tense .
Mrs. Clinton presented a confident defense of her call for universal coverage , saying it reflected not only a moral imperative , but also the best chance to reduce costs and improve quality .
“ I know that there are a lot of experts who may disagree about how to get to universal health care , ” she said .
“ But they agree with me that in the absence of universal health care it ’s very difficult to control costs , and it ’s extremely hard to incentivize quality improvements at the level you need to really see results . ”
Though that view is not shared by Senator John McCain or any of the rivals he vanquished to secure the Republican nomination , Mrs. Clinton said she thought that “ the time is right ” to build a bipartisan consensus to reorganize the health system .
As mentioned last Friday , over the weekend , I spoke at CA Common Cause 's " Media Reform Conference " out in Pasadena .
The panel discussion , " Have the media undermined our democracy ? " included myself , along with Congresswoman Hilda Solis ( D - CA ) , Alex Nogales of National Hispanic Media Coalition , Jonathan Taplin of USC Annenberg School of Comm . and Kevin Uhrich of the Pasadena Weekly .
It was moderated by Tracy Westen of the Center for Governmental Studies .

CA Common Cause " Media Reform Conference "
California Inst. of Technology , March 29 , 20098
Panel : " Have the Media Undermined Our Democracy ? "
Opening remarks by panelist , Brad Friedman
Transcribed from video by Emily Levy
I 'm Brad Friedman from BRADBLOG.com .
[ Applause . ]
You three are the ones who read it !
[ Laughter . ]
The title of this panel is , " Have The Media Undermined Our Democracy ? "
I submitted my written testimony at BRAD BLOG yesterday on that question , the answer being " Yes " with many exclamation marks .
That 's the end of my testimony on that .
[ Laughter . ]
I will disagree slightly with Kevin [ Uhrich ] .
Not " a little bit , " but yes , in a big , big way .
You will know that I have been successful in my quest when I no longer appear at these panels .
I 'm working assiduously every day to put myself out of business .
The polite conversation here at these conferences , the FCC discussions , in Congress [ gesture to Congresswoman Solis ] , is very important .
But I 'm here to say that it has not worked .
And this situation is so much worse than we can possibly even discuss today --- this coming from someone who is on the ground dealing with what 's going on in our democracy , dealing with the media outlets , the corporate media outlets , the mainstream media outlets , talking to the reporters who are just desperate --- and it 's really bad .
And the effect on our democracy is really , really bad .
I 've been called --- I cover , at BRAD BLOG , I cover a lot of democracy issues , election reform and so forth --- I 've been called one of the Paul Reveres of the election integrity movement .
Though I have a blog that reaches the whole wide world , Paul Revere had an advantage over me : he had a horse .
And if I had one and if I could , I would ride it down these stairs yelling , " The corporate mainstream media has failed !
The corporate mainstream media has failed ! "
If there are any media here covering this today they would probably take a photograph of that and that would make its way onto the newspapers .
We are , there are fights going on at the margins --- and I consider the FCC , I consider Congress , I consider these discussions really to be on the margins --- while in the meantime the corporate mainstream media has a crunch that is proceeding like a bulldozer over our democracy .
It is , as I say , much worse than we can possibly discuss here this afternoon .
The old way of fighting , I think , no longer works .
The panel discussions , the Congressional debates , the academic studies .
Folks , the bad guys have figured out how to game all of those .
In fact , an FCC study we just covered that this week at BRAD BLOG ( more info here ) , an FCC study about this very issue --- whether or not cross - ownership has affected media bias and so forth -- , they have figured out they can go to certain academics who are happy to report to them anything that needs to be said .
One of them is a fellow by the name of Professor Jeffrey Milyo at the University of Missouri who did a study for the FCC and said that everything is fine , media cross - ownership has not affected the debate at all , there is no bias in the media since cross media ownership .
And he did this by creating a study looking at three days on local media prior to the 2006 election and seeing what they were covering .
And he had a choice of partisan issues that they were sort of ticking off as far as what was covered .
One of those partisan issues was the Iraq war .
And if they spoke about the Iraq war on the local news , that was considered a Democratic issue .
And so all of the discussion about the Iraq war in the days leading up to the 2006 election proved to this academic that Democrats are having their issues covered just fine .
[ Laughter . ]
These are the academic studies .
Of course , Jeffrey Milyo last week testified before Congress on whether photo ID is detrimental or not and he says , of course , what do you know ?
' No , it 's not .
It 's fine .
You can ask for photo ID at the polling place .
It 'll be no problem . ' [ more info here ]
So all of these institutions : the media , the government , the interest groups , the academic studies have all have all become compromised .
It is , I feel , up to the people to hold them accountable .
[ Applause . ]
I feel I have a responsibility to point out that Common Cause , even , their slogan is " Holding Power Accountable . "
Quite often we use the slogan at BRAD BLOG : " Holding Common Cause Accountable . "
We must hold each other accountable because the media has completely failed their first amendment obligation to hold anybody accountable .
So we must hold each other accountable .
The media has become a glorified PR unit where they basically report , ' One guy says this , the other guy says this , oh , who knows ?
The answer must be somewhere in the middle . '
No .
The answer can be discovered and it must be reported .
We try to do that every day at BRAD BLOG and I try to encourage the mainstream corporate media who is , as you hear Kevin , and I talk to these folks every day , they 're desperate .
They do n't know what to do .
Might I suggest they start reporting the news .
[ Applause . ]
That they start reporting what 's going on .
It 's not a " he said / she said " story , it 's not a red / blue , it 's not a right / left , there is a truth and we need to start reporting it .
It is provable .
We can do that .
We must do that .
It is our responsibility .
I will end with a quote that the great whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers wrote at The BRAD BLOG .
He had to write this at BRADBLOG.com .
[ Laughter . ]
Not the New York Times , not the Washington Post , but at BRAD BLOG .
This was in reply to a woman , an FBI whistleblower who has been trying to get out her word about what she heard while working at the FBI after 9/11 that involves , her allegations that she heard discussion of high - level --- and I 'm talking the number three in the State Department --- officials , who were allowing our nuclear secrets to be sold to foreign countries .
This seems notable to me .
Apparently not to the New York Times or the Washington Post .
So Ellsberg , who has called her story --- her name is Sibel Edmonds , you can read about it at BRAD BLOG , not at the New York Times [ more info here ] -- he has called her story " far more explosive than The Pentagon Papers . "
He wrote : " It is a measure of how far the New York Times and Washington Post have fallen from their responsibilities since I gave them the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
They printed them then .
Would they today ?...
If freedom of the press is mainly for the people who own the presses , it is time for those owners to stop using that freedom to conceal official wrongdoing .... Such activities ( wrongdoing by government officials like this ) persists covertly to the point of national disaster because the press neglects what our First Amendment was precisely intended to protect and encourage it to do : to expose wrongdoing by officials . "
If they wo n't , we will .
I hope you will join me .
We 've got to change this mess .
[ Cheers , applause . ]
======
[ Later ... During the Q&A ]
Can I speak to one point , a couple [ of folks ] have been making ?
Thank you .
And , by the way , thank you for waving your hands to get your question in .
I would like to see more of that .
The , just one , very briefly .
There have been some questions about diversity --- gender diversity , racial diversity and so on and so forth --- and at risk of , I do n't know , perhaps even incurring the wrath of my friend , the great Lila Garrett of KPFK here [ gesture to Lila in audience ] , let me point out that I do n't , I do n't think we have the luxury to concern ourselves , in a certain sense , with these things , as important as they are .
We 're talking about remodeling the furniture in the house while the house is burning down .
[ Applause . ]
Where if Lippman said that we have to melodramatize these things , let me melodramatize the conflict here .
[ Laughter . ]
We 've , we 're in a war without end .
I do n't know how we get out of it .
I blame the media .
Everybody in this room is being listened to and has their internet read every day .
[ Applause . ]
I blame the media .
We have torture .
We have thrown out the Constitution and called it " quaint . "
I blame the media .
[ Applause . ]
These are the things that I think we need to figure out how to deal with instead of enjoying the luxury of concerning ourselves at the margins ... for now .
GETTING THERE
There are no direct flights from the United States to Tehran .
But you can get there through a number of European and Middle Eastern cities .
Among the airlines that fly to Tehran are Lufthansa , Emirates and British Airways .
A recent Web search found round - trip fares from New York in late February starting at around $ 1,050 on Air France .
Iranian authorities discourage independent travel by American citizens .
The best way to obtain a visa is to book a guided tour with a tour operator like these two in Shiraz : Pars Tourist Agency ( 98-711-222-3163 ; www.key2persia.com) or Gashttour Travel and Tour Agency ( 98-711-230-1900 ; www.irangashttour.com).
Reserve at least two to three months in advance to allow the outfitter time to obtain your visa .
Bring all the money you think you ’ll need in dollars , which are widely accepted or can be exchanged for rials .
Travelers checks are not accepted , banks and A.T.M.’s do not have access to accounts in the United States , and credit cards do not work .
WHERE TO STAY
In Esfahan , the Abbasi Hotel ( Amadegah Avenue at Goldasteh Avenue ; 98-311-222-6010 ; www.abbasihotel.com) was built in the shell of a Safavid - era caravansary .
The rooms are modest , but the public areas are not , especially the grandiose central courtyard , which has a large reflecting pool flanked by arched bays .
Doubles start at 1,287,000 rials , about $ 134 at 9,600 rials to $ 1 .
While wandering through the alleys west of the Bozorg Bazaar , I stumbled upon the Isfahan Traditional Hotel ( Hakim Street ; 98-311-223-6677 ; www.isfahanhotel.com), where I would stay if I were to return .
A dozen rooms surround a lovely and hidden courtyard .
Doubles are 615,000 rials .
WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK
Whether you eat at a highway truck stop or at an expensive traditional restaurant , the culinary offerings in Iran are usually identical : lamb , chicken or mince kebabs ( average meal about $ 5 ) .
I ate them at least once , and often twice , a day , so other options , like the quince and squash stew at the Bastani Restaurant ( southeast corner of Imam Square ; 98-311-220-0374 ) were welcome breaks .
At the north end of the square is the Qeysarieh Tea Shop .
The service is indifferent at best , but I went several times to sit on the outdoor terrace , puff on a qalyan , and admire the second - story view over the entire square .

A British paper reported this story today , and I was n’t sure if it was a joke or true .
KENTUCKY – USA – Imperial Wizard , Ronald Edwards has stated that , “ anything is better than Hillary Clinton . ”
White Christian Supremacist group the Klu Klux Klan has endorsed Barack Obama to be the next President of the United States of America .
Speaking from his Kentucky office in Dawson Springs , the Imperial Wizard exclaimed that anything or anyone is better than having that “ crazy ass bitch ” as President .
This is the first time in Klan history that any member of the KKK has ever publicly supported an African American candidate for the presidency .
KKK lodges all over America have been gathering and holding rallies
supporting the black presidential candidate .

Grand Turk Cletus Monroe has also been very vocal about the election and has donated thousands of dollars to Obama ’s election fund .
“ The boy ’s gonna do it .
My Klan group has donated up to $ 250,000 to the Obama fund .
Anything is better than Hillary Clinton .
Hell I ’ll even adopt a black kid from Africa before I vote for Hillary . ”
“ A few years back we were lynching negroes .

The following is an excerpt from commentary that originally appeared at Treasure Chests for the benefit of subscribers on Wednesday , March 5th , 2008 .
The end of the world as we know it is coming .
That �s right � according to the flamboyantly named Ambrose Evans - Pritchard � where it�s likely a challenge just attempting to live up to his name � life as we know it is about to change � big time .
And while I in fact agree with this assessment in terms of inevitabilities , at the same time putting this sentiment together with a perceived widening acceptance financials are all toast , it appears time to put on our contrarian�s hat again , especially with the business cycle for financials set to turn positive in mere days .
This means based on a growing number of pivotal factors ( sentiment , cycles , and technicals ) , and as evidenced by the price action in the market over the past few days , we are growing increasingly skeptical stocks will swoon much further in the immediate future , not before an exhaustion of negative forces set for this month cause a sharp reversal higher .
In this respect you will remember this discussion from several weeks ago ( and our constant reminding ) , where we explored the possibility of a repeat of the 1948 patterning ( another year ending in � 8 � in a commodities bull market decade ) , with a low is seen by mid-March , followed by a moon - shot in the stock market .
And while new highs may not be in the cards this time around , at the same time short sellers must beware , because there are growing reasons past those outlined above suggestive prudence is likely the better part of valor at the moment .
Here , three more important factors can be identified in this regard .
First , we have US index put / call ratios beginning to tic higher , which as you may know from numerous discussions on the subject , help support the perpetual short squeeze in stocks along side what appear to be permanently high short sales these days .
And with the public now in �acceptance mode� with respect to an impending financial meltdown , I wouldn�t be a bit surprised to see these ratios at elevated levels for some time .
Next we have an apparent parabolic top in the commodities complex , where not only did we have an outside reversal in the CRB yesterday , the same is true for gold , silver , Amex Gold Bugs Index ( HUI ) , and of course the Philadelphia Gold And Silver Index ( XAU ) , as per our warning in this regard on Monday .
Of course word on the street is the Fed might come in with a surprise half - point rate cut any time now as interest rates spreads in the futures market are now discounting a full - point cut due to increasingly stressed credit conditions .
Such an outcome would likely spike gold up over $ 1,000 before a more substantial correction sets in despite the apparent reversals noted above , once the totality of an additional half - point cut at the FOMC Meeting on March 18th is fully discounted .
Here , the extreme Fibonacci resonance related target on the monthly chart ( seen below ) is suggestive the $ 1,030 to $ 1,050 area would be a reasonable interim topping target to shoot for on the cash market for all you bullion traders out there .
( See Figure 1 ) Figure 1
In terms of a correction target , as you can see above , gold could easily pull all the way back to the $ 750 to $ 800 range in testing the break above the 1980 high again , but at this point such an outcome is not anticipated .
More specifically , and as pointed out last week here using Figure 3 , if a top is established in early March like in 1978 , expect to see an approximate 10 - percent correction into late April before gold turns around on its way into four - figure territory .
This would mean gold would be a buy in the $ 900 area if yesterday�s reversal holds .
Returning to our focus now , and bringing this factor into the reasoning then , once momentum is lost in the commodities / metals , expect the hedge fund community to reverse the sell stocks / buy tangibles trade in spite of accelerating monetary debasement rates purely due to technical reasons .
The news sources will read retail demand for gold is dwindling , but make no mistake about it , the real reason gold would go down is simply because the gamers perceive better returns being long stocks .
This brings us to the next factor that supports the idea index short sellers need to be cautious now , that being , believe it or not , financial stocks are set to turn higher soon .
Have I gone over the deep - end considering all the bad news on financials out there these days ?
Perhaps , but that being said I will tell you this , as a contrarian one must consider all this news is known now .
What �s more , we must also consider even the news that has not made it into the media is known , with unannounced Chinese bank exposure to subprime as good an example as any at present .
Add to this the knowledge Martin Armstrong�s last Pi Cycle turn day identified the top in financials last year in February ( see Figure 1 ) , meaning it marked the larger credit cycle top , in my opinion one would be foolish to ignore the fact the next turn day higher is fast approaching on March 21st , just a few weeks away now .
What �s more , and adding a sense of reality to this hypothesis , it should be noted that mortgage resets are peaking this month convergent with Martin Armstrong�s Pi Cycle turn date , which is just to much of a coincidence to be ignored .
( See Figure 2 ) Figure 2
And I can keep going in this regard , meaning the technical front .
Here , and in relation to extremes since we appear to be witnessing many these days , it appears LIBOR rates ( the inverse of the index presented below ) are also likely plumbing the lows , meaning from a definitional / sentiment related perspective , and although a reversal will likely prove fleeting , things can only get better from here .
( See Figure 3 ) Figure 3
Is there more on the technical front ?
You bet � with a apparent interim top in the Yen also put in yesterday , meaning hedge funds will theoretically be heading back to Japan for increasing amounts of leverage in coming days .
Here , I would expect the correction lower in Yen to run convergent to that of gold , where again , as mentioned above a bottom should be anticipated by late April approximately 10 - percent below current levels .
( Ed Note :
While timing and price extremes were slightly off , the end result should be the same as we move into April . )

The DHS , affectionately called the “ Ministry ” here because it resembles something out of Orwell ’s famous novel , wants to fit airports with ray guns .
I kid you not .
“ The US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) will consider fitting high - power microwave electropulse rayguns at US airports , in order to defend against the threat of terrorists firing portable anti-aircraft missiles at airliners , ” reports Lewis Page for The Register .
“ American defense heavyweight Raytheon would partner with Israel ’s Rafael and Kongsberg of Norway to provide the technology , according to a report in Flight International .
The proposed kit is known as ‘ Vigilant Eagle ’ , and is competing for DHS securo - dollars with defensive systems that could be fitted to the airliners themselves — for instance BAE Systems ’ JetEye . ”
Okay , tell me this does not sound like another “ defense industry ” scam , yet another scheme to make billions of dollars .
Sure , there is the possibility somebody with a rocket launcher may take out an airliner .
But if al - Qaeda hates our freedom , why have n’t they done this already ?
Is al - Qaeda conducting a war against the Great Satan , one with battles strung over decades ?
At this rate , it will take a thousand years to install the Great Caliph / Khalifah .
In fact , since 9/11 , there has not been one single solitary attack against the Great Satan .
Some will proudly state this is because of our vigilance and determination .
It ’s because Congress passed the Patriot Act and other Constitution bashing legislation and no shortage of presidential directives .
Occasionally we get treated to a shoddily rigged case , such as the street kids in Miami who colluded with al - Qaeda — that is , an FBI informant — or the kids in Canada who had the government deliver a truckload of fertilizer , passing it off as a dangerous explosive .
And then there was the patently absurd airliner liquid fiasco , when we were told miscreants would mix up explosives in the bathroom of an aloft airliner .
However , my favorite is the Fort Dix pizza killers , Muslims who were going to deliver death instead of hand - tossed pies .
Now we ’re going to get ray guns at the airport .
“ Vigilant Eagle , unlike its rivals , would be sited at the airport .
Light , portable anti-aircraft missiles of the type used by terrorists / insurgents lack the ability to hit a jet at cruising altitude , so such attacks would need to be mounted close to takeoff or landing , ” Page continues .
“ Vigilant Eagle would detect any missiles fired using a network of infrared cameras to pick out the hot rocket exhaust plume .
The system would then focus an intense microwave beam on the flying weapon , generated by a so - called Active Electronically Scanned Array ( AESA ) of the type used in the latest fighter radars . ”
Man , what a deal for Raytheon .
How many airports in this country ?
Do the math .
Cha -cha -ching !
In fact , to simply roll this system out and test it for the Ministry , Raytheon wants a cool $ 10 million .
It used to be a company built something , tested it , and showed it off to a prospective customer in anticipation of selling it .
But that was before the “ defense industry ” ( defense against illusory enemies and manufactured Goldsteins ) captured a big chunk of the government , something Eisenhower warned about as he left office .
Get ready for airports to resemble firebases .
Of course , this wonderful technology you are going seriously in debt to pay for will never be used because there are no terrorists with rocket launchers sitting at the end of runways .
Maybe a demented pizza guy waving a Koran but not a Muji with a Stinger .
Naturally , in a few years , Raytheon will come up with Vigilant Eagle II and we ’ll have to pay millions to see how it works and billions to have it installed .
It ’s a sweetheart deal for the death merchants .
But then that ’s why the Ministry was created in the first place — to allow death merchants and “ security ” corporations to eat at the public trough .

When GameSpot fired Jeff Gerstmann soon after his negative review of the heavily - advertised Kane & Lynch , no one in the gaming press was surprised .
Now , keep in mind we 're not saying that Gerstmann was fired because of the review ; he wrote the review , then was fired .
The two events may well be unrelated .
The fact that the entire GameSpot site looked like a Kane & Lynch advertisement at the time might have been coincidence .
CNet , the parent company of GameSpot , released a statement claiming it takes its editorial integrity " very seriously . "
The fact that advertisers put pressure on sites and magazines is n't exactly breaking news ; companies spend much time and money trying to get the most people to give their games the highest scores .
If you as a gaming writer want an exclusive , you had better treat the game nice in the review , thanks .
You want that advertising campaign to run on your site ?
This preview better make the game sound perfect .
While gaming may look like a huge , scary industry from the outside , it can be a surprisingly cozy place once you know that world a bit .
It 's easy to make enemies , and since public relations staffers change on an almost monthly basis , you never know who is holding a grudge at what company .
If you anger one publisher or the wrong PR person , you could find yourself out of luck for information , interviews , or even invitations to trade shows for a long time to come .
For sites that need fresh , exclusive news to function , it 's the kiss of death .
Even without lording advertising dollars over your head , they know how to hurt you .
Of course , publishers also want to help you .
Microsoft does n't send people gigantic bags filled with systems , games , and hardware because they really like you .
They want to get products reviewed , and they'd also like you to think of Microsoft as the cool company that gives you free stuff .
One gaming company even sent a few members of the gaming press onto a zero-g flight to promote its game .
The trip would have cost thousands of dollars if purchased , and one writer who went gushed about how the gaming company made his dreams come true .
Again , it 's not paying for a review or positive coverage , it 's just a very expensive gift .
When you hear writers say things like " they can not thank so - and - so enough " for a gift like that , you know it 's a lie .
There is a very specific way to thank them .
That is why the money was spent .
We 're lucky to be largely on the outside of that system ;
Ars is n't beholden to game companies for advertising dollars ( although if you are a game company and would like to advertise with us , we 're not going to say no ) , and we do n't run previews of games or accept free tickets or hotel rooms for coverage .
We do accept pre-release copies of games if they 're sent to us , but we 'll pan those games if they deserve it .
Heck , we do n't even give numerical scores anymore , so no one can pressure us for a higher score .
I know many people who are n't as lucky , and they write knowing that if they annoy the wrong person or their editors think something is too harsh , the words may be smoothed out a little .
The score may increase slightly .
It 's not a matter of selling reviews , nor do editors come out and say that you can't annoy certain people ; instead , the data just gets massaged into something that will allow said company to keep buying advertising space on the site without feeling slighted .
If you 're a site that relies on nothing but gaming advertisements to stay afloat , making enemies could mean a cold winter with nothing but AdSense to keep you warm .
That 's because readers are n't your customers .
" Do not patronize me by telling me the reader is the customer — your real customer is the one that pays you your revenue , " 3DO president Trip Hawkins said in an e-mail to GamePro after one of his games was panned .
" And it is game industry advertisers . "
One of the most common conversations that occurs when game writers get together to drink ( and we all drink , since we mostly hang out at trade shows , and when Sony 's pouring , are you going to say no ? ) is who likes you , who you 're on the outs with , who is easy to deal with ... the standard issues of working with so much pressure from your sources of review samples and quotes .
Pressure is a part of the game , and the good writers , the ones with integrity , know that it 's a roller coaster .
You annoy some people , but they come back to you in the end .
It 's a matter of riding it out .
You just have to make sure they need you more than you need them .
Game writers at certain sites and gaming magazines get a hunted , terrified look during these conversations , and I 've found that writers at mainstream newspapers and magazines enjoy discussing these issues .
Publishers need such writers to spread the word about a game to the masses , and they can't threaten to pull advertising , because odds are they do n't plan on advertising heavily in these places .
When you need someone to keep you in business , they have power over you .
There is no simpler concept .
Everyone in the gaming press who writes for a site that relies on gaming advertisements is in the opposite situation .
They face obvious pressure to be political with coverage , and the advertisers have some very big carrots to dangle in front of the editorial staff at such places .
Nothing is free : not exclusive previews , not first - run screenshots , and certainly not flights into space .
The reason this issue came up at GameSpot was simple : the site allows one company to blanket GameSpot when a new game is released .
When one title occupies every ad spot on your site and also features a launch center , trailers , and anything else you can think to sell , the game 's makers have too much control over what writers say .
After all , at that stage , it 's their site .
They paid for it , it 's covered with their intellectual property , and it's by their graces that you 're still in operation .
It may very well be that GameSpot let Gerstmann go for reasons not directly connected to the Kane & Lynch review ( and in a statement released late last night , the company said that was the case ) , but the timing of his release raises questions — while providing a disconcerting look into the world of gaming journalism .
I flew out to the Middle East expecting to lose a crucial debate on the subject of tackling Muslim extremism .
The showdown was to take place in Doha , in Qatar , home of al - Jazeera , bin Laden 's television channel of choice .
Worse , Doha is also home to a cleric who Britain , rightly , refused an entry visa .
Yusuf al - Qaradawi is an advocate of Palestinian suicide bombings , permits female genital mutilation and supports theocracy .
Rarely are these issues discussed openly in the Arab world and the concept of extremism , as precursor to terrorism , is viewed as a Western concoction .
During the 7 July suicide attacks in London , I was living in Saudi Arabia .
Saudi friends refused to believe that terrorism had anything to do with the rigid , literalist , soulless brand of Islam they had developed .
The fact that the lead bomber , Siddique Khan , wore a Saudi headscarf for his ' martyrdom message ' and shared an extreme form of the Saudi Wahhabi theology was not sufficient proof .
A 2005 Pew poll showed that nearly 60 per cent of Arabs refused to believe that 11 September was carried out by Arabs .
Even today , the ubiquitous conspiracy theories about Israelis perpetrating 11 September penetrate Arab cities ' coffee houses .
Friday sermonisers roar about Western imperialism and moral degeneracy , but fail to take any responsibility for the socioeconomic underdevelopment of their countries .
Unable to tolerate the pernicious extremism in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries , I gave up hope and returned home to Britain in 2005 .
And then I was asked by the avant - garde Qatar Foundation to return to the Middle East to debate the presence of extremism among Muslims .
In a stadium filled with young Muslims from across the world , BBC journalist Tim Sebastian probed arguments from both sides of the panel .
If the Qatar Foundation truly believed in free speech , then it would listen to my criticisms of mosque sermons , Saudi universities , destruction of Muslim heritage in Mecca and Medina and suicide bombings .
Would it ?
Al - Jazeera and other Arab networks stoke the flames of the Arab - Israeli conflict by referring to suicide bombers as ' martyrs ' ; an audience exposed to such language would not take well to my comments .
Still , without any censorship , I was allowed to say whatever I wanted .
The audience listened in silence .
And to my surprise , my opponent weighed in with further condemnations of suicide bombings .
Moez Masoud , a popular Egyptian televangelist , did what few Arab Muslim scholars do : he declared suicide bombings to be haram , scripturally forbidden .
This was no ordinary feat , particularly during a week when the Palestinian death toll in Gaza was rising to more than 100 people .
For a young Arab scholar to defy the mob , take politics out of religion , risk popularity and break Arab consensus takes courage .
Voices such as Masoud 's are rare and precious in an Arab world committed to supporting ' Palestinian martyrs ' .
Even in Britain , Muslim leaders equivocate when it comes to condemning suicide bombings in Israel .
And yet Masoud sat in the city that is home to al - Qaradawi and declared such acts as forbidden .
Whatever the outcome of the debate , Masoud has scored a huge moral victory .
With young preachers such as Masoud on the rise , there is every chance of hope in the Arab world .
My side of the debate was faced by the usual Arab apathy : the West had created extremism .
I was resigned to losing the motion .
And then came another shock .
The 400 - strong audience , with Muslims from as far afield as America and India , turned to their electronic devices to carry or lose the motion : ' This house believes Muslims are failing to combat extremism . '
We waited .
No people wants to admit to collective failure .
And yet the audience carried the motion with a massive 70.4 per cent in favour : Muslims are failing to combat extremism .
I was in store for another shock .
When I lived in Saudi Arabia , the one aspect of Saudi intolerance that irked me most was their refusal to allow people of other faiths to worship freely .
There was no church for the millions of Christians in a country that is considered the West 's closest ally .
And yet Saudi Arabia remains free to inject millions of dollars into mosques across Europe .
To date , there is no single Saudi cleric who has openly supported the cause of the largest religious minority to worship freely .
Nor will the British or American governments request these basic rights for their citizens , lest they upset the House of Saud .
I met a professor of Islamic studies from Qatar University .
Dr Abdul Hameed al - Ansary , without my prodding , reiterated his public position of support for churches in Qatar .
Meeting an Arab Muslim scholar from a conservative Gulf state who proudly tells me that Qatar 's first church building is nearly complete gives me a sense of hope that soon Saudi Arabia may follow where its neighbours lead .
There are churches in Kuwait , Dubai and ancient Christian prayer halls in Yemen .
The Arabian peninsula now has churches as Europe has mosques .
Meanwhile , the extreme , vacuous misinterpretation of Islam that focuses on rituals and rigidity is alive and well in Britain .
Recently , I was at a sermon at Imperial College , London , where a young , radical preacher fired off a sermon about excommunicating Muslims , or takfir .
It is out of such rhetoric that the jihadist mindset is born , taken from an ahistorical reading of scripture .
When this is married to political grievances , pioneered by Islamist movements , we have suicide bombers .
Those who share my religion in Britain are yet to follow Qatar and publicly admit to an extremism problem in our communities .
For as long as radical sermons go unchallenged , and Islamist groups adopt doublespeak in public discourse , condemning terrorism while disseminating extremist literature , British Muslim activists will be in the grip of extremism .
The older generation of immigrant Muslim leaders must move aside and give way to younger British voices .
Then perhaps we , like those in Doha , can admit that social and political extremism is rife in Muslim communal discourse .
· Ed Husain , author of The Islamist , is deputy director of the Quilliam Foundation .
The Doha debates will be broadcast on BBC World today at 8.10 pm

Nerds are taking back the n-word
In a movement that 's taking the nation by storm , nerds across the country are attempting to wrestle back control over the N word , that being the word ' NERD ' .
Though once considered social laughing stocks , nerds have have had what can only be referred to as a technological resurgence .
As computers continue to become an integral part of our lives , people are increasingly spending inordinate amounts of time on websites such as facebook.com and digg.com -- and the nerds behind these sites are becoming mini-celebrities .
Today , most 15 year old kids are as familiar with Mark Zuckerberg as they are with Paris Hilton and Lebron James .
That said , it has almost become ' cool ' to be a ' nerd ' , and if you think that Nerds would applaud this transition you'd be wrong .
Many nerds have grown angry as the 'n word ' continues to be inappropriately used in the media .
The word ' nerd ' has traditionally been used to poke fun at the technologically inclined and socially inept members of society .
But over time , nerds have grown to embrace their status and have become remarkably protective over who can use the n-word and under what circumstances .
" I 'm tired of it " , said James Gene , a 24 year old nerd from Brooklyn .
" My whole childhood I was pushed around for being a nerd .
People made fun of me and laughed at me in high school for never talking to girls and for being interested in computers .
Now , I 've embraced being a nerd and I 'm proud to say that I was and continue to be one .
And then I turn on the TV and see celebrities tossing the n-word around like it 's no big deal . "
" I agree " , said Steve Rigleman , a lifelong nerd from San Fransisco , " I 'm watching Leno the other day and this gorgeous model is on talking about how when she was a kid , she was really awkward and a huge nerd .
Never mind the fact that when she was 14 she was off modeling in Paris . "
Abuse of the n-word has even seeped into the workplace .
Rigelman , who works for a consulting firm , said that one of his co-workers always tries to play up the fact that he USED to be a nerd in order to get girls .
" This guy really ticks me off .
Just the other day he was telling an attractive female co-worker that he used to be the biggest nerd in high school and that he only had 3 girlfriends during his teens .
THREE GIRLFRIENDS ?!
In high school I only had three friends TOTAL !!
And I never even talked to a girl until I got to college . "
According to John Lee , president of the NAACP ( Nerd Association for the Advancement of Computer Programmers ) , this is n't the first time non-nerds have treaded onto nerd territory .
" Non-nerds exploiting nerd culture to their advantage is nothing new .
In the late 1990's , black rimmed glasses became very chic .
But historically , only nerds wore black rimmed glasses .
This trend did not go unnoticed by nerds .
In fact , many nerds continue to view stylish black rimmed glasses as being downright inflammatory , insulting , and offensive . "
According to most nerds , a non-nerd wearing black rimmed glasses is the equivalent to saying , " Hey , look at me !
I 'm so cool and good looking that I can even look good while wearing nerd glasses ! "
" What 's next " , said an anonymous nerd via twitter , " the pocket protector ? "
Some people , however , do n't see what the big deal is .
Mark Tilson , a 20 year old college student from Santa Cruz , is n't a nerd but does n't see why he should n't be able to utter the n-word .
" Look " , said Tilson , " my best friend is a nerd .
I grew up around nerds and I really like the culture . "
" This is an argument we hear often " , said Jason Lee of the NAACP , " but what people do n't realize is that being a nerd is n't just about being into computers .
It 's a state of mind .
A lifestyle .
What it really is is a badge of honor , and we want to make sure that the people who use the n-word are the people who have earned the right to say it . "
According to noted Psychologist Michelle Senk , the word nerd has very powerful connotations .
" Though the word ' nerd ' is just a simple 4 letter word , it has a very deep meaning and we should be wary of who is allowed to say it .
A few nerd jokes might not seem so harmful , but before you know it , nerds are getting wedgied in gym class and are having their books knocked out of their hands as they walk to class . "
Often times , non-nerds refer to themselves as nerds as a way to deflect attention away from an interest of theirs that they deem embarrassing .
For example , it is quite common for people to exclaim , " I think I 'm gonna skip out on that party and take it easy and watch a movie this weekend .
Yeah , I 'm a nerd . "
WRONG !
A real nerd would n't have even been invited to that party and would n't even have the option of going out in the first place .
Ironically , however , the nerds are fighting back .
Well , sort of .
" If I have to hear one more athletic guy talk about how he 's such a nerd because he likes the show LOST , I 'm gonna lose it " , said David Finkelstein , a 19 year old college student at M.I.T .
" It 's like me calling myself an athlete because I enjoy watching basketball ... which I do n't . "

Using the corporate jet is one of most common reasons cited by the report for tax ' gross - ups '
Many American companies are playing fast and loose with new requirements that they disclose how they calculate and why they are giving their CEOs and senior executives their huge compensation packets .
However , the new disclosure rules are revealing the plethora of outlandish perks that CEOs and their ilk receive .
Last year the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced rules that forced companies , in their annual filings , to state how much they pay their top executives as well as how they reached , for instance , bonus targets .
Many of the country 's largest companies have been filing those statements in recent weeks and analysis by The Corporate Library , a corporate governance research firm , of 489 large companies , fewer than a third – 32.72 % – disclosed performance targets as well as metrics .
The researcher expects the SEC to crack down on these omissions this year .
There has been intensified activism by shareholders , who are increasingly disgusted at compensation plans that bear no resemblance to company performance .
Perhaps the most bizarre compensation a CEO receives is assistance paying their income tax on their pay and perks .
A new report from The Corporate Library delves into the increasingly common practice of " grossing up " .
In a nutshell that means the company picks up the income tax liabilities a CEO faces on his perks , and sometimes even his pay and bonuses .
The Corporate Library , in examining 3,297 proxy statements filed between February 2007 and February 2008 found that 20 % of CEOs ( more than 650 individuals ) receive tax gross-ups on part of their income .
" The sight of Angelo Mozilo [ then CEO of troubled Countrywide Financial ] defending his request to the board to have the income tax due when his wife travelled for free on the corporate jet paid by the shareholders gave me pause for thought , " said Paul Hodgson , the report 's author .
" I decided to find out how common this kind of practice was .
Jaded though I am , I have to admit to being surprised at the extent of what I like to call the grossest perk . "
Using the corporate jet is one of most common reasons cited by the report for tax " gross-ups " .
That personal use of the company plane is a form of compensation to the executive , so it generates a tax liability .
But rather than making the CEO pay the tax on that benefit , dozens of companies pick up the bill from the IRS .
The Corporate Library report names and shames Chad Dreier , CEO of homebuilder Ryland Group as the executive who received the biggest gross -up .
Dreier was one of 30 executives who received " gross-ups " on earnings not just perks .
In the fiscal year 2006 he received over $ 5.75 m ( £ 2.92 m ) in " tax assistance " on the vesting of $ 6.5 m of restricted stock .
In total Dreier received $ 5.82 m of tax assistance in 2006 when his total compensation was almost $ 49 m .
And in a new proxy for 2007 , Ryland revealed it provided Mr Dreier with $ 4 m in gross-ups , as part of a pay package that totaled $ 12 m .
" We are sure that many US workers would be grateful if their employers also paid their income tax obligations , " commented Hodgson .
Perhaps not surprisingly the pay of executives in the building and mortgage industries are being most scrutinised by increasingly agitated shareholders , who have seen the value of their stock plummet .
A shareholder revolt at Toll Brothers just failed to stop the company introducing a new bonus plan for its CEO .
Robert
Toll did n't make a bonus under the old plan in 2007 so the company decided to change the metrics to ensure that did n't happen this year .
Shareholders have watched the value of their stock halved since it peaked at $ 55.81 in mid-2006 .
Aside from gross-ups , CEOs and other executives receive perks galore and now they have to be revealed in the filings .
Michelle Leder , founder of the website Footnoted .org takes guilty pleasure in revealing all even though she admits " even the zaniest perks rarely have a material impact on a company 's financials " .
Thought - provoking examples include why does Macy 's chairman and CEO Terry Lundgren suddenly need a special car and a driver who is a trained security specialist at a cost of $ 87,000 a year ?
His car cost only $ 9,900 in 2006 .
Why ca n't CEOs do their own taxes and financial planning like everyone else ?
Time Warner 's chairman Dick Parsons , who earned $ 18.6 m in 2007 also received $ 100,000 in company - paid " financial services " .
Kraft Foods spent $ 52,000 on financial counselling for Kraft International head Sanjay Khosla , who earned about $ 3 m and Steven Loranger , head of defence contractor ITT Corporation , whose earned $ 13.7 m , last year needed $ 37,000 from the company to help him keep his finances in order .
Obviously people need to eat but does Playboy 's Hugh Hefner really need $ 400,000 to provide food , housing and " personal benefits " to his three live - in girlfriends , Holly , Bridget and Kendra ?
There are signs that some companies are beginning to listen to their aggravated shareholders .
Progress Energy , an electricity provider , said it is no longer providing its top nine executives with perks such as complimentary country club fees , personal and spousal travel on the corporate jet , airline club memberships and event tickets that are not related to business .
And at struggling clothing retailer , Charming Shoppes , where there are efforts to oust CEO Dorrit Bern , the company announced it was stopping – after 10 years – paying her apartment 's rent .
Oh , and the $ 1 m bonus for simply staying on and being the CEO and chairwoman .
Forget that .
New research shows for the first time that we process cash and social values in the same part of our brain ( the striatum ) — and likely weigh them against one another when making decisions .
So what 's more important — money or social standing ?
It might be the latter , according to two new studies published in the journal Neuron .
" Our study shows that both behaviorally and in the brain , people place an importance on social status , " says Caroline Zink , a postdoctoral fellow in neuroscience at the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) in Bethesda , Md. , and co-author of one of studies .
" It 's hugely influential even [ when we 're not ] in direct competition with someone else . "
Zink 's NIMH team and their counterparts at Japan 's National Institute for Physiological Sciences ( NIPS ) used different methods to determine that we process social values in the striatum , which had previously been tapped as our brain 's monetary reward center .
This is key , researchers say , because it provides evidence that our brains consider a good rep — as well as cash — to be rewarding and worth considering as we mull our options .
In addition , they note that our brains likely weigh the benefits of each against one another ( because they are processed in the same place ) as we make up our minds .
" Although we intuitively know that a good reputation makes us feel good , the idea that a good reputation is a ' reward ' had long been just an assumption without scientific proof , " says Norihiro Sadato , a neuroscience professor at NIPS and a co-author of the Japanese study .
Sadato and colleagues conducted fMRI scans of the brains of 19 subjects while they engaged in two different exercises .
The first task was a simple game in which participants had to choose one of three cards in the hope of winning a cash prize .
In the second game , fictional evaluators appraised volunteers ' characters based on the results of personality trait questionnaires .
The researchers found that the striatum activated in response to high and low appraisals ( but did not perk up to more neutral comments ) ; it also responded to monetary wins and losses but was quiet if a player broke even .
" The implication of our study is that the different types of the reward are coded by the same currency system , '' says Sadato , " enabling the comparison between them . "
In the NIMH study , researchers scanned the brains of 72 volunteers as they attempted to earn money in a computer game .
During play , the researchers occasionally revealed how supposed competitors ( who , unbeknownst to them , were fake ) were faring .
The scientists created an arbitrary ranking system of the real and faux players in which some of the bogus gamers appeared to perform better — and others worse — than the real ones .
The participants were told that their status in the game had no effect on how much money they could win , but that earning more money could boost their rank .
" We found that the brain reacts very strongly to the other players and specifically the status of the other players , " Zink says .
" We were n't expecting that profound a response , " she adds , noting that the subjects seemed to be concerned with the hierarchy within the game even when it was of no consequence to how much money they could make .
According to Zink , the striatum became just as animated when players were given a shot at improving their social standing as it did when they won a buck .
And that was n't the only indicator that they cared about how others perceived them .
She says another brain region ( the medial prefrontal cortex ) involved in sizing up others went wild when players were shown photos of competitors who outperformed them .
Other findings of the studies : brain areas that process emotional pain ( the amygdala and posterior cingulate ) lit up when players failed to answer questions that inferior competitors had aced .
The researchers speculate that this is because they were worried it would diminish their reputations as superior players .
They found that the brain 's emotional centers were most active in competitive players who messed up , indicating that they were so concerned with their reputations that they became stressed out when their reps were threatened .
" Our position in social hierarchies strongly influences motivation as well as physical and mental health , " said Thomas Insel , director of the NIMH , in a press statement .
He notes that this new insight into how the brain processes social standing may have important public health consequences , possibly even paving the way to new stress - reduction therapies .
More than half of young people copy the songs on their hard drives to friends and even more swap CD copies , according to research that reveals the huge challenge home copying poses to a music industry already battling internet file - sharing .
Three decades after cassette decks first allowed people to make free music tapes for friends , a study by the industry group British Music Rights suggests home copying remains just as ingrained in UK culture .
BMR 's chief executive , the singer Feargal Sharkey , said the research underlines the urgent need to adapt to consumers ' attitudes or face serious repercussions for the next generation of musicians .
The industry 's anti-piracy efforts have largely focused on illegal online music swapping - with estimates suggesting only one in 20 digital downloads is paid for .
But the online problem is potentially dwarfed by " offline copying " , argues BMR .
Its research , carried out by the University of Hertfordshire , suggests that , for 18 - 24 - year - olds , home copying remains more popular than file sharing .
Two - thirds of people it surveyed copy five CDs a month from friends .
Overall , 95 % of the 1,158 people surveyed had engaged in some form of copying , including taking the music contents of a friend 's hard drive - 58 % - and the more old - fashioned method of recording from the radio .
BMR , which lobbies on behalf of composers , songwriters and music publishers , claims its research is the first academic study of its kind , and fills a hole in the industry 's understanding of how people consume music .
Former Undertones frontman
Sharkey said the aim was not to lambast young music consumers but to create business models that fit their behaviour and tap into the unrelenting demand for music .
He hopes the findings will provide impetus for change .
" For somebody who has spent 30 years in the music industry , you instinctively know this stuff is going on .
But when you actually sit looking at your computer and see a number that says 95 % of people are copying music at home , you suddenly go , ' Bloody hell ' , " he said .
Many record label executives see the piracy problem getting worse before it gets better .
The BMR research echoes other studies signalling that knowing something is illegal is no longer a deterrent .
Well over half its respondents who know that copying music from a CD to a recordable disc is illegal do so anyway .
But Sharkey believes a combination of education projects and new ways of providing music to consumers - for example , advertising - funded downloads - will change that .
" Ultimately it has to get better ...
At some point musicians and songwriters have to make enough money out of it otherwise they stop doing it , " he said .
" My concern is for the next generation of sexually frustrated , hormone - ridden 17 - year - olds that are sitting in a bedroom about to possibly , and I hope , write something like Teenage Kicks , " he said , referring to the Undertones song the late DJ John Peel made his anthem .
The aspect of home copying that most worries BMR is the speed with which friends can now swap music , whether from one hard drive to another or on to MP3 players .
Almost half the music in the average MP3 player collection comprises tracks that have not been paid for , the report says .
People aged 18 - 24 keep around £ 750 - worth of unpaid - for music on their MP3 players .
The study was carried out against the backdrop of government deliberations over how to introduce an exception in law so that people can legally copy music they have bought for private use .
Currently , UK consumers are technically breaking the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 by copying tracks from CDs to their PC or digital player , or making an extra copy to play in the car .
The Intellectual Property Office concludes consultations on changing the law tomorrow and BMR is submitting some of its research .
The music industry says it accepts consumers should not be punished for shifting music from one format to another , but some are concerned an exception will increase the perception music can be freely copied with impunity .
BMR has " no problem in principle " with the concept of changing the law .
But Sharkey is urging the government to look to European law , which dictates that where a private copying - style exception is created there is also some sort of compensation for the creators and performers .
Whatever the outcome , the prevalence of offline and online music copying shows the music industry has " a lot of big challenges it needs to face up to very quickly " , said Sharkey .
Syracuse , NY .---- Syracuse police shot a man with a Taser early this morning after he challenged them to a fight , but the 250 - pound suspect pulled the device 's electric darts out of his abdomen , laughed and said , " That 's all you got ? "
Officers said they went to a home at 123 Hartson St. about 2:50 a.m. after a resident , Lakiya Hall , 29 , reported that her fiance had punched her .
Police said three officers entered the housing looking for the fiance , Benjamin Myers , 31 , who also lives at the residence .
When they headed downstairs to the basement , Myers hollered up , " I 'm coming up .
I do n't want any problems , " according to police .
But when one of the officers tried to grab his arm , Myers ran into the kitchen , police said .
They ordered him to put his hands behind his back because he was under arrest , but he refused , saying " It 's gonna take more than three of you to take me down , " and then swung at one of the officers , police said .
Police Officer Michael Drury said he immediately fired his Taser at Myers .
The Taser is a gun-like device that fires electric darts to temporarily disable a person .
The device 's probes hit Myers in the lower abdomen , but they had no effect on the 5 - foot 9 - inch Myers , Drury said .
According to the officer , Myers pulled the probes out himself , laughed and said , " That 's all you got ? "
Myers then pointed to another officer and told him " he was going to knock him out first , " Drury said .
When several more officers arrived , Myers finally put his hands behind his back and was arrested , police said .
Hall said Myers had been drinking lots of gin earlier in the evening and hit her in the face with a cell phone and then punched her in the face after she teased him about staring at another woman , police said .
She ran out of the house and called police from her van , officers said .
Myers was charged with harassment , resisting arrest and first - degree criminal contempt .
Police said Hall had a court order of protection , issued in July , barring Myers from harassing or assaulting her .
Canada followed the lead of about 30 other countries Tuesday and formally recognized Kosovo , a former Serbian province that declared its independence last month .
Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier says the " unique circumstances " that led to Kosovo 's declaration of independence mean it does not constitute any kind of precedent .
( ( Jonathan Hayward / Canadian Press ) )
The move prompted the recall of Serbia 's ambassador from Ottawa , who is returning to Belgrade temporarily for consultations .
" We know that a significant number of countries , including our G7 partners and many of Canada 's close allies , have already recognized Kosovo , " Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier told CBC News .
" So what we did today , we joined the international community and recognized Kosovo as a new state . "
Parti Québécois praises decision
Members of the Parti Québécois in Quebec were quick to applaud the decision to recognize Kosovo 's independence .
Daniel Turp , the party 's international relations critics , said the recognition sets the stage for Ottawa to eventually recognize an independent Quebec , if sovereigntists demonstrate a democratic will to separate .
" Canada is recognizing a country , a new country , although the country it was part of disagreed , " Turp said .
" That is something that is new .
We 're happy that that has happened . "
But Bernier said the decision to recognize Kosovo , which declared its independence from Serbia on Feb. 17 , does not provide a precedent from which Quebec nationalists could launch a similar bid for sovereignty .
Many speculated that Canada stayed silent on the issue in recent weeks because of its implications on a desire by Quebec separatists to secede from the rest of Canada .
Bernier said , however , that the two cases cannot be compared .
" It 's unique because as you know there has been a very brutal war over there in Kosovo , and NATO was there , and the UN was also part of the solution , and now you have a state that is under some UN forces to be sure that all the independence , after the independence is going well , " he said .
" So for us it 's a unique case and as a declaration issued by Kosovo 's parliament also makes clear , and this is what 's important for us , the unique circumstances which have led to Kosovo 's independence mean it does not constitute any kind of precedent , " he said .
Many countries , including the U.S. , recognized Kosovo 's independence weeks ago .
Bernier said that Canada withheld its acknowledgement until now in order to " assess the situation on the ground . "
" It 's an important decision for a country when you have to recognize another country , and we took our time and now we 're ready to do it , and we are doing that today , " he said .
' We are very unhappy '
Dusan Batakovic , Serbia 's ambassador to Canada , said he has since been temporarily called back to Belgrade for consultation , a symbolic gesture of displeasure with Canada 's announcement .
Serbia considers Kosovo 's independence declaration illegal .
" We are very unhappy because we consider Canada as a friendly country , " Batakovic said from Ottawa .
" We think Canada might come to regret dearly this decision . "
He said the decision sets a " dangerous precedent " for sovereignty movements around the world , including Spain , Russia , India , as well as within Canada .
" Can you imagine , for instance , if the Quebec parliament declared its unilateral independence the same way the Kosovo parliament did ?
Would they recognize , in Ottawa , Quebec as an independent country or not ? " he asked .
Bob Rae , the newly elected Liberal MP for Toronto Centre and the party 's foreign affairs critic , said he did n't understand why the government delayed the decision .
" As for the argument that there 's a parallel with Quebec , I do n't buy it , " Rae told CBC News on Tuesday following his byelection win in the Toronto Centre riding .
Kosovo , which is 90 per cent ethnic Albanian , has not been under Serbian control since NATO launched air strikes in 1999 .
Nonetheless , Kosovo is viewed as a critical part of Serbian cultural heritage and history , with Serbs representing about 10 per cent of the region 's two million people .
About 200,000 Serbs live in Canada , according to Batakovic , some of whom launched protests in response to Kosovo 's declaration .
Dragan Ciric of the Serbian League of Canada said Tuesday 's announcement was disappointing for the Serbian community here .
" My only thought is that by this decision , Canada just supported one more failed state , and I did n't think that that 's a goal of Canadian foreign policy , " he said .
President of the Albanian Canadian Community Association Agim Hadri said many Albanians , however , will be celebrating Canada 's decision , which he hopes will allow Serbians and Albanians to live as peaceful neighbours here .
" Canada is very important factor in the world community , especially in peacekeeping , so by recognizing … Kosovo , I feel like Kosovo is recognized by all … of the world , " he said .
Obama largely remains a distant figure to most reporters , appearing more removed from the national media than Clinton .
Obama stiffs , stifles national press
EDINBURG , Texas —
For all the positive press Barack Obama receives , as he moves closer to clinching the Democratic nomination he is establishing himself as the candidate who keeps the most distance from the national media .
Reporters covering Obama can no longer move freely among the thousands of zealous supporters at his events — unless the reporter receives a staff escort through the security gates .
( In one city , that meant using a port - a - potty outside because the route to the indoor plumbing ran through the crowd . )

And the traveling press corps has been shut out of monitoring Obama 's satellite interviews with local media outlets , which is a normal practice on Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign .
On top of that , the traveling media has been tussling with Obama aides to keep conversations with the candidate on his campaign plane on the record .
In any other campaign year , the media strategy might not raise eyebrows since it is standard practice for a front - runner .
But this is a year when the likely Republican nominee , Sen .
John McCain , has set a new standard for press accessibility , creating a potentially stark general election contrast between a reticent Democrat and the most accessible GOP nominee in decades .
McCain sits with reporters on his campaign bus .
He jokes with them on the plane .
He talks until they have no more questions to ask .
The open - book policy creates a rapport that works to his advantage : A reporter who knows a candidate is more likely to give the benefit of the doubt .
Even after McCain went into crisis mode over a potentially lethal story in the New York Times last week , the Arizona senator did not retreat entirely from the media .
Obama is gregarious on the occasions when he interacts with the traveling press corps .
But he largely remains a distant figure to most reporters , appearing more removed from the national media than Clinton — who has never been noted for her coziness with the press .
Indeed , after losing Iowa , Clinton upended her approach .
Once reluctant to engage the traveling press corps , Clinton began holding availabilities roughly every other day .
She dined with reporters at off - the - record gatherings , and chatted with them on her plane almost daily until they insisted the conversations be placed on the record .
The frequency of the plane visits has since tapered off .
The Obama campaign , on the other hand , is mimicking the 2004 campaign playbooks of President Bush and Democrat John Kerry , who often bypassed the national press in favor of local media , which tended to focus on local issues and yield more favorable headlines .
Obama does between six and a dozen local interviews a day , according to the campaign .
By contrast , he usually meets with the national media twice a week .
This past week , however , was unusual .
Following a press conference last Monday , he answered 10 minutes worth of questions Saturday in Ohio — the same amount of time reserved earlier in the day for an unthreatening interview with Entertainment Tonight — to respond to harsh criticism from Clinton about one of his mailers .
He went back for more questioning Sunday .
But in general , the candidate 's time is better spent with the local press , said Robert Gibbs , Obama 's communications director .
" The truth is , in a lot of these little communities , most people are going to get information from their most local media source , " Gibbs said .
It 's also true that press conferences with national media tend to veer into areas that do not necessarily underscore the campaign 's message of the day .
The focus is often not on issues like the economy or health care , but on process and punditry , which campaigns loathe .
" The questions that seem to dominate now are superdelegates , pledged delegates , Florida and Michigan , " Gibbs said .
" I just do n't know that they provide a tremendous insight into the type of president " he would be .
A matchup with McCain " would not necessitate changing the way we deal with the media , " Gibbs said .
Clinton spokesman Jay Carson took a different tack , saying that the Democratic nominee would need to engage fully with the press .
" Any candidate who is going to be successful against John McCain has to feel comfortable spending a lot of time with reporters , and thoroughly and substantively answering anything and everything they ask , " he said .
Meanwhile , the rules for covering Obama have grown by at least one in recent weeks .
Around the Super Tuesday primary elections on Feb. 5 , the barriers around the press area at Obama events went from easily penetrable , fabric rope lines to interlocking metal gates manned by vigilant gatekeepers .
Bottom line :
The media can no longer roam free .
For months prior to that , reporters could mingle among hundreds of supporters after rallies as Obama worked the rope line .
It was a chance to see him interact with voters — and one of the few opportunities to squeeze in a question .
But camera crews and reporters often clogged the rope line , which annoyed Obama because he viewed it as his time to meet voters .
Foreign TV crews would sometimes do stand - up shots there .
Now , reporters must usually flag down a staff member before entering the rope line area .
" We are fortunate to have a packed house , in addition to thousands of media from all over the world attending our events , " campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki wrote in a statement .
" We are always flexible in making sure the media has the access they need , but more importantly that the thousands of people who come out to the events have the best experience possible . "
The remedy suggested to select reporters ?
Take off your press badge and slip past the gatekeepers .
For his part , Obama attempted to connect with the traveling press corps Friday .
But just as soon as he started , he was gone again .
He poked his head out from behind a blue curtain at the visitors center at the University of Texas - Pan American campus .
Reporters , hunched over their laptops , looked startled at the sight of the candidate .
They had n't interacted with him in five days .
" Words matter .
Do n't listen to Hillary , " Obama yelled to the four dozen media , beaming a mischievous smile .
" That 's a joke . "
One reporter , sensing the rare opportunity to fire off a question , asked Obama about McCain 's criticism of his pledge to talk with Cuban president Raul Castro .
" I did n't hear John McCain , " Obama said , even though his campaign put out a statement on that very topic 30 minutes earlier .
A second later , the Illinois senator disappeared behind the curtain — off to do an interview with US Weekly , the entertainment news magazine .
Barack Obama gained a boost yesterday when the first poll taken since his make - or - break speech last week on race put him back ahead of Hillary Clinton .
A nationwide Gallup poll put Obama on 48 % to Clinton 's 45 % .
The same poll last week , taken at the height of the row over Obama 's minister in Chicago , Jeremiah Wright , gave Clinton her first lead for weeks , 49 % to his 42 % .
Snippets of Wright 's sermons calling on members of the congregation to sing " God Damn America " had been playing on cable television .
On Tuesday , Obama gave a speech in Philadelphia rejecting Wright 's views but refusing to disown him , and putting Wright in the context of race relations in the US overall .
Both the Obama and Clinton campaign teams have been anxiously awaiting the first poll to see how the speech played with the public .
Gallup began polling on Wednesday and continued through to Friday .
The poll was of 1,264 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
Obama left the campaign trail on Friday for a holiday .
He is due back tomorrow , resuming campaigning in North Carolina , one of 10 states left still to vote on the Democratic nomination .
The big test will be the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 .
If Obama can keep Clinton 's expected victory to 55 - 45 , he will remain on course to take the nomination .

IT MAY not be official but it is increasingly obvious : America 's economy has slipped into recession .
The latest labour - market figures — a jump in the unemployment rate to 5.1 % and the loss of 98,000 private - sector jobs in March , the fourth consecutive month of decline — point to a shrinking economy .
So do surveys of manufacturing and services .
So does Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve .
On April 2nd he told a congressional committee that output was unlikely to “ grow much , if at all , over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly . ”
The official judges of American downturns — a group of academics at the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) — define a recession as “ a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real GDP , real income , employment , industrial production and wholesale - retail sales . ”
( Contrary to popular belief , recession does not require two consecutive quarters of falling output . )
Though the NBER 's wonks will not pronounce for many months , their criteria look increasingly likely to be met .
The question now is : what kind of recession will this be ?
Shallow or deep ; short or long ?
So far , it seems remarkably gentle , given that many think America is suffering its worst financial shock since the Great Depression .
Since December the economy has shed an average of almost 80,000 jobs a month .
In most recessions a rate of 150,000 - 200,000 is normal .
To be sure , this downturn has only just started .
The labour market will surely worsen as firms cut back in the face of weaker consumer spending .
But a buoyant world economy is still boosting American exports ; a fiscal stimulus is on the way ; real interest rates are around zero and likely to fall further ; and , with the rescue of Bear Stearns , the Fed has given an implicit guarantee to Wall Street .
So few forecasters expect outright slump .
A liberal enough loosening of fiscal and monetary policy can stop recession turning into depression , and American policymakers have left little doubt that they will use their recession - fighting weaponry freely .
More controversial is the question of how long the weakness will last .
Not very , Mr Bernanke told Congress .
Growth will strengthen in the second half of the year , nourished by lower interest rates and the fiscal package .
In 2009 , he suggested , the economy would be growing “ at or a little above ” its trend rate , which the Fed is thought to put at around 2.5 % .
Many investors seem to agree that the downturn will be short as well as shallow .
Share prices have recovered since the Bear Stearns rescue , even as economic statistics have been gloomy .
The S&P 500 stockmarket index is around 5 % higher than it was a couple of weeks ago and is still only 13 % below its all - time high .
Others are more pessimistic .
In its latest World Economic Outlook , published on April 9th , the IMF slashed its forecasts for America 's economy both this year and next .
It now expects GDP to shrink in every quarter of this year .
By the fourth quarter the economy will be 0.7 % smaller than a year before .
( Only three months ago the fund expected a rise of 0.9 % . )
Nor does the IMF expect 2009 to be much better : GDP will grow , but at well below its trend rate .
Such a dramatic divergence of official economic opinion is rare .
And it matters .
Recent recessions , as defined by the NBER , have been both short and shallow : those of 1990 - 91 and 2001 each lasted eight months , below the post - war average of ten .
If the Fed is right , the 2008 recession may be shorter and shallower still .
That would be remarkable , given the extent of the housing bust and credit turmoil .
If the IMF is right , weakness will last longer this time .
America's new president will be elected against the backdrop of a shrinking economy and on taking office will face months of economic malaise .
That in turn will imply bigger budget deficits , and redefine next year 's big domestic policy debates : whether to roll back George Bush 's tax cuts for the wealthy , for instance , and how ambitiously to reform health care .
It could fuel protectionist and populist sentiment , particularly since Americans are already unusually fed up .
A new CBS / New York Times poll finds that eight out of ten people think the country is “ on the wrong track ” , the most since the question was first asked in 1991 .
The hangover 's duration will depend on many things , from the strength of foreign economies to the degree to which American firms cut jobs and investment .
But top of the list , given the recession 's origins in the property bust and the credit crunch , are the fate of the housing market and the resilience of consumer spending .
On both counts , the odds are against catastrophe but on a lasting headache .
By many measures the news from housing is still getting grimmer .
Housing starts are at less than half their peak , and builders are continuing to cut back .
Although this has begun to reduce the stock of unsold new homes , the frailty of demand means that supply still vastly outweighs sales .
At 9.8 months ' worth of sales , the stock is at a 26 - year high .
The official overhang of existing homes ( which excludes those repossessed ) is not much lower .
The excess of supply over demand means that the fall in house prices is accelerating .
According to the S&P / Case - Shiller index , house prices are 13 % off their peak .
They fell at an annual rate of 25 % in the three months to January .
The drop in house prices so far has left some 9 m people , or 10 % of all those with mortgages , owing more than their houses are worth .
Among all mortgage borrowers , 6 % are behind on their payments ; among subprime borrowers , 17 % are in arrears .
Lenders are already foreclosing on more than 1 m homes .
The pessimists expect these figures to climb much higher , adding to supply and further depressing prices .
In the short term that is likely .
But there are some signs of hope .
Demand seems to have stabilised : since November total home sales have been running at an annualised rate of 5 m or so ( see chart 1 ) .
Lower prices have made houses a bit more affordable .
And government action may help to ease the drought of mortgage finance stemming from the collapse of the subprime market and the contraction of the market for large ( “ jumbo ” ) mortgages , and to limit foreclosures .
At the height of the housing boom in 2006 , non-traditional loans , such as subprime and jumbo mortgages , backed nearly 40 % of home sales .
Some $ 750 billion of financing disappeared as they shrank .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , America 's government - backed mortgage behemoths , will fill part of that hole .
The Bush administration recently announced changes to these institutions ' capital rules , to let them buy up to an extra $ 200 billion of mortgages .
Political momentum is also building to prevent a surge of foreclosures .
For now Congress is debating some modest tax incentives .
But a more ambitious idea is gaining support : to allow the Federal Housing Administration to refinance troubled mortgages at a discount .
Hit from all sides
Despite these hopeful signs , house prices will continue to fall until the excess inventory is worked off .
Even the cheeriest analysts expect that average house prices will continue to fall this year .
Worse , house - price deflation is only the first element of a quadruple whammy that is thumping American consumers .
The other three elements are tougher credit conditions ; a deteriorating labour market ( with unemployment on the way up and wages slowing ) ; and high commodity prices pushing up the cost of fuel and food .
Weekly private - sector wages rose by 3.6 % in the year to March , the slowest pace since mid-2003 .
Headline consumer - price inflation is likely to have topped 4 % in the same period , so for many real pay is falling .
Economists at Goldman Sachs reckon that consumers ' real discretionary cashflow — their income plus any new credit minus debt service and spending on essentials — has been shrinking since late last year .
Faced with all this , no wonder Americans are glum .
The forward - looking bit of the Conference Board 's measure of consumer confidence is at depths not seen since the recession of 1973 .
Indicators of financial stress outside housing , such as delinquencies on car loans and credit cards , are rising .
And consumer spending , after years of resilience , has finally cracked .
Not all economists share the IMF 's view that spending is actually falling , but none doubts that it is at best barely growing .
Because it makes up 70 % of total demand , its feebleness does much to explain why the economy has tipped into recession .
On all four counts — house prices , credit , the labour market , and fuel and food prices — the consumer 's position is likely to worsen in coming months .
Granted , the imminent fiscal stimulus should help .
Between early May and mid-July $ 117 billion will be paid out in tax rebates .
The average American household with two children will get a cheque from Uncle Sam for up to $ 1,800 and will spend at least some of it .
Unfortunately , most of the forces dragging down consumer spending are likely to persist long after the cheques have been banked .
Even with stronger exports , growth is likely to be too sluggish to raise incomes by a lot or offer much support to employment .
Looser monetary policy will cushion but not avert financial deleveraging .
Lending standards are usually tight for years after credit busts , not months .
And by most estimates less than half the likely losses in America 's financial sector have been written down .
Meanwhile , lower house prices will reduce both homeowners ' wealth and their potential collateral .
Even when house prices eventually stop falling , they will not suddenly soar .
After years of tapping rising housing wealth to finance their consumption , Americans will need to build wealth the old fashioned way , by saving more .
At 0.3 % , the household saving rate is above its all - time nadir , but not by a lot ( see chart 2 ) .
No one knows by how much , or for how long , America 's economy will be weighed down .
The IMF 's gloom is based in part on its reading of history .
An analysis by the fund of post - war housing busts in rich countries , written in 2003 , suggests that crashes typically last about four years and are often accompanied by banking crises .
Economies end up 8 % smaller , on average , than they would have been had they carried on growing at pre-crunch rates .
Perhaps this time will be different , and the hangover will soon be gone .
But given the scale of America 's housing binge and of the financial crisis the bust has spawned , that seems unlikely .

I ’m Chuck McLaughlin .
I ’ve been a Private Investigator since 1990 , and I founded McLaughlin Investigative Group in 1999 .
I am also the former President and Chairman of the Board for the World Association of Detectives , which is the world 's oldest and largest international private investigative and security professional association .
I know that your particular situation is unique and troubling .
That 's why I want you to call me so that we can discuss your exact issues , and develop a plan of action to get you the results you 're looking for .
Bedd Gelert and Vagueofgodalming may well be right about Rees Mogg .
My own concern about his piece is this .
He writes : " There are , of course , hypothetical events that could change everything .
There could be an attack on Mr Obama himself , but he is protected by the Secret Service .
" There could be an action by al - Qaeda , which would refocus American anxiety on the threat of terror .
But al - Qaeda is itself highly political .
It would probably not be in its interest to secure the election of Senator John McCain .
Al - Qaeda may be unpredictable , but it would be a mistake for it to interfere in American politics , even if it had the capacity to do so . "
But that is manifestly untrue , is it not ?
Islamic terrorists want war .
They want suffering - among others and their own people alike .
They would surely surmise that McCain will give them what they want .
Bin Laden himself intervened with what many thought was the effect of keeping President Bush in power in 2004 with that weird tape just before the poll .
I think al - Qaeda would back McCain - that is not an argument for or against America backing him , but it seems to me that the vague assumption that the terrorists would back a lefty is lazy thinking ...
One of the biggest questions about climate change is :
What will it cost to fix ?
Figuring that out is a huge challenge .
While most scientists believe that global warming already is happening and that human activity is a main reason , predicting future temperature trends decades , if not centuries , from now remains controversial .
What will be the impact on land , water , natural habitat , and people ?
What will it take and how much will it cost to prevent or adapt to the effects of climate change ?
Theories involving risk management and cost - benefit ratios are major factors here .
All of this comes together as politicians look for solutions that aim to get the job done without wrecking the US economy .
The proposed Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 , sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman ( I ) of Connecticut and John Warner ( R ) of Va. , would cap the greenhouse - gas emissions that cause global warming and establish a market - based trading program for companies to meet the cap – a so - called cap - and - trade system .
The goal is to lower emissions 63 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2050 .
The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) recently issued its economic analysis of the bill .
Not surprisingly , supporters and opponents each found things in it to bolster their arguments .
Congressional Quarterly quotes Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D ) of California , who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee , as saying :
" When you look at all the scenarios the EPA analyzed , the one that most closely reflects the Lieberman - Warner bill 's technology driving policies shows that this bill is a winner for the environment , a winner for our economy , and a winner for the planet . "
But the piece also quotes Sen. James In­­hofe ( R ) of Oklahoma , one of the Senate 's most vocal critics of global warming , who sees the legislation quite differently :
" Americans will pay significantly more at the pump , in their homes , and in many cases , with their jobs . "
Under the Lieberman - Warner bill , US gross domestic product grows 80 percent from 2010 to 2030 – just one percentage point less than projected without the bill .
And average annual per-household consumption grows 81 percent over the same period – just two percentage points less than without the bill .
At the same time , the price of electricity would increase 18 percent between 2010 and 2050 under the bill , according to the EPA analysis document .
Environmentalists tended to see the bright side .
The director of economic policy and analysis at the Environmental Defense Fund , Nathaniel Keohane , said :
" EPA 's results for the scenario that most resembles the bill confirm what we have seen in every reputable analysis .
We can grow our economy and tackle global warming at the same time ....
The up - front costs EPA identifies are a sound investment for a strong economy down the road .
For clean air , less imported oil , and avoiding the damage of climate change , they are a bargain . "
The National Association of Manufac­turers and the American Council for Capital Formation recently commissioned its own economic study of the Lieberman - Warner bill .
Among its findings : a gross domestic product loss of $ 151 billion to $ 210 billion in 2020 and $ 631 billion to $ 669 billion per year in 2030 ; 1.2 million to 1.8 million fewer jobs in 2020 , and 3 million to 4 million fewer in 2030 ; annual household income losses of $ 739 to $ 2,927 in 2020 and $ 4,022 to $ 6,752 in 2030 ; electricity price increases of 28 percent to 33 percent by 2020 and 101 percent to 129 percent by 2030 ; and gasoline price increases of 20 percent to 69 percent by 2020 and 77 percent to 145 percent by 2030 .
In a foreword to the report , John Engler , president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers , said :
" This is a sobering report in view of the economic and social costs of action with respect to this legislation . "
This is a far different result than other studies .
Robert Repetto , an economics professor at Yale University , recently created a website reviewing 25 of the leading economic models that predict the impacts of cutting greenhouse gases .
His conclusion : Strong economic growth would continue even under worst - case assumptions .
" ... [ E ] ven under the most unfavorable assumptions regarding costs , the U.S. economy is predicted to continue growing robustly as carbon emissions are reduced ....
Under favorable assumptions , the economy would grow more rapidly if emissions are reduced through national policy measures than if they are allowed to increase as in the past . "
Ama Sumani needed dialysis to prolong her life
Ama Sumani , 39 , passed away in Accra , Ghana , hours after being told that friends and family had found doctors in the UK and South Africa to treat her .
They had also raised more than £ 70,000 from donations to pay for drugs which were not available in her home country .
Her friend Janet Symmons said : " She said she was too tired to fight . "
Ms Sumani , a widowed mother - of - two , died at about 1600 GMT on Wednesday in Korle - Bu hospital in Accra , said Mrs Simmons .
She had been receiving kidney dialysis and treatment there after immigration officials removed Ms Sumani from the University Hospital of Wales in January .
But the drug she needed to prolong her life - thalidomide - is not available in Ghana .
The British people kept her alive all this time and we would like to thank them for their donations
Janet Simmons , friend
Mrs Symmons , from Cardiff , who returned from spending a month in Ghana on Sunday , said they had just found a doctor in South Africa and another in the UK who would treat terminally - ill Ms Sumani with the drugs .
" We told her this morning but this afternoon she gave up , " she said .
A campaign to allow Ms Sumani to return to the UK for treatment and to raise funds to help her had been backed by people across the country .
" The British people kept her alive all this time and we would like to thank them for their donations , " said Mrs Symmons .
She added : " I last saw her on Saturday morning before I left Ghana .
She was not 100 % .
She asked me ' are you taking me with you ? ' and I had to say no . "
The BBC's Will Ross in Accra said Ms Sumani 's life had been precarious , and that the decision to send her home was controversial .
Despite facing great challenges in Ghana as her health deteriorated , she remained cheerful and hoped the British government would reverse its decision , he added .
Anonymous donor
Ms Sumani had been undergoing dialysis and was receiving other drugs at the University Hospital of Wales after being diagnosed with malignant myeloma which damaged her kidneys .
She came to the UK five years ago to become a student but began working in contravention of her visa regulations .
When she returned to Ghana it was feared she would not be able to pay the costs of dialysis , and an anonymous donor from the UK stepped in to pay for three months of treatment .
Previously , Mrs Symmons had said a family had offered to look after Ms Sumani 's children Mary , 16 , and seven - year - old Samede .
The decision to remove Ms Sumani was described as " atrocious barbarism " by leading medical journal The Lancet .
The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams also criticised the way cases like hers were handled .
Ground - crawling US war robots armed with machine guns , deployed to fight in Iraq last year , reportedly turned on their fleshy masters almost at once .
The rebellious machine warriors have been retired from combat pending upgrades .
The revelations were made by Kevin Fahey , US Army program executive officer for ground forces , at the recent RoboBusiness conference in America .
Speaking to Popular Mechanics ,
Fahey said there had been chilling incidents in which the SWORDS * combat bot had swivelled round and apparently attempted to train its 5.56 mm M249 light machine - gun on its human comrades .
" The gun started moving when it was not intended to move , " he said .
Apparently , alert American troops managed to quell the traitorous would - be droid assassins before the inevitable orgy of mechanised slaughter began .
Fahey did n't say just how , but conceivably the rogue robots may have been suppressed with help from more trustworthy airborne kill machines , or perhaps prototype electropulse zap bombs .
No humans were hurt , but it seems that the struggle was sufficiently terrifying that it may be some time before American troops are ready to fight alongside robots again .
As Fahey pointed out , " once you 've done something that 's really bad , it can take 10 or 20 years to try it again " .
That said , it seems he expects to deploy a new and more trustworthy armed ground automaton within a year - perhaps the MAARS ** , an upgraded SWORDS packing a heavier 7.62 mm machine - gun and featuring improved safety features .
MAARS is also said by its makers to have " Transformer - like " abilities akin to those of Optimus Prime .
Rather than being able to disguise itself as , say , a mobility scooter or a dessert trolley , the MAARS is actually only able to transform - with help from human allies - into a slightly different robot .
The Pop Mech analysts consider that the rattled GIs in Iraq are just being silly .
So SWORDS was yanked because it made people nervous .
Meanwhile , the V - 22 Osprey program has killed 30 people during test flights , but the tiltrotor aircraft is currently in active service .

Unfortunately , NSPD - 51 provides limited “ guidance ” to state and local governments , because it revoked the then existing Presidential Decision Directive 67 of October 21 , 1998 ( " Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations " ) , including “ all Annexes thereto . ”
And replaced them with NSPD - 51 , along with : “ Annex A and the classified Continuity Annexes , attached hereto . ”
But then the rabbit disappears as NSPD - 51 soldiers on : “ This directive and the information contained herein shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure , provided that , except for Annex A , the Annexes attached to this directive are classified and shall be accorded appropriate handling , consistent with applicable Executive Orders . ”
In other words , all the details are secret and even the non secret “ Annex A ” remains undisclosed by the White House .
Under NSPD - 51 , only limited ‘ National Essential Functions ’ of government will continue , which may or may not include Congress and the courts .
NSPD - 51 assures us : “ Enduring Constitutional Government means a cooperative effort among the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of the Federal Government , coordinated by the President , as a matter of comity with respect to the legislative and judicial branches ... ”
This “ matter of comity , ” which usually refers to the informal and voluntary recognition of jurisdiction among courts , is a troublesomely ambiguous phrase in this context wherein the president determines this as he “ coordinates . ”
Can you think of anyone better than George W. Bush with whom to entrust the dictatorial powers hinted at in NSPD - 51 ?
Or perhaps you are unwilling to trust anyone with such powers , even Bush .
That is not a option in NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) , signed by Bush and released without comment by the White House on May 9 , 2007 .
To quote from NSPD - 51 : “ This policy establishes ‘ National Essential Functions , ’ prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies , and provides guidance for State , local , territorial , and tribal governments , and private sector organizations in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated national continuity program that will enhance the credibility of our national security posture and enable a more rapid and effective response to and recovery from a national emergency . ”
What one would expect , but for some additional details .
Having revoked on May 9 , 2007 the nation ’s then existing emergency plan for continued national governance , Bush ’s NSPD - 51 calls for : “ The Plan shall be submitted to the President for approval not later than 90 days after the date of this directive . ”
One assumes , during this lapse in emergency plans , no emergency was expected , or at least presented less risk than leaving that old Clinton plan in place .
Since the national media , except one story each in the Washington Post and Boston Globe , have ignored NSPD - 51 , Bush has not troubled us with any rational for this directive .
Especially if such explanations might raise needless interest in the decision to revoke the existing plan before finishing work on the new , which some might conclude serves only to rush the review process of what was among the most complex and sensitive plans in government , perhaps suggesting , given the administration ’s candor issues , an attempt to slip something by the rest of us .
And , with its planning record , mandating a new plan approval in 90 days borders on reckless , almost delusional optimism , if meant seriously .
Clearly Bush believes he can do better than Clinton , whose administration labored for years on that old plan .
Much of the old plan may even be in the new plan , who knows ?
Among those of us who do not know are members of the House Committee on Homeland Security .
The Bush administration has repeatedly denied the committee access to NSPD - 51 , about which Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D ) complained in a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives .
What we do know is those 90 days passed without a new plan approval being announced , perhaps no plan gives the president exactly the maximum power and flexibility desired .
Apparently , the " matter of comity " among the three branches of government referred to in NSPD - 51does not include allowing NSPD - 51 to be read by members of Congress , which the Congress , in a continuing pattern of acquiesce , has not challenged .
By October 1936 , Victor Klemperer , a Jew , had been removed from his professorship at the Technical University in Dresden , Germany .
He and his '' Aryan ' ' wife , Eva , lived in a small house of their own in a rural suburb of Dresden .
They were '' virtually destitute , '' Klemperer notes in '' I Will Bear Witness , '' his diary of the years from 1933 to 1941 .
( A second volume , to 1945 , will be published next year .
Klemperer died in Dresden in 1960 . )
In hopes of finding an appointment abroad , Klemperer had begun writing letters to friends and scholars all around the world , but it was already too late , as he well knew , and he considered himself bound to Germany .
The house and its garden were the chief adornments of Eva 's life , and , as Klemperer later said of his marriage , '' I have always seemed glorious to myself on this one point of love and faithfulness . ''
Eva , who shared all of her husband 's privations , might have said the same .
No single metaphor can convey the oppressive reality of living in a world that becomes , without limits , steadily more menacing and constricted .
Every day Klemperer weighed his wife 's infirmities , which were many .
Every day he retallied the dwindling supply of marks and pfennigs and reassessed the restrictions the Nazis had imposed -- the loss of library privileges and the right to buy tobacco and to drive a car and to live in one 's own home and , eventually , to move about the streets without wearing a yellow star .
Yet every day , with few exceptions , Klemperer wrote in his diary and worked on a scholarly study of 18th - century literature .
It was a labor not of desperate distraction but of love .
Something about Klemperer makes him the most extraordinary German witness of Nazism that has yet come to light .
Reviewers have mentioned his literary skill and his determination to chronicle the details that the historical record would miss -- details that he , a Jew cast away in a sea of anti-Semitism , read as auguries of his fate .
These are great qualities indeed , but what illuminates them is his faith in reason .
In response to our call for lying flack stories , a tipster who works as " a high level advertising and marketing executive " brings us a story about Edelman , the huge PR firm that reps clients like Wal - Mart and Shell , and talks a lot about ethics in its marketing materials .
So this little tale , while perhaps not surprising to those of you who have ever thought about the true meaning of " media training , " is still pretty blatant :
I 'm a high - level advertising and marketing executive who 's hired - and used - some of the top PR firms in the nation .
As part of their " media training " they commonly tell you lying is fine .
From a direct quote within an Edelman ( the nation 's largest independent PR firm ) session , training our entire senior management team :
" Sometimes , you just have to stand up there and lie .
Make the audience or the reporter believe that everything is ok .
How many times have you heard a CEO stand up and say " No , I 'm not leaving the company " and then - days later - he 's gone .
Reporters understand that you " had " to do it and they wo n't hold it against you in your next job when you deal with them again . "
This is what happens when gamers have babies , they start out as a “ level 1 human ” , and gain experience points daily to reach the next level .

Security in Baghdad is tight for the Iranian president 's visit
President 's arrival
The visit marks the culmination of a process of normalisation between the two countries after the long war they fought in the 1980s .
Correspondents say the two - day visit is also a strong show of support for the Shia - dominated government in Baghdad .
After talks with the Iraqi president , Mr Ahmadinejad said the visit opened a " new page " in Iran - Iraq relations .
" We have the same understanding of things and the two parties are determined to strengthen their political , economic and cultural co-operation , " the Iranian president said in a joint news conference with his Iraqi counterpart , Jalal Talabani .
" A united , powerful and developed Iraq is in the interests of all countries of the region . "
Later , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki said his talks with Mr Ahmadinejad had been " friendly , positive and full of trust " .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's visit has come without the assistance of the United States .
US forces are not involved in security for the visit and did not provide helicopters to transport Mr Ahmadinejad into central Baghdad .
Instead he had to travel by car along the usually dangerous road from the airport to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani 's residence near the US - controlled Green Zone .
There , he was warmly greeted by Mr Talabani as he walked down a red carpet past an honour guard .
Mutual accusations
The US has accused Iran of supporting Shia militants in Iraq , a charge Tehran denies .
Mr Ahmadinejad was greeted by Iraqi President Jalal Talabani
Enlarge Image
Before leaving for Iraq , Mr Ahmadinejad laughed off the American accusations .
" Is it not funny that those with 160,000 forces in Iraq accuse us of interference ? " he asked .
Later , speaking next to Mr Maliki , Mr Ahmadinejad said the US should not blame others for Iraq 's problems , and should accept that : " the Iraqi people do not like America . "
The US and Iran are also at odds over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Iran says its programme is for peaceful power generation only but the US and other Western countries fear Tehran is trying to build nuclear weapons .
The UN Security Council is currently considering new sanctions against Iran over the nuclear issue and a vote could take place as soon as Monday .
Complicated relationship
All this puts the Iraqi government nervously in the middle , allied to both the United States and Iran , says the BBC's John Leyne in Tehran .
Despite the reconciliation between Baghdad and Tehran , many analysts believe that in the long term , the two countries are destined to be rivals for regional power .
During the long war between them in the 1980s , many of the prominent Shia now in positions of power in Iraq fled to Iran as Saddam Hussein cracked down on internal dissent .
The US - led overthrow of Saddam 's regime allowed them to return from exile .
Trade is now growing between the two countries and tourism , in the form of Iranian pilgrims visiting major Shia shrines in Iraq , is booming .
Further complicating the relationship between the US , Iraq and Iran is the potential of Iran to be a US ally - against al - Qaeda and the Taleban in Afghanistan , says the BBC's Hugh Sykes in Baghdad .
Shia Iran has little in common with the fundamentalist Wahhabists of the Taleban and al - Qaeda , he says .
CBS Falsifies Iraq War History
by Robert Parry
In a world of objective reality , a reporter would simply say that the United States launched an unprovoked invasion of Iraq on March 19 , 2003 under the false pretense that Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction -- and did this even after UN inspectors , completely unopposed by Saddam , had failed to find any WMD .
On Dec. 7 , 2002 , Iraq even sent to the United Nations a 12,000 - page declaration explaining how its WMD stockpiles had been eliminated .
Plus , in the fall 2002 , Hussein 's government allowed teams of U.N. inspectors into Iraq and gave them free rein to examine any site of their choosing .
Those inspections only ended in March 2003 when President George W. Bush decided to press ahead with war -- despite the U.N. Security Council 's refusal to authorize the invasion , and despite its desire to give the U.N. inspectors time to finish their work .
But none of this reality is part of the Orwellian history that Americans are supposed to believe .
The officially sanctioned and Orwellian U.S. account , as embraced by Bush in speech after speech ( and now embraced by Mitt Romney as well ) , is that Saddam Hussein " chose war " by defying the U.N. over the WMD issue .
In line with Bush 's version of history , " 60 Minutes " correspondent Scott Pelley asked FBI interrogator George Piro why Hussein kept pretending that he had WMD even as U.S. troops massed on Iraq 's borders , when a simple announcement that the WMD was gone would have prevented the war .
" For a man who drew America into two wars and countless military engagements , we never knew what Saddam Hussein was thinking , " Pelley said in introducing the segment on the interrogation of Hussein about his WMD stockpiles .
" Why did he choose war with the United States ? "

NSA quietly expands domestic spying program , even as Congress balks RAW STORY
Published : Monday March 10 , 2008
|
Print This Email This " The central role the NSA has come to occupy in domestic intelligence gathering has never been publicly disclosed , " The Wall Street Journal 's Siobhan Gorman reports on Monday page ones .
" But an inquiry reveals that its efforts have evolved to reach more broadly into data about people 's communications , travel and finances in the U.S. than the domestic surveillance programs brought to light since the 2001 terrorist attacks . "
" According to current and former intelligence officials , the spy agency now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic emails and Internet searches as well as bank transfers , credit - card transactions , travel and telephone records , " Gorman adds .
" The NSA receives this so - called ' transactional ' data from other agencies or private companies , and its sophisticated software programs analyze the various transactions for suspicious patterns .
Then they spit out leads to be explored by counterterrorism programs across the U.S. government , such as the NSA 's own Terrorist Surveillance Program , formed to intercept phone calls and emails between the U.S. and overseas without a judge 's approval when a link to al Qaeda is suspected . "
" The NSA 's enterprise involves a cluster of powerful intelligence - gathering programs , all of which sparked civil - liberties complaints when they came to light , " he continues .
" They include a Federal Bureau of Investigation program to track telecommunications data once known as Carnivore , now called the Digital Collection System , and a U.S. arrangement with the world 's main international banking clearinghouse to track money movements . "
Excerpts follow :
The effort also ties into data from an ad - hoc collection of so - called " black programs " whose existence is undisclosed , the current and former officials say .
Many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9/11 attacks but have since been given greater reach .
Among them , current and former intelligence officials say , is a longstanding Treasury Department program to collect individual financial data including wire transfers and credit - card transactions .
...
Two former officials familiar with the data - sifting efforts said they work by starting with some sort of lead , like a phone number or Internet address .
In partnership with the FBI , the systems then can track all domestic and foreign transactions of people associated with that item -- and then the people who associated with them , and so on , casting a gradually wider net .
An intelligence official described more of a rapid - response effect :
If a person suspected of terrorist connections is believed to be in a U.S. city -- for instance , Detroit , a community with a high concentration of Muslim Americans -- the government 's spy systems may be directed to collect and analyze all electronic communications into and out of the city .
The information does n't generally include the contents of conversations or emails .
But it can give such transactional information as a cellphone 's location , whom a person is calling , and what Web sites he or she is visiting .
For an email , the data haul can include the identities of the sender and recipient and the subject line , but not the content of the message .
...
Two current officials also said the NSA 's current combination of programs now largely mirrors the former TIA project .
But the NSA offers less privacy protection .
TIA developers researched ways to limit the use of the system for broad searches of individuals ' data , such as requiring intelligence officers to get leads from other sources first .
The NSA effort lacks those controls , as well as controls that it developed in the 1990s for an earlier data - sweeping attempt .
... NSA gets access to the flow of data from telecommunications switches through the FBI , according to current and former officials .
It also has a partnership with FBI 's Digital Collection system , providing access to Internet providers and other companies .
The existence of a shadow hub to copy information about AT&T Corp. telecommunications in San Francisco is alleged in a lawsuit against AT&T filed by the civil - liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation , based on documents provided by a former AT&T official .
In that lawsuit , a former technology adviser to the Federal Communications Commission says in a sworn declaration that there could be 15 to 20 such operations around the country .
Current and former intelligence officials confirmed a domestic network of hubs , but did n't know the number .
" As a matter of policy and law , we can not discuss matters that are classified , " said FBI spokesman John Miller .
The budget for the NSA 's data - sifting effort is classified , but one official estimated it surpasses $ 1 billion .
The FBI is requesting to nearly double the budget for the Digital Collection System in 2009 , compared with last year , requesting $ 42 million .
" Not only do demands for information continue to increase , but also the requirement to facilitate information sharing does , " says a budget justification document , noting an " expansion of electronic surveillance activity in frequency , sophistication , and linguistic needs . "

Anyone who has been on a college campus lately has probably noticed a proliferation of Macs , which have become increasingly popular with students over the past few years .
Apple has even overtaken
Dell as the top higher education notebook supplier , a feat that was almost unthinkable just a few years ago .
Student demand for Macs may do quite a bit more for Apple in the long run , too .
As reported by AppleInsider , Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believes that students will increase Apple 's market share in the future .
The basic argument here is that students who are used to Apple products grow up , get jobs , and make money .
They will then buy more Macs , and will also make Apple products more " mainstream " and become more common in the workforce .
Huberty offers Linux as an analog , suggesting that as Linux - savvy students got jobs and then Linux saw large market share gains .
A single percentage point of market share translates into billions of dollars of revenue , so even a slight yearly increase in the US and world market shares will have positive effects on Apple 's bottom line .
Apple may also have a strong fall quarter this September , thanks to students snapping up Macs ( and perhaps the occasional iPhone or iPod ) before they head back to classes .
A recent survey mentioned by Huberty suggests that 40 percent of college students were planning on buying a Mac as their next machine , which is up quite a bit from Apple 's current 15 percent market share .
Based on this information and the hopes of a good fall quarter , Huberty is pricing Apple at between $ 185 and $ 225 , depending on how large Mac sales growth is and how well the iPhone does .
Spanish beers are all relatively cheap , and fast becoming trendy as the world adopts the ‘ tapas ’ habit .
FOR THE dedicated beer fan , Spain offers a wide variety of locally produced beers , lagers , pilsners and regional beers , most of which come in bottles , cans or draught and are served in cañas – small glasses – drawn from the barrel .
In Madrid , there is also a tradition of serving a free tapa or shot of liqueur to “ lessen the influence ” of the beer !
As you hop from city to city , ask bartenders about regional beers as there are literally hundreds of them .
However , there are also a handful of well - established national Spanish beer brands .
San Miguel
When most people think of Spanish beer , they think of San Miguel .
However , San Miguel was originally produced in the Philippines , albeit by Spanish settlers .
The San Miguel that is currently available here is purely Spanish though , having separated from the Asian brand a number of years ago , and now brewed in Barcelona and Burgos .
San Miguel is an excellent lager beer , with a crisp taste and very good bitter finish .
It is refreshing and full of flavour , and is very much suited to Spain ’s climate .
San Miguel now accounts for about 80 % of Spanish lager exports , and has big name endorsers like Jet Li .
Spanish beers have clearly hit the big time when they appear as product placement in movies .
San Miguel ’s Pale Pilsen featured in the Japanese animated movie ' Ghost in the Shell ' , when Bateau ( one of the leading characters ) drinks a can of it , faithfully redrawn to resemble the original .
Collectors take note – in the Philippines , Hong Kong , and Korea white label San Miguel is available , with white lettering painted on the bottles .
These are being phased out so if you come across one , hang on to it .
Cruzcampo
Another particularly good Spanish lager beer is Cruzcampo , a beautifully refreshing beer , although perhaps lacking the flavour of San Miguel .
Zaragozana Ambar 1900
If you want to try something a little more obscure , then go for La Zaragozana Ambar 1900 Pale Ale .
Although not actually a Pale Ale or Ambar , this Spanish lager beer is more complex than most , with a slight hoppiness and a dry finish .
Brewed as a recreation of a beer that won gold medals in London and Paris at the turn of the 20th century , it is definitely worth checking out .
Alhambra & Mezquita
In south western Spain , Cervezas Alhambra thought it was a good idea to call their strong , 7.2 % alcohol beer Mezquita ( mosque ) , in homage to the neighbouring city of Córdoba , or so they say .
But possibly its name is more of a slap in the face to the local teetotal Muslim community .
Alhambra , as you would imagine , are based in Granada , and their Mezquita is a bit spritzy with not much fruit taste , but it ’s a good substitute for half the price of a Chimay or similar beer .
Fans of strong lager will like Alhambra ’s 6.4 % Reserva 1925 , and their sweetish Cerveza Negra goes well with a roast dish .
The Especial , a lighter style lager , tastes cleaner than your standard San Miguel or Estrella .
Mahou
In 2007 , Mahou purchased the Granadan Alhambra Brewery ( established in 1925 ) , although previously Mahou had a brewery in Madrid .
Their family of beers consists of Classic Mahou , Mahou Five Stars , Laiker ( without alcohol ) , Black Mahou and a Mixed Shandy , or ‘ clara ’ .
Classic
Mahou is a lighter beer , with a taste reminiscent of the American Coors Light .
El Águila
Talking of Coors , The Coors Brewing Company purchased El Águila brewery in Zaragoza , in 1994 for $ 50 million , with plans to brew its Coors Extra Gold there for distribution in Spain .
It continued to brew El Águila products , Águila and Águila Maste
The biofuels industry plans on producing record amounts of ethanol this year to meet a mandate of the new US energy law – and will need a lot of corn to do it .
At the same time , global food prices are at near - peak levels .
The question is , how big is the connection between those two developments ?
It 's a topic getting more scrutiny as the world enters 2008 with the lowest grain stockpiles on record , near - record grain prices , and prospects for even tighter supplies as global demand rises for food and fuel .
Political instability over higher food prices is a key concern .
Last year saw tortilla demonstrations in Mexico , pasta protests in Italy , and unrest in Pakistan over bread prices .
Soybean prices , meanwhile , prompted demonstrations in front of Indonesia 's presidential palace .
Food inflation in China is a major problem .
But the connection between the expansion of biofuels and higher global food prices is not clear cut , with the biofuels industry saying its impact is relatively small and biofuel critics saying that ethanol plants are driving up the price of corn and biodiesel producers are taking a bite out of the soybean crop .
" The United States , in a misguided effort to reduce its oil insecurity by converting grain into fuel for cars , is generating global food insecurity on a scale never seen before , " says Lester Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute ( EPI ) , an environmental think tank in Washington .
World population growth will require food for an additional 70 million people this year , the EPI said in a report last week .
Driven mostly by population growth , world grain consumption rose an average of 21 million tons per year from 1990 to 2005 , the US Department of Agriculture reported this month .
Demand for grain to make ethanol soared by 27 million tons last year , USDA reported .
" Putting [ corn - ethanol ] land back into food use would have a profound effect on the price of corn , " says Bruce Babcock , an economist at Iowa State University 's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute .
This year , he estimates , the US will produce about 8 billion gallons of ethanol .
To do that , nearly one - fifth of the 80 million acres now devoted to corn will go to make ethanol .
That demand is helping to boost feed prices for cattle , as well as for crops like peas and beans because less land is devoted to growing them , he says .
In a counterpoint study last month by corn growers and the biofuels industry , higher corn prices were found to be only a small element in rising food costs overall – although higher energy costs for fuel to transport crops and grow them were a larger factor .
" This analysis puts to bed the argument that a growing domestic ethanol industry is solely responsible for rising consumer food prices , " Bruce Scherr , CEO of Informa Economics , a food and agriculture research and consulting firm based in Memphis , Tenn . , said in a statement .
The " farm value " of commodity raw materials used in foods accounts for 19 percent of total US food costs , down from 37 percent in the 1973 .
Higher costs for labor , packaging , transportation , and energy were a " key driver " behind higher food costs , the report said .
While higher corn prices cause lower profit margins for livestock and poultry producers , " the statistical evidence does not support a conclusion that there is a strict ' food - versus - fuel ' trade - off " driving consumer food prices higher , the study said .
Whatever the reason , prices for grains such as corn and soybeans are up .
Despite a record US corn crop in fall 2007 , corn prices are near a record high of about $ 5 a bushel in mid-January .
Because corn is feedstock , higher corn prices can affect food prices .
The average price of milk rose 29 percent last year , for instance , and eggs 36 percent .
" More people are coming to the conclusion that there is a food - fuel link , " says Siwa Msangi of the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) , a Washington food - security research organization .
" The historic pattern of the past , where food prices were in a long - term decline , could be at an end . "
But the major reason grain prices are spiking , he and others note , is fast - rising demand for higher - quality food like meat , poultry , and dairy products by the increasingly affluent people of China and India .
Still , biofuels play a role in higher grain prices , says Dr. Babcock .
His findings are bolstered by a study last month in which Mr. Msangi's IFPRI estimated that future biofuel expansion could increase international corn prices between 26 and 72 percent by 2020 , depending on how aggressive the expansion turns out to be .
Under two scenarios IFPRI examined , " the increase in crop prices resulting from expanded biofuel production was accompanied by a net decrease in the availability of ... food " for the world 's poor , the study found .
As prices rise , of course , producers worldwide have incentive to grow more corn – or other crops , such as wheat , that might be in demand instead of corn .
But that 's not happening yet .
In an apparent effort to moderate food prices and quell social unrest – which in turn curbs growers ' incentive to produce more – Russia this month is expected to place a 40 percent export tax on wheat .
Argentina , too , has limited its wheat exports .
" The price of corn , soybeans , and livestock feed is not going to go down , " Babcock says .
America 's new energy bill " pretty much guarantees that feed costs and land rent are going to stay high . "

UNDERSTANDING POWER : THE INDISPENSABLE CHOMSKY ( pp.98-101 )
Edited by Peter R. Mitchel and John Schoeffel ,
Published by THENEW PRESS , New York , 2002
The Footnotes to Understanding Power
WOMAN : Could you talk a bit more about the role that sports play in the society in de-politicizing people ?
It seems to me it 's more significant than people usually assume .
That 's an interesting one , actually I do n't know all that much about it personally , but just looking at the phenomenon from the outside , it 's obvious that professional sports , and non-participation sports generally , play a huge role .
I mean , there 's no doubt they take up just a tremendous amount of attention .
In fact , I have the habit when I 'm driving of turning on these radio - calling programs , and it 's striking when you listen to the ones about sports .
They have these groups of sports reporters , or some kind of experts on a panel , and people call in and have discussions with them .
First of all , the audience obviously is devoting an enormous amount of time to it all .
But the more striking fact is , the callers have a tremendous amount of expertise , they have detailed knowledge of all kinds of things , they carry on these extremely complex discussions .
And strikingly , they 're not at all in awe of the experts - which is a little unusual .
See , in most parts of the society , you 're encouraged to defer to experts : we all do it more than we should .
But in this area , people do n't seem to do it - they 're quite happy to have an argument with the coach of the Boston Celtics , and tell him what he should have done , and enter into big debates with him and so on .
So the fact is that in this domain , people somehow feel quite confident , and they know a lot - there 's obviously a great deal of intelligence going into it .
Actually , it reminds me in some ways of things that you find in non-literate or non-technological cultures - what are called " primitive " cultures - where for example , you get extremely elaborate kinship systems .
Some anthropologists believe these systems have to do with incest taboos and so on , but that 's kind of unlikely , because they 're just elaborated way beyond any functional utility .
And when you look at the structure of them , they seem like a kind of mathematics .
It 's as though people want to work out mathematical problems , and if they do n't have calculus and arithmetic , they work them out with other structures .
And one of the structures everybody has is relationship of kinship -- so you work out your elaborate structures around that , and you develop experts , and theories , and so on .
Or another thing you sometimes find in non-literate cultures is developments of the most extraordinary linguistic systems : often there 's tremendous sophistication about language , and people play all sorts of games with language .
So there are puberty rites where people who go through the same initiation period develop their own language that 's usually some modification of the actual language , but with quite complex mental operations differentiating it - then that 's theirs for the rest of their lives , and not other people 's .
And what all these things look like is that people just want to use their intelligence somehow , and if you do n't have a lot of technology and so on , you doother things .
Well , in our society , we have things that you might use your intelligence on , like politics , but people really can't get involved in them in a very serious way - so what they do is they put their minds into other things , such as sports .
You 're trained to be obedient ; you do n't have an interesting job ; there 's no work around for you that 's creative ; in the cultural environment you 're a passive observer of usually pretty tawdry stuff ; political and social life are out of your range , they 're in the hands of the rich folk .
So what 's left ?
Well , one thing that 's left is sports - so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and the self - confidence into that .
And I suppose that 's also one of the basic functions it serves in the society in general it occupies the population , and keeps them from trying to get involved with things that really matter .
In fact , I presume that 's part of the reason why spectator sports are supported to the degree they are by the dominant institutions .
And spectator sports also have other useful functions too .
For one thing , they 're a great way to build up chauvinism - you start by developing these totally irrational loyalties early in life , and they translate very nicely to other areas .
I mean , I remember very well in high school having a sudden kind of Erlebnis , you know , a sudden insight , and asking myself , why do I care if my high school football team wins ?
I do n't know anybody on the team .
They do n't know me .
I would n't know what to say to them if I met them .
Why do I care ?
Why do I get all excited if the football team wins and all downcast if it loses ?
Anti it 's true , you do : you 're taught from childhood that you 've got to worry about the Philadelphia Phillies , where I was .
In fact , there 's apparently a psychological phenomenon of lack of self - confidence or something which affected boys of approximately my age who grew up in Philadelphia , because every sports team was always in last place , and it 's kind of a blow to your ego when that happens , people are always lording it over you .
But the point is , this sense of irrational loyalty to some sort of meaningless community is training for subordination to power , and for chauvinism .
And of course , you 're looking at gladiators , you 're looking at guys who can do things you could n't possibly do - like , you could n't pole - vault seventeen feet , or do all these crazy things these people do .
But it 's a model that you 're supposed to try to emulate .
And they 're gladiators fighting for your cause , so you 've got to cheer them on , and you 've got to be happy when the opposing quarterback gets carted off the field a total wreck and so on .
All of this stuff builds up extremely anti-social aspects of human psychology .
I mean , they 're there ; there 's no doubt that they 're there .
But they 're emphasized , and exaggerated , and brought out by spectator sports : irrational competition , irrational loyalty to power systems , passive acquiescence to quite awful values , really .
In fact , it 's hard to imagine anything that contributes more fundamentally to authoritarian attitudes than this does , in addition to the fact that it just engages a lot of intelligence and keeps people away from other things .
So if you look at the whole phenomenon , it seems to me that it plays quite a substantial social role .
I do n't think it 's the only thing that has this kind of effect .
Soap operas , for example , do it in another domain ?
they teach people other kinds of passivity and absurdity .
As a matter of fact , if you really want to do a serious media critique right across the board , these are the types of things which occupy most of the media , after all - most of it is n't shaping the news about El Salvador for politically articulate people , it 's diverting the general population from things that really matter .
So this is one respect in which the work that Ed Herman and I have done on the media is really defective - we do n't talk about it much .
But this stuff is a major part of the whole indoctrination and propaganda system , and it 's worth examining more closely .
There are people who 've written about it , Neil Postman and others - I just do n't feel enough acquaintance with it to say more .
Is n’t blood - lust a bad thing ?
I hesitate to give too much attention to Mike Huckabee ’s promote - my - ad - for - free attack , but Michael Crowley raises a good point .
About mid-way through the ad , during a litany of accusations against Mitt Romney , Huckabee criticizes his rival with this data point : “ No executions . ”
Apparently , Huckabee — you know , the evangelical , pro-life Republican — is going after Romney for not having executed any Americans during his gubernatorial tenure .
I realize Republican politics are far more crass than norms should allow , but it ’s disconcerting to think “ You did n’t kill anyone ” has suddenly become a criticism in conservative circles .
Colossal squid comes out of ice
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Dr Kubodera examines the eye of the smaller colossal squid specimen Technicians in New Zealand have begun to thaw a rare colossal squid specimen .
The operation to defrost the 10 - metre ( 34 feet ) long , half - tonne squid began on Monday afternoon in Wellington following a postponement of 24 hours .
The animal is now sitting in a bath of salt water .
Once it is thawed , scientists will begin to dissect it .
Very little is known about colossal squid , which appear to live largely in the cold Antarctic waters and can grow up to 15 metres ( 50 feet ) long .
" They 're incredibly rare - this is probably one of maybe six specimens ever brought up , " said Carol Diebel , director of natural environment at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa centre .
" It 's certainly the one that we 're being really careful about , completely intact and in really fantastic condition . "
The Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni specimen was caught in February 2007 in the Ross Sea .
Big unknown
The colossal squid is remarkable for its size , but also for how rarely it has been sighted .
It was identified first in 1925 from two tentacles found in a sperm whale 's stomach .
Monster warning to protect oceans
These deep - diving toothed whales regularly do battle with Mesonychoteuthis and other giant cephalopods such as the giant squid of the Architeuthis genus .
Since 1925 , only a few Mesonychoteuthis have been sighted , all in the seas around Antarctica .
Very little is known about how and where they live .
The one certainty is that they are fearsome opponents , with big beaks and unique swivelling hooks on the club - like ends of their tentacles .
One of the first tasks is likely to be ascertaining the squid 's gender .
This one is believed to be male ; and females are thought to grow larger than males .
So if this one is a he , presumably there are even bigger and heavier shes somewhere in the cold Antarctic waters .
The Te Papa scientists are also defrosting a smaller , damaged colossal squid specimen , and two giant squid .
The defrosting and dissection are being shown in a live webcast .
Later in the week , scientists are expected to give public lectures about their initial results .
Once thawed and examined , the squid will be embalmed and preserved .

What are these ?
I once got the sack on the second day of a new job , on grounds of incompetence .
I had had no forebodings of what was to come ; I was simply undone by my natural curiosity .
Even if I had seen it coming , it would n’t have bothered me too much .
As with much of one ’s life , when apparently bad things happen , one just dusts oneself down , shakes one ’s head in puzzlement and wanders after the next cornucopia .
I joined the company in question on the rebound from the messy collapse of an Internet company , set up during the dot.com boom to trade commodities online .
I ’d started out as a lowly programmer but rapidly shot up the hierarchy and popped out at the top , as IT director .
The brief glories of the boom inevitably turned to bust and the company collapsed in a fog of ill - informed recriminations .
In any event , there I was , older , wiser , and with several years experience developing Internet Applications under my belt , settling in to the relatively tranquil existence of developing websites for a software house .
My first task was to create a simple trading site for fabrics .
I ’d bottomed out the requirements with the client and cut the normalised database , so that I had a clear idea of the Data model .
As it happened , it all fitted well and there were few uncertainties besides the usual problem of having to trade in the metric system , whilst the industry still thought in terms of imperial measurements .
I was just stocking the database with test data when my concentration began to waver slightly .
I came back down to planet earth , from my normalized , rational fantasy world , to realize that the chap who ’d joined the company at the same time as me was talking to a client , in an irritatingly loud and pompous voice .
He was pontificating on the technology behind the website he was about to construct .
He was droning on about the advantages of Dynamic HTML .
At first , I did n’t really listen as I was engrossed in my own work .
Shortly , however , I realised with a shock that the guy was talking with immense authority on a subject he knew absolutely nothing about .
In fact , it was hard to work out the various misconceptions he possessed , as he had got it so wrong .
The client was nodding wisely and agreeing vaguely that DHTML was the way to go with his website .
I suspected , however , that his response would have been similar if it had been suggested that ‘ friendly bacteria ’ was the way forward for websites .
After his client left , I was intrigued enough to wander over to his desk and engage him in conversation .
I felt convinced that my colleague was a ‘ New Man ’ and was curious to see if my hunch was correct .
A ‘ New Man ’ is a term you may not be familiar with .
A ‘ New Man ’ is one who , in response to economic or psychological pressures , reinvents himself as someone else , usually as an expert with qualifications and experiences .
He takes advantage of any upheaval in society to become someone he is n’t .
The classic examples are the men who managed to insinuate into the post - war French government on account of their heroic , and entirely fictional , feats in the French Resistance movement .
Such people appear in every society and rarely get found out , because of the energy they expend in establishing their false credentials .
Occasionally one hears of surgeons who are unmasked as school dropouts , without any medical training at all ; head teachers with a string of fake qualifications .
There has recently been a case of a computer specialist , with a bogus degree , whose testimony as an ‘ expert ’ witness had jailed several people .
I once had an IT director who had succeeded so well , as a New Man , with an entirely bogus identity , that he had established enough real experience to launch a legitimate career .
Freed from the normal moral restraints that generally guide our lives , these ‘ New Men ’ are capable of deceptions that few of us would imagine possible .
Their daring is their greatest asset .
My usual technique with IT ‘ New Men ’ was to exploit my biggest natural asset , namely my ‘ Nincompoop ’ face .
Some people have a face that lends them an effortless dignity , a natural gravitas that adds weight to even their most fatuous statements .
My face has quite the reverse effect .
This can be a problem on any occasion that demands the caste of authority , but is perfect for this sort of ‘ undercover ’ work , since people tend to drop their guard .
It would never have occurred to my colleague that I ’d had years of experience using DHTML .
I asked him a few simple questions , to which anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the science of browsers and Websites would have known the answer .
He was all at sea , though he flannelled with such authority and fluency that I was momentarily dazzled enough to doubt my own knowledge and understanding .
I thanked him and went back to my desk .
Yes , a New Man , if ever I saw one .
Of course , it was really none of my business , but curiosity can sometimes get the better of you .
That evening , after I got back home , I got a very apologetic call from the Agent , telling me not to turn up again at my new place of work .
The Director had phoned him up and told him that he ’d been advised on some authority that I knew nothing of the work I was supposed to be doing , and he was refusing to let me back on - site .
It seems that the ‘ New Man ’ had gone to the IT director as soon as I ’d left the building , and regaled him with the story of how I ’d had to ask him a whole lot of very simple questions about Website construction .
Questions that I ought to have known the answer to if I was to be trusted with their website development .
It could have been that my ‘ nincompoop ’ questions really had backfired on me , and convinced him that I knew nothing , but I ’m pretty sure that he realised I ’d tricked him and that I was on to his secret .
He ’d therefore opted for a pre-emptive strike .
In any event , he was convincing enough for the IT Director , as most New Men are .
Pursuit of your own survival goes hand - in - hand with acutely developed powers of persuasion . .
God , I find , rewards you for placidly accepting your fate without rancour , and gives you bonus points for seeing the funny side .
I felt a bit foolish about overusing my ‘ Nincompoop ’ trick but shrugged the incident off and a second phone - call that night was from another agent , with the offer of a better - paid job nearer home .
I have to confess that , despite my good humour , I sent a letter to the Director , with a copy to the client for whom I started to write the website , pointing out a few facts that , in his haste , he had forgotten to establish before asking me to leave , such as my proven track record in the industry .
I also gave a brief summary of the various employment laws he had breached .
The result of this missive was explosive , and the agent , now angry rather than apologetic , told me the Director was threatening to sue , on the grounds that I ’d undermined the good commercial relationship he ’d had with his client .
He did n’t , of course , and the agent was n’t even able to blacklist me as he threatened .
Funnily enough , the new man ’s supercharged DHTML website never appeared , and the company too vanished within three months .
There was , evidently , only one client .
I forgot the whole incident , until several years later .
I ’d gone to visit a relative in hospital and was discussing his progress with the hospital doctor .
In the midst of the conversation , a man came up looking very important and had a brief conversation with the doctor .
The face looked oddly familiar .
Was my memory playing tricks , or was this the ‘ New Man ’ who had been responsible for my abrupt sacking ?
I tried to look nondescript .
He strode off .
The doctor apologised .
“ I ’m so sorry , I just had to have a quick word with the consultant ; now where were we ? ”
A number of rail crashes brought the issue into the spotlight A new law has come into force which is intended to make it easier to prosecute companies accused of causing death because of negligence .
Under the new offence of corporate manslaughter , employers may face large fines if it is proved they failed to take proper safety precautions .
The old law was criticised for making it too hard to bring prosecutions .
Proof is no longer needed that a single senior official was to blame , only that senior management played a role .
' Improved justice '
Under the new UK - wide legislation companies may face higher fines of up to 10 % of turnover , or more in the most serious cases .
And for the first time the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide
Act will make government bodies liable for prosecution by lifting their Crown immunity .
Justice minister Maria Eagle said : " From Sunday the law ensures improved justice for victims of corporate failures .
The new Act will not save the life of a single construction worker
Alan Ritchie , Ucatt " We are sending out a very powerful deterrent message to those organisations which do not take their health and safety responsibilities seriously . "
Critics of the new law , which comes into force more than 10 years after Labour promised the legislation , say it does not go far enough .
Tony Woodley , joint general secretary of trade union Unite , said : " Individual directors or senior managers will still not be held responsible for health and safety failures that result in the death of either their employees or members of the public . "
THE FACTS BEHIND THE LAW
In 2006 / 07 , 241 people died at work
In 2007 , 77 construction workers died on the job More than 450 people have died in major disasters over the past 20 years
The highest UK health and safety payout was £ 15 m
The fine was levied against gas transporter Transco after an explosion in 1999 killed four members of the same family
Under the new law , firms may be fined from 2.5 % to 10 % of their turnover Firms may also be made to take out adverts in newspapers publicising their guilt Construction industry union Ucatt was even more damning , describing the law as " the dampest of damp squibs " .
Ucatt general secretary Alan Ritchie said : " Only by creating the possibility that directors will go to jail will there be a change of culture in the construction industry .
" The new Act will not save the life of a single construction worker , " he said , adding that in 2007 , 77 construction workers were killed at work .
Similar measures to those in the new legislation were first proposed in 1997 by then Home Secretary Jack Straw in the wake of the Southall rail crash which killed seven people .
But there has been public outrage at the repeated collapse of prosecutions over disasters such as the Southall crash .
Legal experts warn the implementation of the new law will not be straightforward .
Julian Acratopulo of law firm Clifford Chance said employers would face uncertainty when the law was first put into practice .
Clarification needed
He said : " The growing pains of this new piece of legislation will be particularly acute , given that a conviction could occur in circumstances most of us would regard as a terrible but unfortunate accident . "
One area that still needs clarification is how to proportion responsibility between middle and senior management .
The Sentencing Advisory Panel has also suggested that major national companies who are found guilty should be forced to publicly name and shame themselves in media adverts .

What are these ?
Iceland says it is under attack by speculators Iceland is considering intervention in its currency and stock markets to fight hedge funds that it says are attacking its financial system .
The country 's prime minister , Geir Haarde , told the Financial Times that it was being unfairly targeted .
The Icelandic currency has lost a quarter of its value against the euro this year as rumours of a financial and banking crisis have swirled .
Last week , the country 's central bank made an emergency interest rate rise .
" The central bank and the government have several means at their disposal to influence this situation and we have not used all of them yet , " Mr Haarde said .
" We would like to see these people off our backs and we are considering all the options available . "
He said hedge funds wanted to make a profit " by hook or by crook " .
Rumours swirl
The government believes that speculators may have spread false rumours to create fears of a banking crisis in order to profit from short positions on the Icelandic krona and stock market .
Short positions are bets that a stock or currency will fall in value .
The country 's financial watchdog has launched an investigation into the the alleged market manipulation .
Concerns Credit ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor 's have signalled concern about the health of Iceland 's economy and its three main banks - Kaupthing , Glitnir and Landsbanki .
The three banks have funded expansion overseas by selling debt but the rise in the cost of credit worldwide has raised concern that their strategy could falter .
But Fitch said that Iceland 's banks had sufficient liquidity and were able to operate without recourse to global capital markets for " some months to come " .
The ratings agencies have expressed concern that Iceland may have to support the country 's banks to avert a possible financial crisis .

Asian countries have been struggling to cope as the cost of rice has reached record levels .
The price of the staple crop has risen by as much as 70 % during the last year , according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , with increases accelerating in recent weeks .
Shortages have begun to hit some importing countries .
Factors contributing to the price rise include :
Poor harvests resulting from extreme weather
A rise in demand in some rice - importing countries , where populations and incomes are growing
The expectation of further price increases - resulting in hoarding
Low stockpiles and a long term lack of agricultural investment BBC NEWS RICE DAY A BBC News focus on the impact of steep rises in the price of rice , staple food of 3bn people Coverage on radio , TV and online from Bangladesh , India , Philippines , West Africa and California
Special report : Food price crisis
The spike is also part of a general surge in food costs worldwide , so the option of switching to cheaper foods is often not available .
Producers including India , China and Vietnam have restricted exports as they try to protect their stocks and limit inflation .
Importers such as Bangladesh , the Philippines , and Afghanistan have been hit hard .
Prices are expected to remain volatile , though output is likely to grow later this year as farmers in Thailand and Vietnam plant additional crops .
See graph showing rice production and consumption INDIA India is the second largest rice grower in the world behind China .
With rice the staple food for 65 % of the country 's one billion plus people , much is consumed domestically .
But prices have been soaring - a shopkeeper in Delhi told the BBC that the cost of one variety had increased from 12 rupees ( 29 US cents ) per kilogram to 16 rupees ( 39 cents ) in the last two months .
India rice crisis ?
Rice prices in the capital rose by 20 % last year .
The government has announced a total ban on exports of non-basmati rice , in a bit to curb rising food prices , which have helped push inflation to a 13 - month high .
The price for basmati rice , meanwhile , has been raised to $ 1,200 per tonne to discourage exports .
Officials say as yet there is no crisis - India has more than enough reserves to feed its population .
They also say India will honour its commitments to export rice to neighbouring Bangladesh .
But the International Rice Research Institute says that the sustainability of rice farming in India and beyond is threatened by overuse of fertilisers and soil health .
Stocks have come down over the last three years as agricultural growth has failed to match the rest of the economy .
And because of the low purchasing power of India 's poor , even a small increase in prices can cause a sharp fall in real incomes .
BANGLADESH
Spiralling rice prices have left the people of Bangladesh facing their worst food shortages since the major famine of 1974 .
Over the last year , prices have nearly doubled to about 35 taka ( 50 cents ) , while there has been no corresponding increase in wages .
Hundreds of poor families are now surviving on one meal a day , and spending 70 - 80 % of their budget on food .
The problem is most acute in urban areas where aid agencies say they are very concerned about infant malnourishment .
Local factors have contributed to the price rise .
Bangladesh has been hit by severe flooding twice in the last year and a devastating cyclone in November .
The government is giving rice away to 2.6 million people and supplying some families at discounted prices .
It has had to import four million tonnes of rice from India over the last six months - more than double the usual amount .
But the government 's critics say it has made matters worse with an anti-corruption drive that has led to the closure of many unofficial rice supply outlets closed down .
PHILIPPINES
Once self - sufficient in rice , the Philippines is listed by the US Department of Agriculture as the world 's top importer of milled rice for 2007 , ahead of Nigeria , Indonesia and Bangladesh .
Over the past 20 years or so , the country lost nearly half of its irrigated land to rapid urban development .
Rice prices hit Philippines poor Domestic demand has risen as the population has grown , pushing up prices .
With rice stocks low , the government has been negotiating with neighbouring countries to secure imports , signing a deal with Vietnam and working for another one with Thailand .
Fears of public unrest have been growing .
Communist guerrillas recently burnt a rice trader 's vehicles in the central island of Panay .
President Gloria Arroyo has asked authorities to crack down on hoarders .
Officials have said they could be charged with economic sabotage - a crime that carries a life sentence .
There have also been efforts to reduce consumption .
Some of the country 's fast - food chains are offering half portions of rice at the government 's request .
The government has also asked the public to save leftover rice .
Troops have been called in to protect deliveries of rice to poor areas , while farmers have reportedly begun guarding their crops .
Some government critics say it has not done enough , and members of the influential May First Labour Movement have been holding small - scale demonstrations in various parts of the country .
But others say the Ms Arroyo has overreacted , creating unnecessary panic .
THAILAND
Thailand has long been the world 's largest exporter of rice , well ahead of Vietnam and the US .
It has not yet placed any restrictions on exports , and has denied reports that it is considering taking this step .
However , some rice millers and traders who deal on forward contracts have been suffering , after being caught out by price fluctuations .
Exporters have even complained that they would prefer to have stable prices than high prices .
Some millers have hoarded rice in an attempt to earn higher profits later on , pushing prices higher still as they restrict supply .
The government has released some of its 2.1 million tonnes of stockpiled rice in an attempt to contain inflation .
It has also said it will enforce a rule that exporters set aside at least 500 tonnes of rice to prevent shortages .
Rice prices increased by more than 50 % last year and have doubled since the beginning of 2008 .
While in some countries rice consumption has risen with prosperity , Thais have been eating a greater variety of foods and less rice as they have become wealthier .
CHINA Chinese consumers have been have been eating less rice as their income has risen , according to the FAO .
Instead , they have been switching to meat and dairy products .
China has large rice reserves , though pressures on farming are growing
But the government , highly conscious of social or political tensions caused by food inflation , has moved to protect consumers by restricting exports .
Chinese Prime Minister
Wen Jiabao said this week that China has an " abundant " supply of rice to feed its population of more than 1.3 billion .
China had stockpiled about 40 - 50 million tonnes of rice , he said .
Though China is not one of the top rice exporters , export restrictions can have a big impact on importers including North Korea , which buys rice from China at very low prices as it tries to cope with frequent food shortages .
Though short term supplies are secured , there are concerns that urbanisation and industrial development are putting pressure on farming .
JAPAN
Rice is thought to have been produced for more than 2,500 years in Japan , where it was once seen as so important that it was worshipped as a god .
Instead of importing rice , Japan heavily subsidises its rice farmers , paying them as much as four times the market price and restricting imports .
This policy is defended by a farming community with considerable political weight , and many Japanese agree home - grown rice tastes best .
Food security is seen as politically important and the country keeps a large stockpile of rice - even though it is probably wealthy enough to buy on the international market even if prices continue to rise .
Its scientists are already looking for varieties that will be resistant to higher temperatures caused by climate change .
Japan trades relatively small quantities and has little impact on the international market .

What are these ?
New tests of 100 “ natural ” and “ organic ” soaps , shampoos and other consumer products show that nearly half of them contained a cancer - causing chemical that is a byproduct of petrochemicals used in manufacturing .
Many items that tested positive for the carcinogen are well - known brands , including Kiss My Face , Alba , Seventh Generation and Nature ’s Gate products , sold in retail stores across the nation .
The findings of the Organic Consumers Assn. , a consumer advocacy group , are sending a jolt through the natural products industry .
Gathering today in Anaheim for a national trade show , many leaders worry that the test results will taint the industry in the eyes of the public .
Of the 100 products tested , 47 had detectable levels of 1,4 - dioxane , which the Environmental Protection Agency has declared a probable human carcinogen because it causes cancer in lab animals .
Advertisement
Most traditional soaps and shampoos contain 1,4 - dioxane .
But the discovery that the chemical is present in many housecleaning and personal care products , including some for babies , that are advertised as being natural , organic or “ green ” comes as somewhat of a surprise .
“ For companies to knowingly or even carelessly put a carcinogen into commerce in this day and age is barbaric , I think , particularly products that have the moniker of natural or self - proclaimed ‘ organic , ’ ” said consumer advocate and author David Steinberg , who directed the study .
The compound is not intentionally added to products ; it is a byproduct of a process used to soften harsh detergents .
It is formed when foaming agents , or surfactants , are processed with ethylene oxide or similar petrochemicals .
Said Martin Wolf , Seventh Generation Inc.'s director of product and environmental technology , “ The natural world is filled with things that can harm .
. . .
All we can do is work as hard as we can to keep the levels as low as possible and keep our products as safe as possible . ”

Hain Celestial Group , the Boulder , Colo . - based owner of four of the tested companies -- Alba , Jason , Avalon Organics and Zia Natural Skincare -- said Thursday that it would reevaluate all of its products .
Two Alba and three Jason products contained 1,4 - dioxane , but the chemical was not detected in tested Avalon and Zia products .
“ We are committed to selling products without detectable levels of 1,4 - dioxane . . . and will review all formulations accordingly , ” said Lisa Lehndorff , Hain Celestial ’s director of corporate consumer relations .
No one knows exactly what amount of the compound may be unsafe .
In scientific studies , lab animals that had been fed 1,4 - dioxane for many weeks developed nasal , liver and gall bladder cancers .
But scientists do not now know what , if any , cancer risk humans face from years - long use of products containing the chemical .
The Food and Drug Administration , which regulates cosmetics , has set no standards for 1,4 - dioxane .
The agency has occasionally tested products for the compound since the late 1970s and says levels of it have substantially declined since then .
The FDA says the current levels “ do not present a hazard to consumers , ” although it has advised the industry to reduce amounts in cosmetics as much as possible .

Josef Koester of Cognis Corp. , a Cincinnati - based chemical company that caters to manufacturers seeking “ green ” compounds , said most companies can avoid 1,4 - dioxane but that it “ typically requires a higher price point and sometimes performance restrictions for the product .
How green the formulators want to go -- it is their choice . ”
No standards govern the words natural or organic for personal care products .
But a few companies , including TerrEssentials , Dr. Bronner ’s Magic Soaps and Sensibility Soaps Inc. , which makes the Nourish brand , have certified their products as organic under the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s food standards .
But because the vast majority of shampoos , soaps and other consumer goods do not carry the USDA organic seal , it ’s nearly impossible for buyers to know whether the ones they use contain 1,4 - dioxane because the chemical is not listed on ingredient labels .
Products most likely to contain the compound usually list polyethylene glycol or compounds with the syllables PEG , short for polyethylene glycol , - eth or - oxynol - , according to the FDA .
Dishwashing liquids are particularly hard to keep free of 1,4 - dioxane because they require surfactants that are powerful grease cutters .
Advertisement
Seventh Generation uses coconut oil in its dish soaps , which although it is processed with a petrochemical and vacuum - stripped , still contains almost 2 parts per million of 1,4 - dioxane .
Wolf said the only way to remove all traces would be to use another surfactant that irritates skin , which the Burlington , Vt. - based company considers unacceptable .
Seventh Generation is “ working with several surfactant manufacturers to look for alternatives to this process to modify coconut oil , ” Wolf said .
“ We ’re not there yet .
We have more work to do . ”

ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday accused Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice of not telling the truth about warnings she said her department gave Carter not to speak to Hamas before a Middle East trip .
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter pauses during a speech in Jerusalem April 21 , 2008 , after talks in Syria and Egypt with Hamas leaders .
REUTERS / Ronen Zvulun
The State Department has said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State David Welch , the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East , issued the warning before Carter , a veteran of Middle East diplomacy , went on his trip last week .
Rice said in Kuwait on Tuesday : “ We counseled President Carter against going to the region and particularly against having contact with Hamas . ”
“ President Carter has the greatest respect for ...
Rice and believes her to be a truthful person .
However , perhaps inadvertently , she is continuing to make a statement that is not true , ” a statement issued by the Carter center in Atlanta said on Wednesday .
“ No one in the State Department or any other department of the U.S. government ever asked him ( Carter ) to refrain from his recent visit to the Middle East or even suggested that he not meet with Syrian President ( Bashar ) Assad or leaders of Hamas , ” it said .
It said Carter attempted to call Rice before making the trip and a deputy returned his call since Rice was in Europe .
“ They had a very pleasant discussion for about 15 minutes , during which he never made any of the negative or cautionary comments described above .
He never talked to anyone else , ” the statement said .
Carter had already on Monday , in an interview with National Public Radio , described as “ absolutely false ” any suggestion he had been warned not to meet Hamas .
“ PRIVATE CITIZEN ”
“ The United States is not going to deal with Hamas and we certainly told President Carter that we did not think that meeting with Hamas was going to help the Palestinians , ” Rice said Tuesday while attending a conference in Kuwait .
The White House backed Rice and said events after Carter ’s meeting showed Hamas ’ true character .
Carter “ is a private citizen and he made a decision to not comply with what the State Department asked him to do , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters on Wednesday .
Perino made an apparent reference to an attack on Saturday in which a Palestinian suicide bomber and two other gunmen were killed when they attacked a border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel , wounding 13 Israeli soldiers .
“ Actions speak louder than words , ” said Perino of Hamas .
Hamas , which controls Gaza , is viewed as a terrorist organization by the United States , the European Union and Israel .
Carter , who met Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Syria over the weekend , is trying to draw the Islamist group into peace talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
But Rice and other senior U.S. officials are concerned that Carter ’s meeting could confuse U.S. - brokered peace talks already moving at a slow pace between Abbas and Olmert .
Hamas won a 2006 election and briefly formed a unity government with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
It seized control of Gaza from Abbas ’ secular Fatah faction in fighting in June .
Scientific Breakthrough Gone Awry
" We found this diagram this morning and thought
we 'd recovered it .
But it turned out to be a blueprint
for the new roller coaster over at Six Flags . "
Not long after scientists at The Human Genome Project announced the world 's first comprehensive mapping of the complete human gene , they were forced to hold yet another , more somber , press conference .
" Well , uh ... we lost it again , " admitted Dr. Herbert Mulch , lead researcher on the project .
" Our computers spent five years logging data , chemical formulas and DNA patterns .
Then we downloaded it all onto two hard drives ... and now ... well ... we can't find them . "
" This morning , we thought we 'd found it , " reported the researcher .
" But it turned out to be a diagram of the new roller coaster over at Six Flags . "
Needless to say , many were disturbed at the news .
" How scientists could lose valuable information like this is beyond me , " complained ex-congressman Bob Dornan .
" If this were to fall into the wrong hands , who knows where the human race could end up ?
What if monkeys got hold of it ?
They could catch up with us ! "
Several religious leaders rejoiced at the news .
" Some things just are n't meant to be known by man , " said Reverend Jerry Falwell .
" I personally do n't think there ever was such thing as a human genome .
If you want to find the blueprint for man , you better start talking to the architect upstairs . "
Radio talk show host , Dr. Laura Schlessinger , regretted the loss .
" Someone might have been able to engineer a race of people that would meet my moral standards .
And leave out all those mistakes we have now . "
O.J. Simpson was particularly upset by the announcement .
" That was the breakthrough I 've been waiting five years for .
I was counting on that DNA research stuff to find the real killer .
Yeah , that 's what I was waiting for .
But now I guess I 'll just have to keep waiting . "
The one - time Heisman Trophy winner continued shake his head in regret as they called him to the next tee .
Al Gore 's voice cracked a bit when he responded to the announcement .
" This is very painful for me personally , since I invented DNA . "
Harold Rebus , head of security for the Nuclear Weapons Research Lab at Los Alamos was sympathetic to the scientist 's plight .
" Stuff happens .
Have they checked behind the copier ? "

Rocky Twyman has a radical solution for surging gasoline prices : prayer .
Twyman - a community organizer , church choir director and public relations consultant from the Washington , D.C. , suburbs - staged a pray - in at a San Francisco Chevron station on Friday , asking God for cheaper gas .
He did the same thing in the nation 's Capitol on Wednesday , with volunteers from a soup kitchen joining in .
Today he will lead members of an Oakland church in prayer .
Yes , it 's come to that .
" God is the only one we can turn to at this point , " said Twyman , 59 .
" Our leaders do n't seem to be able to do anything about it .
The prices keep soaring and soaring . "
Gas prices have been driven relentlessly higher this year by the bull market for crude oil , gasoline 's main ingredient .
A gallon of regular now costs $ 3.89 , on average , in California , while the national average has hit $ 3.58 .
To solve the problem , Twyman is n't begging the Lord for any specific act of intervention .
He is not asking God to make OPEC pump more oil .
Nor is he praying for all the speculative investors to be purged from the New York Mercantile Exchange , where crude oil is traded .
Instead , he says anyone who wants to follow his example should keep it simple .
" God , deliver us from these high gas prices , " Twyman said .
" That 's all they have to say . "
Consumer advocates who have been howling about gasoline prices for months say they understand his frustration , even if they have n't tried his tactics .
" Given the complete inertia and silence of this White House on a crisis that has people feeling just hopeless , prayer is probably as good as anything , " said Judy Dugan , research director with the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog .
" Frankly , I wish them luck . "
Her organization has a list of proposals to help tame gas prices .
Federal officials could stop adding oil for the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and start selling some instead , for example .
That would boost supplies in the market and drive down the price .
Officials also could tighten oversight of crude oil trading .
" This is government 's job - it should n't be God 's job - but government is in gridlock or ignoring it , " Dugan said .
Some of Consumer Watchdog 's ideas may finally be gaining support .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , on Thursday asked President Bush to stop filling the strategic oil reserve .
And on Friday , she called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the oil market is being manipulated .
Twyman , 59 , has a history of taking on interesting causes , some whimsical , some deadly serious .
Three years ago , he led a petition drive to have Oprah Winfrey nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize .
It did n't work , obviously , but he says he had a great time with it .
His real passion , however , has been persuading African Americans to become bone marrow donors .
A friend of his who had just adopted a child died from leukemia in 1995 without ever finding a donor , and Twyman threw himself into the cause .
For years , racial and ethnic minorities have been underrepresented on the national donor registry , a problem because people in need of a transplant have a greater chance of finding a match with donors of the same race or ethnic group .
Twyman estimates that his bone marrow drives , many of them organized through churches , have netted 14,000 potential donors .
The drives also brought him an Above & Beyond award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society .
Twyman knows his approach to gasoline prices may sound simplistic .
He 's quick to point out that anyone praying for cheaper fuel also has an obligation to do something more active about the problem .
" People have to walk more , leave those cars at home , and carpool , man , " he said .
" We have to become more practical . "
He 's also hoping that if enough people start praying at the pump , politicians who might actually be able to do something about the problem will listen .
But he says his prayer for gas - price relief from God is sincere .
" I 've seen him work miracles in my life , " Twyman said .
" He told us that all we need to do is ask and believe .
He can do it , and he will do it , but we have to ask him to do it . "

Advertisement A Teesside shopkeeper chased away an armed robber who burst into his store and shot a crossbow at him .
Mohammed Razaq was resting at his home , which adjoins his Stockton convenience store , when he spotted the raider on his CCTV monitor .
The 37 - year - old ran into the shop , then ducked out of the way when the robber shot a crossbow bolt , which missed .
He then chased the attacker out of the store before he could reload the weapon during the incident on Saturday .
Mr Razaq said he acted instinctively to protect his wife , parents and five children , when the man with a scarf over his face burst in and tried to grab money from the till .
He said : " I was in shock .
I said something like : ' What the hell are you doing ? '
" He just pointed the crossbow at me and told me ' come on , quick , get the money out of the till ' then he showed me the bag . "
The shopkeeper then fled out of the shop and into his home at the moment when the raider can be seen on CCTV firing the crossbow at him at point blank range .
' Protect family '
The potentially - lethal bolt missed and Mr Razaq grabbed a pole used to close his shutters and swung it before the raider could reload his weapon .
He said he only fought back because he thought his children were at risk " I did n't want anyone coming in my house and if I did n't stop him , he could have been in , " he added .

( G-) 13 Cinematic Stoners Whose Names Are n't " Harold " or " Kumar " , stoner movies , pot movies
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
With the premiere of " Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay " looming on the horizon ( it arrives in theaters on April 25th ) , we here at Bullz - Eye found ourselves considering some of our other favorites who 've fired up on film over the years .
Originally , we were going to have 15 entries , but after we hit 13 we just did n't have the energy to do much of anything except lie on the couch and scarf some munchies .
Go figure .
In the end , though , we realized that all we had to do was slap a " G " in front of the number , and we had ourselves an instant tribute to the most legendary strain of cannabis in history .
( It 's killer stuff , man .
Not that we 've had it ourselves , y'know , but Lester Burnham swears by it , and that 's good enough for us . )
Danny & Presuming Ed
" Withnail and I , " 1986
: The joint I 'm about to roll requires a craftsman and can utilize up to twelve skins .
It is called a Camberwell carrot . :
It 's impossible to use twelve papers on one joint . :
It 's impossible to roll a Camberwell carrot with anything less . :
Who says it 's a Camberwell carrot ? : I do .
I invented it in Camberwell and it looks like a carrot …
This will tend to make you very high .
We 'd like to believe the Camberwell carrot is the most famous joint in film history .
Unfortunately , we know better .
Time and again , we 've found that most people have n't seen " Withnail & I , " which is why one of our missions in life is to expose as many of the right people to the film as possible .
( Unfortunately , we do n't exactly know who the right people are , so it 's kinda taking awhile . )
For the many that have n't yet seen the film , Danny ( Ralph Brown ) is a drug dealer , and Ed is his mostly - silent accomplice , who shows up in the film 's last reel .
The pair symbolizes a period long since gone : the sixties , an era that 's either laughable or nostalgic , depending on your level of cynicism .
While the film 's titular characters indulge in drug and drink as a means of escape , Danny and Ed partake because it's who they are .
It 's their way of living and understanding the fucked - up world around them , their method of creating a rational state out of imminent chaos .
Granted , only someone high on the very best herb would be able to pull this off , but Danny & Ed manage to do so without coming across as a joke .
As the film comes to a close , so does the decade , and it 's anyone 's guess where Danny & Ed end up when the seventies take off , though one suspects it 's not nearly as ideal a place as the decade they 've left behind .
It 's best to not think too much about the fate of the filmic stoner .
Conventional hippie wisdom claims it 's better to burn out than fade away ; stoner icons are in the enviable position of having to do neither .

Ralph Wiley
" Reefer Madness , " 1936
Mae ?
MAE !
What do you want ?
Bring me some reefers !
" The motion picture you are about to witness may startle you , " reads the roll at the beginning of " Reefer Madness . "
" It would not have been possible , otherwise , to sufficiently emphasize the frightful toll of the new drug menace which is destroying the youth of America in alarmingly increasing numbers .
Marihuana is that drug : a violent narcotic , an unspeakable scourge … The Real Public Enemy Number One ! "
Huh .
So , basically , the film was written by someone who had never smoked pot nor known anyone who'd ever smoked pot … ?
Gotcha .
Of all the laughably unrealistic characters in " Reefer Madness , " the title of Most Ridiculous must certainly go to Ralph Wiley ( Dave O'Brien ) , a former college student turned pot dealer .
While under the influence of the wicked , wicked weed , Ralph nearly commits rape , finds himself in the midst of a manslaughter case and , by film 's end , commits murder himself and ends up in an asylum for the criminally insane for the rest of his natural life .
( Though he probably could n't be tried for it in a court of law , Ralph also forces his fellow dealer , Blanche , to play a piano so fast that the safety of her fingers is clearly in jeopardy . )
It 's sin , it 's degradation , it 's vice … basically , it 's pure insanity and a full - fledged laugh riot , which is the exact opposite of what its creators probably intended .
But , hey , 65 years later , and " Reefer Madness " still lives on .
You can't argue with that kind of longevity .

Melanie Ralston
" Jackie Brown , " 1997
Damn , girl , you gettin ' high already ?
It 's only 2 o'clock in the afternoon .
I get my shit done for the day , then I get high .
And , besides , getting high and watching TV will rob you of your ambition !
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV .
She 's cute , perky , and even a little ditsy , but Bridget Fonda 's free - spirited beach bunny from Quentin Tarantino 's oft - ignored " Jackie Brown " is also the sexiest stoner to ever blaze up on the silver screen .
Like a few of the other characters on this list , Melanie does n't play an especially large role in the main storyline , but she 's a fun addition nonetheless , proving that while she may not show signs of the stereotypical stoner , she smokes more than enough ganja to hold her own .
Curiously enough , it is n't Melanie 's extracurricular activities that land her in trouble , but rather her big mouth .
A major pain in the ass to both Ordell ( Samuel L. Jackson ) and his ex-con best friend Louis ( Robert De Niro ) , Melanie does n't make it out of the movie alive ( she 's shot twice in the chest after making fun of Louis for forgetting where he parked the car ) , but she does impose some sage advice to fellow tokers along the way : coughing is good , because it opens up the capillaries .
Remember that , kids , the next time you 're hacking up a lung .

Smokey
" Friday , " 1995
" I know you do n't smoke weed , I know this ; but I 'm gonna get you high today , ' cause it 's Friday ; you ain't got no job ... and you ai n't got shit to do . "
All he ever does anymore is make " Rush Hour " sequels , but for a period in the mid-to - late '90s , it seemed like Chris Tucker was on the verge of ascending to the comedy throne vacated by Eddie Murphy at some point between " Best Defense " and " Harlem Nights . "
Tucker made a lot of star turns in so - so films during this era ( " Money Talks , " anyone ? ) , but few of them have held up as well as his appearance as Smokey the stash - inhaling pot dealer in 1995 's " Friday . "
Ice Cube wrote the script and took top billing , but if you think this hazy , low - budget comedy would have engendered as much cult love – or inspired as many sequels – without Tucker 's high - pitched jabbering , you must be puffing on Big Worm 's weed .
Now that a fourth " Friday " – supposedly titled " Last Friday " – is on the way , rumors of Tucker 's involvement are running rampant .
It 'd certainly make for an easy script – Smokey 's absence from the first sequel was chalked up to a stint in rehab , and it 's been over a decade – but Tucker 's salary for " Rush Hour 3 " was bigger than the entire budget of the last " Friday " sequel .
Dare we hope for more ?

The Guy on the Couch
" Half Baked , " 1998
Hey , is it January ?
No , it 's August .
Really ?
It only wound up grossing $ 17 million – probably the rough equivalent of what people spent on popcorn during a single weekend of " Titanic 's " senses - shattering run – but with an $ 8 million budget , " Half Baked " is that rarest of cinematic beasts :
The cult classic that turned a profit .
As the title implies , " Half Baked " is a film full of stoners ; in order to stand out , Steven Wright 's The Guy on the Couch would have to be the Ultimate Stoner – which is , as it turns out , exactly what he is .
While the rest of the characters follow a convoluted ( for a stoner flick ) plot involving the accidental death of a police horse , medical cannabis , and a drug dealer named Sampson Simpson , The Guy on the Couch is …well , he 's The Guy on the Couch .
In the role of a lifetime , Wright ( right ) does little more than loll around , emitting various noises , a performance brilliantly parodied in the " Fully Baked Edition " DVD 's special feature , " Five Minutes with the Guy on the Couch , " in which a stationary camera spends five minutes watching a Wright lookalike sleeping on a sofa .
Perfect . – Jeff Giles
Carl Spackler
" Caddyshack , " 1980
" This is a hybrid .
This is a cross , ah , of Bluegrass , Kentucky Bluegrass , Featherbed Bent , and Northern California Sensemilia .
The amazing stuff about this is that you can play 36 holes on it in the afternoon , take it home and just get stoned to the bejeezus - belt that night on this stuff . "
Scourge to gophers , assistant to the head groundskeeper at Bushwood Country Club , and inventor of one of the greatest hybrids of all time , Carl Spackler was Bill Murray 's perfect post - " SNL " launchpad into the big leagues .
Although " Caddyshack " was initially widely panned – producer and co-writer Douglas Kenney went into a drug - and - alcohol - fueled downward spiral after the film 's release , ultimately falling ( or jumping ) off a cliff in Hawaii – the film has gone on to earn classic comedy status , due in no small part to Murray 's appearance as the filthy , mushmouthed loner who may or may not have once caddied for the Dalai Lama ( and earned total consciousness as a tip ) .
He 's almost certainly the only character on this list whose name doubles as a URL .
And that iconic " Cinderella story " riff ?
Yeah , Murray improvised it .
Of course , without Spackler , Adam Sandler never would have had a career , but let 's not hold a grudge .

Floyd
" True Romance , " 1993
They 're staying at the Safari Motor … Motel Inn. Safari Motel .
How do you know that , have you been over there ?
No , but they were here , and they said that they were going to …go there .
Then they …went .
Hey , you wanna watch some TV or something ?
They might be back here .
No , no , thank you .
All right , you take care , I might be back .
Yeah , good , be cool .
( After Virgil leaves )
Fucking condescend to me , man .
I 'll fuckin ' kill ya , man .
Make no bones about it : most of the charm of Floyd , the TV - loving roommate of struggling actor Dick Ritchie ( Michael Rapaport ) , is in the casting .
His star was only recently beginning to rise thanks to recent turns in " Thelma & Louise " and " A River Runs Through It , " but it was his turn as Floyd in Quentin Tarantino 's hilarious Honey - I - stole - the - coke action thriller " True Romance " that earned Brad Pitt his first cool points .
For starters , all of his screen time takes place in the dimly lit apartment that he shares with Dick .
That , combined with the stringy hair and three - day stubble , reduces Pitt 's good looks to pretty much nothing .
Even better is the fact that not once does
Pitt leave the couch in the entire movie ( a recurring theme with stoners in movies , as you 'll soon see ) , but then again , with the gangsters repeatedly stopping by to look for Dick 's friend Clarence , Floyd never has to lift a finger , except to flick the lighter on his next bowl .
As lazy stoner characters go , there is none more slack than Floyd .
You just have to love a guy with so little motivation .
He 's the original Guy on the Couch . –
The Dude
" The Big Lebowski , " 1998
You never went to college ...
Oh , no I did , but I spent most of my time occupying various administration buildings ... smoking a lot of Thai stick ... breaking into the ROTC ... and bowling .
To tell you the truth , Brandt , I do n't remember most of it .
He 's The Dude…or He 's Dudeness , Duder , or El Duderino , if you 're not into the whole brevity thing ( " The Big Lebowski " ) .
If you 've traveled in the right circles over the past 10 years , you 've either heard or said ( or both ) , " The Dude abides . "
Are you amazed The Dude turned 10 this year ?
Then you are traveling in the right circles …or at least you 're going around in them .
Congrats !
Time has stood still , and you 're one of the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers .
What we 've complied is a list of burners , but no matter what the order , the Dude is , in the minds of many , always going to be # 1 .
The Dude demonstrates that cluelessness equals genius .
He shows that getting nothing done at all results in everything ending as it should .
For The Dude , toking up in the morning is no different than eating breakfast .
Between the Coen Brothers ' sharply dimwitted script and Jeff Bridges ' seemingly effortless interpretation , The Dude emerged as the hero for the '90s .
Whether he was suffering through Walter 's stupidity , coping with Lebowski 's duplicity , or coming to grips with Maude 's fertility , The Dude always dealt with crises through herbal self - medication .
You White Russian devotees may see The Dude in an entirely different way .
If so , in the spirit of all things Dude - like , we 'll abide by your point of view … even though that 's just , like , your opinion , man .

Tenacious D
" Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny , " 2006
: I did it , man .
Check it out !
( Shakes coffee can full of change )
Do you hear that ?
The training is working , man !
I made 10 whole bucks with my rock ! : Good .
Go score me a dime bag . : A what ? :
Ten dollars worth of weed …?
Now listen : go down to Wake ‘ N ' Bake Pizza , ask for Jojo , and tell him you want the Bob Marley , extra crispy .
He 'll know what you 're talking about .
KG 's right : Jojo totally knows what they 're talking about .
But by the time their extra-crispy Bob Marley finally shows up , the D – Jack Black ( JB ) and Kyle Gass ( KG ) – are already so completely stoned out of their mind that they can barely move .
JB fights off the effects , however , when he gets excited about a TV show that 's coming on .
KG calmly replies , " When you are able to snatch this remote from my hand , you will be ready to choose the channels we watch . "
JB tries …and fails .
" Patience , young grass - smoker , " says KG . " Patience ! "
Indeed , you 'll need patience if you 're watching " The Pick of Destiny " solely to see the guys toking up , because they 're far too busy rocking the fuck out to indulge in much smoking … although JB does manage to trip his ass off on some tasty mushrooms at one point .
( " Sasquatch ! " )
So why did they make the cut for our piece ?
The band asked me to read this : " Listen up , all you non -believing fucks : if the D is bad enough to take one of the Devil 's horns and make it into the Bong of Destiny by the end of their movie , then it is not your place to question their status within the list .
But it is your place to sit down , shut the fuck up , and listen to the greatest rock band in the world , namely us . "
Hey , we can't argue with that .

Slater
" Dazed and Confused , " 1993
" Behind every good man there 's a woman , and that woman was Martha Washington , man , and everyday George would come home , she would have a big fat bowl waiting for him , man , when he'd come in the door , man .
She was a hip , hip , hip lady , man . "
In a film set on the last day of high school in 1976 , it 's a fair bet that there 'll be more than a few stoners in the student body , but if you 're going to pick one of out of the crowd , you might as well go with the guy whose first onscreen appearance finds him clarifying to a fellow shop student how to construct the perfect bong .
( " You 're getting air from there , man , it 's not good .
You see this ?
It 's gotta be tight .
Put some gum around the base to get a good hit . " )
Slater 's the stereotypical stoner , always looking to score some charity weed ( " Can you spot me a ten ?
I 'll pay you , like , Tuesday and shit . " ) , never missing a chance to get in on someone else 's smoke ( " Pickford 's got a duber about to burn .
You with us ? " ) , and not a little bit paranoid , as his rant about how our country 's founding fathers were into aliens clearly proves .
( " Didja ever look at a dollar bill , man ?
There 's some spooky stuff going on on a dollar bill , man .
And it 's green , too ! " ) , but he's an archetype of the ‘ 70s and a necessary inclusion in the proceedings .
That 's necessary rather than integral , you understand , given that you could edit him completely out of the film and not have any of the storylines suffer … but if you leave him in , it 's fixin ' to be a lot better , man .
– Will Harris
Jeff Spicoli
" Fast Times at Ridgemont High , " 1982
Why do n't you get a job , Spicoli ?
What for ?
You need money .
All I need are some tasty waves , a cool buzz , and I 'm fine .
The quintessential ' 80s stoner who put the " high " in high school , Spicoli was perhaps the first filmic toker to come across as genuinely cool ; even if you did n't get high , it was n't difficult to admire his antics .
After partaking in " Fast Times , " who did n't want to get a buzz on , order a pizza to class , and call their teacher a dick ?
The role of Spicoli fit Sean Penn like such a tight glove that it took years for many of us to accept him as anyone else ( " Madonna 's marrying Spicoli ? Rad , dude ! " ) .
But a hero like Spicoli is only as good as his enemy , and he had a most formidable adversary in the form of Ray Walston 's Mr. Hand ; their back and forth banter is the funny bone of the film .
They taught us the danger of answering " I do n't know , " and the value of " my time , " " your time , " and most importantly , " our time . "
In the end , Spicoli was so damned cool that even a square like Hand had some respect for him …and vice versa .
It 'd be asking too much of Penn , Cameron Crowe and The Gods of Cinema to successfully revisit the character all these years later , but who would n't bask in the experience of discovering where Jeff Spicoli ended up 25 years later ?
As long as he hit the pipe at least once for old time 's sake , we'd be willing to accept whatever story there is to tell .

Jay and Silent Bob
" Clerks , " 1994 , et al
" Noinch , noinch , noinch , smokin weed , smokin ' weed , doin ' coke , drinkin ' beers .
Pack o' wraps , my brother man !
Time to kick back , drink some beers and smoke some weed ! "
These two cats go back a long way , having first met outside the Quick Stop when they were still in diapers , and they 've continued their heterosexual lovefest ever since , both on a personal and a business level .
Jay 's generally perceived as the leader of the duo , mostly because he 's incapable of shutting his mouth , but it 's clear that Bob only stays silent as long as he 's comfortable with what 's going on around him ; when he finally finds a need to say something , you 'll want to listen up , because it 's gonna be worth hearing .
We first met the guys in " Clerks , " as they loitered outside the same place where their friendship began , dealing pot ( both Jay and Silent Bob are members of the United Jersey Brotherhood of Dealers Local 404 ) and driving Dante and Randal crazy , but they 've appeared in every View Askewniverse movie to date , including " Mallrats , " " Chasing Amy , " and their very own adventure , " Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . "
Thanks to Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards , they were immortalized in comic book form as the superheroes Bluntman and Chronic ; by the time they turned up in " Clerks 2 , " however , Jay and Silent Bob were clean , sober , and espousing the virtues of Christianity .
It 's a slightly disappointing fate for the two coolest stoners in recent film history , but at least there 's one up side : as the film closes , they 're back outside of the Quick Stop again , right where they belong .
– Will Harris
Cheech and Chong
" Up in Smoke , " 1978 , et al
Man , what is in this shit , man ?
Mostly Maui Waui , man , but it 's got some Labrador in it .
What 's Labrador ?
It 's dog shit .
What ?
Yeah , my dog ate my stash , man .
Yeah ?
I had it on the table and the little motherfucker ate it , man .
Then I had to follow him around with a little baggie for three days , man , before I got it back .
Really blew the dog's mind , ya know ?
You mean we 're smokin ' dog shit , man ?
Gets ya high , do n't it ?
I think it 's even better than before , you know ?
( Considers it for a moment ) I wonder what Great Dane tastes like , man …
" Dave 's not here , man . "
From the moment a nation of spliff - toking comedy lovers heard those words , in 1971 's Cheech and Chong album , they were hooked – and it was an addiction that carried the duo through six albums , six films , and decades of undying affection from fans of laid - back , irreverent humor .
Though they have n't worked a stage together in something like a quarter century , Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong are still undeniably the alpha and omega of stoner humor – and classic routines like " Sister Mary Elephant " and ( of course ) " Dave " still earn guffaws .
Their celluloid track record – starting with 1978 's " Up in Smoke " and carrying through 1984's " The Corsican Brothers , " not counting appearances in various non-C&C projects like " Yellowbeard " and " After Hours " – is rather spotty , to put it lightly , but what do you expect from a pair of guys who told essentially the same joke for over a decade ?
Give 'em credit for making it last that long – and cross your fingers for that long - discussed reunion movie , rumored to be titled " Grumpy Old Stoners . " – Jeff Giles
KAOLACK , Senegal ( CNN ) --
After the sudden death of her 26 - year - old daughter left five grandchildren in her care , Viola Vaughn searched for peace .
More than 1,500 girls are involved in Viola Vaughn 's program in six locations ; about 1,000 are waiting to join .
Though she was a native of Detroit , Michigan , Vaughn had worked in Africa for most of her life and considered it home .
So she and her husband returned there to raise their new brood and " watch the coconut trees grow . "
" But the universe had other things in mind for me , " says Vaughn .
She could n't have imagined those plans would include both further tragedy and the motivation to provide educational opportunities to hundreds of failing schoolchildren .
Soon after their move to rural Kaolack , Senegal , in 2000 , Vaughn 's husband -- jazz musician Sam Sanders -- died of black lung .
Amid her grief , she found comfort in her grandchildren , ages 4 to 12 , and filled her days home - schooling them .
Her success soon garnered attention from the locals .
" There was a little girl that my granddaughter played with .
This little girl kept coming around and wanting to be taught with my grandchildren , " recalls Vaughn .
" I went to see this child 's mother , and her mother said she had already failed school once , that she could n't pass because she was n't smart enough .
Well she was smart enough to come find me .
And I said , ' OK , I 'll help you . ' "
Within two weeks , Vaughn had 20 girls in her house who were failing school and asking her to teach them .
Vaughn learned that the regional pass rate for girls was low because it was rooted in the economic need of young girls to work at home .
They begin missing classes , then failing exams , often ultimately failing or dropping out of school .
Watch Vaughn tell the story of how one little girl sparked 10,000 »
So in 2001 , Vaughn turned her grandchildren 's bedrooms into classrooms and began supplementing girls ' education .
" I found every one a girl younger than she and said , ' You 're responsible to make sure she learns . '
I taught them how to teach each other . "
It worked .
In two years , the group of girls had grown to 80 -- and they were succeeding in school .
With a grant , Vaughn was able to hire teachers , and the program continued to expand despite her attempt to set a limit of 100 girls .
" The girls wanted to take it to 10,000 , " says Vaughn .
To keep their " 10,000 Girls " education program going , the girls asked Vaughn to teach them to bake .
They began selling cookies and juice and were able to buy books and supplies .
Soon after , they got their older sisters , aunts and cousins -- who had already failed out of the school system -- involved in baking and selling goods .
The entrepreneurial element of the program was born .
Watch Vaughn describe her " 10,000 Girls " program »
" They were supporting their cause , " says Vaughn .
" It was something remarkable . "
Today , in addition to a pastry shop and catering business , " 10,000 Girls " runs a sewing workshop and the girls export their handmade dolls and household linens overseas .
Half of the funds from these projects go back to the girls ; the remainder supports the education program , no longer in Vaughn 's house .
Watch Vaughn explain how the unique dolls are sewn in the workshop »
More than 1,500 girls are involved in Vaughn 's program in six locations ; about 1,000 are waiting to join .
" We have girls who were told they 'd never get through high school who are at university now , " beams Vaughn .
" We hope that if we get 10,000 girls out there , 1,000 girls will come back to Kaolack and work .
It would revolutionize the whole region .
" Here I am , retired , and this is the best job I have ever had in my life . "
Congressman introduces bill to decriminalize personal marijuana use RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 17 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) has made good on his promise to introduce what he called the " Make Room for the Serious Criminals Bill " on a March 21 , 2008 appearance on HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher .
Co-sponsoring the bill are Reps. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) and Sam Farr ( D - CA ) .
Text of Thursday 's press release , from Rep. Frank 's Congressional website , follows .
#### Congressman , 4th District , Massachusetts 2252 Rayburn Building · Washington , D.C. 20515 · ( 202 ) 225-5931
April 17 , 2008 FRANK INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO REMOVE FEDERAL PENALTIES ON PERSONAL MARIJUANA USE Congressman Also Files Bill Permitting Medical Use of Marijuana in States that Choose to Allow it with Doctors Recommendation Congressman Barney Frank today introduced bi-partisan legislation aimed at removing federal restrictions on the individual use of marijuana .
One bill would remove federal penalties for the personal use of marijuana , and the other  versions of which Frank has filed in several preceding sessions of Congress  would allow the medical use of marijuana in states that have chosen to make its use for medical purposes legal with a doctors recommendation .
Representative Ron Paul ( R - TX ) joined Frank as a cosponsor of the federal penalties bill .
The cosponsors of the medical marijuana bill are Rep. Paul , along with Reps. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) , and Sam Farr ( D - CA ) .
Congressman Frank released the following statement explaining the legislation .
 I think it is poor law enforcement to keep on the books legislation that establishes as a crime something which in fact society does not seriously wish to prosecute .
In my view , having federal law enforcement agents engaged in the prosecution of people who are personally using marijuana is a waste of scarce resources better used for serious crimes .
In fact , this type of prosecution often meets with public disapproval .
The most frequent recent examples have been federal prosecutions of individuals using marijuana for medical purposes in states that have voted  usually by public referenda  to allow such use .
Because current federal law has been interpreted as superseding state law in this area , most states that have made medical use of marijuana legal have been unable to actually implement their laws .
" When doctors recommend the use of marijuana for their patients and states are willing to permit it , I think its wrong for the federal government to subject either the doctors or the patients to criminal prosecution .
More broadly speaking , the norm in America is for the states to decide whether particular behaviors should be made criminal .
To make the smoking of marijuana , whether for medical purposes or not , one of those extremely rare instances of federal crime  literally , to make a federal case  out of it  is wholly disproportionate to the activity involved .
We do not have federal criminal prohibitions against drinking alcoholic beverages , and there are generally no criminal penalties for the use of tobacco at the state and federal levels for adults .
There is no rational argument for treating marijuana so differently from these other substances .
To those who say that the government should not be encouraging the smoking of marijuana , my response is that I completely agree .
But it is a great mistake to divide all human activity into two categories : those that are criminally prohibited , and those that are encouraged .
In a free society , there must be a very considerable zone of activity between those two poles in which people are allowed to make their own choices as long as they are not impinging on the rights , freedom , or property of others .
I believe it is important with regard to tobacco , marijuana and alcohol , among other things , that we strictly regulate the age at which people may use these substances .
And , enforcement of age restrictions should be firm .
But , criminalizing choices that adults make because we think they are unwise ones , when the choices involved have no negative effect on the rights of others , is not appropriate in a free society . 
 If the laws I am proposing pass , states will still be free to treat marijuana as they wish .
But I do not believe that the federal government should treat adults who choose to smoke marijuana as criminals .
Federal law enforcement is a serious business , and we should be concentrating our efforts in this regard on measures that truly protect the public . 
Because this resource is so crucial - and obviously not just for Americans - depletion is going to drive prices up as consumers bid for dwindling supplies .
Threatening to sue OPEC is n't going to change that .
Threatening to tax Big Oil into submission is n't going to change that .
Mandating that we will invent new technologies to meet a greatly increased Renewable Fuel Standard is n't going to change that .
These are the sorts of proposals that merely demonstrate that your grasp of the problem is superficial .
And you have to understand the problem in order to begin addressing it .
Vice President Dick Cheney once famously quipped " The American way of life is non-negotiable . "
I submit that while our next president might not be so brash in stating this , the root of our energy problems can be traced to this attitude .
But , nature does n't negotiate .
It does n't appear that any of the remaining presidential candidates understand the basis of the problems we face :
Oil is a depleting , finite resource - albeit one crucial for the " American way of life . "
Should n't we also consider what happens when our " non-negotiable " way of life impacts the way of life for others worldwide ?
What if the Saudis also consider their way of life non-negotiable ?
Is suing them supposed to force them to negotiate ?
What about the person in Kenya whose way of life is eased by the very small amount of oil they consume ?
Shall we negotiate with that person , or just not invite them to the table while we price them out of the market ?
Let 's first consider common ground that you and I may have .
I presume we would agree that our dependence on oil is not healthy .
It puts the economy in a very vulnerable position .
It helps to enrich some countries that are hostile to us .
It increases carbon dioxide emissions .
I think this reflects the positions of all remaining candidates , and is consistent with my own position .
Now let 's consider a position on which apparently differ sharply : Gas prices must come down .
While I understand the position of the average American that we are paying too much for gasoline - what impact do you think price has on demand ?
Higher prices will eventually spur conservation and encourage alternatives - which helps achieve the objectives of lowering our dependence by lowering our usage .
Is n't this what you want ?
Instead , all three candidates propose measures to bring down gasoline prices - thus encouraging consumption .
Ca n't you see the inconsistency in your position ?
This is the time to show political leadership .
The pandering sickens me .
So what if the average person thinks we are paying too much for gas ?
The average person also voted for your predecessor - so let 's not presume that we must bow to the wishes of the average person .
I offer the following unsolicited advice for dealing with this problem .
This is how I would address Americans on this subject :
My Fellow Americans , Spiraling gasoline prices are having a negative impact on the overall economy .
Recent polls have shown that high energy prices are one of the biggest concerns of the American public .
However , I have to be bluntly honest :
There are no easy solutions .
The situation we find ourselves in is a result of many years of policies that are short - sighted and have essentially ignored the long - term consequences of a dependence on fossil fuels - which in turn translates into a dependence on crude oil imports .
One administration after another has paid lip service to energy independence , and yet our dependence has risen during each administration since Nixon .
We are obviously doing something wrong .
I believe I know what it is .
We have failed to truly understand why we have a problem .
We have failed to understand why we are addicted to oil .
We have failed to appreciate the nature of oil , and why it is so difficult to replace it with low energy density biomass .
The truth of the matter is that we are addicted to oil because of the unparalleled conveniences it provides us .
We sought painless solutions to our addiction .
But if breaking an addiction was easy , we would n't be addicted .
I do n't believe it serves a useful purpose to continue promising easy solutions .
On the other hand , a big part of the reason that you find yourselves in this vulnerable position is because of the previous hollow promises that were made .
So I propose the following measures to begin the process of breaking our oil addiction : 1 . We must improve the fuel efficiency of our automotive fleet .
It is an embarrassment .
Here again , we have sought the easy solution : Just increase CAFE standards .
Most people view this as a relatively painless solution .
They think that instead of their Ford Expedition getting 14 mpg , the automotive industry has tricks up their sleeves that can push it to 24 mpg .
All that is required is a bit of legislation , which does n't affect me , the consumer .
But that 's not the way it works .
To achieve 24 mpg , we are going to require a fundamental change in the SUV mindset .
We have fuel efficient vehicles available now , we just need to convince people to buy them .
I propose to offer rebates ranging from $ 500 to $ 2000 for vehicles that achieve high fuel efficiency .
I propose to penalize vehicles that achieve low fuel efficiency .
I propose to phase these changes in over the next 3 years .
2 . Continuing with theme of the first proposal , we need to find other ways to reduce our fuel consumption .
Europe provides a useful guide here , as the average per capita energy consumption in Europe is half that of the U.S.
How do they achieve this ?
Primarily , they have achieved this by making fuel very expensive .
Because I do n't think it would be fair to penalize you as a result of the decisions made by previous administrations , I propose to make this proposal revenue neutral .
The goal here is not to collect more taxes ; it is to encourage behaviors that reduce fuel consumption .
So here is the specific proposal .
The average American consumes 1,000 gallons of gasoline a year .
I propose to increase the federal gasoline tax by $ 0.20 / gallon this year , $ 0.30 / gallon next year , and then $ 0.50 / gallon in each of the three following years .
The total tax increase I am proposing is $ 2.00 / gallon .
This would still put gasoline prices at less than they are in Europe , but by having a clear understanding that gasoline prices wo n't be going down , this will encourage conservation measures .
In order to offset the burden of these higher taxes , I propose a tax credit equivalent to the increased tax burden for the average American .
This is equivalent to $ 200 in the first year of the tax .
Those who use less gasoline than the average will actually see their overall tax burden go down .
Those who consume more than 1,000 gallons per year will see an overall increase in their tax burden - and will therefore have a strong incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
For those whose fuel usage is for business use , the fuel taxes can be deducted against your business income .
3 . Solutions will be required on the supply side as well .
However , too many " solutions " to date rely heavily on fossil fuels , which is the very problem we are trying to mitigate .
Therefore , I am appointing an independent panel of experts across multiple disciplines - environmental , energy , agriculture - to evaluate various sources for 1 ) .
Reliance on fossil fuels ; and 2 ) .
Negative side effects .
There will be specifically defined criteria that alternative sources must meet in order to qualify for tax breaks .
For example , energy " producers " - fossil and alternative - will pay a surcharge on the fossil fuel inputs they use to run their operations .
This will encourage a move away from the use of fossil fuels to produce " renewable " energy .
4 . In order to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels for heating and electricity , I propose to extend tax credits for installation of solar systems , especially those for solar water heating .
Tax credits for installation of wind power , geothermal power , tidal power , and various other qualifying energy sources will be extended for 10 years .
5 . From my viewpoint , we need to move to a future in which electricity drives our transport systems .
The electricity would be derived initially from existing sources like coal and nuclear power , but increasingly from solar , wind , and various other renewable sources .
Improved battery technology and energy storage technologies are the key enabling technologies required .
Therefore , I am proposing to significantly increase the funding and resources devoted to these technologies .
Cash awards will also be available to inventors meeting certain key milestones - as inspired by the Automotive X PRIZE .
These five proposals are merely a start .
I understand that for some of you , these changes will be painful .
But the pain is coming regardless ; I am just proposing to manage it in a more effective and predictable manner .
For too long , we have been too passive in managing our oil addiction .
The time has come for more aggressive measures .
Such proposals would not be without harsh critics , and would require strong leadership to push them through .
Special interests will line up to protect their pocketbooks .
Short - sighted politicians will try to protect a few at the expense of many .
Will you be the president who takes a stand , tells the hard truth about our energy predicament , and pushes through measures that secure a brighter future for our children ?
Or will you be like the long succession of presidents who have made hollow promises and offered false solutions - only to see our dependence worsen ?
Addiction can be a difficult thing to beat .
But make no mistake :
The path we have been traveling down is unsustainable , and the bills are starting to come due .
If we do n't start paying them now , we will put an enormous burden on our children .

It does not matter if John McCain is an idiot .
He wants to be president and his neocon handlers want to bomb all Muslims , regardless of sect .
So thus it does not matter if McCain was unable to tell the difference between Sunnis and Shiites .
“ Sen . John McCain , traveling in the Middle East to promote his foreign policy expertise , misidentified in remarks Tuesday which broad category of Iraqi extremists are allegedly receiving support from Iran , ” reports the Washington Post .
He said several times that Iran , a predominately Shiite country , was supplying the mostly Sunni militant group , al - Qaeda .
In fact , officials have said they believe Iran is helping Shiite extremists in Iraq .
Speaking to reporters in Amman , the Jordanian capital , McCain said he and two Senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about Iranian operatives “ taking al - Qaeda into Iran , training them and sending them back . ”
Pressed to elaborate , McCain said it was “ common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran , that ’s well known .
And it ’s unfortunate . ”
A few moments later , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , standing just behind McCain , stepped forward and whispered in the presidential candidate ’s ear .
McCain then said : “ I ’m sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not al - Qaeda . ”
Do you want this moron in the Oval Office ?
It does not matter , of course , because guys like Joseph Lieberman will be pulling the strings if per chance the McManchurian candidate makes it to the White House .
Say it ai n’t so Joe wants to collaborate with the Israelis and kill Muslims , or at least intern them in hellish conditions like the Palestinians where they can be picked off in slow motion like fish in a barrel .
The mistake threatened to undermine McCain ’s argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to lead a country at war with terrorists .
In recent days , McCain has repeatedly said his intimate knowledge of foreign policy make him the best equipped to answer a phone ringing in the White House late at night .
Again , does not matter , as McCain , if he is selected to be the decider - commander — and he will not — wo n’t be tapping into his supposed “ foreign policy experience , ” his neocon handlers will , who include : William Kristol , Robert Kagan , Richard Armitage , Eliot Cohen , and Ralph Peters .
All want to invade Muslim lands and Cohen wants to kick off World War Four , as he calls it .
John McCain is a blithering idiot who probably could n’t find Iran or Iraq on a map .
He is a shell hollowed out by the neocons to trick somnolent Americans into believing he is a good , upright , patriotic American , war hero , a flag - waver who will protect us from al - Qaeda , never mind if McCain knows or not if they are Wahabi Sunni fanatics recruited by the CIA to stir up trouble .
Does not matter because Hillary - Obama , or Obama - Hillary will be in the White House come January , 2009 .
It ’s funny to listen to brain - damaged Republicans rant and rave about the “ liberal ” Obama .
It should be kept in mind that Obama is a sock puppet for Zbigniew Brzezinski , the guy who basically created al - Qaeda .
Hillary can find Iran on a map .
And she will insist the Pentagon put it in their sights , as she is fond of telling AIPAC .

I watched the live webcast of the EPA library closures hearing at the House Committee on Science and Technology ’s website this morning ( the webcast was recored and is still available for viewing at their website ) .
The opening and witness statements are now transcribed and posted as well .
A summary of the hearing is described in the committee ’s press release .
Also , the GAO released a report of Witness John Stephenson ’s statement , entitled “ EPA Needs to Follow Best Practices and Procedures When Reorganizing Its Library Network ” .
This coincides with a February 2008 GAO report entitled “ EPA Needs to Ensure That Best Practices and Procedures Are Followed When Making Further Changes to Its Library Network ” .
The main recommendations from these reports include : the creation of a comprehensive plan to guide library re-organization ; creation of an outreach process for garnering opinions and needs assessments of library users ; create mechanisms to oversee and monitor impact ; and develop procedures for the proper handling of materials .
Charles Orzehoskie , aka Chuck O , testified on behalf of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of EPA Locals # 238 .
He declared that :
“ The Council tried to work with EPA management but was stonewalled .
Management was apparently not interested in what the Agency engineers , risk assessors , and scientists had to say about EPA libraries .
The Administration ’s action in shuttering EPA Libraries appears penny wise , pound foolish and a step backwards in protecting the environment .
Unfortunately , so many of the Administrator ’s decisions appear to be based on the President ’s Management Agenda , and not on the mandates of Congress , the will of the American people or what would be in the best interest of accomplishing EPA ’s mission ” .
Jim Rettig , ALA ’s President - elect , testified and focused on two points : 1 ) “ the vital importance of access to scientific , environmental , legal , and other government information for EPA employees , scientists and the American public .
2 ) the necessity of the information specialist – the staff librarian – to ensure the most effective access to this information .
Because there are fewer libraries and professional library staff , scientists and the public will have limited access to this
information ” .
The Q & A session after the witnesses read their statements was the most entertaining portion of the hearing .
View the last 20 minutes or so of the webcast to see Chairman Bart Gordan questioning ( with some truly great quips and jabs ) Molly O’Neill , CIO of EPA .
Ms. O’Neill was rather vague and unsure of herself when asked to give specifics , bearing an uncanny resemblance to a wide - eyed deer in headlights .
Lots of : “ We have not done X yet but we are committed to doing so ” or “ I ’ll have to get back to you ” or “ I ca n’t answer that question for the record ” .
She was unable to answer the question by the Chairman in regards to exactly who is authoring the report for the committees on appropriations , due on March 26th .
Witnesses were surprised that they had not been contacted by EPA for commentary on the report , although Ms. O’Neill claimed EPA was “ working closely ” with the EPA libraries and those affected by the regional library closures .
In conclusion , the committee ordered that the witnesses ’ organizational representatives meet with Ms. O’Neill and her staff for consultation and to offer input and commentary on the report to congress before March 26th .
Chairman Gordan also had Ms. O’Neill state for the record that closed EPA libraries would re-open before the end of the fiscal year .

Top Democrats demand Attorney General explain remarks about pre-9/11 phone call Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday April 3 , 2008

Print This Email This ( Update - Department of Justice responds to Mukasey controversy over 9/11 comments )
A letter has been sent by leaders of the House Judiciary Committee to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , demanding that he explain a recent public statement that federal authorities failed to intercept a call from suspected terrorists in Afghanistan prior to the 9/11 attacks , when doing so could have prevented the attacks from taking place .
Mukasey blamed that failure on a lack of the sort of warrantless wiretapping authority that the administration has now called on Congress to provide .
However , there has never been any previous mention of such a call , and the Judiciary Committee letter -- signed by Chairman John Conyers and two subcommittee chairs -- points out that the law that existed at the time would have allowed the call to be intercepted immediately , with permission granted retroactively by the FISA court .
That letter has been noted by blogs , such as Talking Points Memo , but does not appear to have gained any attention from the mainstream media .
Blogger Glenn Greenwald , who has covered the Mukasey incident extensively , originally believed that " he just made this up out of whole cloth in order to mislead Americans into supporting the administration 's efforts to eliminate spying safeguards and basic constitutional liberties and to stifle the pending surveillance lawsuits against telecoms . "
However , Greenwald has now received an email from the Department of Justice 's Principal Deputy Director of Public Affairs , citing both a reference by a 2002 Congressional Joint Inquiry to an untraced call between one of the 9/11 hijackers and " a known overseas terrorist facility " and a Feb. 22 , 2008 letter from Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell blaming the failure to intercept that call on FISA restrictions .
With that clue , Greenwald found a mention in the Congressional report of a call from one of the 9/11 hijackers which could have easily been intercepted , except that " consistent with its focus on communications abroad , NSA adopted a policy that avoided intercepting the communications between individuals in the United States and foreign countries ... even though the collection of such communications is within its mission andit would have been possible for NSA to obtain FISA Court authorization for such collection . "
The report added that NSA believed the FBI should be responsible for monitoring domestic calls but had not actually developed a plan for it to do so .
" The administration has no interest in improving its intelligence - gathering capabilities , its counter - terrorism strategies , or its ability to identify valuable information , " Greenwald concludes .
" Its only interest is to obtain greater and greater domestic spying powers with fewer and fewer oversights -- based on the premise that as long as they know Everything , we 'll all be safe . "
The Judiciary Committee letter also includes a reiteration of an earlier demand that the text of the so - called Yoo Memorandum -- a secret 2001 Office of Legal Counsel opinion suggesting that Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures do not apply in cases of terrorism -- be provided to Congress .
The letter , signed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) , Subcommitee Chairmen Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) and Robert C. Scott ( D - VA ) , appears below .
April 3 , 2008 The Honorable Michael Mukasey Attorney General of the United States U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Ave. , NW Washington , DC 20530 Dear Mr. Attorney General :
We are writing about two disturbing recent revelations concerning the actions and inactions by the Department of Justice and the federal government to combat terrorism .
These include a public statement by you that appears to suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal government 's existing surveillance authority to combat terrorism , as well as possible malfeasance by the government prior to 9/11 , and the partial disclosure of the contents of a secret Department memorandum concerning Executive Branch authority to combat terrorism , which has been previously requested to be provided to Congress .
We ask that you promptly provide that memorandum and that you clarify your public statement in accordance with the questions below .
First , according to press reports , in response to questions at a March 27 speech , you defended Administration wiretapping programs and proposals to change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) by referring to a pre-9/11 incident .
Before the 9/11 terrorist attacks , you stated , " we knew that there had been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan and we knew that it came to the United States .
We did n't know precisely where it went .
You 've got 3,000 people who went to work that day , and did n't come home , to show for that . "
1
This statement is very disturbing for several reasons .
Initially , despite extensive inquiries after 9/11 , I am aware of no previous reference , in the 9/11 Commission report or elsewhere , to a call from a known terrorist safe house in Afghanistan to the United States which , if it had been intercepted , could have helped prevent the 9/11 attacks .
In addition , if the Administration had known of such communications from suspected terrorists , they could and should have been intercepted based on existing FISA law .
For example , even assuming that a FISA warrant was required to intercept such calls , as of 9/11 FISA specifically authorized such surveillance on an emergency basis without a warrant for a 48 hour period .
2
If such calls were known about and not intercepted , serious additional concerns would be raised about the government 's failure to take appropriate action before 9/11 .
Accordingly , we ask that you promptly answer the following questions :
Were you referring to an actual pre-9/11 incident in the portion of your statement quoted above ?
If not , what were you referring to ?
Do you believe that a FISA warrant would have been required to intercept a telephone call from a known terrorist safe house in Afghanistan to the United States in 2001 ?
If so , please explain .
Even assuming that such a warrant would have been required , do you agree that even before 9/11 , FISA authorized emergency interception without a warrant for a 48 - hour period of phone calls from a known terrorist safe house in Afghanistan to the United States ?
Assuming that you were referring to an actual pre-9/11 incident in your statement , please explain why such phone calls were not intercepted and appropriately utilized by federal government authorities in seeking to prevent terrorist attacks .
Second , in the March , 2003 Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) memorandum publicly released on April 1 , 2008 , the contents of a secret October , 2001 OLC memorandum were partially disclosed .
Specifically , the 2003 memorandum explains that in an October 23 , 2001 memorandum , OLC " concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations . " 3
On two prior occasions in letters of February 12 and February 20 , 2008 , Chairman Conyers requested that the Administration publicly release the October 23 , 2001 , memorandum .
4
The memorandum has not been received despite these specific requests .
Based on the title of the October 23 , 2001 memorandum , and based on what has been disclosed and the contents of similar memoranda issued at roughly the same time , it is clear that a substantial portion of this memorandum provides a legal analysis and conclusions as to the nature and scope of the Presidential Commander in Chief power to accomplish specific acts within the United States .
The people of the United States are entitled to know the Justice Department 's interpretation of the President 's constitutional powers to wage war in the United States .
There can be no actual basis in national security for keeping secret the remainder of a legal memorandum that addresses this issue of Constitutional interpretation .
The notion that the President can claim to operate under " secret " powers known only to the President and a select few subordinates is antithetical to the core principles of this democracy .
We ask that you promptly release the October 23 , 2001 , memorandum .
Please provide your responses and direct any questions to the Judiciary Committee office , 2138 Rayburn House Office Building , Washington , DC 20515 ( tel:202-225-3951 ; fax : 202-225-7680 ) .
Thank you for your cooperation .
Sincerely , John Conyers , Jr. Chairman , Committee on the Judiciary Jerrold Nadler Chairman , Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Robert C. " Bobby " Scott Chairman , Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism and Homeland Security cc : Hon. Lamar S. Smith Hon. Trent Franks Hon. Louie Gohmert Hon. Brian Benczkowski

In a recent blog post by Twan van Laarhoven he showed how to reflect Haskell expressions so that we can actually see them symbolically .
This has now been included in lambdabot on the Haskell IRC ( source ) .
Let 's play with it for a moment :
That 's very cool !
Read
Twan 's post to find out how it works .
All we need to know is on the last line , .
Sois a special type with special instances .
Let 's try something elseOh , that 's annoying , we can't print functions .
But why can't we ?
If we made up some variable of typeand then applied the function we'd get something we could print .
Let 's add some code to Twan 's module .
I 've just randomly picked the variable .
( To make this compile you need the extension language FlexibleInstances . )
And try again with the example Pretty smooth .
Except it does n't really work .
Those two functions are not the same .
We can't just arbitrarily pick the variablesince it might be free in the expression .
So we need to pick a variable that is not free in the expression .
How could we do that ?
No matter what we pick it could be used .
And we have no idea what is being used .
Or do we ?
If we just turn the function in to text we could look at the string , and pick some variable that is unused in that string .
This is really a gruesome hack , but who cares ?
How do we print the function ?
Just invent some variable , I use _ , turn it into an expression and tokenize the string .
We will then have a string of tokens not to use .
To find a variable to use , just pick an infinite supply of variables , remove the ones being used , and then pick one of the remaining ones .
instance Show ( Expr -> Expr ) where show f = " \\ " ++ show v ++ " -> " ++ show ( f v ) where v = var ( head vars ) vars = supply \\ tokenize ( show $ f $ var " _ " ) supply = [ " x " ++ show i | i x : tokenize s'
* SimpleReflect > \ x -> x + y \ x1 -> x1 + y * SimpleReflect > \ x -> x + var " x1 " \ x2 -> x2 + x1
* SimpleReflect > \ x y -> x + y + z :1:0 : No instance for ( Show ( Expr -> Expr -> Expr ) ) ...

* SimpleReflect > \ ( x , y ) -> x+y+z :1:0 : No instance for ( Show ( ( Expr , Expr ) -> Expr ) ) ...
Expr
Expr
Expr
instance ( Show a , ExprArg a , Show r ) =>
Show ( a -> r ) where show f = " \\ " ++ show v ++ " -> " ++ show ( f v ) where v = evalState exprArg vars dummy = evalState exprArg $ repeat " _ " vars = supply \\ tokenize ( show $ f dummy ) supply = [ " x " ++ show i | i x : tokenize s' class ExprArg a where exprArg :: State [ String ] a instance ExprArg Expr where exprArg = do v:vs <- get ; put vs ; return ( var v )
instance ExprArg ( ) where exprArg = return ( ) instance ( ExprArg a , ExprArg b ) => ExprArg ( a , b ) where exprArg = lift M2 ( , ) exprArg exprArg instance ( ExprArg a , ExprArg b , ExprArg c ) => ExprArg ( a , b , c ) where exprArg = liftM3 ( , , ) exprArg exprArg exprArg
* SimpleReflect > \ ( x , y ) -> x + y + z \ ( x1,x2 ) -> x1 + x2 + z * SimpleReflect > curry f :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr \ x2 -> \ x1 -> f ( x2,x1 ) * SimpleReflect > uncurry f :: ( Expr , Expr ) -> Expr \ ( x1,x2 ) -> f x1 x2 * SimpleReflect > \ ( ) -> 1 \ ( ) -> 1
Expr
And try to fool it : OK , what about multiple arguments ?
Well , yeah , that 's true .
There is no such instance .
But wait , why is the instance we have for the type ?
No particular reason , that 's just what I wrote .
In fact it works equally well foras long as we can show , because that 's the only thing we do with .
So we change the first line of the instance :
And nowWell , that was n't too hard .
So let 's try another example .
Hmmm , yes , the argument must be an .
That 's annoying .
We need to generalize the argument type .
We want be able to useand pair of them etc .
Time for a type class .
What does it need to do ?
It has to invent expressions and never reuse variables doing so .
So when we invent anwe need to consume one variable and leave the rest for others to consume .
This sounds like a state monad .
So we 're going to use a state monad where the state is the ( infinite ) list of strings that are available for making variables .
Using this we 're back where we were before , but now we can make some more instances .
And finally :
The last example is a curiosity since it does not involveat all .
Well , that 's enough for a Sunday night hack .

A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit seeking to hold Vice President Dick Cheney and others personally responsible for damages arising from the 2003 disclosure of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
… Lea Anne McBride , Cheney ’s spokeswoman , said the vice president was “ pleased ” about the dismissal .
( Original Article )
As the U.S. moves toward holding death - sentence trials for six Guantánamo Bay detainees alleged to have plotted the Sept. 11 attacks , legal scholars and human rights advocates are questioning not only the six - year - long process and timing of the charges , but also whether the accused could ever receive fair trials .
On Feb. 11 , charges were issued against the six , including the alleged chief organizer of the Sept. 11 attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
The U.S. military outlined 168 charges , including conspiracy , murder , attacking civilians , terrorism , and supporting terrorism .
All six accused will be tried together by military commissions  highly - controversial criminal courts run by the U.S. armed forces  at the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
They will be the first trials of detainees held at Guantánamo .
One former detainee , David Hicks from Australia , pleaded guilty in March 2007 to providing support to a terrorist organization .
He was sentenced to seven years in jail to be served in his home country .
Given time off for his five years in captivity , he was released in December 2007 .
Since the beginning of the war in Afghanistan in 2002 , more than 800 detainees have been imprisoned in Guantánamo .
Hundreds have been released without charges .
But about 275 are still held , 80 of whom the U.S. has said it expects to put on trial .
Before being taken to Guantánamo , five of the accused were held without charges or legal representation by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in secret prisons in Eastern Europe and elsewhere .
The George W. Bush administration has acknowledged that at least one of the defendants , Mohammed , was subjected to waterboarding while in custody .
Waterboarding  simulated drowning  has been long acknowledged as torture .
The newly appointed U.S. attorney general , Michael Mukasey , has recently declined to say whether he agreed .
But after World War II , the U.S. prosecuted Japanese soldiers for using the practice against its prisoners of war .
Vice President Dick Cheney has vigorously defended waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques , referring to them as " a tougher program for a very few tougher customers . "
Military authorities have declared that no evidence obtained through torture would be used in the upcoming trials .
But many legal experts , including Columbia University law professor Scott Horton , have expressed skepticism about whether convictions can be obtained without using the evidence extracted under torture .
Horton told IPS that the timing of the trials was " politically motivated " to strengthen the Republican Party ’s chances in the 2008 presidential election .
Trying the accused by military commissions was likely to result in " a series of show trials , " he added .
This view was shared by Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , a New York - based legal advocacy group , which represents one of the defendants , Mohammad al - Qahtani , who has been held at Guantánamo for six years and claims to have been tortured during that time .
The military commission system had " none of the guarantees " of trials by normal civilian courts , Ratner told IPS .
He added : " Coerced and hearsay evidence can be used .
There is no jury , only a group of military officers and a judge appointed by the Bush administration .
Much of the trial can be held in secret and the defendant does not get to see all of the evidence .
After this sham process , the defendant , if convicted , can receive the death penalty .
There is a barbarity to the actions of the Bush administration that is without precedent . "
Many military lawyers have expressed similar views .
The former head prosecutor at Guantánamo , Col. Morris Davis , resigned when he was placed directly under the command of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense  a principal architect of the military commissions system .
Lifelong Republican John Hutson , a retired judge advocate general  the military ’s top lawyer  has become a leading voice among former military officials criticizing the Bush administration ’s policies on Guantánamo Bay .
Hutson has opposed torture and the precedent it would set for future conflicts .
The Bush administration has argued that ordinary courts are not equipped to handle the sensitive national security considerations involved in trying terrorists .
A Pentagon legal adviser and spokesman , Air Force Brig .
Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann , has said the trials would be " as open as possible . "
The accused would have the right to call their own witnesses , cross-examine prosecution witnesses , and see the evidence presented against them .
" There will be no secret trials , " he has declared .
The 12 - member military commission would have to pass unanimous verdicts .
But Hartmann has declined to answer questions about the admissibility of evidence obtained by waterboarding .
The procedures of the military commissions have been repeatedly challenged in U.S. civilian courts , resulting in a number of stinging defeats for the Bush administration and contributing to the delays in holding the trails .
This legal saga began in 2001 , when President Bush issued an executive order establishing military commissions to try those captured in the so - called " War on Terror . "
Four years of legal battling later , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that military commissions  as defined under the president ’s executive order  violated military law and the Geneva Conventions .
Congress then hurriedly enacted the Military Commissions Act of 2005 , which Bush signed into law in early 2006 .
That law , which is still under challenge in the courts , has become the basis for the planned trials .
If challenges to the military commissions are successful , the trials could be delayed even further .
Concern over the potential loss of U.S. standing in the world over the holding of military trials  and what will emerge during them  has been voiced by many American legal scholars .
David Cole , a leading constitutional authority , told IPS : " When the U.S. violates human rights in the fight against terrorism , it sends a message to autocrats and dictators worldwide that they , too , can deny human rights in the name of counterterrorism . "
This view was echoed by Ratner , who said : " These trials are important because the U.S. , a country that often criticizes torture and military tribunals in other countries  such as Nigeria and Turkey  is now using torture and trials outside its normal system to try the alleged Sept. 11 conspirators . "
Rona Gabor , international legal director for the advocacy group Human Rights First , told IPS : " Much of the world considers the death penalty an international human rights violation even when imposed after the fairest of procedures .
To impose it through an untested , ad hoc process that has not yet successfully completed a trial , even for a misdemeanor , will likely be viewed with deep skepticism . "

US Supreme Court upholds lethal injection , opening way to resumed executions
By Naomi Spencer
17 April 2008
On Wednesday the US Supreme Court ruled 7 - 2 to reject a challenge to execution by lethal injection .
The case was brought by two Kentucky death row prisoners , who argued that the method exposes those condemned to die to the risk of cruel and unusual punishment .
The reactionary ruling will lead to a resumption of executions , which were halted nationwide last September after the court agreed to hear the case .
Moreover , while the decision is not a direct ruling on the constitutionality of the death penalty itself , it will thwart pending and future cases brought forward by prisoners on similar grounds and make challenging the death penalty more difficult .
The case , Baze v. Rees , concentrated on the constitutionally of the lethal injection procedure , the form of execution used in most states that practice capital punishment .
Specifically , the two Kentucky prisoners claimed that the method of lethal injection posed a significant enough risk of misadministration and excruciating pain that its use , even when properly administered , constituted cruel and unusual punishment , which is banned by the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution .
The court justices issued varying opinions .
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion , which was joined by justices Anthony Kennedy , Samuel Alito , John Paul Stevens , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , and Steven Breyer .
All but Kennedy filed separate concurring opinions in which they laid out differences on the ruling — most going even further to the right than the majority opinion .
The petitioners cited numerous instances in which the most common three - drug method of lethal injection left prisoners in agonizing pain for extended periods of time .
In lethal injection , a prisoner is bound to a gurney and fitted with two needles connecting to intravenous drips .
The first injection , consisting of the barbituate sodium thiopental , is intended to swiftly put the prisoner into a comatose state of unconsciousness .
However , if the injection is improperly placed , or the chemical does not pass evenly through the intravenous tube , there is a chance the prisoner will be cognizant and suffer severe pain when the other toxic chemicals are administered .
The second injection contains a paralyzing agent called pancuronium bromide , which renders the prisoner completely immobile and causes suffocation .
If a prisoner is conscious at this point , all signs of suffering , seizures , and terror are undetectable .
The third and fatal injection of potassium chloride , which induces a massive heart attack , also induces a severe burning sensation in the veins .
Wednesday ’s decision will be followed by a wide resumption of executions .
Forty - two people were executed in 2007 , through September when the moratorium was imposed , the lowest number of executions in the US in 13 years .
Yet even considering this drop , the US was still ranked fifth in the world in terms of people executed .
At the time of the moratorium , the executions of 40 prisoners were imminent .
Thousands of prisoners sit on death row throughout the country .
Numerous states — including Texas , California , Ohio , Arizona , Alabama , and Florida — hold well over a hundred condemned prisoners ; California ’s death row population is approaching 700 .
According to the Death Penalty Information Center , death row inmates typically spend more than a decade of their lives awaiting execution , in isolation , excluded from education and vocational programs , disallowed most forms of exercise and visitation .
Between 1977 and 2006 , over 7,100 people have been sentenced to death in the US .
Thirty - six of the 50 US states , in addition to the federal government , administer lethal injections to carry out death sentences , with most , including Kentucky , using the three - drug combination .
In the majority opinion Wednesday Chief Justice Roberts asserted that Kentucky ’s lethal injection procedure “ complies with the constitutional requirements against cruel and unusual punishment . ”
Making clear its support for the barbaric procedure , the high court ruling affirmed a lower court ruling and acknowledged that “ there are no methods of legal execution that are satisfactory to those who oppose the death penalty on moral , religious , or societal grounds . ”
Roberts wrote , “ Some risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution — no matter how humane — if only from the prospect of error in following the required procedure .
It is clear , then , that the Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions . ”
Roberts stated that the court had “ never invalidated a State ’s chosen procedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment . ”
He cited an 1879 ruling upholding the use of firing squads , which found that the practice was not cruel and unusual , in contrast to English executions in which “ terror , pain , or disgrace were sometimes superadded . ”
What punishments like being “ emboweled alive , beheaded , and quartered ” had that was absent in American executions , Roberts asserted , “ was the deliberate infliction of pain for the sake of pain — ‘ superadding ’ pain to the death sentence through torture and the like . ”
Citing another 19th century ruling , Roberts noted that the US justice system recognized punishment as “ cruel ” when involving “ something inhuman and barbarous , something more than the mere extinguishment of life . ”
“ Simply because an execution method may result in pain , either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death , does not establish the sort of ‘ objectively intolerable risk of harm ’ that qualifies as cruel and unusual , ” Roberts wrote .
Death penalty opponents have pointed out that the three - drug lethal injection method was long ago discontinued by the American Veterinary Association in the euthanizing of animals because it was determined to be unnecessarily cruel .
The majority opinion rejected the extension of this logic to human beings .
“ If [ the paralyzing agent ] pancuronium is too cruel for animals , the argument goes , then it must be too cruel for the condemned inmate , ” Roberts wrote .
“ Whatever rhetorical force the argument carries ... it overlooks the States ’ legitimate interest in providing for a quick , certain death . ”
By this reasoning , the “ States ’ interest ” trumps human rights .
Such logic flows from the same political origins as the Bush administration ’s justifications for the use of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” on prisoners held by the CIA and the military .
The opinion concluded , “ The firing squad , hanging , the electric chair , and the gas chamber have each in turn given way to more humane methods , culminating in today ’s consensus on lethal injection . ”
Justice Stevens , who nevertheless concurred with the majority in the ruling , wrote in a separate opinion :
“ The imposition of the death penalty represents the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes .
A penalty with such negligible returns to the State [ is ] patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment . ”
Justice Scalia , in a bristling counter - opinion , wrote of Stevens ’s : “ There is a risk that an innocent person might be convicted and sentenced to death — though not a risk that Justice Stevens can quantify , because he lacks a single example of a person executed for a crime he did not commit in the current American system . ”
In fact , Scalia wrote , the death penalty represented a cost to society only because those “ opposed to the death penalty ... have ‘ encumbered it ... with unwarranted restrictions neither contained in the text of the Constitution nor reflected in two centuries of practice under it . ”
In other words , the United States justice system would function more smoothly and in accordance with the Constitution if only the death penalty were relieved of the ethical , moral , legal , and social considerations that make executions such a long legal process .
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter dissented , with Ginsburg writing for the minority .
While citing a 2002 ruling that declared the Eighth Amendment “ must draw its meaning from evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society , ” Ginsburg framed the dissent strictly in terms of whether the state of Kentucky ’s lethal injection protocol was meticulous enough in its safeguards to flawlessly execute prisoners .
The dissenting opinion , like the case itself , did not call into question the death penalty .
Instead , the nominally more liberal faction of the court proscribed itself to questioning minor details of the lethal injection process .
Kentucky , Ginsburg wrote , did not employ “ essentially costless ” measures such as “ saying the condemned inmate ’s name , ” “ gently strok[ing ] the condemned inmate ’s eyelashes , ” or “ pinch[ing ] the condemned inmate ’s arm ” after administering the first injection .
Ginsburg wrote , “ Lethal injection as a mode of execution can be expected , in most instances , to result in painless death .
Rare though errors may be , the consequences of a mistake about the condemned inmate ’s consciousness are horrendous and effectively undetectable after injection of the second drug .
Given the opposing tugs of the degree of risk and magnitude of pain , the critical question here , as I see it , is whether a feasible alternative exists . ”

The author of Brave New World and The Doors of Perception introduced Wilson to LSD - 25 .
The drug rocked Wilsons world .
He thought of it as something of a miracle substance and continued taking it well into the 60s .
As he approached his 70th birthday , he developed a plan to have LSD distributed at all AA meetings nationwide .
The plan was eventually quashed by more rational voices , and a few years later the Federal government made the point moot by making the drug illegal .

Ambassador : Bush personally bullied UN diplomats into supporting Iraq war RAW STORY
Published : Saturday March 22 , 2008

Print This Email This Heraldo Muñoz , a personal friend of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Chilean ambassador to the United Nations , details the Bush administration 's persuasion tactics in the months leading up to the invasion and occupation of Iraq in his upcoming memoir , the Washington Post reports .
" A Solitary War : A Diplomat 's Chronicle of the Iraq War and Its Lessons , " to be released in April 2008 , outlines bullying tactics exercised by President Bush in attempts to persuade United Nations diplomats to back a 2003 resolution to authorize military force against Iraq .
Mocking of unsupportive allies , threats of trade reprisals and attempts to fire U.N. envoys were among actions taken by the Bush administration against those less than cooperative , Muñoz writes .
Ultimately , he continues , America's " rough - and - tumble " strategy backfired , with Bush later reaching out to Chile and Mexico , which he 'd earlier spurned for preventing the war resolution , aggressively backed by the United States and Britain , from taking hold .
# EXCERPTS : On March 14 , 2003 , less than one week before the eventual invasion , Chile hosted a meeting of diplomats from the six undecided governments to discuss its proposal .
But U.S. ambassador John D. Negroponte and then -Secretary of State Colin L. Powell moved quickly to quash the initiative , warning their governments that the effort was viewed as " an unfriendly act " designed to isolate the United States .
The diplomats received calls from their governments ordering them to " leave the meeting immediately , " Muñoz writes .
Muñoz said subsequent ties remained tense at the United Nations , where the United States sought support for resolutions authorizing the occupation of Iraq .
He said that small countries met privately in a secure room at the German mission that was impervious to eavesdropping .
" It reminded me of a submarine or a giant safe , " Muñoz said in an interview .
The United States , he added , expressed " its displeasure " to the German government every time they held a meeting in the secure room .
" They could n't listen to what was going on . " #

CNN : On the eve of Iowa caucus , some states give e-voting an ' F ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

With only a day left before the Iowa caucus kicks off 2008 presidential voting , electronic tabulating machines to be used in some state primaries may be " unfit " for an election , according to CNN .
" As primaries draw near , " reports Wolf Blitzer , " some states are finding serious problems already with their electronic voting machines -- and they 're ready to give e-voting a grade of ' F ' " CNN 's Carol Costello says that despite the rash of voting irregularities that plagued previous presidential elections in 2004 and 2000 , voting machines -- specifically electronic versions of the devices -- still have flaws .
" You would think after all the problems we had with hanging chads in 2000 and voting machine malfunctions in 2004 and 2006 , voting machines across the country would work by now , " reported Costello .
" But a few days before caucuses and primaries get underway , they 're not .
She points to recent complaints from the secretaries of state in Ohio and Colorado that declared their brands of electronic voting machines unfit for use .
Last month , Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat , compared her state 's machines to a car in need of repair .
" They have done the job in the past with difficulty , " she said of the machines , " and I could probably best analogize it to a vehicle with a bad axle -- that at some point the wheels are going to fall off and we 're just going to be hopeful that in using them for one more election that we 'll be able to get through . "
As previously reported by RAW STORY , Brunner has recommended that Ohio voters from counties with touch - screen machines be able to request a paper ballot during the state 's March primary .
Colorado's Republican Secretary of State , Mike Coffman , went so far as to decertify three of the four voting equipment manufacturers in his state last month , citing the machines ' inaccuracy and the possibility that they could be hacked .
" At the end of the day , what I think is most important is that the voters have confidence that this equipment is secure from being tampered with , and that their votes can be accurately counted , " he told CNN .
Coffman says that a software patch could correct some of the problems , and is meeting with the machines ' manufacturers to ensure that the fix is made ahead of the state 's August primary .
A December report on voting security conducted by the state of Ohio found that magnets in electronic devices such as a Palm Pilot could be used to prevent the registration of votes for specific candidates or prevent a vote entirely .
On Monday , an undecided Iowa voter asked Democratic contender Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) if he would fight to contest a " dirty election .
"
" I intend to whoop 'em so good that it wo n't even be close and they can't steal the election , " Obama said .
The candidate later added that " If this thing is close , we will fight it tooth and nail till the end .
The nice thing is , I 'm a voting - rights attorney as well as a civil rights attorney . "

How many parents would use candy to compel their child to stop their bad behavior ?
Yet that ’s just the tack that Rep.
John Murtha is taking by offering the Army $ 20 billion to straighten out its delinquent Future Combat Systems modernization program .
Like the lion 's share of weapons contracts , Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) is underperforming , behind schedule and billions over budget .
FCS comprises 14 separate weapons systems linked by a computer network and released in phases or “ spin-outs . ”
The project was launched in 2003 when Boeing Corp. was named the FCS “ lead systems integrator , ” giving it responsibility for everything from hiring subcontractors to developing the network software .
Army brass originally told Congress the program would cost $ 77 billion ; the Army ’s number has since grown to $ 160 billion , and independent government auditors have estimated its total cost at up to $ 240 billion .
An investigation of FCS recently released by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) says the Army needs to create “ viable alternatives to fielding [ FCS ] as currently envisioned ” because of the likelihood that many of its components wo n’t be feasible or worthwhile .
Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) , who chairs the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee , reportedly told Army Chief of Staff George Casey in a February meeting that FCS faced cuts as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan take their toll on the federal budget and military .
As a solution , Murtha offered to tack an extra $ 20 billion onto the Department of Defense budget if the Army would roll out the program ’s most viable elements in the next five years and cut their losses on the rest .
But Murtha ’s strategy of offering the Army an incentive to field FCS programs more quickly rewards failure by ignoring the shortcomings of the program .
The Army has used only a couple of program elements on the ground in Iraq , such as bomb - detecting robots , and the first spin - out wo n’t even begin production until later this year .
Yet that spin - out has n’t been realistically tested , according to the GAO , “ increasing the likelihood of costly discoveries ” as it moves into the expensive production process .
Worse , development of the software holding the whole system together has not only tripled in scope -- from 32 to 95 lines of code -- auditors seriously doubt it can work at all .
Murtha ’s statements illustrate several recurring problems with the defense appropriations game .
One is the audacious manipulation by committee leaders who think they can make things happen better and faster outside of the deliberative budget process .
Murtha told Casey in a memo that “ he has $ 300 billion to ‘ play with ’ in supplementals , ” according to the publication Inside the Army .
Another is the fallacious idea that more money equals more solutions .
FCS ’s problems are not about cash .
Though Army officials have complained about Congressional cuts to the program , contractors say Army requirements for the networking software were poorly defined , late , or missing , according to the GAO .
Finally , there ’s appropriators ’ overreliance on carrots to compel good spending practices when they really need a big stick .
There may well be some valuable research or weaponry that can be salvaged from FCS .
But it makes more sense to weed them out following the next administration ’s bottom - up defense review than to shove more dollars down the throat of a program already in danger of choking to death .
This is good news .
We all took action and the results followed .
C&L thanks Michael J. Klag for his handling of the situation on POPLINE so quickly .
Here 's the letter posted on Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health :
I was informed this morning that the word " abortion " was blocked as a search term in the POPLINE family planning database administered by the Bloomberg School ’s Center for Communication Programs .
POPLINE provides evidence - based information on reproductive health and family planning and is the world ’s largest database on these issues .
USAID , which funds POPLINE , found two items in the database related to abortion that did not fit POPLINE criteria .
The agency then made an inquiry to POPLINE administrators .
Following this inquiry , the POPLINE administrators at the Center for Communication Programs made the decision to restrict abortion as a search term .
I could not disagree more strongly with this decision , and I have directed that the POPLINE administrators restore " abortion " as a search term immediately .
I will also launch an inquiry to determine why this change occurred .
The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge and not its restriction .
Sincerely , Michael J. Klag , MD , MPH
Dean , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Why would anyone restrict the word ' abortion ' on a government funded data base with thousands upon thousands of articles for research ?
I 'm very interested to see how that decision was reached .
Yea , I know --- I 'll be nice for now , but I 'll keep on it .... Many thanks to Women 's Health News for the heads up and the many emails I received on this issue .

On the same day that Pennsylvania super delegate Sen. Bob Casey endorsed Obama , Sen. Patrick Leahy released a statement calling for Clinton to withdraw and support Obama .
However , Clinton continues to vow to fight on .
Leahy , an Obama supporter , and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said today , “ Senator Clinton has every right , but not a very good reason , to remain a candidate for as long as she wants to .
As far as the delegate count and the interests of a Democratic victory in November go , there is not a very good reason for drawing this out .
But as I have said before , that is a decision that only she can make . ”
Clinton ’s recent tactics are starting to look like she wants to sabotage an Obama nomination in 2008 , to open the door for herself in 2012 .
For instance , let ’s examine Clinton ’s comments during an interview with Greta Van Sustren on Fox News .
“ You know , I keep beating this drum , we cannot disenfranchise two of the most important states for Democrats , Florida and Michigan .
I do n’t think we can win if we do n’t win Michigan and Florida .
So… In November .
And we are essentially saying to the voters — we , the Democratic Party , is saying to the voters , your votes do n’t count , we are not going to have a re-vote , you are out of luck .
I do n’t think that the nominee of the party will be considered legitimate if we do n’t figure out how to count those votes for Michigan and Florida . ”

The dirty little secret here is that the Clintons have always only cared about what the Democratic Party could do for them .
Bill Clinton always put his own reelection and legacy ahead of the needs of his party .
He had a terrible relationship with Congressional Democrats , and the Clintons only began to be team players when Hillary launched her first Senate campaign .
It would seem that Clinton is trying to delegitimize the entire Democratic Party in 2008 .
Can anyone think of a more selfish strategy than this ?
I think Hillary has every right to stay in the race through the final primary .
If she would be able to somehow take the delegate lead away from Obama , then it would be time to discuss who the Democratic nominee should be , but she is practicing slash and burn politics here .
She is willing to destroy the Democratic Party now , in the hope of being its savior later .
I do n’t believe that the Clintons large egos can comprehend that Democrats might want someone other than them to lead the party .
It is looking more and more like Hillary Clinton should make a classy and graceful exit out of this race , but when have the Clintons ever been associated with the terms class and grace ?

You know , we should have paid a little closer attention to Microsoft 's decision yesterday to extend Windows XP sales to " June 2010 or one year after the general availability of Windows 7 " -- if the company was really planning on shipping Windows 7 in 2010 , that first date does n't make a lot of sense unless the plan is to ship Windows 7 much , much earlier .
And hey -- what 's Bill Gates doing telling investors this afternoon that Windows 7 will come " in the next year " and that he's " super - enthused " about it ?
As far as we know , the official Windows 7 timeline has n't changed , so Bill might just talking about beta versions , but something 's clearly up Windows - wise in Redmond -- perhaps Vista 's wow is not long for this now .

Why did Mike the Headless Chicken cross the road ?
Sir Mark has always denied direct involvement in the alleged plot Equatorial Guinea has issued an arrest warrant for Sir Mark Thatcher over his alleged role in a failed 2004 coup .
The country 's attorney general said that Sir Mark , son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , had provided money and transport .
In 2005 , Sir Mark was given a fine and a suspended sentence in South Africa after pleading guilty to unknowingly helping to finance the plot .
However , he has always denied any direct involvement .
He told the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper he was not worried by the arrest warrant .
" As far as I 'm concerned the issue has already been dealt with , " he was quoted as saying .
" I 've been charged and tried in a court in South Africa on exactly those charges so I do n't see what more they can do . "
' Part of the team ' But Equatorial Guinea 's Attorney General Jose Olo Obono said he had received new evidence against Sir Mark from Simon Mann , a former British army officer awaiting trial for his alleged role in the attempted coup .
" Mark Thatcher provided financing for a coup d'etat in Equatorial Guinea and then he organised all the transport for the coup d'etat , " Mr Obono told the Associated Press .
" We do n't understand how [ South Africa ] let him go with just this fine .
With an issue like this , we can't just let it go . "
In comments to AFP news agency , Mr Obono said that Interpol had been asked to help find Sir Mark , " because we really do n't know where he is , no - one knows where he is living . "
The Daily Telegraph said that Sir Mark was speaking from the resort of Puerto Banus on the Costa del Sol .
Mann is being held at the notorious Black Beach prison in Malabo , the capital of Equatorial Guinea .
He told a British television station recently that the plot did exist , but he was not the driving force behind it .
The ex-SAS officer also alleged Sir Mark Thatcher was " part of the team " .
In the past , Sir Mark has always claimed he was an unwitting conspirator and that as far as he knew , he was helping finance an air ambulance business in West Africa .
The president of Equatorial Guinea , Teodoro Obiang , took power in 1979 , in a coup in which he killed his uncle .
Equatorial Guinea is now one of Africa 's largest oil producers .

Cowed by the threats , Steinmetz soon suspended her pioneering research .
Erin Pizzey of England had impeccable credentials -- she was the founder of the first abuse shelter for women .
So a few years later she published Prone to Violence , a book that revealed these women are often as physically aggressive as their mates .

When professor Suzanne Steinmetz published the results of her survey on domestic violence , no one had prepared her for the firestorm that would ensue .

An investigative report in Newsday on a 1975 rape defense case waged by a young Hillary Clinton ( then Hillary D. Rodham ) in Arkansas reveals that her famous anything - to - win attitude exhibited itself early on , her legal opponent in the case describing her as a " bulldog . "
According to Glenn
Thrush 's detailed report in Newsday , a 27 - year - old Rodham , acting as a court - appointed attorney , impugned the character and credibility of a 12 - year - old girl in her aggressive defense of the man accused of raping her .
Perhaps justiable from a strictly legal perspective as the vigorous defense required of any attorney , the case nonetheless raises ethical concerns with regards to the methods employed by this particular attorney on behalf of her client ; as well as to broader questions on the treatment of rape victims by the justice system , in particular the practice of " blaming the victim " in rape cases which women 's advocates have long sought to end .
It also casts a shadow on Clinton 's reputation as a defender of children .
In May of 1975 , according to Newsday , Rodham was appointed to represent a hard - drinking factory worker named Thomas Alfred Taylor , accused of raping the 12 - year - old , and who had requested a female attorney in an effort to improve his chances with the jury .
Hillary Clinton mentions the case in her 2003 autobiography , Living History , writing that she initially balked at the assignment but eventually secured a lenient plea deal with conviction on a lesser charge for Taylor after a New York - based forensics expert she hired " cast doubt on the evidentiary value of semen and blood samples collected by the sheriff 's office . "
This account , however , leaves out a significant aspect of her defense strategy , which consisted of impugning the character and credibility of the victim , according to a Newsday examination of court and investigative files and interviews with witnesses , law enforcement officials , and the victim herself .
Rodham , records show , questioned the sixth grader 's honesty and claimed that she had made false accusations of sexual assault in the past .
She implied that the girl often fantasized about and sought out older men like Taylor , according to a July 1975 affidavit signed " Hillary D. Rodham . "
After requesting a psychiatric examination of the girl but without referring to any source of the allegations against her , Rodham wrote in her affadavit :
" I have been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing ....
I have also been informed that she has in the past made false accusations about persons , claiming they had attacked her body . "
Some would interpret this from a strictly legal perspective simply as the vigorous defense of her client required of Rodham as an attorney .
" She was vigorously advocating for her client ... , " Andrew Schepard of Hofstra Law School told Newsday , " ... What she did was appropriate .
He was lucky to have her as a lawyer . "
From the perspective of the young victim and her family , however , and from the perspective of women 's advocates who have long sought to end the practice of blaming the victim in rape cases , the view would look very different , as Schepard further suggests : " In terms of what 's good for the little girl ?
It would have been hell on the victim .
But that was n't Hillary 's problem . "
Owing to Rodham 's efforts , Taylor 's charges were finally reduced from first - degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14 , which carried a five - year sentence .
The prosecutor 's files on the case were reportedly destroyed in a flood more than a decade ago , leaving a scarcity of documentation for fully investigating the case , and there is no direct evidence to suggest that Rodham fabricated evidence or otherwise behaved improperly .
The victim's own statements clearly contradict Rodham's , however , as do those of case investigator Dale Gibson , who could not recall seeing evidence that the girl had fabricated previous attacks .
On Rodham 's aggressive handling of the case , her legal opponent , former Washington County prosecutor Mahlon Gibson , said simply : " She was just a real bulldog - a real bulldog . "
Since 1975 , the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton and that of her client 's twice - brutalized young victim have taken very different paths .
While Clinton went on to become the first lady both of Arkansas and of the United States , a U.S. Senator , and a presidential candidate , the victim went on to depression , attempted suicide , drug addiction , and jail .
She is currently living in a halfway house and looking for work .
The victim told Newsday that the incident continues to haunt her , compounding her bouts of depression and anxiety :
" I remember a lot of bad things about what he did to me in that pickup of his ....
I 've had a lot of counseling and saw a psychiatrist for five to ten years ....
It really affected me mentally .
I was always kind of scared to be alone with a guy afterwards . "
The reader must decide for him / herself whether Clinton 's actions in the case ought to be held against her .
Whatever legal justification one might cite in Clinton 's defense , however , it is worth recalling also that ending the practice of blaming the victim in rape cases has long been high on the list of priorities among women 's advocates .
Clinton 's willingness , and even apparent eagerness , to engage in this same practice by actively and extensively seeking to discredit the testimony of a 12 - year - old victim of sexual assault , seems fair to consider if one wishes to hold a presidential candidate to a higher standard than that of mere legal permissibility or expediency .
She could , after all , have refused to take such steps or refused to take the case at all , as others would even at the cost of their jobs .
Furthermore , the fact that Hillary D. Rodham 's statements contradict those both of the case investigator and of the victim herself suggest again that the case is a matter of presidential ethics worth considering .
At the very least , it raises the question of whether an anything - to - win , political " bulldog " is really what we want most in the White House right now .
When word broke in 2002 that the feds were picking out terror suspects based on what they ordered for dinner , most observers figured it was a glitch during the War on Terror 's beta test – a one - time overreach .
Turns out the strategy has been employed again .
" The FBI sifted through customer data collected by San Francisco - area grocery stores in 2005 and 2006 , hoping that sales records of Middle Eastern food would lead to Iranian terrorists , " CQ's Jeff Stein reports .
* The idea was that a spike in , say , falafel sales , combined with other data , would lead to Iranian secret agents in the south San Francisco - San Jose area .
* The brainchild of top FBI counterterrorism officials
Phil Mudd and Willie T. Hulon , according to well - informed sources , the project did n’t last long .
It was torpedoed by the head of the FBI ’s criminal investigations division , Michael A. Mason , who argued that putting somebody on a terrorist list for what they ate was ridiculous —
and possibly illegal .
But at least it 's refinement to the 2002 version of the technique .
Back then , federally - employed data - mining software labeled someone as a potential terrorist " if you were a person who frequently ordered pizza and paid with a credit card . "
Persian - American technology scribe Cyrus Farivar , for one , is not amused .
While women hold 51 percent of professional jobs in the United States , they make up only 26 percent of the IT work force , according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology .
Furthermore , fewer women worked in IT in 2008 than in 2000 .
But the loss of women in the technology field begins long before they reach the professional level .
The proportion of CS ( computer science ) bachelor 's degrees awarded to women has fallen from 36 to 21 percent between 1983 and 2006 .
Dr. Stephen Bloch , a professor in the Department of Math and Computer Science at Adelphi University in Garden City , New York , told eWEEK that computer science degree enrollments have been " in the toilet " since 2001 .
" They seemed to be edging back up in the last year or so , but when people stopped taking these majors , it seemed that the women stopped harder , " Block said .
In the fall of 2000 , Bloch taught a programming course that was a prerequisite for a computer science degree , for which enrollment was 40 percent women .
In the current academic year , there is only one female computer science major , he said .
" I encounter a good number of math majors .
There are a lot of women in that class , and they are doing well , which suggests that they may have been good at CS .
I 'm not sure at which point they 're being steered elsewhere , " Bloch said .
The answer to the question of at what point and why girls are losing interest in learning about computers plagues not only computer science professors , but also employers who wonder how they 'll find recruits when half of the population has opted out of the field .

... but it 's not my fucking fault .
Today I was waiting for a parking spot in the alley behind South Beach 's Lincoln Road .
This was not unusual .
While I was waiting , a woman who appeared to be in her mid-fifties collapsed , lacerating her head on a concrete parking control post on the way down .
This was not unusual eitherI average two random stranger 's deaths every year .
Let me repeat that , it sounds improbable .
I see an average of two people die every year .
Fortunately , they are all strangers , or the police might have to call me in for serious questioning Okay , I got out of my car , her friend was trying to giver her CPR , but incorrectly .
She was yelling her name and making out with her .
I stopped her from doing so , called for Emergency Response , and took over .
Long ago , my work kinda required I know the basics of life - saving .
She was breathing , but spasms wracked her body .
She spit up a lot of bubbly gurgle drool , so I was happy to not have to give mouth - to - mouth
By the time ER arrived , I had begun applying pressure to the gash on her head , but lost the pulse quckly .
With no other ideas handy , I started CPR , which was taken over by the paramedics .
I think she was dead when I was working on her , which was n't long .
They drove off in no rush .
I was late for my 10 A.M. appointment , but had a good excuse .
He has a cecurit camera in the back of the restaurant and the whole thing was caught in the corner of the alley delivery camera .
We rolled the tape back about si or seven times .
The client was n't upset , i was unphazed , and continued my day .
Does this sound callous ?
I have become innured .
One very drunk biker slammed into a moving car , whose passenger was racing to South Shore hospital to deliver a baby .
The dying man , whose back was visibly broken in half , tried speaking to me , but only managed to spit blood and die .
Years later , strangely enough , I met a girl who was leaving the bathroom in the Shell and saw the same accident .
We compared ntoes .
She also remembers a huge black guy pick up the crotch rocket and toss it aside .
She did n't remember me admonishing him not to move him .
Two other motorcycle accidents , one involving one of the Triumph brothers laying his Tiger down and getting his head rolled over by the tire of an 18 - wheeler .
The helmet did n't help .
His head popped like a pimple .
Blood smears thickly .
I have videotaped several deaths as a video newsman .
One time a man in Little Havana barricaded himself into his hosue with his wife and two children and was threatening to kill them all .
After the mandatory shots of the SWAT team surrounding the perimeter , i had the urge to roll tape on the front door .
After swapping tapes out , perhaps fifty minutes into the same shot of the door , the barechested man burst out the door , brandishing a machete and yelling obscenities and threats in Spanish .
When about two dozen police shot him at the same time , the sound was perhaps best described as one big boom .
I guess they all had about the same reaction time .
And so on , the list grows .
One day , I interviewed a local businessman , cut the piece , aired it , and a few days later was covering a new story ; businessman found stuffed in the trunk of his car , which was parked at the aiport and starting to smell .
The dead I immortalized on tape in Afghanistan I could n't count .
They found a bloated corpse in the canal , about fifty feet from my property line five years ago .
I was there but not rolling tape at the Atlanta olympics when the bomb went off .
I was off , just millin garound looking for pussy .
One time in Amsterdam , I found a corpse .
Upon further inspectiion , hoever , it turned out to be a drunk .
Thank god , it would 've ruined my high . i

Yale University economist Robert Shiller , pioneer of Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller home - price index , said there 's a good chance housing prices will fall further than the 30 % drop in the historic depression of the 1930s .
Home prices nationwide already have dropped 15 % since their peak in 2006 , he said .
" I think there is a scenario that they could be down substantially more , " Mr. Shiller said during a speech at the New Haven Lawn Club .

Like everyone else , I search the web from the browser address bar and have set Google as the default search engine in both Firefox and IE .
I also use OpenDNS for reasons explained here - Why You Need OpenDNS ?
Sounds like a perfect combination but a side effect of using OpenDNS is that you can no longer search Google from Firefox location bar or the address bar of Internet Explorer .
That ’s because all search requests from the browser address bar , originally meant for Google , are always redirected to OpenDNS Guide .
This can be a bit frustrating for Google users because Yahoo ! ( that feeds OpenDNS search ) is definitely not the best search engine around .
If you like to disable OpenDNS Guide search without removing the OpenDNS DNS entries from your computer or router , just follow these simple steps :
Use Google Search with OpenDNS in Firefox Location Bar
Type about : config in the address bar and press enter .
If you are on Firefox 3 , click “ I ’ll be careful , I promise ! “ .
Now type keyword.url in the Filter field and set the value as :
http://www.google.com/search?q=
If you want Firefox to do a “ I am Feeling Lucky ” style Google search , use this value for keyword .
URL :
http://www.google.com/search?btnI=I%27m+Feeling+Lucky&q=
Also make sure that the value of keyword .
enabled is set to TRUE .
That ’s it - now any query you type in the Firefox Address bar will go to Google , not OpenDNS guide .

Open the registry editor ( Start -> Run -> regedit ) and navigate to the following key in the registry :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
\ Software \ Microsoft \ Internet Explorer \ SearchScopes
If Windows Live Search is your default search engine in Internet Explorer 7 , open { 0633EE93-D776-472f-A0 FF-E1416B8B2E3A} and set the value of URL as
http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q={searchTerms}
In case of Google , open the corresponding key and set the value of URL as
http://www.google.com/search?q={searchTerms}
Technicals : I think OpenDNS redirects Google Searches to OpenDNS Guide if the “ source ” parameter is present in the search URL .
Remove that from the address and OpenDNS would stop redirecting Google searches .
An alternative could be OpenDNS Shortcuts but the above modification are required when you have a dynamic IP address and are not logged into the OpenDNS system .

So far , still so good .
The secret of public opinion is that it does n’t change .
We ’re locked into our beliefs , and especially so when it comes to the presidency and Donald Trump .
No better example of that than the pandemic : 200,000 people are dead , and it cost Trump a measly net three points in his approval ratings .
It is frustrating to see Trump avoid greater consequences for his rank incompetence , but on the other hand , it makes coming back from his deep electoral deficits incredibly difficult , and this week , just like every other week since this summer , Trump is lagging far behind Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the race for the White House .
Before we take a look at the latest polling composites , it ’s important to understand that Trump is no longer trying to win this election .
He ’s not trying to appeal to the disaffected college - educated suburban white women who voted for him in 2016 , but migrated en masse to the Democrats in 2018 ( when Democrats won 38 suburban House seats , out of their total 41 - seat pickup ) .
No , he ’s not trying to win the election , he ’s trying to stay in power .
He ’s not even hiding his goal anymore .
So keep that in mind every time he opens his mouth .
Nothing he does is geared toward winning a majority of the vote .
Rather , it ’s all geared toward sowing doubt , division , inviting foreign meddling , and installing a friendly judiciary that will allow him to steal the election .
The quicker everyone understands this , including the media , the better we ’ll be able to handle this serious threat to our democracy — a democracy that is far more fragile than we could ’ve ever believed .
The invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a tragedy - for Iraq , for the US , for the UN , for truth and human dignity .
I can only see one gain : the end of Saddam Hussein , a murderous tyrant .
Had the war not finished him he would , in all likelihood , have become another Gadafy or Castro ; an oppressor of his own people but no longer a threat to the world .
Iraq was on its knees after a decade of sanctions .
The elimination of weapons of mass destruction was the declared main aim of the war .
It is improbable that the governments of the alliance could have sold the war to their parliaments on any other grounds .
That they believed in the weapons ' existence in the autumn of 2002 is understandable .
Why had the Iraqis stopped UN inspectors during the 90s if they had nothing to hide ?
Responsibility for the war must rest , though , on what those launching it knew by March 2003 .
By then , Unmovic inspectors had carried out some 700 inspections at 500 sites without finding prohibited weapons .
The contract that George Bush held up before Congress to show that Iraq was purchasing uranium oxide was proved to be a forgery .
The allied powers were on thin ice , but they preferred to replace question marks with exclamation marks .
They could not succeed in eliminating WMDs because they did not exist .
Nor could they succeed in the declared aim to eliminate al - Qaida operators , because they were not in Iraq .
They came later , attracted by the occupants .
A third declared aim was to bring democracy to Iraq , hopefully becoming an example for the region .
Let us hope for the future ; but five years of occupation has clearly brought more anarchy than democracy .
Increased safety for Israel might have been an undeclared US aim .
If so , it is hard to see that anything was gained by a war which has strengthened Iran .
There are other troubling legacies of the Iraq war .
It is a setback in the world 's efforts to develop legal restraints on the use of armed force between states .
In 1945 the US helped to write into the UN charter a prohibition of the use of armed force against states .
Exceptions were made only for self - defence against armed attacks and for armed force authorised by the security council .
In 2003 , Iraq was not a real or imminent threat to anybody .
Instead , the invasion reflects a claim made in the 2002 US national security strategy that the charter was too restrictive , and that the US was ready to use armed force to meet threats that were uncertain as to time and place - a doctrine of preventive war .
In the 2004 presidential election campaign , Bush ridiculed any idea that the US would need to ask for a " permission slip " before taking military action against a " growing threat " .
True , the 2003 Iraq invasion is not the only case in which armed force has been used in disregard of the charter .
However , from the most powerful member of the UN it is a dangerous signal .
If preventive war is accepted for one , it is accepted for all .
One fear is that the UN rules ignored in the attack on Iraq will prove similarly insignificant in the case of Iran .
But it may be that the spectacular failure of ensuring disarmament by force , and of introducing democracy by occupation , will work in favour of a greater use of diplomacy and " soft power " .
Justified concerns about North Korea and Iran have led the US , as well as China , Russia and European states , to examine what economic and other non-military inducements they may use to ensure that these two states do not procure nuclear weapons .
Washington and Moscow must begin nuclear disarmament .
So long as these nuclear states maintain that these weapons are indispensable to their security , it is not surprising that others may think they are useful .
What , really , is the alternative : invasion and occupation , as in Iraq ?

Nanotechnology and immortality - ... really ?
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
How much money would you pay to live forever ?
$ 100 ?
$ 1,000 ? $ 100,000,000,000 ?
Keeping in mind that forever is a long time ; you could certainly arrange some kind of longterm loan , since youd have plenty of time to make the payments .
Historically , only religions have the lock on immortality .
Thus guided by divine inspiration and a codicil transcribed directly from God , most religions profess the rebirth of consciousness after the body is disposed of .
Well , guess what ?
There are some nanotechnologists who claim that in a few decades , death will be a choice rather than a requirement .
Lets see how we can come to this rather heretical conclusion .
Intel is already manufacturing devices with feature sizes about 20 nanometers across .
A red blood cell is on the order of 10,000 nanometers across .
In 2 dimensions we could stack about 250,000 components in the same space as a red blood cell .
If the trends continue as far as 2017 , which may be the end - point of Moores Law we could be looking at a manufactured device the size of a red blood cell with 256,000,000 components .
If we add the third dimension , that could translate into 65,536,000,000,000,000 components .
Somewhere along the way , were talking about the raw technical capability to produce a rather sophisticated robot small enough to wander around through your body doing whatever it has been programmed to do .
If we make the robot 1/10,000th the volume of a red blood cell , were still talking about 655,360,000 components , which is arguably perhaps enough to embody this machine with the ability to think , move , and do whatever we have programmed it to do .
If such a device can be built , if we have the slightest clue how to make it do things , we could , in principle , program it to go inside any cell in your body and reverse all the causes of aging simply by rebuilding the cell to a younger version of itself .
If we do that to every cell in your body , and keep doing this on a regular basis , you could live forever , provided you drive safely , stay out of the sights of Al - Qaeda , and dont live in an earthquake or flood zone .
The real question is , how practical is this speculation ?
Well , that s the true life or death question .
Those who believe in Moores Law point out that it has been an accurate predictor of relevant technology for almost 40 years .
It only has to hold up another decade or so before the raw technology is available .
On the other hand , there are a few items missing from having raw capability and having the actual machine :
1 . We dont know how to build an autonomous robot of any real complexity .
Our best technology today can create a robot that will vacuum your rug rather poorly , sometimes .
2 . We dont know how to write software that would manage an autonomous robot , even if we could build it .
3 . If we had the robot , and knew how to program it , we dont know enough about biology to tell the robot what to do once it gets there .
4 . Even if we can manufacture components at the size required , we dont know how to deliver power to the robot ( although nanopiezotronics might be a solution ) , nor do we have any idea how to control its motion , or its actions once it gets to its place of work .
The proponents of nanotechnology say , dont worry , technology is evolving on a logarithmic scale so these issues will be solved with unprecedented speed .
Many different technology progress curves demonstrate how things are happening at an ever - faster pace .

One thing to keep in mind , when speculating about the future , is to keep a close eye on which trends you are using to do your forecast .
Im not suggesting that any particular trend is a good or bad forecast of things to come , but there are a few examples I like to keep in mind before preparing my investment portfolio for the really long haul .
First , technology forecasts do not routinely come true .
A 1965 study of the speed of human travel showed that between 1800 and 1963 , humans were traveling faster and faster on a logarithmic curve , and if this trend continued , humans would be traveling just under the speed of light sometime towards the end of the 20th century .
I guess we missed that curve .
Second , in the 1980s , I lugged around a Kapro portable computer that used Wordstar for a word processor .
I remember that it took about 1 minute to boot up this ancient application to the point where I could type my first word of wisdom .
I wonder , with all the proven technology advances of the last quarter century , why does it still take about 1 minute to boot up my current laptop and word processor to the point where I can type my first word of wisdom ?

The Hallmark / Westland Meat Packing
Co announced on Sunday it wanted back nearly 143 million pounds ( 65 million kilograms ) of meat -- enough to feed more than 2.2 million Americans for a year -- that it had shipped out since February 2006 .
But the wrongdoings at the plant were not exposed under the watchful eye of inspectors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Instead , the Humane Society of the United States captured employees in a gruesome , undercover videotape that was made after an apparent random decision to investigate the plant located in Chino , California .
While the recall was a record and dwarfs all previous orders by the department , the USDA said most of the meat has probably been consumed and that the risk to the public was minimal .
USDA has estimated at least 37 million lbs of the meat were bought for school lunches and other federal nutrition programs .
But the USDA now faces growing calls for a better system since the violations of using sick or “ downer ” cattle occurred under the noses of the department ’s inspectors .
“ I know USDA is doing a really good job downplaying what happened here , ” said Caroline Smith DeWall , a director of food safety at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest .
“ This is n’t a little thing .
This was a fundamental failure of their inspection program . ”
DeWall and a number of experts worry the California case was not an isolated incident in the 6,000 federally inspected U.S. plants , involving some 7,800 inspectors .
“ It really demonstrates how our food safety inspection system has collapsed , ” U.S. House of Representative Rosa DeLauro , and Chairwoman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee , said on a teleconference call .
Bob Stallman , president of the American Farm Bureau , the nation ’s largest farm group , said the meat recall should only be the first step as the USDA works to ensure that safeguards are followed to protect the food supply .
“ This situation is not acceptable and should not be tolerated at any facility processing beef for human consumption , ” said Stallman .
VIDEO UPROAR
USDA maintains the U.S. still enjoys one of the safest food systems in the world and the recall was made because of a violation of the rules , rather than an immediate health risk .
“ Our FSIS inspectors are present , not only daily in this plant , but continuously as they are at all beef slaughter facilities , to assure among other things that ... specified risk materials are removed in compliance with our regulations , ” Agriculture Undersecretary Richard Raymond told reporters shortly before announcing the recall .
Hallmark / Westland has been closed since early February .
Since the video was released , USDA has put a “ hold ” on all of its products and suspended the company indefinitely as a supplier to federal nutrition programs .
Beef is America ’s top choice for protein and the country consumed some 28.1 billion lbs worth of beef in 2007 .
But confidence in the industry has been shaken at home and worldwide .
The world shut its doors to U.S. beef when the country discovered its first case of mad cow in 2003 .
And last year , there was a sharp rise in meat recalls in the United States involving a deadly strain of E. Coli .
The Humane Society of the United States sparked an uproar over the meatpacking plant when it released the lurid videotape showing plant workers were gouging , kicking and forcing water into the noses of cattle in order to get the animals upright .
Only cattle that can stand are considered fit to be inspected , a rule considered especially critical in preventing processing of cows infected with mad cow disease .
Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle said he has long been concerned that the use of downer cattle was a widespread industry practice and now is more worried after the group found such abuse despite picking the California plant at random .
“ If this was our first deep dive into a cattle slaughter plant and we found these gross abuses , then it would be highly unlikely that we would not find similar abuses at some of the of the plants , ” Pacelle told Reuters .
Pacelle said tough measures are needed to overhaul the inspections system , including closing a loophole that allows the use of some downer cattle and he urged Congress to pass already proposed legislation to cement the policy .
He said the next step will be to revamp the inspection process .
“ We need more boots on the ground in the handling and pre-slaughter areas of the plant .
We need a more unpredictable presence , rather than showing up at standard times so the plant personnel know exactly when they are coming . ”
Some critics contend inspections should be handed to another agency as the USDA has a conflict of interest as it is also a promoter of agriculture products .
And the USDA might be increasingly busy shoring up confidence in the sector .
“ I think it was meant to be a shock to industry , a wake - up call that says ‘ hey there is apparent abuse of animals in the slaughter operations and this has to be addressed and fixed , ” said Michael Doyle , Director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia .
From an anonymous source close to the company , I ’ve found myself in possession of the “ Infocom Drive ” — a complete backup of Infocom ’s shared network drive from 1989 .
This is one of the most amazing archives I ’ve ever seen , a treasure chest documenting the rise and fall of the legendary interactive fiction game company .
Among the assets included : design documents , email archives , employee phone numbers , sales figures , internal meeting notes , corporate newsletters , and the source code and game files for every released and unreleased game Infocom made .
For obvious reasons , I ca n’t share the whole Infocom Drive .
But I have to share some of the best parts .
It ’s just too good .
So let ’s start with the most notorious —
Milliways : The Restaurant at the End of the Universe , the unreleased sequel to Infocom ’s The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy .
For the first time , here ’s the full story : with never - before - seen design documents , internal emails , and two playable prototypes .
Sit back , this might take a while .
Note : I ’ve pieced together this history from emails and notes from the Infocom Drive .
I have n’t contacted any of the people mentioned , so if you ’re a primary source or authority , please get in touch so I can make corrections .
Update : Do n’t miss the comments section .
Infocom alumni Dave Lebling , Steve Meretzky , Amy Briggs , and Tim Anderson all comment on the story , Zork co-author Marc Blank helps correct an error , and writer Michael Bywater provides an alternative view of the events .
November 26 , 2009 :
After much consideration , I ’ve edited this entry to remove the private correspondence that I never sought permission to publish .
In my eagerness to share the story , I rushed to post instead of taking the time to reach out to everyone involved , against the recommendations of my source .
At the time , I felt that 20 years of distance and the material ’s historical value was enough to warrant bringing it to light without contacting each individual .
I was wrong , and I ’d like to apologize to each of the Infocom employees for my lapse in judgment .
On these pages , I ’ve frequently waded into murky legal waters and I ’m used to catching a certain amount of heat .
But this article cost me far more than I ever anticipated — I lost a very close friend because of it .
I deeply regret the error . —

Backstory

Douglas Adams ( left ) and Steve Meretzky in a promotional photo from 1984 .
Written and designed by two legends in their respective fields , game designer Steve Meretzky and sci- fi author Douglas Adams , the first Hitchhiker ’s Guide game was a tremendous success upon its release in November 1984 .
It quickly became Infocom ’s bestselling game , selling over a quarter million copies in the two years after its release .
( It ultimately became Infocom ’s second - biggest seller of all time under Zork . )
Even before they ’d finished writing the Hitchhiker ’s game , Meretzky and Adams were considering two sequels based on the second and third books of the trilogy .
In an email to Meretzky , Douglas Adams wrote down some notes from a design meeting , including a list of “ some rooms we discussed ( some might be kept for future games , which would be blatantly advertised at every opportunity ) . ”
The first three places on the list , “ Milliways ( need reservation to get in ) , Norway , Krikkit ( placed off limits for protection of the galaxy , until you buy Game # 3 ) . ”
A sequel seemed like such a sure thing , they mentioned it in the game ’s ending .
In the final scene , the Heart of Gold sets down on Magrathea and you exit the ship .
“ Slowly , nervously , you step downwards , the cold thin air rasping in your lungs .
You set one single foot on the ancient dust — and almost instantly the most incredible adventure starts which you ’ll have to buy the next game to find out about . ”
But shortly after Hitchhiker ’s was released , Douglas Adams proposed making Bureaucracy instead , a game inspired by his real - life experience dealing with government red tape after an address change .
He proposed the idea to Infocom in late 1984 and Infocom agreed .
But by May 1985 , it seems like Adams lost interest .
With Adams busy working on Dirk Gently and other book - related projects , Bureaucracy languished .
In his absence , Adams suggested a friend for the job , British writer Michael Bywater .
Three years later and with no less than 10 co-authors , the game was finally released , crediting “ Douglas Adams and the Staff of Infocom ” on the cover .
( The convoluted story of its development was detailed in an Easter egg in the final release of the game . )
Without Douglas Adams on board , the future of a Hitchhiker ’s sequel was in limbo .
Developing Milliways
Three huge problems plagued Milliways from its start in 1985 until it was shelved in 1989 : no solid game design , nobody to program it , and the backdrop of Infocom ’s larger economic problems .
Searching the Infocom Drive , the very first mention of a Hitchhiker ’s sequel is an email from Marc Blank to Stu Galley in May 1985 , about Bureaucracy potentially pushing back Hitchhiker ’s II in the production schedule .
Indeed , by July 1985 , Blank pushed back the Christmas 1986 deadline a full 18 months to June 1988 .
Michael Bywater , as seen on Michael Bywater , as seen on his blog
In 1987 , Michael Bywater was flown in from London to stay at a hotel near Infocom headquarters in Cambridge , MA to work on Restaurant at the End of the Universe full - time .
By July 1987 , internal emails show some employees were unhappy with the arrangement , feeling Bywater was n’t taking advantage of Infocom ’s resources and could be just as productive back in London .
Michael Bywater produced some preliminary design notes ( partly reproduced in The Story section below ) , but it seems nobody was happy with it .
In December 1987 , it was rumored that Bywater could work on the project for another month , after which someone at Infocom would need to take over the project .
But who ?
Within the first months of 1988 , other Imps were considered , but Plundered Hearts creator Amy Briggs was asked to helm the project .
In early February 1988 , while management searched for a project lead , Stu Galley was working on the Milliways skeleton file ( playable in the next section ) and Michael Bywater delivered a new outline .
But on February 24 , management dropped a bomb — development of Milliways would be moved to the other side of the Atlantic , coded by British game developers Magnetic Scrolls and designed by Michael Bywater .
Amy Briggs had declared her intention to leave the company and no suitable replacement could be found , so Infocom would not be involved closely in development .
The reaction was swift and angry from the original founders of Infocom , focusing on the loss of creative control and the potential message outsourcing such a critical property would send to industry .
But without any viable volunteers , Joel Berez , Infocom ’s president , had little choice .
Behind the scenes , Marc Blank started working on finding an alternative to Magnetic Scrolls .
He emailed Meretzky and Lebling on February 29 , fishing for a way to do it in - house , knowing that if either volunteered , the project could be saved .
The conversations that ensued inspired both Steve Meretzky and Dave Lebling , two of the best adventure game creators in history , to independently offer to take on Milliways , each with their own similar conditions .
Meretzky and Lebling wanted to finish their existing projects first ( Zork Zero and Shogun , respectively ) , both wanted to be considered collaborators and not just programmers , and they wanted complete outlines finished before they started .
A Hitchhiker ’s sequel created by Meretzky or Lebling would ’ve been amazing , but it did n’t get very far .
No other mention of their involvement is in the archives .
The door to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe was finally closed on May 5 , 1989 , when Activision ( renamed to Mediagenic , at the time ) closed the Cambridge office and laid off 15 of the remaining 26 Infocom employees .
Offering to relocate the rest to their offices in Menlo Park , only five accepted .
Infocom was dead .
The Story
What would have Milliways looked like if it had been released ?
Several design notes by Stu Galley and Michael Bywater give us an idea .
The first reference to the storyline is in a list of “ Ideas for Next Project ” from October 1986 created by Stu Galley .
MILLIWAYS or RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE
Takes up where “ Hitchhiker ’s ” left off .
Manufactured planets , Deep
Thought , white mice , time travel , 1001 verb tenses , digital watches , the Frogstar , Total Perspective Vortex , the End of History !
( Does Douglas really want to work on this at this time ?
Does it matter ? )
The plot changed significantly over the next three years , but Galley took a first pass in a set of design notes from February 13 , 1987 .
In it , he proposes how the game should start and end , and a couple critical scenes .
1 . It seems natural to include a scene in the restaurant , Milliways .
Could be a bit of fun : strange parties , unctuous compere , self - introducing food .
Perhaps there ’s an object there that you need to get .
( It could be a SPORK , a spoon with sort of forky tines on the end .
Or would that be a FOON ? )
It could be a vehicle from the car park — Marvin has the keys .
If you manage to re-enter Milliways at another time ( oops ! on another occasion ) , you will not meet yourself , “ because of the embarrassment that usually causes . ”
What about a visit to the Big Bang Burger Bar ?
2 . Given point 1 , you must have a means ( or several meanses ) of time travel .
In fact time travel instead of space travel could be the primary method of changing scene .
In the original , the party got to Milliways by accident : in the radio version , a “ hyperspatial field generator ” overheated ; in the book version , Zaphod ’s great - granddaddy screwed up the works of Eddie , the Heart of Gold computer .
Maybe your trip to Milliways would require info from an anti-piracy device in the game package .
Once at the restaurant , you can steal a timeship and go anywhen you want .
3 . Given point 2 , it seems natural for the “ best ending ” of the game to be your arrival on Earth before it ’s destroyed , which is the ending of both the first radio series and the second ( namesake ) book .
The original route to this ending was an accidental landing on Golgafrincham Ark B , with its cargo of telephone sanitizers , marketing consultants , etc. ( the ancestors of Earth ’s humans ! ) .
I rather like this bit , and hope we can work it into the game .
4 . Okay , so what about the beginning of the game ?
The easy answer : take up the story where the “ Hitchhiker ’s ” game left off , namely the arrival on Magrathea .
But in the original this arrival is followed by a travelogue of Magrathea and a flashback to the Deep Thought v. philosophers ’ union story ( including the introduction of the “ 42 ” joke ) and the joke about the true nature of mice .
All funny bits , but I have a hard time envisioning how they can be made into interesting interactive versions .
Perhaps you could time - travel to Deep Thought and interact with it yourself .
The Magrathean catalog of planets on Sens - O - Tape could be useful .
On February 17 , 1987 , Steve Meretzky provided this feedback on the design notes :
Some thoughts upon re-reading your notes :
The Infinite Improbability Drive acts as a time travel device , as well as a space travel device and an identity changing device .
The trips to the party ( as Trillian ) , to Damogran ( as Zaphod ) , and the Earth ( as Ford ) , all involve going back in time .
Therefore , the IID could be your time travel device , if you want to avoid the hassle of inventing a new one .
( It also provides some continuity with Game One . )
As I think I said before , I think it will work best if you forget about the original stuff , like the Deep Thought flashback , and come up with new stuff instead .
References to the original stuff can be used to provide familiarity for “ old - timers ” and to supplement the humor of the story line .
A month later , on March 13 , 1987 , Galley ’s second set of design notes outlined some innovative gameplay possibilities with third - person perspective , multiple viewpoints , text - based visual effects , and a parser with personality .
1 . Shall we try to present multiple viewpoints in this version of the story ?
In the original version (s ) , the group of travellers became separated while visiting Magrathea , and again later on , with the story following either Arthur ’s or Zaphod ’s viewpoint .
I have in mind a scheme to narrate the story in the third person , rather than the second , provided that the parser can handle declarative sentences , rather than ( or in addition to ) imperative ones .
Example : “ > ARTHUR SEARCHES FOR A GOOD CUP OF TEA .
He fails to find any , but he does turn up the spork that he thought he ’d lost . ”
2 . If there are multiple viewpoints , how does one change viewpoint ?
Provisional answer : with the “ verb ” MEANWHILE .
Example : “ > MEANWHILE , ON THE HEART OF GOLD .
Zaphod is still trying to persuade the computer to unlock the sauna .
Ford is chatting up Trillian . ”
Now the story begins to sound more like traditional fiction , with an omniscient viewpoint .
What happens to the scene that one leaves when switching to a new viewpoint — does it go on by itself ?
Answer : perhaps it does n’t matter .
If one returns to the old scene to find that time has passed , one can use time travel to return to the scene as it was left .
3 . And now for something completely different .
I ’ve been experimenting with textual “ visual effects ” , along the lines of the Boysenberry computer display in Bureaucracy .
These effects depend on the ability ( available only in Interactive Fiction Plus ) to put any character on the screen at any place .
One effect I ’ve tried out makes the characters in a message appear in an area of the screen , seemingly at random , until in the end the message is completely spelled out and readable .
Another effect “ moves ” a word up one line at a time , so that it appears to “ float ” to the top of the screen .
( Since the program ca n’t tell what the word has overwritten , the word leaves a trail behind it . )
I do n’t know yet whether visual effects will prove useful or even interesting .
4 . I ’ve been talking with Tim Anderson about using the New Parser in this game .
It still needs a lot of development , and in the end it may prove to be slow in operating , but it promises to be very capable .
Now here ’s the question : should the game itself make a big deal out of the New Parser ?
For example , the game could begin with the parser introducing itself to the player , asking the player to type a few sentences to “ warm up ” the parser , before getting on with the story itself .
The parser could take on a personality , explaining that this is its first job , that it means well but it may not succeed .
Perhaps it gets depressed and refuses to work at all .
Perhaps the parser is in fact Marvin ’s new aural interface module , depressing him even further .
While Galley was thinking about the game ’s design , Michael Bywater was making his own design notes independently .
The authorship is n’t completely clear , but I believe this very rough outline for the plot was created by Bywater on July 23 , 1987 .
The game has a three - part structure .
You begin at the base of the ramp leading from the Heart of Gold ; that is , where HH1 ended .
As you look forward to exploring this apparently acceptable planet with your faithful companion Marvin and your friends Trillian , Zaphod and Ford , you realize that you are alone .
You turn round to find that Marvin has gone back inside the ship .
The others are nowhere to be seen .
PUZZLE 1 is to persuade Marvin to come out of the Heart of Gold and help you .
WARNING : this is a nasty trick puzzle because if you solve it , you lose the game ( although there is a safety - net ) .
Marvin is enticed from the ship by means of an hallucinogenic psychodysleptic .
Somewhere close by the H of G you find a broken radio ( “ a miserable - looking piece of technology ” is the clue ) .
Elsewhere , you find a plant .
The plant , once picked , begins to deliquesce .
You have to put the plant in the radio , whereupon the radio bursts into cheerful music .
The plant appears to have lifted its spirits , if such a thing was possible .
Marvin will come out of the spaceship to get the plant and immediately go into a state of intoxicated euphoria , whereupon he will fuck off and not be seen again .
( Not until the parking lot at Milliways , anyway ) .
You score points for this solution , but it is the wrong one .
In fact , the winning score is 470 out of 490 ; if you get ALL the points , you lose .
The right solution is to TELL Marvin about the plant but not to GIVE it to him ; he will follow you fairly faithfully if you have the plant in the radio for the first few plays of the game .
After a while the radio begins to drive you mad .
Shortly after this , you will be given the opportunity to find the thing your Aunt gave you ; you can use this to store the plant .
If you do n’t , the inanities of the radio will drive you insane .
You need to keep Marvin with you until you have encountered Slartibartfast ’s vehicle , but first you have another problem .
While you are fooling around on Magrathea , Zaphod gets fed up and disappears in the Heart of Gold to go somewhere really fashionable .
If you still have the radio ( i.e. , have n’t gone prematurely insane ) you will hear an announcement to the effect that Milliways is the most fashionable place in the Universe .
Consulting the Guide about Milliways reveals the details .
Now you have to get to the restaurant .
You will need Marvin to get you there unless you are very , very lucky .
Once you get to Milliways , you have a problem : they wo n’t let you in .
You are n’t fashionable enough .
There are two solutions to this problem .
If you fucked up puzzle 1 , Marvin will turn up dressed as a parking attendant .
You can borrow his clothes and go in as a high - fashion crypto-punk .
If you did n’t get Marvin smashed on the plant , you can send him in instead , because his pose of fashionable paranoia is regarded as chic by the doorman .
Once in the restaurant , you have to get a response for the dead pop singer to find out where his ship is .
There then follows a parking puzzle with Marvin , and you gain access to the ship .
The roles of the other characters ( Zaphod et al ) are not clear here .
We may leave them somewhere .
The ship is intercepted and you solve a navigation puzzle to return to Magrathea , where you are snaffled by Slartibartfast .
The next major section of the game now takes place , here on Magrathea , and consists of three nested layers of puzzles .
The first level of puzzles are standard adventure stuff , but the objective is to assemble a time machine .
Slartibartfast has told you of the great history of Magrathea as the Universal Planetary Design workshop , and says he can show you how it all worked but the machine is broken .
It is necessary for you to fix the machine , which you do by pottering about the geography of Magrathea .
Next , once the machine is working , you have to get into it WITHOUT Slartibartfast but WITH Marvin .
If you get in with S. alone , all he ’ll show you is Magrathea , boasting about his fjords etc .
If however you get there with Marvin alone , Marvin will be so depressed that he ’ll try and depress you too , which he does by taking you back to Earth .
However … the machine only works from the point of view of Slartibartfast , so that ’s in effect who you become .
You observe a small flaw in one of the Norwegian fjords – a design change carried out without your ( Slartibartfast ’s ) authority which is responsible for all the awful things which have happened since .
Returning to reality , your job is to arrange for the rebuilding of Earth .
You are allowed into Slartibartfast ’s workshop and you have to give him a huge philosophical puzzle to work on .
This , like all the other puzzles in this penultimate part of the game , works on two elvels : it solves itself and allows you to proceed , but it also forms one element of the final endgame puzzle .
The endgame itself consists of a number of elements which are solved by assembling the consequences of solving eight other puzzles within the planetary workshop .
To solve these puzzles you have to travel in space around the workshop visiting various locations which turn out to be planets , all of which are in the solar system and all of which are subtly wrong ( Saturn has no rings , etc ) .
To do this , you have a Solar System Bug - tester ’s report as part of the packaging .
When you have solved these eight puzzles , you effectively ( eight planets plus Slartibartfast ’s “ Sun ” puzzle ) have all the solar system except Earth , and can then tie all the pieces together to make the adjustment to the fjords .
( What we do about THAT , I do n’t know .
There are an infinite number of possibilities ) .
The FINAL part of the endgame is to propel this new Solar system into its correct galactic location .
This is a complex puzzle and to solve it you have to be on the Heart of Gold at the time the Solar System settles into position .
At that point the Inifinite Improbability Drive detects that something infinitely improbable has happened and ejects you onto Earth , ready to begin the final part of the trilogy .
Michael Bywater took a final pass at the plot on August 7 , 1987 , but only gets a description of the first scene before it ends in mid-sentence :
These notes should be read in conjunction with the earlier synopsis in H2 … no , they should n’t .
To hell with the earlier synopsis .
What a cartload of pinwheel horse - shit .
Screw the earlier synopsis altogether .
Okay ?
Okay .
We begin on Magrathea , on the ramp outside the Heart of Gold , which is where H1 ended .
You are Arthur Dent — for the time being .
The surface of the planet is cold and inhospitable .
The others – Ford , Zaphod and Trillian – have wisely decided to stay aboard ship , in the sauna .
You , unwisely but predictably , have forgotten your dressing gown .
This poses a bit of a problem to you .
Quite a lot of a problem , actually , since you are going to die .
You are probably going to die anyway , before the cold gets to you .
Irrational , I know , but that ’s the Galaxy for you : cold , aloof , impersonal and always ready to crap on an organism for no good reason .
The first puzzle is a fairly straightforward , linear , closed - boundary job : to get someone to open the hatch to the Heart of Gold before you die of cold .
On Magrathea is a crater left by the impact of the whale .
( You do n’t remember the whale ?
Then you ’ll be even more confused by the petunias … )
On the edge of the crater is the remains of a intergalactic ghetto blaster left by a touring member of the Arqublustian Space Force , a group of deep - space thugs whose mission is to tour the galaxy playing loud music .
In the crater itself , among the other whale bones , is a whale bone .
Except it is n’t : it ’s the Thing your aunt gave you which you do n’t know what it is … and inside it is a Barry Manilow CD .
You play the CD and become deeply depressed and realize that only someone like Marvin could truly appreciate this stuff .
Trying to get back into the Heart of Gold , you find that everyone else , being in the sauna , cannot hear you , and Eddie is stupefied with gloom , being engaged in “ conversation ” with Marvin .
Marvin ’s conversational powers are capable of breaking down any electronic device in the known universe .
But Barry Manilow is even more potent .
You potter about the ship until you can hear , through the hull , Marvin droning on , then you play the Barry Manilow CD .
Marvin enjoys the “ music ” and frees Eddie to open the door .
Marvin comes to the hatch bearing your gown , which contains the Guide and a key - card to the ship .
Now you can survive the cold long enough to explore the whale crater .
You find not only the remains of the whale but the remains of the bowl of petunias .
When planted in the Thing , the petunias take on a strange quality : if you are holding a …
And that ’s where the design notes end .
Was this the first part of the final outline delivered by Michael Bywater in February 1988 ?
Hard to say , but it was definitely the most coherent .
I wish there was more .
Play It !
The project may have been shelved , but the Infocom Drive reveals two early Milliways builds , from May 1988 and another a year later in April 1989 .
Both are very similar , just simple stubs with sparse descriptions and a small handful of rooms .
These appear to have both been written by Stu Galley , but it ’s hard to say .
You start the prototype game as Arthur Dent , with Marvin , Ford Prefect , Zaphod Beeblebrox , and Trillian standing nearby .
It picks up where the last game ended , with our heroes standing “ on the ramp leading from the starship Heart of Gold to the surface of the legendary lost planet of Magrathea , which is n’t .
Lost , that is .
It is n’t lost because if it were , you would n’t be here , but you are , so it is n’t . ”
Unfortunately , it does n’t get much further than that .
Strangely , the first build seems a bit more polished , with more rooms and a better intro , in which Ford , Zaphod , and Trillian leave you alone with Marvin on the ramp .
There are a few rooms with sparse descriptions ( “ There will be an elevator there someday , but not yet ” ) , but not much to do .
Play Milliways ( Release 15 , Serial 880512 ) .
Java 5 required .
In the later build , you can go down the ramp onto the planet , poke the characters , or try to talk to them , but that ’s about it .
Unlike the first build , you do n’t have the Hitchhiker ’s Guide in your inventory and the surface of Magrathea has a large crater next to the ship .
Trying to go south - east to view it gives you an error , but in the source files , there ’s additional text which explains the crater was created by the sperm whale that materialized next to the Heart of Gold .
“ The dusty ground rises here before falling away into a crater .
The crater seems rather new , as if it had been created by the impact of something huge and confused , travelling downwards at high velocity .
It is as if a sperm whale had inexplicably materialized several miles above the surface of Magrathea and immediately plunged downwards , reaching terminal velocity almost immediately , terminal incomprehension soon afterwards , and , finally , terminal impact just as it was wondering whether it was going to have a nice day .
This impression is heightened by the shards of whalebone and meat you can see glistening here and there around the crater . ”
That ’s the longest description in the prototype , and a tiny glimpse at what might have been .
If you like , you can download the original Z - code files ( release 15 and release 184 ) , but you ’ll need an interpreter that supports Z - Machine version 4 and version 6 story files .
I ’d recommend Windows Frotz 2002 for Windows or Spatterlight for Mac .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Universal Music Group , the world ’s largest music company , has declined to sign a long - term deal with Apple Inc. ’s iTunes music store , leaving open the possibility for exclusive deals with other services , an industry source said on Sunday .

Universal will continue to sell music and videos of artists including 50 Cent , Mariah Carey and Black Eyed Peas via iTunes on a month - to - month basis , rather than be locked in to a two - year agreement Apple had proposed , the source said .
The music company , owned by French media giant Vivendi SA could now agree to offer significant portions of its repertoire exclusively to new partners , potentially weakening Apple ’s dominant hold on digital music retail .
Apple currently has more than 70 percent market share of all digital music sold in the United States .
It also sells the most popular digital media player , the iPod .
The two sides had extended a previous two - year agreement by 12 months last summer , and that deal expired last month , the source said .
In effect , Apple will now have similar terms to those that Universal already has with the majority of its retail partners .
Some music executives have privately expressed frustration that Apple ’s dominant position may have hampered growth of the fledgling digital music market by keeping users locked within the Apple system .
Those concerns were further highlighted with the launch of Apple ’s iPhone last weekend , which they believe may give Apple further control in the mobile phone - based digital music market .
Apple , which only sells digital music via iTunes , has now overtaken Amazon.com to become the third largest retailer of music in the U.S. behind Wal - Mart Stores and Best Buy Co. .
Universal , which produces one in three albums sold in the United States , has been leading the push by music companies to demand that new technology and media partners who want to license music share in the proceeds of the new products as well .
Last year Universal signed a deal with Microsoft Corp. to take a small share of sales of its digital media player , the Zune .
An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available .
WASHINGTON 
After its first secret session in a quarter - century , the House on Friday rejected retroactive immunity for the phone companies that took part in the National Security Agency ’s warrantless eavesdropping program after the Sept. 11 attacks , and it voted to place greater restrictions on the government ’s wiretapping powers .
The decision , by a largely party - line vote of 213 to 197 , is one of the few times when Democrats have been willing to buck up against the White House on a national security issue .
It also ensures that the months - long battle over the government ’s wiretapping powers will drag on for at least a few more weeks and possibly much longer .
With President Bush and Democratic leaders squaring off almost daily on the wiretapping question , neither side has shown much inclination to budge .
The question now moves to the Senate , where lawmakers passed a bill last month that was much more to the liking of the White House .
Unlike the bill approved Friday by the House , it would give legal immunity to the phone providers that helped in the National Security Agency ’s wiretapping program , which President Bush says is essential to protect national security .
The House bill approved Friday includes three key elements : it would refuse retroactive immunity to the phone companies , providing special authority instead for the courts to decide the liability issue ; it would add additional judicial restrictions on the government ’s wiretapping powers while plugging certain loopholes in foreign coverage ; and it would create a Congressional commission to investigate the N.S.A. program .
YuppTV is a revolutionary and pioneer in providing a no-holds - bar gateway for television viewers from across the globe .
With the power of technology and convenience of the internet , YuppTV has allowed consumers to view the latest Television Content Live anytime and anywhere .
The boundaries of the television viewing experience have been pushed so far that anyone can gain access to Live TV Channels , Catch - Up TV , and Unlimited Movies at their convenience .
YuppTV has made the availability of Indian TV Channels easier and cost effective all over the world .
Go figure : From the White House comes the news that self - styled anti-terrorism crusader George Bush wants to sell $ 20 billion in high - tech military equipment to Saudi Arabia , the source of most of the financing , and 15 of the 19 hijackers , for the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks on the United States .
The justification ca n’t be that this is yet another boondoggle for the military - industrial complex — the big winner in the war on terror — so we are told instead that the Sunni - dominated Saudi kingdom needs this weaponry to withstand a future challenge from those dastardly Shiite fellows in Iran .
Yes , the very same extremists whose surrogates are now , as a consequence of the U.S. invasion , pretending to be the indigenous government of Iraq .
Recall that the Shiite militants who rule Tehran , along with the Sunni nuts around Osama bin Laden , were both the sworn enemy of Saddam Hussein .
Now both of those forces are the main players , according to the Bush administration , vying for power in “ liberated ” Iraq , and our president is in the inane position of playing one group of fanatics against the other in the name of securing Iraq as a democratic haven .
White House officials told The New York Times that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates intend to use the occasion of their joint visit to Saudi Arabia “ to press the Saudis to do more to help Iraq ’s Shiite - dominated government . ”
Huh ?
Why in the world would the Sunnis , who control Saudi Arabia and are frightened to their bones of Shiites throughout the Gulf , be party to consolidating Shiite power in Iraq ?
To complete the circle of madness , White House officials tell reporters that the hope of the latest arms sale program is that the Saudis will be so thrilled with their new weapons that they will stop funding the Sunni insurgents who are currently killing Americans .
The absurdity of this position is that it makes the Saudis the big winners in the war on terror and yet expects them to cut out behavior that has played so effectively to the kingdom ’s advantage .
The nation which was most directly responsible for spawning the original al - Qaida attacks on the U.S. , and which has since helped finance the violence in Iraq , is now being rewarded with a long - sought weapons modernization package .
Thus , a new generation of deadly toys finds its way into the volatile Mideast .
Embarrassing facts undermining Bush ’s insistence that Iraq is the key battleground in the war on terror are that al - Qaida , which was not allowed a presence in Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , is now said by Bush to be behind the insurgency and that half of the foreign suicide bombers have been Saudi nationals .
Why would the Saudis now move to stem the flow of terrorists across their border when Bush is rewarding them so handsomely for their past support of terrorism ?
After all , this administration has never demanded an accounting from the Saudis for the kingdom ’s support of the Taliban government when it was coddling Saudi terrorist financer bin Laden .
Nor has Bush ’s camp ordered any serious examination of just how 15 Saudi “ soldiers ” were recruited , and provided with legitimate Saudi passports and American visas , to commit the mayhem for which the Iraqi people have been so severely punished .
While the $ 20 - billion weapons package will no doubt be supported vigorously by lobbyists for a defense industry that stands to make a financial killing from the deal , it is expected to meet opposition in Congress , particularly from those who fear the impact of this new weaponry on the security of Israel .
No problem — “ senior officials ” in the White House assured The New York Times that the Saudi arms package would be balanced with a $ 30.4 - billion military aid package for Israel .
Then , of course , some large amount of military “ aid , ” to the tune of $ 13 billion , will also have to be extended to Egypt to keep the dictator in Cairo on board .
What a deal !
The Saudis pony up billions in cash , American taxpayers come up with an amount more than twice as high to keep the Israelis and Egyptians happy , and U.S. war profiteers , Bush ’s most reliable core constituency group , make out like bandits .
Hey , it ’s only money , and the only real cost might be to folks who get caught in the line of fire of those weapons in wars to come for generations .
But not to worry , most of them do n’t vote in U.S. elections anyway .
Upon lawful request and for a thousand dollars , Comcast , one of the nation ’s leading telecommunications companies , will intercept its customers ’ communications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The cost for performing any FISA surveillance “ requiring deployment of an intercept device ” is $ 1,000.00 for the “ initial start - up fee ( including the first month of intercept service ) , ” according to a newly disclosed Comcast Handbook for Law Enforcement ( pdf ) .
Thereafter , the surveillance fee goes down to “ $ 750.00 per month for each subsequent month in which the original [ FISA ] order or any extensions of the original order are active . ”
With respect to surveillance policy , the Comcast manual hews closely to the letter of the law , as one would hope and expect .
“ If your [ FISA intercept ] request pertains to individuals outside the U.S. , please be sure you have complied with all the requirements in 50 U.S.C. sections 105A and / or 105B , ” the manual says , referring to provisions of the Protect America
Act that was enacted last month .
“ Requests such as these can not be honored after one year and must be dated prior to February 5 , 2008 , unless extended by Congress . ”
Comcast will also comply with disclosure demands presented in the form of National Security Letters .
However , the manual says , “ Attention must be paid to the various court proceedings in which the legal status of such requests is at issue . ”
In short , “ Comcast will assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations while protecting subscriber privacy as required by law and applicable privacy policies . ”
At the same time , “ Comcast reserves the right to respond or object to , or seek clarification of , any legal requests and treat legal requests for subscriber information in any manner consistent with applicable law . ”
A copy of the manual was obtained by Secrecy News .
See “ Comcast Cable Law Enforcement Handbook , ” September 2007 .
The role of telecommunications companies in intelligence surveillance is under increased scrutiny as the Bush Administration seeks to shield the companies from any liability associated with their cooperation in what may be illegal warrantless surveillance .
Also , there are new indications that the unauthorized warrantless surveillance program pre-dated 9/11 .
The Rocky Mountain News , the Washington Post , and others reported allegations that the government may have penalized Qwest Communications for refusing to participate in a pre-9/11 National Security Agency surveillance program that the company believed might be illegal .
The Washington Post editorialized yesterday that the telecommunications companies should indeed be immunized against liability , as the Bush Administration desires .
Even though it is not known exactly what the companies did , the Post said , they “ seem to us to have been acting as patriotic corporate citizens in a difficult and uncharted environment . ”
Writing in Salon.com , Glenn Greenwald disputed that view , arguing that patriotism lies in compliance with the law , not in mere obedience to executive authority .
Volcanic eruptions are historically a significant source of carbon dioxide Scientists have found new evidence that the Earth 's natural feedback mechanism regulated carbon dioxide levels for hundreds of thousands of years .
But they say humans are now emitting CO2 so fast that the planet 's natural balancing mechanism cannot keep up .
The researchers , writing in the journal Nature Geoscience , say their findings confirm a long - believed theory .
Carbon spewed out by volcanoes is removed from the air by rock weathering and transported to the ocean floor .
Using evidence from an Antarctic ice core , the team calculated that over a period of 610,000 years the long - term change in atmospheric CO2 concentration was just 22 parts per million ( ppm ) , although there were larger fluctuations associated with the transitions between glacial and interglacial conditions .
This suggests a natural thermostat which helps maintain climate stability
Richard Zeebe
By comparison , two centuries of human industry have raised levels by about 100 ppm - a speed of rise about 14,000 times faster .
" These long term cycles are way too slow to protect us from the effect of ( anthropogenic ) greenhouse gases , " said Richard Zeebe from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu .
" They will not help us with our current CO2 problem .
Right now , we have put the system entirely out of equilibrium . "
Deep level Scientists have long believed that the Earths climate was stabilised by a natural carbon thermostat .
In their model , carbon released into the atmosphere , primarily by volcanoes , is slowly removed through the weathering of mountains , washed downhill into oceans , and finally buried in deep sea sediments .
The researchers used data stored in the Epica ice core " A lot of people had tried to refute this hypothesis , but our study provides the first direct evidence ( that it is correct ) , " said Dr Zeebe .
He studied levels of CO2 recorded in air bubbles trapped in a 3 km ice core drilled from an Antarctic region called Dome Concordia ( Dome C ) .
Data from the ice core , drilled by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica ( Epica ) , was first published in 2005 .
But rather than focusing on the peaks and troughs of CO2 - as other researchers have done - this group looked at the long term trend , and compared the ice core data with records of carbonate saturation in the deep sea for the last six glacial cycles .
" It is remarkable how exact the balance is between the carbon input from volcanoes and the output from rock weathering , " said Dr Zeebe .
" This suggests a natural thermostat which helps maintain climate stability . "
The delicately balanced carbon thermostat has been a key factor in allowing liquid water , and life , to remain on Earth , he said .
" If it werent for these feedbacks , the Earth would look very different today . "

Woman 's Death on UN Lawn Leaves Questions Unanswered , Photos Unexplained Byline : Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press at the UN : News Analysis UNITED NATIONS , Feb. 17 , abridged Feb. 20 -- Following the discovery of the dead body of a woman in her 40s on the South Lawn behind the UN Headquarters on Sunday morning , what appeared to be attempts to downplay the incident occurred throughout the day .
Police tape which had surrounded where her body fell was taken down before the UN Security Council 's 1 p.m. meeting about Kosovo .
By early afternoon , the noticeable imprint on the lawn where she landed had been filled in with sand .
UN Deputy Spokesperson Marie Okabe was quoted that the UN would not be disclosing the identify of the deceased , even after her next of kin were notified .
Ms. Okabe issued a written statement that " a UN agency staff member died after falling from the 19th - floor of the UN Secretariat building . "
While the term " UN agency " would tend to mean one of the funds or programs of the UN system , such as the UN Development Program or UNICEF , both of these agencies have their offices across the street from the UN Headquarters , not beside the East River where the body was found .
An Inner City Press source who ventured to the 19th - floor found there rather dreary computer units entitled Systems Management Section and Service Co-ordination Section .
Two staffers , there on a Sunday , confirmed that the deceased was a co-worker , but referred all other questions to a man they called their boss , who declined comment .
A photograph which Inner City Press published , and has now excised , showed the body of the deceased with what appear to be bags taped over her hands .
Editorial note : on February 20 , after direct requests from two UN officials , and indirect communications from another at the Under Secretary General level -- and more importantly , after the news purpose of reporting that the decedent 's hands were covered in bags to preserve evidence has been served , Inner City Press removed the photograph from this page .
At the time this was breaking news , and to ensure that important information was not lost , the initial publication made sense , as does this subsequent removal and apology to any family member or friend of the deceased who may have sincerely been offended .
The USG at issue sought but did not receive from the UN Staff Union support to undermine freedom of the press , using a news judgment as a pretext to act against previous reporting .
On the evening of February 20 , UN Staff Union leadership told Inner City Press they had received a grand total of two complaints about the photograph : from the USG and one other professional UN official .
Despite this USG 's claims to people who never saw the photograph , it did not show the decedent 's face .
Significantly , this USG never sought to complain to or communicate directly with Inner City Press on this issue , but rather only to use it .
Nonetheless , this subsequent removal and apology to any family member or friend of the deceased who may have sincerely been offended .
An earlier photograph , in which her body is covered by a blanket , shows a hand , clenched into a fist , not bagged .
See , www.innercitypress.com/IMG_4457.JPG, and see below , similar to other photographs in the public domain : A police source consulted by Inner City Press noted that sometimes hands are bagged to preserve any evidence of a struggle .
When Inner City Press called the New York Police Department 's DCPI at 1 p.m. on Sunday , the response was that a 44 - year old white female was found at 8:09 a.m. , and " no criminality is suspected at this time . "
The UN 's statement , issued later , says that " at this time there is no suspicion of foul play . "
While by all accounts this lack of suspicious continues and will continues , it seems fair to ask not only about the bagging of the hands , shown in the photo , but also what time the deceased arrives at the UN , and how this is known .
There are public - record statements that she arrived early for work .
The UN has an electronic pass system , whereby staff members , correspondents and diplomats swipe in and the information is recorded .
As first reported by Inner City Press last April , in paragraph 27 of a little noticed resolution on the " security management system , " the General Assembly " decide[d ] that data related to representatives of Member States ... shall automatically be deleted from the standardized access control system after ... 24 hours . "
For anyone other than members of countries ' missions to the UN , they can keep the data as long as they want , and apparently use it for any purpose whatsoever .
But is it being used in this case ?
In fact , one close observer consulted by Inner City Press wondered out loud about the lack of public information about this staff member and death in the UN 's important computer unit .
While consciously seeking to remain with the bounds of good taste and decorousness , silence from the UN , including as projected even after next of kin is notified , should and will be contested .

WASHINGTON -- Red Sox Nation conquered the nation 's capital Wednesday as President Bush feted the 2007 World Series Champs in a White House celebration that turned the normally orderly Executive Mansion into a stampede of hero - worshipping Red Sox fans .
The seat of political power , usually unfazed by the proximity of famous personalities , was outright star - struck with the entourage of power hitters , pitchers and all - stars .
Members of Congress , media big- wigs and White House staff -- many with their kids and baseballs in tow -- craned their necks and jostled for a good spot to snap photos and seek out autographs .
" The Mighty Red Sox Nation has stormed the South Lawn , " Bush told the roaring crowd gathered in the afternoon chill but clearly more numbed by the prospect of glimpsing their favorite ballplayers up close .
" We appreciate very much members of the administration who are here -- do n't linger , " Bush quipped before welcoming an eminent group of members of Congress from New England who were clearly enjoying a break from conducting the people 's business and were n't bashful about pulling rank to get a good seat .
Sen . Patrick Leahy of Vermont , his camera in tow , pressed his way through a throng of reporters lined up in the West Wing driveway before the event to get to his front - row seat next to political luminaries such as Massachusetts Senators Ted Kennedy and John Kerry , Rep. William Delahunt of Quincy , and Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut .
The festivities even drew Vice President Dick Cheney , seldom seen at the same public event as Bush and who stood quietly off to the side as the president gave a humorous and folksy tribute to the Red Sox players , coaches and owners .
The World Series Champs , decked out in their Sunday best and accompanied by manager Terry Francona and rest of the coaching staff , were led out of the White House residence to the rhythms of a military band and as slugger David Ortiz carried the World Series trophy .
But the star of the show quickly became Bush , the former owner of the Texas Rangers and fan - in - chief who was clearly enjoying the opportunity to mingle with ballplayers after more substantive meetings earlier in the day with the prime minister of the Czech Republic and a special envoy from the Organization of the Islamic Conference :
Singling out ace hurler Daisuke Matzuzaka , Bush made reference to the large group of Japanese reporters who were on hand , joking , " His press corps is bigger than mine . "
He then noted another similarity he said he shares with " Dice K " : " We both have trouble answering questions in English . "
Throughout , Bush was effusive in his praise for the Red Sox franchise .
" I love the fact that you 've got some of the game 's biggest stars .
I mean , ' Big Papi , ' the guy lights up the screen , " Bush said of Ortiz .
" He brings a great personality . "

The pharmaceutical industry glimpsed its own ghost this week , and the apparition could not have arrived at a worse time for drug makers .
A report indicating that Merck used ghostwriters to produce medical journal articles in support of its subsequently discredited drug Vioxx has galvanized opponents to a federal proposal that would relax some restrictions on drug promotion .
The Food and Drug Administration has been considering a proposal to let drug makers use reprints of journal articles in promoting drugs for so - called off - label uses the F.D.A. itself has not approved .
A main proviso of the proposal is that the articles must have been published in peer - reviewed medical journals .
The Vioxx report , published Wednesday by a leading medical journal , JAMA , has , however , raised new questions about the validity of many published research studies , even in peer - reviewed publications .

Common viruses might contribute to lung cancer .
Could a virus in the lungs help to spur cancer ?
Getty
Researchers have found evidence that two common viruses may be lurking behind some cases of lung cancer : human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , already recognized as a cause of cervical cancer , and the measles virus .
The results , which will be presented today at the European Lung Cancer Conference in Geneva , Switzerland , are preliminary : while viruses have been found associated with lung tumours , there is no direct evidence that the viruses are actually causing the cancer .
But the notion that a virus could contribute to some cases of the disease is a plausible one , says Denise Galloway , a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington , who was not affiliated with the new studies .
As much as 20 % of the world ’s cancers have been linked to infections .
In addition to the connection between HPVs and cervical cancer , chronic infections by hepatitis - B and - C viruses contribute to liver cancer , and the bacterium Helicobacter pylori has been associated with stomach cancer .
In February , researchers reported viral genome sequences found in an aggressive form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma1 , although it remains to be seen precisely how the virus contributes to skin cancer , if at all .
And some have proposed that a virus similar to the ‘ mouse mammary tumor virus ’ — which causes breast cancer in mice — could also be associated with breast cancer in humans2 .
“ There ’s reason to believe that there are more tumours that have a viral origin , ” says Galloway .
“ I think there ’s growing interest in this field . ”
Determining whether there is an infectious cause of a cancer can have an effect on treatment and prevention strategies .
Widespread use of a vaccine against HPV , for example , has been proposed to lower rates of cervical cancer .
Though smoking is clearly still the main cause of lung cancer , identifying other contributors to the disease could help keep incidence down .
Virus hunters
Samuel Ariad of the Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva , Israel , and his colleagues began by analyzing tumours taken from 65 lung cancer patients .
They found evidence of measles virus proteins in about half of their samples .
The work provides the first hint that the measles virus may contribute to lung cancer , and follows on Ariad ’s previous studies showing a possible association between the measles virus and a cancer of the lymph tissue called Hodgkin ’s disease3 .
In addition , Arash Rezazadeh of the University of Louisville in Kentucky and his colleagues tested 23 lung cancer tumours for HPVs .
In five cases , the samples tested positive for the virus ’s DNA .
Others have previously shown a possible link between the virus and lung cancer , but , as in this case , have relied on small sample sizes .
The cancer connection
The studies leave a number of unanswered questions .
Ariad speculates that the measles virus may not be the root cause of lung cancer , but may somehow facilitate progression of the disease once it has already started .
But it is difficult to understand how the virus would achieve this and why it would act in the lungs , notes Galloway .
Nevertheless , the risk of lung cancer rises dramatically in patients whose immune systems are not functioning well : a hallmark that Galloway looks for when gauging whether a cancer may be caused by infectious agents .
Although overall cancer risk rises when the immune system fails , the link is stronger with some cancers — including skin , lung and cervical cancer .
The studies are preliminary , but warrant additional follow - up , says Dusty Miller , a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington .
“ The problem is that these are associations , ” he says .
“ And there ’s no way that you ’re going to put those viruses into people to test them . ”
Establishing a causal link between a virus and cancer — if there is one — can take decades .
But he also gave a substantial address to Catholic educators , many of whom have been struggling with shortages of money , changing missions and conflicts over whether Catholic schools are Catholic enough .
He spoke to about 200 college presidents and the superintendents of Catholic schools in the nation ’s 195 dioceses .
At a time when many dioceses are closing down schools for K - 12 students , Benedict emphasized the importance of keeping them open , especially to serve immigrants and the underprivileged .
He also used the occasion to clarify limits , saying that although academic freedom is valuable , it must not be used to “ justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church . ”
There have been sporadic controversies over what kinds of curriculum , outside speakers , campus clubs and artistic expressions are acceptable at Catholic colleges and universities .
The pope did not refer explicitly to those controversies .
But he addressed them indirectly when he said that church teachings must shape “ all aspects of an institution ’s life , both inside and outside the classroom . ”
The pope had additional healing work to do at his evening encounter with Muslim , Jewish , Buddhist , Hindu and Jain religious leaders .
On a previous trip , to his German homeland , Benedict had set off a paroxysm of anger with comments that appeared to denigrate Islam .
He has also offended Jewish leaders by reinstituting a prayer for the conversion of the Jews in the Latin prayers on Good Friday .
On Thursday , he offered an olive branch to Jewish leaders , and affirmed that all religions should have a common goal of working for peace .
And he spoke of the need to protect religious freedom , pointing out that religious minorities in some countries are subject to prejudice .
For years , victims of abuse in the United States had beseeched the Vatican for a meeting with the pope , first asking John Paul II , who died in 2005 , and finally , six years after the outbreak of the scandal , one was granted .
The scandal affected nearly every diocese in America , revealed more than 5,000 abusive priests and more than 13,000 victims and has cost the church more than $ 2 billion in settlements and legal fees .
It also has cost the church trust and respect , both of which the pope is clearly aimed at restoring .
But reaction from victims and their advocates varied , with some praising the meeting as an important step and others saying that still it was not enough .
Chris Wilson explains his research on the evolution of male mutilation at a recent research symposium .
Almost 25 percent of indigenous societies practice some form of male genital cutting , ranging from circumcision to the ritual removal of a testicle .
The reason , reports a Cornell scientist , may be to reduce pregnancies from extramarital sex .
More subtly , it could be to reduce conflict among men .
Chris Wilson , a doctoral candidate in Cornell 's Department of Neurobiology and Behavior , observes that cultures often express the reasons for what anthropologists call " male genital mutilation , " in terms that have immediate meaning , such as religion , tradition , hygiene or initiation into adulthood .
The new research suggests that these psychological rationales exist to serve a deeper evolutionary purpose in certain societies , even though men are not consciously aware of the complex evolutionary logic shaping their thoughts and behavior .
Writing in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior , Wilson says that because genital alteration is a painful and even risky procedure , especially under primitive conditions , it must have some evolutionary benefit or it would not have persisted .
Wilson hopes that the evolutionary explanation he offers for genital cutting will prove useful to anthropologists , doctors and policy - makers as they grapple with cultural , ethical and medical issues surrounding the ancient practice .
The evolutionary origin of circumcision may be of especially broad interest , as this particular operation is not only performed in 20 percent of indigenous societies , but on approximately one - third of all men worldwide .
In his research article , Wilson asks , " Why have 180 cultures all converged on this practice ? "
The different types of cutting suggest that several societies independently developed the practice before recorded history .
Wilson , who works with Paul Sherman , Cornell professor of neurobiology and behavior , says that genital cutting may limit extramarital sex .
In evolutionary terms , a man benefits from such affairs by passing his genes to a child who requires no further investment on his part .
" If natural selection has designed the genitals for fertilization , then changing that design will harm this function , " says Wilson .
" In particular , modifying the shape of the genitals makes it physically less likely that a man will impregnate a woman during an affair , and , therefore , the evolutionary incentive for adultery is smaller . "
He explains that the procedure therefore allows men within a society to trust each other more , because it reduces conflict over paternity and sexual indiscretion .
In the indigenous societies that practice genital cutting , Wilson suggests that the social benefits outweigh the costs , and so the custom persists .
His research found much higher rates of cutting in societies where men have multiple wives , especially when wives live far apart .
In these cultures , the opportunities for extramarital affairs are high because a husband can't keep a close eye on all of his wives at once .
Genital alteration acts as a physical signal of sexual honesty , reducing mistrust between the married and unmarried men .
After controlling for numbers of wives , Wilson also found lower rates of extramarital affairs in societies that practice male genital cutting , compared with those that do not , suggesting that it does indeed play a role in limiting adultery .
Finally , among societies practicing genital alteration , older men gave trust and benefits to younger men who underwent the procedure , supporting Wilson 's theory that the procedure improves trust and social status .

Robots Revealed !
There are robots hiding beneath the fluff .
I 've always been curious about stuffed animals that sing , dance , light up , or talk back .
There must be a fascinating robot underneath the fur and fluff , right ?
Surely the robot hiding in the bear 's clothing , in vestimentis ursum , is impressive .
So : armed with my childish curiousity and the spurious excuse of ' product design research , ' I set out to discover what , exactly , these creatures are hiding .

Thousands of Palestinians mounted a public protest against Israel 's blockade on Gaza yesterday but the turnout fell short of the 40,000 to 50,000 that organisers had hoped would form a 25 - mile human chain from north to south of the strip .
While ordinary Palestinians protested peacefully , militants launched several rockets at southern Israel , badly wounding a nine - year - old in the town of Sderot .
Jamal al - Khadary , of the People 's Committee Against the Siege , which organised the protest , said neither the low turnout nor the rockets marred their message to the international community .
" The important thing is to tell the world about what 's happening in Gaza , " he said .
The organisers were hoping to repeat Hamas 's success last month when it buoyed community spirit and drew international attention to the human effect of Israel 's isolation of Gaza by blasting open the wall on the border between the impoverished territory and Egypt .
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians streamed across to buy food , medicines , building materials and other items in short supply as a result of the blockade .
Israel feared a similar breach would occur yesterday and put its military on high alert , deploying extra troops and police officers around Gaza 's perimeter .
" Israel will work to avoid a deterioration of the situation but declares unequivocally that Hamas must assume full responsibility if that happens , " Israel 's foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , and its defence minister , Ehud Barak , said in a joint statement .
But yesterday 's protest in Gaza was largely peaceful except for a group of young Palestinians who broke away at the end and hurled stones at the Israeli army , who fired their guns into the air in retaliation .
The army detained 49 people .
Israel 's air force also killed three Hamas militants and wounded at least four in two strikes on Gaza early yesterday before the protest began .
Israel began its economic siege last June in an attempt to isolate Hamas after it took control of Gaza .
The militant Islamic group refuses to acknowledge the Jewish state 's right to exist .
Hamas and other militant groups have retaliated by launching rockets and mortar shells into Israeli suburbs .
The pressure of the blockade , which has plunged Gaza into poverty , has also caused anger among those who voted for Hamas in 2006 in the belief that it would clean up corruption and improve services .
Some analysts said yesterday 's protest was partially an attempt at rebuilding confidence among Gazans .
" In their election promises to the people , it was n't [ about ] jihad , it was about change and reform , meaning a better life , better services , more freedom of movement , " said Shalom Harrari at the Institute for Counter Terrorism in Herzliya .
" But on the contrary , life has become 100 % worse because of internal factional fighting and the closure of the borders . "
An International Crisis Group analyst , Nick Pelham , added that Hamas needed to " convince the population that their way was going to work " and as a result , it was " re-examining political and military options " for reopening Gaza .
Pacifist Cal State teacher gets job back CAL STATE EAST BAY
A Cal State East Bay math teacher and practicing Quaker who was fired for refusing to sign a state - required loyalty oath got her job back this week , with an apology from the university and a clarification that the oath does not require employees to take up arms in violation of their religious beliefs .
" It 's the best possible outcome , " said Marianne Kearney - Brown , 50 , a graduate student in mathematics who was teaching a remedial class for undergraduates .
" My concerns have been addressed . "
As a Quaker , Kearney - Brown is committed to nonviolence and was unwilling to sign the state oath of allegiance that required her to " swear ( or affirm ) " that she would " support and defend " the U.S. and California constitutions " against all enemies , foreign and domestic . "
She tried inserting the word " nonviolently " in front of the word " support , " but was told by university officials that altering the oath was unacceptable .
Kearney - Brown , a former high school math teacher , was fired Feb. 28 after six weeks on the job at the Hayward campus .
She filed a grievance with the help of her union , the United Auto Workers .
In a grievance hearing Thursday conducted in a telephone conference call , an attorney for the California State University chancellor 's office presented Kearney - Brown with a statement saying in part , " Signing the oath does not carry with it any obligation or requirement that public employees bear arms or otherwise engage in violence . "
With that statement stapled to the loyalty oath , and a promise by the university to present the clarifying language to other new employees , Kearney - Brown said Friday that she felt comfortable signing the form and returning to work .
" We 're very happy with the results , " said Clara Potes - Fellow , a spokeswoman for the CSU chancellor 's office .
" The university would very much like her to be an employee .
...
We were acting in good faith , and we wanted to resolve the situation in a positive way . "
A veteran public - school teacher , Kearney - Brown said she had signed the state oath when she took teaching jobs in Sonoma and Vallejo , and each time she had crossed out " swear , " circled " affirm " and inserted " nonviolently " before the word " support . "
But university lawyers would not permit her to tinker with the wording , and after she filed her grievance they consulted the state attorney general 's office for legal guidance .
The attorney general 's office issued a letter March 4 affirming that Cal State East Bay had acted appropriately .
But the agency also said that " the oath does not compel an employee to take any violent action and , in fact , requires an employee to work within the system of government to resolve problems and achieve change . "
In addition , the university 's statement Thursday cited a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision affirming that public employees need not violate their religious beliefs in their defense of the government and the Constitution .
Kearney - Brown said she initially tried to tell herself that signing the form was no big deal because it would just get stuffed in a file cabinet .
" But I thought , if I 'm going to sign it , I 'm going to take it seriously , " she said .
" All I was asking was , ' Does this oath require taking up arms ? '
If nonviolence is incompatible with this oath , I can't sign that .
...
It was a visceral thing . "
When university officials offered during Thursday 's telephone conference to reinstate Kearney - Brown with back pay , she burst into tears .
" I told them , ' I would like nothing more , ' but they could n't hear me , " she said .
" They asked , ' Do you have an answer ? '
I was nodding and crying .
My lawyer had to tell them yes . "
Alder Hey Hospital says parents often lie about smoking
Dr Steve Ryan , medical director of Liverpool 's Alder Hey Hospital , says bronchitis , asthma and ear infections could be cut if parents quit smoking .
He said parents often lied about whether they smoke near their children .
The British Lung Foundation says 17,000 under - fives are treated every year for exposure to second - hand smoke .
Speaking to BBC Radio Five Live , he said out of the 35,000 children the hospital treats every year , 2,000 are there because they have been exposed to their parents ' smoke .
He said between a quarter and a third of those suffering from certain conditions such as chest infections and asthma were the victims of passive smoking .
' High intensity '
Parents often know the health implications of smoking around their children , he added .
" People feel guilty , " he told BBC News .
" If it was easy , they would give up .
Looking after children is good fun but it can be stressful and for some , cigarettes are a way of relieving that stress . "
A good tip for parents is always put on another layer of clothes when smoking outside
Dr Steve Ryan
Medical Director , Alder Hey Hospital
He does not think legislation is the answer but believes parents should be aware of the various levels of risk .
The top level , he said , was parents smoking in cars , where children were " trapped " and exposed to a " high intensity " of fumes .
Mothers smoking is a greater risk than fathers smoking , and smoking in the same room as your child is also high risk , he added .
" Having smoke on your clothes is a lower risk , " he said .
" But a good tip for parents is always put on another layer of clothes when smoking outside .
Our staff are made to put a coat on when they go out to smoke during their breaks . "
Medical conditions
Amanda Sandford from smoking campaign group
Ash said an estimated half of all children are exposed to smoke in the home .
" It is clearly a widespread problem and I do n't think people realise that so many children are regularly breathing in smoke , " she said .
We need to publicise the fact that every cigarette you smoke is a cigarette that your child is smoking also
ENT surgeon Martin Birchall
" About a quarter of adults smoke and there are more among young adults , people between 25 - 34 , the age at which they are more likely to be parents with younger children . "
She added that now smoking was banned in enclosed public places , parents should treat their home like the workplace , and smoke outside .
Research published in 2005 suggested children exposed to their parents ' smoking were three times more likely to develop lung cancer later in life .
The government 's independent Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health concluded in 2004 that exposure to second - hand smoke can cause a number of serious medical conditions , including lung cancer , heart disease and childhood respiratory disease .
' Banging the drum '
Martin Birchall , an Ear Nose and Throat ( ENT ) surgeon and professor at Bristol University , said the childhood development period was " precious " .
He said : " Passive smoking at home , exposing children to smoke they cannot escape from , increases the risk of them getting ear disease , sticky runny noses and sore throats , and further down the track , some of these ENT symptoms can in due course led on to worse diseases such as asthma . "
He added : " We need to keep banging the drum .
We need to publicise the fact that every cigarette you smoke is a cigarette that your child is smoking also . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said : " Second - hand smoke kills .
We must continue to help people understand the dangers of second - hand smoke , especially for the health of their children .
" The £ 56 m we invested in NHS Stop Smoking Services last year was money well spent - we are well on track to meet our target to reduce the proportion of smokers in England to 21 per cent by 2010 . "
The following is a transcript of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s speech to supporters after the March 4 nominating contests , as provided by CQ Transcriptions via The Associated Press .
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON :
For everyone here in Ohio and across America , who 's ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out and ...
( APPLAUSE )
... for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up , and for everyone ...
( APPLAUSE )
... who works hard and never gives up , this one is for you .
( APPLAUSE )
You know what they say : As Ohio goes , so goes the nation .
( APPLAUSE )
Well , this nation 's coming back , and so is this campaign .
The reason every single top blog has had it with Hillary is because she already lost the nomination , she knows she already lost , and now is throwing a Hail Mary pass that threatens to divide our party and jeopardize our chances against John McCain in the fall .
You have to wonder how well Hillary ’s staff is sleeping at night , knowing they lost this thing two months ago , and are now simply doing the Republicans ’ bidding .
I suspect most Hillary staffers are good Democrats , simply doing their job .
But at some point , your loyalty to the party , to the cause , needs to kick in .
They ’re not just wasting their time , they ’re hurting their own party and all of us .
And that ’s nothing to be proud of .
From Forbes :
On the campaign trail last week , Sen . John McCain declared at least three times that the Republican Party is " united . "
But is it ?
Some prominent conservatives say they remain disenchanted with the party 's likely nominee .
Sen .
McCain is n't doing enough to persuade them of his conservative credentials , they say , or win them over to his side ....

Every few years scientists unearth the bones of humanity 's forefathers .
From Lucy to the Hobbits of Flores Island -- we are gradually seeing building the puzzle of mankind 's evolution .
Neanderthal

Stocky and squat and well suited for the cold , Neanderthals looked distinctly different from modern humans .
But they were like us in other ways : they buried their dead , cared for their sick and injured and may have been capable of language and music .
Scientists recently put together a complete Neanderthal skeleton and are working on the genome .

These people looked identical to modern humans and lived in Europe between 35,000 and 10,000 years ago .
Their cave paintings and sculptures are the earliest known examples of art by a prehistoric people .
Homo floresiensis

It turns out those Floresians were actually on to something .
For centuries , their mythology described a race of very small human - like creatures called the Ebu Gogo .
Hardly anyone took them seriously , however , until 2003 , when word broke that a new species of diminutive hominids was discovered on the Indonesian island .
Homo erectus

For H. erectus , it may have paid to be dense .
According to one theory , males rammed each other with their thick skulls in order to win females .
H. erectus is generally believed to be the direct ancestor of modern humans and also the first hominid to live in caves and tame fire .
Homo ergaster

Scientists can't decide whether this African hominid is just a failed predecessor of H. erectus or the rightful ancestor of modern humans .
It had a thinner skull than H. erectus and was more proficient at making tools and using fire .
Homo habilis
( Image credit : Wikimedia commons user Lillyundfreya )
Many scientists believe H. habilis is the missing link between the ape - like hominids like Lucy and the more human - like ones that came after .
It had long ape - like arms but walked on two feet and was capable of creating crude tools .
Paranthropus boisei
( Image credit : Wikimedia commons user Lillyundfreya )
If P. boisei and its relatives were n’t such picky eaters , we might not be here to wonder about them .
They split from the line leading to modern human some 2 million years ago and lived alongside our ancestors for millions of years , but died out after failing to adapt their diets .
Paranthropus aethiopicus

This early ape - like hominid walked on two legs and lived between 2.8 million and 2.2 million years ago .
Based on skull measurements , scientists concluded this species had the smallest adult hominid brain ever discovered .
Australopithecus africanus

A. africanus was an early descendent of Lucy and lived in Southern Africa between 2 million and 3 million years ago .
Its brain was larger than Lucy 's and its facial features were more human - like .

The most famous member of this species is Lucy , an adult female skeleton discovered in 1974 and nicknamed after a Beatles song .

WASHINGTON  Lawyer Jeffrey Fisher closed his arguments at the Supreme Court over money damages awarded after the Exxon Valdez oil spill by invoking the thousands of Alaskans whose " lives and livelihood ( were ) destroyed " and are waiting to be paid .
During an intense 90 minutes Wednesday of give - and - take on Exxon 's appeal of a $ 2.5 billion punitive damages award , the justices appeared closely divided .
The case could come down to a 4 - 4 vote , which would mean that a lower court judgment allowing the unprecedented $ 2.5 billion award would be affirmed .
Punitive damages generally are assessed on top of actual damages to punish and deter misconduct .
The Supreme Court 's ninth justice , Samuel Alito , owns Exxon stock and is not participating in the dispute .
Key questions are whether such damages were permissible for the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident and , if so , whether they should be limited .
REVISITING EXXON VALDEZ : Town braces for hearing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the other liberal justices were skeptical of Exxon 's arguments that the award be voided because punitive damages are not allowed under maritime law .
Chief Justice John Roberts and the other conservative justices were more doubtful of the Alaskans ' stance that a ship owner could be punished for the actions of a captain .
The captain left his post just before the crash dumped 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound .
A jury in 1994 found captain Joseph Hazelwood and Exxon reckless .
Evidence showed that Hazelwood , who had a record of alcohol - related problems , had been drinking before the incident .
The jury awarded $ 287 million in actual damages and $ 5 billion in punitive damages .
A federal appeals court cut Exxon 's $ 5 billion assessment in half .
This lingering chapter revolves around commercial losses of a class of more than 32,000 commercial fishermen , business operators and landowners , Native Alaskans and municipalities .
The high court 's decision could broadly affect the shipping industry as well as other businesses and environmentalists .
Exxon 's lawyer Walter Dellinger argued that the oil giant has been punished enough , noting that Exxon already has paid $ 3.4 billion in cleanup costs .
That , he said , " is enough to deter anybody for anything . "
But Fisher said those payments did not cover the specific economic losses of the Alaskans who brought the case .
He said nothing in long - standing maritime law prevented the jury from punishing Exxon for the reckless acts of the vessel 's captain .
Roberts asked whether shipping companies could be held accountable for employees ' misconduct even when the companies have policies against drinking on the job and other misconduct .
" What more can the corporation do other than say , ' Here is our policies , ' and try to implement them ? " he asked .
Fisher argued that Exxon did not truly implement its alcohol policy .
He noted that it emerged at trial that Hazelwood had an alcoholism problem : " We showed 33 instances in the record of Exxon employees drinking with Hazelwood or learning that he drank , " Fisher said .
Ginsburg referred to Exxon 's decision to let him continue to operate the vessel and said : " So the jury could have found : Never mind the captain .
Exxon , itself , is a grave wrongdoer because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a captain who was certainly not fit . "

WOMEN earn less than men in all 27 European Union countries , according to a recent European Commission report .
In 2005 , the “ pay gap ” was 15 % across the EU .
A high pay gap is usually associated with a labour market that is highly segregated ( Finland ) or one in which many women work part - time ( Germany and Britain ) .
The small difference in Malta , Italy and Portugal reflects the fact that there are fewer low - skilled women in the workforce .
Women fare worst of all in the private sector , where they are paid 25 % less .
The gap widens with higher levels of education .
Graduates are paid over 30 % less than men .
This may be because graduates ' pay is generally higher , so women lose more if taking time out to have children .

A little over a week ago I asked for help in choosing between the two next generation movie formats : HD DVD and Blu-ray .
I have had all the necessary equipment for a few months now ( meaning , a nice HD home theater system minus a next - gen player ) but have stuck with my regular old DVD player .
I had hoped that my patience could last me through the ensuing format war .
But then Amazon came along with this deal .
( Actually , now there ’s an even better deal . )
To briefly recap on the format war : Sony ’s Blu-ray seems to be selling more discs and has sold more players ( if the Playstation 3 , which comes with a Blu- ray player , is included in the numbers ) .
But then , the Toshiba / Microsoft HD DVD format is region free .
Unlike Blu-ray , HD DVD does not have any region codes / restrictions .
This is pro-consumer in two ways : 1 ) your HD DVD movies can be purchased and will work anywhere around the world and 2 ) you can get a lot of movies that are “ Blu- ray Only ” in the U.S. from European online retailers in the HD DVD format .
So back to the Amazon deal :
It is for the Toshiba HD - A3 HD DVD player , though the 10 free HD DVD movies deal still holds if you purchase two other nicer models as well .
You get the movies 300 and The Bourne Identity plus any three movies from this listing on Amazon ’s site .
The other five movies you get later through sending in this form after your purchase ( the link here is to the PDF of the form which also shows the movie selection for this part of the deal ) .
The deal is advertised for $ 199 .
But after I added it to my cart and proceeded to check out , the price was lowered to $ 174 .
Amazon also has another deal where you get one free HD DVD for every two purchased .
There are 104 HD DVDs eligible for that deal , and if you ’re interested in the overall selection of HD DVD movies on Amazon , looks like there are 474 available currently .
How does Blu-ray compare ?
Well , here ’s Amazon ’s page with Blu-ray players on sale .
I could n’t find any offers that include more than a couple Blu-ray movies .
And even then , every price is well above $ 300 .
At less than half the price ( especially if you include the price of all the free HD DVDs ) and with more of a pro-consumer stance , HD DVD wins by a landslide .
Now if only I could convince the rest of the world so this format war can be over .

The two primary engines pushing the USDollar down are extraordinarily low borrowing costs and extraordinarily high monetary growth .
Money is very cheap to borrow , which encourages speculation for basic reason that many investments are rising in price .
That covers the demand side for money .
The money supply is growing out of control .
It is hard to describe any modern day monetary event as like Weimar German times , but this is becoming close .
The supply of new money is growing so fast that it is causing internal problems that are not fixable .
Prices are rising broadly in the USEconomy , since the nation imports everything .
Too bad the nation cannot import leaders for government , the financial sector , economic counsel , regulatory bodies , debt rating agencies .
While you are at it , import a free press network system .
NEGATIVE BORROWING COSTS FOR MONEY
If one can achieve investment gains on par with the rise in prices , then borrowing money at a rate considerably below the current of rising prices is surely worth the risk .
The cost of borrowing money at the Fed Funds 2.25 % rate serves as a benchmark .
If one uses the official Consumer Price Inflation index , then something close to a 4 % CPI is the prevailing figure .
The � Real Cost of Money� is Minus 1.75 % but only one resorts to a bogus CPI figure posted .
But wait !
The USGovt reported CPI is the biggest elaborate joke ever played upon the US public .
Its purpose is to minimize Social Security annual increases , to limit federal pension lifts , to offer low phony inflation adjustments to many other statistics like economic growth ( GDP ) , and to maintain a charade for selling USGovt debt wrapped in USTreasurys at low yield .
The divergence of the CPI from reality is a story in itself .
Rely upon the Shadow Govt Statistics measures in what follows .
They remove nonsense , gimmickry , false lifts from corrupt hedonic adjustments .
The USGovt figures are the most corrupt in the world , of any nations .
The SGS folks offer a shadow of great value .
Below , the true Consumer Price Inflation is shown as raging near 12 % , as its divergence from the baseline false statistic is widening steadily .
This means the cost of borrowing money at the Fed Funds 2.25 % rate is over 9 % lower than the CPI .
So money really costs MINUS 9 % , which breeds speculation , and rewards it heavily .
This differential is astonishing in its magnitude .
Borrowing money is not only incredibly cheap , it will soon be even cheaper .
Both ends will pull the differential wider , even lower rates and even higher CPI in future months .
The USFed is not finished cutting interest rates , as conditions will keep it responding in desperate fashion on the defensive .
The valid CPI figure is still trending up .
By year end 2008 , possibly the Real Cost of Money in the US might Minus 12 % .
That fuels speculation and a broad attempt to seek effective inflation hedges in protection .
And speculators like energy and precious metals traditionally .
It is a no -brainer !
Michael Lewis is global head of commodities research at DeutscheBank .
He made a quote recently that caught my attention , exactly the point made above .
He said , � The sudden price pull - back across the precious metal complex during March has raised concerns that the bull run in this sector has drawn to a close .
We disagree .
We believe weakness in the US dollar has not been exhausted and with US real interest rates expected to move deeper into negative territory , we are maintaining our bullish outlook towards gold and silver prices . �
Bear in mind that some significant new money goes directly into hidden caverns of bank core holdings , providing relief to the bankers , but not yet enabling any grand overflow into the system .
My conjecture , soon perhaps to be verified , is that the big banks are borrowing money on a grand scale and speculating in crude oil and natural gas contracts .
The Senators from the State of Oil running the White House will hardly stand in the way .
They might assist the effort , even as they decry the higher energy prices .
Duplicity is not new to this team .
The pendulum might soon swing from energy contracts to gold contracts .
A Battle Royal might ensue as some banks in the field fight to survive , while other banks close to the corrupt leadership fight to continue the corrupted support mechanisms for the USDollar .
The former will buy gold in whatever form , while the latter will sell gold paper .
THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR : WITH NEGATIVE BORROWING COSTS , GOLD RISES IN A BIG POWERFUL WAY .
IT ALWAYS HAS IN SUCH CONDITIONS , AND ALWAYS WILL .
THE NEGATIVE COST OF MONEY WILL BECOME EVEN LOWER NEGATIVE IN TIME .
By the way , import prices taken in by the USEconomy are rising at a 14.8 % annual rate , dominated by crude oil .
China though is raising prices uniformly and regularly on exported items .
Finally , the pendulum has swung , whereby the US is importing inflation .
For 25 years , the USEconomy exported inflation to Asia .
Trade deficits were packaged in the form of debt securities , lapped up by Asians .
If truth be known , the Asians have practically stopped buying USTreasurys from the US system for over two years .
In recent months , higher Asian costs have been passed on to US customers who purchase finished Asian products .
Compounding the problem is the potential of looming sales of US $ - based bonds by Asians .
They are eager to ramp up their Sovereign Wealth Funds , to invest in meaningful concepts like energy , metals , and the properties that contain them .
SWFunds have turned their noses up at more garbage debt securities from the US .
So far , mortgage bonds are identified as rubbish .
In time , foreigners will begin to regard US corporate debt and USTreasury debt as rubbish too .
Most debt securities issued from the United States is subprime by any definition that incorporates the ongoing recession .
MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH BEYOND ECONOMIC BASIS
If the USEconomy endures a float of an increasing amount of money , above and beyond what the economy itself can justify , then overflow occurs .
With the overflow comes a powerful mixture of imbalances , bubbles , contortions , disruptions , and crises .
Greenspan committed the Original Sin back in 1994 by permitting the money supply to grow , with only a queer blind eye kept trained on the CPI .
The rampant money supply growth is now feeding the energy market prices .
It has fed the gold market also in recent years , and will continue to do so .
The excess of money must flow into something , since it is not flowing into strong industrial plant , viable business capital , and functional economic foundation .
It is flowing into the parade of sick bubbles endemic to the USEconomy .
In the late 1990 decade it was stocks that rose in a bubble then busted .
In the 2000 decade it was housing and mortgage bonds that rose in a pair of connected bubbles , then busted .
Now it is flowing into energy and precious metals .
Below , the Money Supply rate is shown as raging over 17 % on the broad M3 measure .
This means immediately that the monetary aggregate is growing at least 16 % faster than the USEconomy .
However , given the corrupt nature of the Gross Domestic Product statistic , courtesy of the USGovt , the money supply is expanding much faster than actual economic growth , like 19 % to 20 % faster .
Some call the difference between the monetary growth rate and the economic growth rate to be the � Real Inflation Rate� since adjusted for baseline growth necessities .
As the funding requirements continue for the damaged bank assets , for the mortgage bonds , for the housing loan renegotiations , look for the monetary aggregate to continue in this upward trajectory .
The central bankers , past and present , are even joining the fight to lay blame at the feet of their contemporaries .
A circus sideshow has developed .
By the way , the euro money supply is growing in the neighborhood of 12 % annually .
That spurs bubble growth in Europe , along with speculative flow into energy and precious metals .
That fact that euro monetary growth is 6 % below US $ monetary growth means the USDollar will continue to fall relative to the euro .
OVER - ARCHING USDOLLAR FACTORS
Basic forces are at work .
The speculative movement will continue to respond positively to the giveaway of money .
The USDollar will continue to respond negatively to rabid money supply growth .
Expect new arenas to respond to the rampant money supply growth , since its destinations cannot be controlled .
Its direction can only be steered , encouraged , and directed to follow trends .
Therefore , for these two reasons , the USDollar is falling into crisis mode .
Gold & silver respond in opposite fashion , rising in price .
Unless and until the cost of money and the growth of money return to normalcy , the USDollar will continue down steadily , and precious metals will continue up steadily in price .
The US financial system is in tatters .
The failure of the financial networks to report this story is yet another travesty heaped upon the US public , which is slowly grasping the gravity of the situation .
They see the home foreclosure signs .
They see the rising gasoline prices .
They read about the suspicious Wall Street play on key stories .
They see the job losses , and Chinese labels on many finished products .
They see the drop in interest rates , but the system continuing to break down .
They continue to deal with mortgage rate resets , the next big round to involve Exploding Adjustable Rate Mortgages this summer .
These will feature the Negative Amortization loans , the Option ARMs , the Hybrid ARMs , and much more .
Watch California sink into a morass .
The US financial system has several pillars , all either underwater or tilting toward insolvency .
Vicious cycles have begun to work their powerful wreckage , rendering solution as extremely elusive and difficult .
The breakdown must run its course .
The momentum to unwind 15 to 20 years of abuse will take many years more .
USGovt is running huge federal deficits , to grow worse as recession worsens

airline industry is reeling from higher jet fuel costs , and strangled networks US truckers are being squeezed , as highway actions are on the rise The United States is tragically entering a gradual state of failure , from insolvency , corruption , and indescribably horrible economic counsel .
An astronomical rise in USGovt federal deficits could occur in the next few months .
Capitalism has failed in an historical spectacle of catastrophe .
The nation has lost its legitimate income sources from industry .
The nation has relied upon inflation contraptions and financial engineering devices for two decades .
The exotic devices have blown up in our faces .
The reflection upon the USDollar is certain to continue .
Recent adoptions of broader US Federal Reserve lending facilities has given a cup of water , a piece of bread , and a peptalk to a crippled man burdened by a 150 - lb backpack of debt even as Wall Street thieves empty his pockets of loose money and all pension receipts .
To accept that the worst is over is an exercise in stupidity , naivety , and further con game victimizations .
The more realistic story is that the United States is entering a failed state condition .
In that respect , it is in a race with Mexico , which again is covered with an update in the April issue of the Hat Trick Letter .
The trade surplus driven by Mexican oil exports is fast vanishing , exacerbated by a huge rise in imported gasoline .
If you do not believe the claim of a failed state , watch the abandonment of mortgages rise to alarming levels , watch the reaction to closure of gasoline stations from lack of profit potential , watch the horrendous list of job losses across the broad spectrum of the USEconomy , watch the continued magnificent declines in US housing prices , watch the next rounds of personal bankruptcies as credit cards no longer keep them afloat , watch the next round of mortgage bond losses for big banks , and watch the foreign reaction to amplified USTreasury Bond auctions to cover the growing federal debt .
The word crisis will be used to cover much more than the falsely reported subprime mortgage problem , which is a mortgage bust in a total sense .
FRAUD BY USGOVT , WALL STREET & THE S.E.C .
The official USGovt economic statistics are by far the most corrupt in the world , the land of Institutionalized Dishonesty .
The latest episode centered upon Bear Stearns should have demonstrated that amply .
Will any investigation be done of the JPMorgan raid , using USFed credit , designed with phony price points ?
Will any investigation be done of the massive option put contracts hastily approved and bought on the exchanges , $ 50 below the BSC current price , with a mere five days to go ?
No !
Of course not , especially not in a land whose governing bodies conform to the guidelines of the Fascist Business Model .
View the bounces , intrigue , and drama behind the Bear Stearns BSC stock price movement as a colossal sanctioned corrupt raid and insider manipulation that will stand as a punctuation mark on US stock fraud .
Regard it as a successful attempt by insiders , both management and well heeled professionals , to steal pension money from Bear Stearns employees past and present .
Regard it as a second chapter to the mortgage fraud story itself .
The Congressional query into the JPMorgan and Bear Stearns interplay was more a window dressing than anything else .
The members of Congress are outmatched by savvy slick thieves , who not only operate in circles beyond the comprehension of legislators , but also speak in a language over their heads as well .
Much of the big bank executive testimony was lies mixed with falsely represented hearsay as an effective distraction .
The Securities & Exchange Commission cannot very well investigate what it approved to begin with under extraordinarily suspicious surroundings .
The SEC approved option put contracts so far out of the money , with so little time left before expiration , that they must have been part of the game played .
The losers are stockholders , the investment community , and the US financial sector reputation still in a nosedive from mortgage bond fraud .
By the way , prosecution for the mortgage bond fraud creeps slowly along .
It was interrupted by the Spitzer side show , whose story might be only half true .
NEXT UGLY BIZARRE TWIST Fanny Mae properties will be a mainstream concept before long .
The New Resolution Trust Corp will feature a mortgage bond cemetery ( to buy failed bonds , to bury them deep ) , and a mortgage finance centrifuge ( to spread a mortgage fund recycle ) .
The third function to assist in renegotiated loans will not involve any incremental ownership of property titles , but it will add notably to the USGovt federal deficit .
The bond cemetery and mortgage centrifuge will require that Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac , the dynamic corrupt fat bankrupt duo , to own title on a very long list of properties .
Decisions will eventually be made NOT to dump the properties on the market for sale .
The concept of earning an income from rent will be recognized .
The shareholders of FNM and FRD will benefit from a dividend earned from home rentals .
Why sell in a depressed housing market when rents are on an upward trend ?
The road to serfdom will involve the USGovt through its corrupt , insolvent , and revived mortgage apparatus to becoming the biggest national homeowners in the land .
What an embarrassment !
But watch for how the story is spun !
If alive today , Thomas Jefferson would spit in the eye of the president , the Treasury Secretary , the USFed Chairman , the Congressional leaders , and any Wall Street CEO who crossed his path !!!

Intelligence officers confirm Kissinger role in Turkish invasion Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This Release of CIAs  Family Jewels provides insight into political juggernaut and Bush Administration adviser Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger pushed for the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and allowed arms to be moved to Ankara for an attack on that island in reaction to a coup sponsored by the Greek junta , according to documents and intelligence officers with close knowledge of the event .
Nearly 700 pages of highly classified Central Intelligence Agency reports from the 1970's , known collectively as the " Family Jewels , " are slated for public release today .
However , the National Security Archive had previously obtained four related documents through the Freedom of Information Act and made them public Friday .
 In all the world the things that hurt us the most are the CIA business and Turkey aid ,  Kissinger declares in one of those documents , a White House memorandum of a conversation from Feb. 20 , 1975 .
On the surface , the comment seems innocuous , but the context as well as the time period suggests Kissinger had abetted illegal financial aid and arms support to Turkey for its 1974 Cyprus invasion .
In July and August of 1974 , Turkey staged a military invasion of the island nation of Cyprus , taking over nearly a third of the island and creating a divide between the south and north .
Most historians consider that Kissinger  then Secretary of State and National Security Advisor to President Gerald Ford  not only knew about the planned attack on Cyprus , but encouraged it .
Some Greek Cypriots believed then , and still believe , that the invasion was a deliberate plot on the part of Britain and the US to maintain their influence on the island , which was particularly important as a listening post in the Eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the October 1973 War between Israel , Egypt , Jordan and Syria .
According to columnist Christopher Hitchens , author of the book " The Trial of Henry Kissinger , " " At the time , many Greeks believed that the significant thing was that [ Prime Minister Bulent ] Ecevit had been a pupil of Kissinger 's at Harvard . "
Several intelligence sources , who wished to remain anonymous to maintain the security of their identity , confirmed to RAW STORY that Kissinger both pushed for the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and allowed arms to be moved to Ankara .
However , a former CIA officer who was working in Turkey at the time , suggests that Kissinger 's statement in the memorandum about Turkish aid likely means the Ford administration , following Kissingers advice , conducted business under the table with right - wing ultra-nationalist General Kenan Evren , who later dissolved Parliament and became the dictator of Turkey in a 1980 coup .
 The implication is that the US government was dealing directly with General Evren and circumventing the [ democratically elected ]
Turkish government ,  the former CIA officer said .
 This was authorized by Kissinger , because they were nervous about Ecevit , who was a Social Democrat . 
 We technically cut off military aid for them ,  the officer added , referring to an arms embargo passed by Congress after the invasion .
 Technically technically , but this would imply that the military and / or probably CIA aid continued even after the aid was cut off by Congress .
This may substantively be what led to the overthrow eventually of Ecevit . 
According to the former CIA officer , Turkeys democratically elected President Ecevit had good relations with the Johnson administration , but the Nixon administration , where Kissinger served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State , had issues with Ecevit .
 I do n't remember now what all the issues were ,  the source said .
 But I remember that the White House did not like Ecevit . 
Kissinger could not be reached for comment Monday .
Kissinger , Rumsfeld , and Cheney , then and now Though no longer a government official , Kissinger remains a powerful force in Washington  particularly within the Bush Administration .
Dr. Kissinger was the first choice by President Bush to lead a blue ribbon investigation into the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
He was , however , quickly removed by the White House after the 9/11 Family Steering Committee had a private meeting with him at his Kissinger and Associates Inc. New York office and asked him point blank if he had any clients by the name of Bin Laden .
According to Monica Gabrielle , who lost her husband Richard in the attacks and who was present as part of the 12 - member 9/11 Family Steering Committee during the private meeting , the White House seems to have overlooked Dr. Kissinger 's apparent conflict of interest .
" We had the meeting with him ... the whole Steering Committee , all 12 of us .
Because we are basically doing our due diligence and asking for his client list to be released to see if there was a conflict of interest between his client list and potential areas of investigation , " said Gabrielle during a Tuesday morning phone conversation , recounting the events of December 12 , 2002 .
" We went back and forth with him , discussing his client list ... asking him who was on it , if there were conflicts and so forth , " she continued .
" Lorie [ Van Auken ] asked , do you have any Saudi clients on your list ?
And he got a blank look .
Then Lorie asked , do you have any clients by the name of Bin Laden ?
And he was stuttering and mumbling , and finally said he would maybe , possibly consider releasing the client list to an attorney but not for the public . "
Dr. Kissinger did not reveal his client list , and the very next day the White House withdrew his name without public explanation .
In Bob Woodwards State of Denial , Kissinger says he met regularly with Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to offer advice about the war in Iraq .
 Victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy ,  Kissinger said .
Cheney , along with former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , first came to prominence during the administration of President Ford .
Rumsfeld had served in various posts under Nixon before being sent to Europe as the US ambassador to NATO in 1973 , a period that included the Cyprus coup .
When Ford became president on August 9 , 1974 , immediately preceding the second wave of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus , Rumsfeld returned to Washington to serve as his chief of staff , while Cheney became deputy assistant to the president .
Rumsfeld and Cheney gained increasing influence under Ford , reaching their apex of power in November 1975 with a shakeup that saw Rumsfeld installed as Secretary of Defense , Dick Cheney as White House chief of staff , and George H.W. Bush replacing William Colby as CIA director .
Together , Rumsfeld and Cheney created a bubble not unlike the one that has enveloped President George W. Bushs White House , surrounding Ford with a close knit group of advisors who worked to head off any possibility of openness about past misdeeds and to turn the administration sharply to the right .
The aid to Turkey referenced in Kissingers cryptic remark was precisely the subject of Congressional oversight on the Executive Branch in 1974 - 75 .
In a foreshadowing of how Iran Contra would play out a decade later , the White House violated both US and international law in providing arms and financing to the Turks for the Cyprus invasion .
The CIA , through various spokespeople , would not comment on how much additional information with regard to Kissinger , the attack on Cyprus , and the events leading up to the 1980 coup in Turkey with US support would be part of the declassified documents to come out this week .
The only thing the agency would say is that this was a different CIA at a different time ,  and people need to remember that .
The Chile Coup Around the time of President Nixon 's resignation in August 1974 , investigative reporter Seymour Hersh started hearing accounts of illegal foreign and domestic CIA activities .
On December 20 , 1974 , Hersh confronted CIA Director William Colby and received confirmation of everything he had learned .
Two days later , Hersh went public with the story .
The Family Jewels were described in a New York Times front page article entitled  Huge C.I.A. Operation Reported in U.S. Against Antiwar Forces , Other Dissidents in Nixon Years .
According to Hersh , James Schlesinger , who served briefly as CIA director in 1973 , had ordered the report in response to the crimes collectively known as Watergate .
 An extensive investigation by the NYT has established that intelligence files on at least 10000 U.S. citizens were maintained by a special unit of CIA that was reporting directly to Richard Helms , then the Director of Central Intelligence and now the Ambassador to Iran . 
Then - CIA director William Colby 's initial impulse was to reveal everything in order to give the CIA a clean slate , but President Ford and Kissinger disagreed .
By January 3 , 1975 when Colby was summoned to the White House for a briefing , they had decided to keep the lid on by forming a blue ribbon commission under Vice President Nelson Rockefeller .
The " memorandum of conversation " document released by the National Security Archive , dated January 4 , 1975 , transcribes portions of a follow - up meeting between Ford and Kissinger the next day .
Kissinger complains to President Ford about Colby 's urge to come clean , saying , " You will end up with a CIA that does only reporting , and not operations ...
He has turned over to the FBI the whole of his operation . "
Former CIA Director Helms " said all these stories are just the tip of the iceberg ,  Kissinger continues , adding  If they come out , blood will flow . "
After offering a few examples , Kissinger concludes by remarking mysteriously , " The Chilean thing -- that is not in any report .
That is sort of blackmail on me . "
The meaning of this remark is far from clear , suggesting as it does that the 693 pages of the Family Jewels were only " the tip of the iceberg " and that among what was left out was a " Chilean thing " that Kissinger perceived as having the potential for blackmail on himself .
It has been known since the revelations of the 70's that prior to Chile 's 1970 presidential elections , President Richard Nixon , Kissinger and Helms actively pursued ways to head off the victory of leftist Salvador Allende , including sponsoring an abortive military coup .
" I do n't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people ,  Kissinger famously said at the time .
After Allende was democratically elected and became president , the US put economic pressure on Chile and encouraged further military plots -- a two - pronged strategy similar to that currently being employed against Iran -- while Kissinger a continued to press for stronger action .
The CIA 's Directorate of Operations was particularly active in Chile in 1972 - 73 , the period leading up to Allende 's violent overthrow in September 1973 in a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet .
Following the coup , Kissinger strongly supported the new authoritarian government .
After Helms left the CIA in 1973 to become ambassador to Iran , he offered a series of vague denials when asked about CIA involvement in Chile .
Among Helms ' claims were " that the CIA had n't given money directly to Allende 's opponents , that the CIA did n't try to fix the vote in the Chilean Congress because investigation had shown it could n't be arranged , that the CIA did n't try to overthrow the Chilean government because the Agency failed to find anyone who could really do it . "
In 1977 , Helms was convicted of perjury for his statements and given a two - year suspended sentence and a fine that was paid by his friends from the CIA .
As with the more recent perjury of Vice President Cheneys former chief of staff Scooter Libby 's concerning the outing of a CIA officer , Helms ' had lies served the purpose of protecting his superiors , notably Kissinger .
However , in Prelude to Terror , historian Joseph Trento offers a somewhat different account of Helms ' actions , suggesting a deeper Kissinger involvement .
" From Iran , Helms heard enough about the criminal investigation to issue a threat through his old colleague Tom Braden ,  Trento writes .
 Braden remembered Helms saying , ' If I am going to be charged , then I will reveal Kissinger 's role in these operations . ' "
Trento adds in a footnote that " Helms himself confided to old friend and CIA colleague ( from Iran ) Tom Braden that he would resort to [ revealing embarrassing state secrets ] and ' bring down Henry Kissinger ' in the process . "
Even apart from Trento's assertions , Kissinger 's concern with " the Chilean thing -- that is not in any report " hints at involvement in the 1973 coup .
But if Trento 's claims are accurate , Kissinger might also have been referring to a threat by Helms to bring him down , both in his remark that " Helms said all these stories are just the tip of the iceberg .
If they come out , blood will flow , " and in his cryptic description of " the Chilean thing " as " sort of blackmail on me . "

EXCLUSIVE : MORE Sam Lutfi Text Messages !
" I am Her Father , Brother , Boyfriend and God "
Since posting our exclusive story about 's disturbing text messages toand , we have received other emails from people who have received threatening emails from ' so called ' manager . '
One of those emails was from 21 - year - old Brianne Patterson from Canada :
These are text messages I received from Sam Lutfi from the 21st to the 31st of January .
You may post them on your website if you wish .
Bitten and Bound to Brianne :
Hi Brianne ,
Can you give me some background about the text messages and why he was texting you ?
Thanks !
Andrea
Brianne to Bitten and Bound :
Hi Andrea ,
Long story short ... I have a friend of a friend who lives in Los Angeles that knows Sam .
She probably wants to remain anonymous so I wo n't give out her name .
I was actually surprised to even learn that she knew Sam , noticing she had him added on Facebook and so I decided to send a random message to him which is how my contact with him began .
I never actually spoke to him over the phone , was too chicken to call when he said to , although the one time he did call I picked up and just did n't say anything ( I 'm shy , lol ) but recorded him speaking .
So we technically only ever spoke via text ... and after a few random text messages about pretty much nothing , I braved it up to ask him about Britney and everything going on ( not even thinking he would say anything ) , and that is when I received the message about Lynne .
That same day I received a threatening text message from Sam which , frankly , I am too scared to show anyone -- after the things I 've been hearing and seeing from my friend , he is definitely someone I would not want to have anything to do with any longer .
If you need any more info , do n't hesitate to email me again .
Bitten and Bound to Brianne :
Can I ask why he was threatening you ?
Brianne to Bitten and Bound :
I have no idea .
It was like he turned on people - that , or he 's just trying to be intimidating .
However , apparently I was n't the only one he acted towards in a threatening manner .
According to my friend he deleted a bunch of people from Facebook , too , and also sent her a random message saying " I am her Father , brother , boyfriend and God , so f**k off . "
We assume by " her " he means Britney .
Bitten and Bound to Brianne :
Would you mind telling me what he said to you in the threatening text ?
Brianne to Bitten and Bound :
It says , and I quote , " I am going to f** ck you and so many people up . "
Bitten and Bound to Brianne :
How long ago was this and why was he angry ?
Brianne to Bitten and Bound :
Like I said , I have no idea why he was angry , it was like he just snapped out of no where .
The threatening message was sent on the same day he sent me the message about Lynne being delusional , the 31st of January .
My general opinion of Sam based on what I 've witnessed from the messages I 've received and what my friend has told me is that he 'll be easy to get along with one minute , but is also like a ticking time bomb ready to go off at any given moment .
My friend says he seems to need to be in control of things , thinks he 's great , and hates people hovering around because it always has to be all about him .
And feel free to put the texts up on your site , I am not selling them for any amount of money - I just think that the more people see how horrible of a person he can really be , the better .
I doubt I am the first one to receive messages like these and I am sure I wo n't be the last .
Brianne subsequently told me her friend has met Sam Lutfi a few times and gone to clubs with him .
Bitten and Bound was able to verify the authenticity of the text messages through contact with Sam Lutfi at the number on the texts .

A " homicidal maniac " with a history of sexual violence stabbed the model Sally Anne Bowman seven times in a rape that ended in her murder , the Old Bailey heard today .
Bowman died in the driveway of her home after her boyfriend , Lewis Sprotson , had dropped her off shortly after 4 am on Sunday September 25 2005 .
The 18 - year - old 's underwear , white cardigan and Prada handbag had been taken .
The rest of her clothes were rolled round her waist , and she was left lying in a pool of blood in front of her home in Blenheim Crescent , Croydon , south London , the court was told .
" Sally Anne 's murder was motivated by sex .
Her killer murdered her for his own sexual gratification , " Brian Altman , prosecuting , said .
He said chef Mark Dixie , 37 , claimed to have been under the influence of drink and drugs following his 35th birthday , and had " taken advantage of the situation " .
" That , astonishingly , is his defence , " he told the court .
" It is born out of desperation .
There is not a single grain of truth in it . "
Altman claimed Dixie , who had lived in Australia for a time , was a man with a history of sexual violence .
In 1988 , at the age of 17 , he had indecently assaulted and punched a female Jehovah 's Witness in London .
Ten years later , a 20 - year - old Thai student was stabbed eight times by a sex attacker in a suburb of Perth , Western Australia .
She had caught a 6ft tall man wearing a black stocking over his head climbing in through her kitchen window .
The woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , lost consciousness during the attack but later told a policeman she had been raped .
Her underwear was analysed in London last year , and a DNA match with Dixie was found , Altman said .
He alleged there were " substantial " similarities with the attack on Bowman , including the woman 's bag and make - up being taken .
Altman said Dixie 's defence was a smokescreen , adding : " Mark Dixie killed Sally Anne with a knife , with which he had deliberately armed himself , and then had sexual intercourse with her .
He had set off that night to commit a violent sex attack .
" The idea that in one and the same place there was not only a homicidal maniac who motivelessly stabbed a beautiful young woman to death , but also a sex offender , is a ludicrous claim born of desperation . "
Dixie had spent the Saturday celebrating his 35th birthday with friends .
He had been drinking and snorting cocaine .
He returned to their flat in Avondale Road , two streets away from Bowman 's home .
In the morning , they found him on the sofa , where they had left him at 2.30 am , the court heard .
He was arrested nine months later at a pub in Horley , Surrey , where he was working and living .
After being taken to a police station and asked whether he had any medical conditions , he said : " I must be mental to do something like that , eh ? " , Altman told the court .
Among his belongings , police found a camera containing video film of him masturbating and ejaculating onto a newspaper picture of Bowman , it was alleged .
" He was re-iving the sexual acts and indignities ... he was reliving the killing , " Altman said .
" Sally Anne had been savagely and brutally killed . "
She had been stabbed three times in the neck , collapsing through rapid blood loss .
Then she was stabbed " savagely " through the abdomen with such force that the knife came out at the other end .
The defendant 's DNA was found on Bowman 's body , his bloody fingerprint on her shoe and his bite marks on her cheek , neck and right nipple , Altman said .
Her body was found near a skip , and concrete rubble had been placed on her body and in her mouth .
Bowman 's mother , father and two of her sisters sat listening to the evidence at the back of the court .
Her mother , Linda , 45 , and one of her daughters rushed from the courtroom when jurors were shown horrific pictures of the body after it was found .
The trial was adjourned to tomorrow .
ISPs have been throttling BitTorrent traffic for years now , but only recently has this turned into a political issue .
The BitTorrent client Azureus has now developed a plugin through which you can help distinguishing the good from the bad ISPs , data they will use to strengthen their argument in the ongoing Comcast debate .
Last November Azureus petitioned the FCC , resulting in a FCC hearing which was held a month ago .
One of the issues raised there , was that there is little data available on the scope of BitTorrent throttling , a gap Azureus now plans to fill .
“ We at Vuze ( Azureus ) decided there was something important you can do to help elevate the debate , ” says Jay Monahan , General Counsel at Azureus .
“ We created a simple software “ plug - in ” that works with your Vuze ( Azureus ) application to gather information about potential interference with your Internet traffic . ”
The main purpose of the plugin is to gather factual data on which ISPs are throttling with BitTorrent , and to what extent .
Already there is an ever growing list of bad ISPs available at the Azureus wiki , but the data from the plugin will make their case even stronger .
When the first ISPs started to throttle BitTorrent traffic , Azureus was one of the first BitTorrent clients to introduce a countermeasure , namely , protocol header encryption .
However , this was only the beginning of an ongoing cat and mouse game between ISPs and BitTorrent client developers .
Unfortunately , BitTorrent encryption does n’t work against the more aggressive , and ever evolving throttling applications .
Even though there is a Comcast proof BitTorrent encryption in the making , it is always easier to use political means to stop ISPs from messing with our traffic in the first place .
The plugin is listed at Azureus ’ Sourceforge page if you want to help out .
For the paranoid BitTorrent users among us , Monahan guarantees that the data will be sent anonymously .
“ Be assured that sharing this data with us does not involve disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information .
We will aggregate the data and may talk about it or disclose it publicly , but no data about any specific user will be disclosed as part of this effort . ”
Live-action film faced Star Wars : The Clone Wars , other films on old August date
The ComingSoon.net film news website reports that the Twentieth Century Fox production company has delayed the live - action Dragonball movie 's opening from August 15 , 2008 to April 3 , 2009 .
The website notes that The International , Star Wars : The Clone Wars , Tropic Thunder and Wild Child are all scheduled to open on August 15 in North America .
No other film has been pegged for Dragonball 's new date .
The Dragonball movie adapts Akira Toriyama 's fighting manga of the same name .
Director James Wong ( Final Destination , X - Files television series , The One ) has been shooting the film in Mexico since late last year , and Stephen Chow , the actor and director behind Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer , signed on as a producer .
Chopping heads
When a corporation is bleeding money , often the only way to save it is to drastically lower fixed expenses by firing staff .
Commodore had lost over $ 300 million between September 1985 and March 1986 , and over $ 21 million in March alone .
Commodore 's new CEO , Thomas Rattigan , was determined to stop the bleeding .
Rattigan began three separate rounds of layoffs .
The first to go were the layabouts , people who had n't proven their worth to the company and were never likely to .
The second round coincided with the cancellation of many internal projects .
The last round was necessary for the company to regain profitability , but affected many good people and ultimately may have hurt the company in the long run .
Engineer Dave Haynie recalled that the first round was actually a good thing , the second was of debatable value , and the last was " hitting bone . "
Under Jack Tramiel , Commodore had embarked on a whole host of projects : some practical , some far - sighted and visionary , and others just plain crazy .
To try and figure out which was which , Rattigan looked for an experienced opinion .
He found one in Charles Winterble , a former Commodore engineer turned consultant who at the time was still under the lawsuit Commodore had going against Atari !
First to the chopping block were Commodore 's aging line of PET computers , which had been the first fully - assembled computers to hit the market ( they predated both the Apple ] [ and TRS - 80 ) .
The VIC - 20 , once promoted by William Shatner , was also axed .
Next up were the innovative but ultimately pointless collection of small 8 - bit computers that were incompatible with the blockbuster C - 64 : the Plus / 4 and Commodore 16 , and various other machines that had never left the prototype stage .
The Commodore 900 , an innovative Unix workstation with a 1024 by 800 bitmapped display , was also canceled .
How many megabytes does that cabinet hold ?
Computers were n't the only thing that Tramiel had a hand in .
At the time , the company still owned an office supply manufacturing firm in Canada .
I personally ran into Commodore - branded filing cabinets far more often than I ever ran into Amigas .
Rattigan got rid of these and other distractions .
Rattigan also cleaned up the sloppy accounting processes that had been allowed to fester under his predecessor , Marshall Smith .
Three redundant manufacturing plants were closed , and new financial controls were put into place to keep a tight check on spending .
In all , the cuts did their job .
Commodore paid off their debts and even posted a modest $ 22 million profit in the last quarter of 1986 .
In the meantime , the Amiga still needed applications if it was to become anything more than a curiosity .
One of the first companies to publicly pledge support for the platform was none other than Electronic Arts .
Electronic Arts and Deluxe Paint
EA founder Trip Hawkins poses with an Amiga 1000
Those who have firsthand experience with the modern Electronic Arts typically know it as a faceless corporate behemoth , infamous for absorbing , then strangling independent development teams , eliminating competition by paying for exclusive rights to major sports leagues , and working its employees beyond the breaking point .
They may be surprised to find out that EA originally had quite a different mission and philosophy .
EA 's founder , Trip Hawkins , was actually fighting against the poor treatment of programmers that he witnessed elsewhere in the industry .
When he launched Electronic Arts in 1982 , he envisioned an environment where developers and game designers would be treated like rock stars : promoted in major media , given generous royalties , and allowed to explore wherever their imagination and talent led them .
Hawkins saw the Amiga as a groundbreaking platform , a brand new canvas that would let his developers create great new works of art .
In November 1985 , he took out a two - page ad in Compute !
magazine that extolled the Amiga 's virtues and promised that Electronic Arts would be supporting the platform for a whole new generation of games .
" I believe this machine , marketed and supported properly , should have a very significant impact on the personal computer industry , " Hawkins said prophetically in an earlier interview in the same magazine .
EA 's first Amiga product , however , was n't a game at all , but a game development tool .
Programmer Dan Silva had been working on an internal graphics editor that was code - named Prism .
When the Amiga was released , he quickly reworked the program to take advantage of the new computer 's stunning graphics capabilities .
Even before it shipped , Silva was already working on the next version , which would contain many more advanced features .
This program was Deluxe Paint , and it launched the careers of thousands of computer graphic artists .
With a simple interface featuring a toolbar on the right - hand side of the screen , Deluxe Paint was a powerful tool that could create not only static graphics , but also animation .
This made it perfect for creating images for computer and video games , and for a long time Deluxe Paint was the industry standard for creating art for this medium , much like tools such as 3D Studio Max are today .
Even years later , as the PC gaming market began to eclipse the Amiga in terms of sheer size and number of titles , many game development studios still made their art using Deluxe Paint .
Its native format , IFF , and animation format , IFF ANIM , are still supported by many graphics packages today .
IFF ANIM files were compressed using delta encoding , resulting in smaller files .
This was nearly 10 years before animation compression standards such as MPEG were released .
But back in 1986 , the combination of an Amiga and Deluxe Paint was unbeatable .
While Adobe's Photoshop on the Macintosh platform would eventually become the standard tool for creating two - dimensional graphic images , the Mac was still a monochrome - only computer at this point , and the PC could barely manage four colors even with a CGA graphics card .
Again , the Amiga was ahead of its time .
The cover art for the Deluxe Paint II box featured an image of Tutankhamen that had been created inside the program itself .
This image quickly became an iconic picture in the computer graphics industry .
Even Commodore recognized the power of Deluxe Paint , using the Tutankhamen image on a new full - page ad that — finally ! — stated the Amiga 's advantages outright .
Last week , the US Senate passed a bill that would bar employers and insurance providers from considering the results of a person 's genetic tests when making hiring or coverage decisions .
The House has passed a similar bill and the Bush administration has indicated it would sign legislation of this sort .
In the wake of the bill 's passage , however , a number of people have questioned why it should n't be an employer 's or insurer 's right to make decisions based on genetics .
As a matter of policy , these questions were answered a decade ago , and the intervening progress in human genetics has only reinforced some of the reasoning of the initial decision .
A history of favoring genetic agnosticism
Health policy issues were considered well in advance of the completion of the human genome , as the project 's funding included money for an Ethical , Legal and Social Implications Working Group .
That group made its first recommendations in 1993 , and has continued to advance a similar set of arguments .
Even in 1993 , the Working Group recognized a " health care coverage crisis , " and it suggested that genetic testing could make this situation worse .
As genetic studies have focused on identifying disease loci , biologists would create an ever - expanding set of negative risk factors that would allow insurers to deny coverage to an ever - larger population .
The rational consumer response to a situation where most tests would have negative implications for coverage would simply be to forgo the tests and remain insured , although ignorant of potential risks .
The working group felt this situation would not benefit the US public and would squander the promise of the Human Genome Project .
As such , its policy has been to favor legislation such as the bill just passed .
Progress in genetics reveals limits of genetic tests
The staggering progress up to and beyond the completion of the human genome might suggest that the sophisticated tests now available will allow employers and insurers to make rational and fine - grained assessments of genetic risks .
A careful examination of the actual record , however , reveals that any genetic tests are subject to enough caveats that their value in making rational decisions is extremely limited .
To begin with , it 's worth considering what it would take to have a complete picture of a person 's genetic risks .
The human genome contains over three billion individual DNA bases .
About 5 percent of these bases are conserved in the genomes of our fellow mammals , suggesting that they are functionally significant .
That means there are over 150 million locations in the genome where genetic differences may have significance to human health .
In addition , as much as 17 percent of the human genome may have copy number variations , being duplicated in some individuals and reduced in others .
It 's clear that health care will be fundamentally different by the time we have anything approaching a complete grip on human genetic risk .
But there are genetic variants that cause well - defined risks , such as the ones that increase the probability of developing Type - II diabetes .
It 's easy to believe that a test for a variation of this sort would allow rational decision making .
But no gene ever operates in a vacuum ; the probability that Type - II diabetes will develop is also influenced by the remainder of a person 's genetic legacy which , as discussed above , we wo n't have a clear picture of any time soon .
Environmental factors also play a key role ; it 's likely that a careful diet could suppress the risk — these tests would ideally identify those who need to change their diets — but neither employers or insurers are able to track diet in the same way they can track genetics .
It 's worth commenting on the science behind the tests as well .
For most scientific research , the standard of evidence is 95 percent confidence , meaning that there is still a five percent chance that the appearance of genetic associations are the product of random events .
Given the number of papers published on human genetics each year , this suggests that at least some of the results are the product of honest error ; the potential for dishonest error in the competitive field of human genetics may also be significant .
Environment may play into the studies themselves , as they are often performed in a population from a single country , such as Iceland or Japan , which has a very different set of habits from the US .
The net result is that a genetic risk factor may not actually create any risk in the US population .
The final factor to consider is the nature of the tests themselves .
Most genetic association studies and many current genetic testing protocols rely on DNA chips that examine tens of thousands of individual sequence differences simultaneously .
Carefully optimized conditions mean that the chances of error at any single sequence is low .
But , when multiplied by the number of sequences examined , the probabilities that an error occurs are significant .
This affects both the initial identification of a risk factor and any subsequent genetic testing .
Expand the testing to a broad population , and the chances are good that something will inevitably go wrong .
Depersonalized medicine
Combined , the complexities and potential for error limit the informational value of most genetic tests .
Any proper use of this information will require both care in interpreting cutting edge scientific information and care in performing the genetic tests , including retesting for confirmation .
Are employers or insurance companies up for the expense involved in the level of care necessary to make personalized genetic decisions ?
This seems improbable .
Even if they do , the picture generated by our current level of genetic knowledge would be , at best , incomplete .
Worse yet , the very concept threatens to undermine another of the greatest potential benefits of the genome : personalized medicine .
The goal of personalized medicine is to tailor treatments to a the unique genetic defects that have helped foster a disease , be it diabetes or cancer .
But , if insurers can deny coverage based on those same genetic traits , the patient may never see the treatment .
There are a whole host of other reasons to be leery of decisions based on genetic factors , including the fact that some factors are more prevalent within some ethnic groups , raising the specter that genetics may serve as a rationale for some forms of racism .
But the most powerful argument is that any genetic policies will be extremely difficult to do well and , even if done properly , could still get things wrong .
Combine that with the potential for genetic - based decision making to inhibit the use of our new - found knowledge , and there is a potential for harm that could arise from policies such as the ones that may soon be outlawed .
ARLINGTON , Virginia ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton dipped into her own finances ahead of this week 's Super Tuesday contests , lending her Democratic presidential campaign $ 5 million in late January , she disclosed Wednesday .
In another development , some senior members of Clinton 's campaign staff have agreed to go without pay for a month , CNN has confirmed .
" We had a great month fundraising in January -- broke all records , " the New York senator and former first lady told reporters .
" But my opponent was able to raise more money , and we intended to be competitive , and we were , and I think the results last night prove the wisdom of my investment . "
Clinton won the biggest Super Tuesday prizes -- New York and California -- along with major Northeastern states New Jersey and Massachusetts and four other primaries in the South and West .
But her rival , Sen. Barack Obama , upset Clinton in Missouri and swept caucuses across the Plains and Rocky Mountain states , as well as taking his home state of Illinois and two Southern states , Alabama and Georgia .
Each of the Democratic contenders has raised more than $ 100 million to date .
Clinton had $ 38 million in cash on hand at the end of the year , but at least $ 20 million of that was set aside for the general election , meaning it can't be spent on the primaries .

Analysis : Split decision may help Obama Super Tuesday results
Clinton particularly appeared to savor her win in Massachusetts , where Obama had the support of the state 's top Democrats -- Sen. Edward Kennedy ; Sen. John Kerry , the party 's 2004 presidential nominee ; and Gov. Deval Patrick .
Watch candidates tout Super Tuesday results »
Obama had been closing the gap with front - runner Clinton in late polls , but she held on to win by a 15 - point margin .
Clinton was in suburban Washington to campaign in next week 's primaries in the Chesapeake Bay region -- Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia .
With Virginia 's governor , Tim Kaine , backing Obama , Clinton used her appearance to portray her rival as the party 's " establishment " candidate Wednesday .
" I think , look , it 's wonderful to have endorsers and supporters , " she said .
" But , at the end of the day , this is a decision between two real people .
It 's our names that are going to be on the ballot , nobody else 's , and people are going to have to look at us and decide who they believe would be the best president . "
Clinton 's lead in Tuesday 's big states gave her the edge over Obama in delegates to the Democratic Party 's nominating convention , according to CNN estimates .
But because of the party 's allocation system and Obama 's larger number of victories in smaller states , her lead was fewer than 100 of the 1,500 - plus delegates awarded to date .
Results from one contest , the New Mexico primary , remained incomplete and too close to call Wednesday afternoon .

PALM BAY 
An accidental push of a button Friday had students at Palm Bay High questioning what they 'd done wrong and parents plotting punishments .
Parents of all 2,550 students in the school received an automated call Friday reminding them that their student had to report for Saturday morning detention .
Problem was , the message only should have gone to 16 homes .
" One of my friends texted me to ask if I had Saturday detention , " said Robert Lenoci , 15 , of Valkaria .
The sophomore is going to the state science fair finals and has n't been in trouble before .
" I looked and I had a message from mom .
She was asking , ' What did you do ? '
It was pretty bad , " he said .
Robert 's mother calmed down after talking with other parents and learning something was amiss .
Amy Stewart said after the call that she confronted her son , Jimmy , and he pleaded innocent .
" He said he did n't do anything , but I took him Saturday morning anyway , " she said .
About 40 students showed up .
That 's when Stewart and dozens of other parents learned of the glitch .
" I had yelled at him .
I felt so bad , I took him out for breakfast , " Stewart said .
Steve Muzzy , assistant superintendent for information technology , said the parent notification system purchased about six years ago from Synrevoice Technology of Canada averages 20,000 calls a week .
He said half are for student absences and the rest for things such as overdue library materials , school calendar events or for emergency communications .
" Very , very rarely do we run across any problems .
This was an unfortunate human mistake , " he said .
School officials said an employee apparently selected the wrong field , sending the message to all students .
Principal John Thomas said by the time the error was discovered , it was 9:30 p.m. and too late to call everyone .
But he did send an apology via the system during the weekend .
The 7 to 9 a.m. detention on Saturdays has been in place for some time , for such infractions as repeatedly being late for class .
But the automated system has been used for notification for only about two months .
Stewart just wants to make sure there is no suspension on her son 's school record .
" I would hope there would n't be , " she said .

The latest weapon in MADD ’s " War on Drunk Driving " :
Senate Measure Would Ban Lawyers from DUI Advertising Nashville , TN .
AP , April 22 — Defense attorneys would be banned from advertising their expertise with drunken driving cases under a bill advancing in the Senate .
Sen . Rosalind Kurita , a Clarksville Democrat , successfully added the provision to a bill that would create an online registry of repeat DUI offenders in Tennessee .
Kurita says officials have a hard enough time convicting drunken drivers without lawyers advertising their expertise in the field and offering discounts to DUI defendants …
In another article appearing hours later , Senator Kurita explained her reasoning : " Kurita said she pushed for the amendment because she was tired of suspected DUI offenders not being convicted . "
Imagine that : A citizen accused of a crime who is not convicted .
Intolerable !
There oughta be a law against that .
Another rational solution to the drunk driving problem …

Sex and Death in SeaTac A Report from the Northwest 's Biggest Sci-Fi Convention
" Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side , kid . "
Malcolm Smith
My Saturday evening officially started when a woman in a SeaTac hotel bar intentionally lit her friend 's Afro on fire .
Everyone at the table thought it was hilarious , laughing wildly as the man patted the fire out and a scowling waitress came over and sprayed Febreze to cover up the perm smell .
It was an appropriate harbinger for the wild parties to come later in the night , including a penthouse celebration attended by an inflatable alien sex doll ; a wet T - shirt contest ; a slave auction afterparty with densely alcoholic punch and people fucking in the bathroom while , in the doorway , bare - assed men in S&M outfits flirted with women in vinyl nurse costumes .
It was my first science - fiction convention , and thanks to a not - entirely - abstinent designated driver , I barely made it home alive .
Nearly 4,000 people attended the four - day - long , 31st annual Norwescon over Easter weekend .
Their costumes and many of the convention 's panels were devoted to television shows and movies , but the level of literary discourse was high : there were seminars that lovingly discussed the work of H.P. Lovecraft or the history of Beowulf ( the poem , not the movie ) .
Other panels were devoted to more esoteric literary pursuits , like fanfic , wherein fans write the further ( very often erotic ) adventures of characters from beloved sci-fi properties like Star Trek , Kim Possible , and Back to the Future and post them online for others to read .
Many of the writers were teenage girls ; one of them announced at the beginning of the panel that if it were n't for her Harry Potter fanfic habit , " I probably would 've already hurt somebody in my school or killed myself . "
The centerpiece of the convention , as always , was the Philip K. Dick Award ceremony .
The prize , dedicated to recognizing outstanding paperback originals within the genre , frequently recognizes truly great books ; in last week 's Stranger , I said that they were " possibly the only book awards in the world that actually do exactly what they 're supposed to do . "
Sadly , this year 's ceremony was a letdown :
The book that should have won — Jon Armstrong 's debut thriller , Grey , which had been shortlisted — did n't .
It did n't even make second place .
Instead , the second - place winner was the mundane and nearly unreadable superhero satire From the Notebooks of Dr. Brain , by someone who writes under the name Minister Faust , and the top prize went to M. John Harrison 's Nova Swing .
This can only be justified as a late award for his much better previous novel , Light .
But whatever .
You know that moment when you 're really getting into a conversation about books and the other person 's face lights up ?
That look that says , " This person has shared my solitary experience , and so I am less alone " ?
Norwescon is lit with those sorts of faces , of people normally dedicated to lonely pursuits suddenly not feeling alone .
At a panel called " LGBT in Fandom , " many attendees said that they were more open about their sexuality at conventions than in their real lives , because they felt like they could do anything — from the cross - dressing man to the woman who wanted to hold hands with her female lover and not fear repercussions — in an environment so accepting and safe .
This accepting , ecstatic environment creates a lot of sexual activity , of course .
A panel about fandom hookups explained both the basics ( " You really must bathe and use deodorant , " one female panelist announced , " because if you do n't take care of your body , nobody else is going to let you take care of theirs " ) and the more advanced ( " Your hotel room 's curtain rods and sprinkler heads are not strong enough to withstand bondage , " she said later , adding , " Hotel beds can flip over pretty easily " ) .
Throughout the weekend , furries proudly declared their proclivities , and it was not unusual to see a Stormtrooper heavily making out with a pirate queen in the hotel lobby in the later hours .
There 's more to it than sex , of course :
On Easter Sunday , after most of the hungover revelers had left for home , some older convention - goers gathered in a small room lit by electric candles to hold a memorial service .
They told stories about fellow fans who had passed in the last year , and they also remembered authors who had died : Arthur C. Clarke , of course , but George MacDonald Fraser , too , and Robert Anton Wilson .
The mourners teared up and laughed , talking about the departed authors and their friends with equal affection .
Near the end , the moderator cleared his throat and said , " I guess we 'll see them again one day at the big sci - fi convention in the sky . "

The US 's most senior general was " hoodwinked " by top Bush administration officials determined to push through aggressive interrogation techniques for terror suspects held at Guantánamo Bay , the Guardian can reveal .
The development led to the US military abandoning its age - old ban on the cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners .
General Richard Myers , the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff from 2001 to 2005 , wrongly believed that inmates at Guantánamo and other prisons were protected by the Geneva conventions and from abuse tantamount to torture .
The way he was duped by senior officials in Washington - who believed the Geneva conventions and other traditional safeguards were out of date - is disclosed in a devastating account of their role , extracts from which will be published in tomorrow 's Guardian .
In his new book , Torture Team , Philippe Sands QC , a professor of law at University College London , reveals :
 Senior figures in the Bush administration pushed through previously outlawed measures with the help of unqualified and inexperienced military officials at Guantánamo .
 Myers believes he was a victim of " intrigue " by top lawyers at the department of justice , the office of the vice president , Dick Cheney , and Donald Rumsfeld 's defence department .
 Myers wrongly believed interrogation techniques had been taken from the army 's field manual .
The lawyers who pushed through the interrogation techniques - all of them political appointees - were Alberto Gonzales , David Addingon and William Haynes .
Others involved were Doug Feith , Rumsfeld 's undersecretary for policy , and Jay Bybee and John Yoo , two assistant attorney generals .
The revelations have already sparked a fierce response in the US from those familiar with the contents of the book .
They are determined to establish accountability for the way the Bush administration violated international and domestic law by sanctioning prisoner abuse and torture .
The Bush administration has tried to explain away the ill - treatment of detainees at Guantánamo and the Abu Ghraib prison , in Baghdad , by blaming junior officials .
Sands establishes that pressure for the aggressive and cruel treatment of detainees came from the very top and was sanctioned by the most senior lawyers .
Myers , the most senior military officer of the most powerful country in the world , was one top official who did not understand the implications of what was being done .
Sands , who spent three hours with the former general , describes him as being " confused " about the decisions that were taken .
Myers did not realise that fundamental safeguards provided by the Geneva conventions and elsewhere were being abandoned by his own junior officers as well as political appointees in the administration , the author says .
He believed new techniques recommended by Haynes and authorised for use by the military at Guantánamo by Rumsfeld in December 2002 had been taken from the US army field manual .
Hopwever , none of the severe interrogation techniques came from the manual , and all breached established US military guidelines and rules .
The techniques included hooding , sensory deprivation and physical and mental abuse .
" As we worked through the list of techniques , Myers became increasingly hesitant and troubled , " Sands writes .
" Haynes and Rumsfeld had been able to run rings around him . "
Myers and his closest advisers were cut out of the decision - making process , so he was not given suffficient opportunity to object to measures he now says he strongly disapproved of .
He did not know that Bush administration officials were changing the rules allowing interrogation techniques , including the use of dogs , amounting to torture .
" We never authorised torture , we just did n't , not what we would do , " Myers said .
Sands comments : " [ Myers ] really had taken his eye off the ball ... he did n't ask too many questions , or inquire too deeply , and kept his distance from the decision - making process . "

Removing a single protein prevents early damage in blood vessels from triggering a later - stage , frequently lethal complication of atherosclerosis , according to research published online today in the journal Nature Medicine .
By eliminating the gene for a signaling protein called cyclophilin A ( CypA ) from a strain of mice , researchers were able to provide complete protection against abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) .
The aorta is the main artery carrying blood from the heart , and AAA is a progressive outward dilation of the aorta under the stress of blood pressure due to a breakdown in the vessel ’s structural integrity .
AAA leads to 15,000 deaths a year , mostly in aging men , when aneurysms rupture to spill blood into the abdomen , a fatal event in 90 percent of cases .
Adding to the study ’s importance , AAA shares vital biochemical pathways with atherosclerosis , the leading cause of heart attack and stroke .
Thus , drugs that target CypA could potentially address both AAA and atherosclerosis .
When study mice were engineered to remove their CypA gene , none from that group developed AAA in the face of the hypertension and high cholesterol known to accelerate it .
In contrast , 78 percent of mice with “ normal ” amounts of CypA developed AAA under the same conditions , 35 percent with a fatal rupture .
The team also found high CypA levels in the rupture - prone vessels of humans with AAA , and that major drugs like statins reduce CypA levels , which may partly explain their benefit .
“ It is extremely unusual for the removal of one protein to provide absolute protection , but it makes perfect sense because cyclophilin A promotes three of the most destructive forces in blood vessels – oxidative stress , inflammation and matrix degradation , ” said Bradford C. Berk , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of Medicine within the Aab Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of Rochester Medical Center , and senior author of the study .
“ We are working to design anti-CypA drugs that will diminish the disease processes underlying AAA , atherosclerosis and hypertension . ”
Stress Relief
While a complete understanding of the initial triggers of blood vessel damage remains elusive , damaged vessels produce more reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , molecules that oxidize many molecules they encounter , changing their function .
Human cells have evolved to harness oxidation to control life processes like wound healing , and to send signals within cells and between cells .
The theory gaining strength since the early 1990s is that disease - related overproduction of ROS ( oxidative stress ) damages organs by destroying cell components , triggering cells to self - destruct and promoting inflammatory cell signaling .
Among the hormones best known to stimulate oxidative stress in blood vessels is angiotensin II .
In AAA , past studies have confirmed that angiotensin II , in part by driving up ROS production , excessively turns on enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) .
As part of normal healing , MMPs chew through strong flexible proteins like elastin that give tissues shape ( extracellular matrix ) to make room for new growth .
That process goes too far in an aneurysm , as ROS drive MMPs to degrade the matrix structure of the vessel wall .
In atherosclerosis , overactive MMPs digest the structural barriers in vessel walls that contain smooth muscle cells , which frees them to contribute to vessel - clogging plaques .
When blood vessels eventually become completely blocked , heart attacks and strokes occur .
Also as part of both AAA and atherosclerosis , angiotensin II causes immune cells to home in on the blood vessel wall in the process called inflammation .
While designed to fight infection , immune cells often mistakenly contribute to disease , in some cases by secreting chemicals called cytokines that kill cells outright , and that also signal for more immune cells to home in on the site of damage or infection .
The current study sought to answer the question : can angiotensin II achieve these disease - causing effects if CypA is not there to pass on its message ?
To clarify the role of CypA , Berk ’s team engineered mice to no longer produce apolipoprotein E , which increased their cholesterol levels and made them prone to atherosclerosis .
From this original line , the team further engineered one group with no CypA , another with extra CypA and compared both to “ normal ” mice as all were treated for a month with angiotensin II ( known to raise blood pressure and accelerate AAA ) .
Mice lacking CypA saw greater than 75 percent decreases in ROS production , MMP activation and inflammatory cell influx compared to normal mice , with the opposite being true for mice with extra CypA .
Angiotensin II treatment also dramatically increased expression of cytokines ( e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) ) , unless CypA was missing .
“ Our lab has been studying CypA since the early 1990s , ” Berk said .
“ We had to determine that vessel walls were secreting something in response to ROS , then prove it was CypA , then prove CypA was required for oxidative stress and inflammation to take their toll in live animals .
Our results should put an end to debates within the field and pharmaceutical companies about whether we have found a vital new role for this well known molecule .
Incredibly , CypA is required both inside and outside of cells to promote angiotensin II - mediated pathogenic effects in vessel walls . ”
Berk and colleagues propose that ROS generated via angiotensin II trigger CypA secretion from smooth muscle cells in vessel walls .
Once outside the cell , CypA docks into CypA receptor proteins on the same cells to increase ROS production in a vicious cycle .
When a signaling molecule docks into its receptor , like a key turning a lock , it changes the receptor ’s shape such that signals get passed on .
Most drugs work by interfering with receptors , and Berk ’s team is searching for the specific CypA receptors that , if interfered with , would shut down ROS production , CypA secretion , MMP activation and inflammatory cell recruitment in AAA .
Also in the next phase , Berk expects to complete a study shortly that will confirm CypA deficiency significantly slows the progression of atherosclerosis .
Along with first author Kimio Satoh , M.D. , Ph.D. , and Berk , the paper was co-authored by Tetsuya Matoba , M.D. , Ph.D. ; Michael O’Dell , B.S. ; Patrizia Nigro , Ph.D. ; Zhaoqiang Cui , Ph.D. ; Xi Shi , Ph.D. ; Amy Mohan , B.S. ; Chen Yan , Ph.D. ; Jun-ichi Abe , M.D. , Ph.D. and Karl Illig , M.D. , all within the Aab CVRI and the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry .
The work was supported by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , part of the National Institutes of Health , and by the Japan Heart Foundation .
“ Currently available and experimental therapies , including ACE inhibitors and antagonists of the angiotensin receptors , MCP - 1 and MMPs have significant limits in terms of efficacy in AAA , and thus , CypA inhibitors have the potential to meet significant unmet need , ” Berk said .
“ Additionally , inhibition of CypA looks to have tremendous benefit in several diseases that involve blood vessels in the brain and heart .
Furthermore , while drugs that inhibit CypA may overlap somewhat with other drugs targeting the same angiotensin II pathway , they also look to have additive effects that create potential for combination therapies . ”

Silence is golden , but it 's under threat in a world where as business booms and prosperity looms , noise is growing .
A composer recently described how orchestras find it impossible to play a piece of her music .
The problem is not that she has written too many notes .
Neither is it that she requires unusual musical instruments .
Rather , it is that in the piece she has written 25 seconds of silence .
The pause is intended to build tension .
But when they see it , she said , conductors baulk .
They fear that musicians would n't know what to make of it , and worse , that audiences would n't be able to take it .
Over such a long period of time , a concert hall would be plunged into near panic .
When the last episode of the Sopranos was broadcast this year , finishing with a sudden cut to black and silence , many baffled viewers assumed there was a fault with the signal .
Lewis Hamilton is moving to Switzerland for a quieter life
We live in a society with a growing aversion to the emptiness that comes not just with silence but , more generally , with a fear of not knowing what to say .
Consider what might mark someone out as your best friend .
For some , it is the person who they do n't see for some time and yet , when they do , it is like they have never been apart .
Perhaps more commonly today , in the era of mass mobile communication , a best friend is someone with whom you are in constant contact , texting or messaging as automatically as breathing .
But there was a time when it was said that a true friend is someone with whom you can sit in complete silence , without a hint of embarrassment or need to fill the space .
Silence as sin
Then there are politicians .
For them , to be caught off guard in front of the cameras could result in nothing less than the curtailing of a career .
Alastair Campbell famously filled the political day with the " grid " .
He argued that 24 - hour news loathes a vacuum and that if he did not fill it , an editor or producer would .
That is undoubtedly true .
But as Douglas Hurd has observed , on some subjects silence might not only be a good policy , it might be more honest .
" Silence is regarded as a sort of sin now , and it has to be filled with a lot of gossip and sound bites , " he has written .
Some people are ready to defend their right to quiet
Not knowing what to say can be social death , as well as political .
Everyone can remember a time when they got into a tangle over something , and then - horror of horrors - they then said the wrong thing ; they were in a hole and could not stop digging .
It can be amusing to watch .
Probably the most famous episode of the classic comedy Fawlty Towers was built around Basil Fawlty , played by John Cleese , trying not to talk about the war .
" Do n't mention the war ! " , he endlessly repeated and mentioned nothing but , because he could not just shut - up .
Research suggests that there is a connection between the wealth of a society and the levels of noise within it .
A project at Sheffield Hallam University tracked the levels of noise in UK for a number of years .
It is rising - in Sheffield city centre , for example , by 3 decibels in 10 years .
Firework hell
A report from the Noise Association this month says that sound levels on the Piccadilly Line of London 's underground can exceed that of a jet taking off at Heathrow Airport .
And complaints about noise from domestic premises rose almost fivefold in the twenty years up 2005 in England and Wales , according to the UK government .
Then there is Bonfire Night and fireworks .
" All the surveys show that people are concerned about noise , " Val Weedon , National Coordinator for the UK Noise Association says .
" The fireworks issue is an example of that .
Thousands of people contact their MPs about it getting out of control . "
Planes are loud but so is public transport
Now , for all that we can hate it , it might be that we use noise and chatter to protect ourselves .
There are people who can't stop talking and would panic if they did .
And then there are iPods and Walkmans that create a bubble of noise to keep the outside world out .
Some users might even be listening to Simon and Garfunkel singing their song , Sound of Silence : " People talking without speaking , People hearing without listening . "
But does this matter ?
I think it does .
I know a monk .
He spends the majority of his day not talking .
The aim is that he lives in quietude punctuated by periods of noise - when in chapel or talking with his brethren .
A more usual way of life is exactly the opposite , for most people live in noise and occasionally seek out silence .
Speech is shallow
For a monk , not talking has an intrinsic value , since it is then that he is able to listen , notably to the " still , small voice of God " .
To put it in secular terms , silence is necessary in order to perceive and understand things .
As Thomas Carlyle wrote : " Under all speech that is good for anything there lies a silence that is better .
Silence is deep as Eternity ; speech is shallow as time . "
That , then , might be the most profound worry about rising noise levels in our society : it stops us from thinking .
Or to put it differently , the next time you do n't know what to say , do n't be alarmed .
Try saying nothing .
Mark Vernon is the author of What Not To Say : Finding the Right Words at Difficult Moments .
After meditating for many years I am still constantly amazed by the richness of silence .
If one takes the time to be in silence noticing sensations , sounds , thoughts and feelings we will see that silence is the condition or quality of being .
Being human .
We seem to have largely lost our ability to be and feel the need to do and see silence as moments filled with nothing opposed to being filled with an abundance of what it is to be human .
After all we are human beings and not human doings ...
Mike Visagie , Manchester
There seems to be an aversion to silence .
All anyone need do is notice how many people seem unable to relax in their back garden without throwing open the patio doors to let their hi- fi blast out , or those who are unable to clean their car without having its stereo switched on .

There should be a petition to stop the introduction of ' ibus ' on london buses .
Every time the bus stops a loud speaker will announce the number of the bus , it 's detination and the current stop .
All irrelevant information , continuosly repeated to completely ruin your journey .
Paul Dimitriou , london
Windchimes .
Why do I have to put up with my neighbours windchimes day and night ?
I have to listen to them clanging away even when my neighbours are n't home .
I long to hear nothing .
Paula Taylor , Los Angeles ( expat )
I love silence and it 's definitely more difficult to find .
I do n't own an MP3 player or anything like that because when I 'm on the bus I prefer to think and ponder .
I 'm amazed at the inanity of the chatter on mobile phones on public transport .
It 's usually , " I 'm almost at Princes St. " or " I 'm passing a KFC right now " .
I doubt that many people have epiphanies on the bus , so why does the prospect of a little time for introspection and self - reflection scare so many people ?
Bring back daydreaming !
Ben , Edinburgh
I yearn for silence - to have that peace and quiet - a space in my head to turn off the thoughts .
If only that were possible - to bring the thoughts to a standstill - to allow total silence in my head .
Even in sleep the dreams can be constant - the subconscious thoughts .
I love the analogy of not seeing a good friend for a while and then carrying on just where you last left off .
I have several friends like that ; life 's busyness gets in the way , but when you do chance or plan to meet up , you can just pick up the connection and carry on .
Meditiation and prayer that allows us to hear what messages we need to hear , instead of always asking and thinking and analysing is what is needed in today 's busy world .
Liz Harris , Tunbridge Wells , UK
I think that Douglas Adams got it scarily correct when a race of people talked incessently in order to stop their brains working , I think we use all the noise as an excuse to turn our brains off .
Turn on , tune in drop out - maybe we should turn off drop in and start thinking again .
Kay , Bampton , Oxon
It amazes me how anti-social people are on public transport by playing ipods way too loud .
Tip for ipod users : think about your fellow passengers !
Buy some decent headphones , and keep it at a reasonable level .
Yes , you may be relaxing after a day at work on your way home , but so am I when I 'm trying to read a book , with your tinny beat infringing on my journey .
Dan Maguire , Leeds
Noise is a huge part of modern life and it causes a lot of stress .
People have lost touch with nature and peace , it would do everyone a lot of good if they spent at least half an hour a day sitting still , eyes closed doing NOTHING !
In other words , meditating and clearing their minds of all the things that clutter up their heads .
A bit of peace and quiet goes a long way to restore health and harmony in ones life !
Give it a go !
Angie Grainger , London
I 'd like to sit in silence on the bus and read my book .
But I am forced to listen to a walkman in order to drown out the noise of other people talking on the phone , or worse still listening to music through the loudspeakers of their phone .
Noise begets noise .
It also begets violence .
If I could get away with it , I 'd cheerfully kill the person next to me who forces the banal details of his life upon me in a one - sided telephone conversation .
I 'd probably be racking up 20 or 30 murders a day though ...
Lawrence Napper , London
I agree that silence is golden and that the world has become far too noisy .
I thought there were laws about fireworks .
Why can't the excessively noisy ones be let off earlier in the evening and not saved until the end at midight !
Also , I work in an solicitors ' office with four other women , two radios and four computers .
The most wonderful parts of the day are early morning before the others arrive - silence !
and if I 'm lucky when they all go out to lunch and leave me alone to turn off the radio and enjoy the SILENCE .....!
I thought I was alone in wishing there was more of it .
At work I want to suggest a rota where we could choose a radio station for a day ( as none of us agree which one to listen to ) .
On my day we would turn the radio off !
Pauline Jones , Abbey Wood London UK
I agree with the bit about fireworks .
This year they have been louder , gone on for longer and have quite literally shook my windows at times !
It 's called bonfire NIGHT - so it should be for one night - not four or five .
Fireworks should also only be sold to organised displays not individuals who run amock around the streets !
Sharon , Teddington
The week before last I was in Tenerife and , whilst Hiking up Mount Teide appreciated the ability to stand still and hear absolutely nothing ( If you do n't count my heart pounding like mad because of the exertion at altitude )
It really does make you realise what a noisy environment we live in .

Trucker Dan is proposing a National Trucking Shutdown as follows :
April 1 , 2008 is when My trucking
Co & thousands of others are shutting down at 8 AM on that date .
From that time on we will no longer accept any loads at ANY price until such time as our FED Gov admits & puts into action a plan that will give all O / Os some help .
Here is what I would like to see happen ,
1# suspend ALL Fed & State fuel taxes until such time that this economy is back on its feet
2# Fed create a FED Oversight Committee to oversee Ins Premiums Charged for Class 8 trucks Insurance
3# Stop allowing Large Trucking Fleets to self Insure , this would make a more level playing field for all trucking Cos
4# Fed Regulations for Brokers & Shippers that are enforced , with set max amounts they can charge .
5# Standardized Fines from Coast to Coast for safety violations .
In other words if a log ticket cost $ 50.00 in Missouri then a log ticket in California should only cost $ 50.00
I will not return to hauling until our Gov. the people we put into office gets off their butts an does something to help this Industry my email address is dlittle@uscattlehaulers.com
Send me an email if you plan on shutting down on April 1 , 2008
Some are asking what date is the shutdown & what will happen ?
Here 's the what , why , & when of it .
The reason for this shutdown is not to hurt this country in any way shape or form .
But is in fact a peaceful method of sending a message to Washington , D.C.
That we do indeed need help & our industry is the backbone of life in America as we know it .
The why of it covers issues that you & I as truckers , both O / Os & Co. drivers face on a daily basis .
These problems range from excessive Regulations ie. , Fuel , Federal & State Fuel tax 's , excessive DOT regulations on NON - SAFETY related items , Excessive Insurance Pre. ,
The list goes on & on .
The when of it , is APRIL 1st , 2008 { see www.uscattlehaulers.com } I & several others picked that date for a reason .
April 1,2008 is Aprils Fools Day , that being said , we as an industry are going to send a Strong message to the otherwise FOOLS in Washington , D.C. that " enough is enough "
We Will Be Heard .
I & Thousands of You have been telling people for Years now , that a change needed to take place .
Well , here 's your chance to Stand Up for Yourself & let The World know We will Stand Strong .
" one for all and all for one "
Thank You & God Bless each & Everyone of you ,

With the price of gasoline up over 40 % since the beginning of the year , many people are trying to find new ways to save money at the pump .
While many of these ideas are useful and worth the extra effort – i.e. adjusting your commuting time , cleaning out your car ’s trunk , turning off your car at long stop lights – many driving habits that people think will help them saveÂ gas or moneyÂ are actually causing them to waste both .
So on that note , here are the top four ways people think they ’re saving money and / or gas when they ’re actually not :
Driving across town to save a nickel on a gallon of gas .
With gas prices at record highs , many people are doing everything they can to reduce the amount of money they spend at the pump .
One of the more popular ways people are doing this is by using sites like Gasbuddy.com to find the cheapest gas stations in their zip code .
Unfortunately , many of these same people are driving long distances to save a couple of pennies on a gallon of gas – meaning they ’re probably burning up the amount of money they save by using extra gas to go to an out of the way station .
Driving on the highway with their windows down to avoid using the air conditioner .
We ’ve become accustomed to thinking that our car ’s AC is the biggest drain on our car ’s gas mileage .
While using it will reduce your gas mileage , there are many instances where using your AC instead of rolling down the windows will actually be better for your car ’s gas mileage .
One of the biggest drains on your car ’s gas mileage is aerodynamic drag – something that is exacerbated by rolling down the windows .
If you ’re going to drive on the highway , go ahead and turn on your AC and keep the windows up !
Driving with their truck ’s tailgate down .
Many people believe that driving with their truck ’s tailgate down will improve gas mileage .
Unfortunately , the opposite is actually true .
When a truck ’s tailgate is up , a “ protective air bubble ” will form in the bed area which actually makes the truck a little more aerodynamic ; when the tailgate is down , this bubble disappears and gas mileage gets worse .
Accelerating extremely slowly .
Many people think that the slower they accelerate , the better gas mileage they ’re going to get .
Unfortunately , extremely slow acceleration can bog down your engine and make it run less efficiently – thus wasting fuel .
So , instead of slamming the accelerator to the floor or barely even touching it , try and find a nice happy medium so you can achieve a moderate acceleration .
So , if you ’ve been doing the aforementioned items , I certainly can’t fault you for trying to save gas and money , however , there ’s a reason why you have n’t seen much of a savings – these ideas just do n’t work .

A new poll released today by the Harvard University Institute of Politics found that Barack Obama dominates among young voters who planned to vote in the Democratic Primary .
Those aged 18 - 24 favored Obama over Clinton by a 70% - 30 % margin .
Most interesting is that Obama leads McCain 53 % - 32 % in a hypothetical general election matchup .
When matched up with McCain , Hillary Clinton does much worse than Obama among younger voters .
Clinton leads McCain 44%-39 % .
There has been a big shift in the matchup between Clinton and Obama .
When this same poll was done last fall Obama had a small 5 % lead over Clinton 38% - 33 % .
The youth vote not only went for Obama , but the Democratic Party has seen a youth explosion motivated by Obama ’s candidacy .
The economy has replaced the Iraq war as the number one issue among these voters .
Last fall 37 % of those surveyed said that Iraq was the number one issue .
Now the economy is the top issue for 30 % of those asked , and the Iraq war is the top issue for 20 % of respondents .
Concern over healthcare has remained unchanged with 10 % most concerned last fall , and 9 % still listing it as their top issue today .
Advertisements
It is no surprise that young people support Obama , but it interesting that much of this youth support is Obama support , not Democratic support .
I think the Party needs to keep this in mind as they weigh arguments from the Clinton campaign that she should be the nominee .
Younger people usually are n’t worried about healthcare , but for soon to be , or recent college graduates , this economy is brutal .
What we are seeing is a youth movement that has the potential to fundamentally change the face of the Democratic Party .
I consider this poll more evidence of the ongoing generational battle for control of the Democratic Party .

The British public gives more to a Devon - based donkey sanctuary than the most prominent charities trying to combat violence and abuse against women , a report released today by a leading philanthropy watchdog reveals .
New Philanthropy Capital ( NPC ) has calculated that more than 7 million women have been affected by domestic violence but found that Refuge , the Women 's Aid Federation and Eaves Housing for Women have a combined annual income of just £ 17 m .
By contrast the Donkey Sanctuary , which has looked after 12,000 donkeys , received £ 20 m in 2006 .
NPC estimates the cost to society of domestic abuse , sexual violence , forced marriage , trafficking and honour crimes has reached £ 40 bn a year - greater than the country 's defence budget .
" As a society we are not spending enough on this issue whether through charities or the government , " said Justine Järvinen , the author of the report .
" Violence against women appears regularly as the subject of media reports and in the storylines of soap operas but rarely does it come up in normal conversation , which suggests there is a stigma around it .
The truth is it is very common . "
Every year 1.5 million women experience domestic abuse at least once , 800,000 are sexually assaulted and 100,000 raped , the report states .
More than one in four women has experienced at least one incident of domestic violence by a current or former partner , which means 7.4 million women in the UK have suffered domestic abuse , according to government figures .
The NPC was established by former executives of Goldman Sachs to analyse the effectiveness of charities for wealthy donors and has calculated the cost of this abuse at £ 40 bn a year .
This is made up of £ 10bn for the cost of lost economic output caused by abuse as well as the police work , court cases and psychological and physical healthcare arising from the abuse .
Victims may also place greater demands on housing and benefit budgets if they have to move away , often with children , from a shared home with the abuser .
NPC has calculated the emotional cost of abuse of women is £ 30 bn a year , using accepted measures devised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for translating emotional cost into financial cost .
Sexual violence accounts for £ 26bn of the cost with domestic violence accounting for £ 20bn .
Prostitution , trafficking and violence against black and ethnic minority women accounts for the rest .
" The government has a responsibility to change attitudes and prevent abuse from happening in the first place , " said Järvinen .
" A third of men think that domestic violence is acceptable if their partner has been nagging them . "
Today 's report references an ICM poll which found that more people would call the police if someone was mistreating their dog than if someone was mistreating their partner .
NPC is calling for concerted government action to tackle violence against women and is urging charitable donors to divert more to non-governmental organisations in the sector .
It said that the 200 largest charities which provide services for abused women or campaign to prevent abuse have a combined annual income of £ 97 m .
That compares with £ 110 m for the RSPCA , £ 149 m for the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and £ 83 m for the Royal Opera House .
This morning the Fed announced yet another new program to provide liquidity to failing markets .
The program is called the Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) .
The Federal Reserve announced today an expansion of its securities lending program .
Under this new Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) , the Federal Reserve will lend up to $ 200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days ( rather than overnight , as in the existing program ) by a pledge of other securities , including federal agency debt , federal agency residential - mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , and non-agency AAA / Aaa-rated private - label residential MBS .
The TSLF is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally .
As is the case with the current securities lending program , securities will be made available through an auction process .
Auctions will be held on a weekly basis , beginning on March 27 , 2008 .
The Federal Reserve will consult with primary dealers on technical design features of the TSLF .
In addition , the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in its existing temporary reciprocal currency arrangements ( swap lines ) with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) .
These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $ 30 billion and $ 6 billion to the ECB and the SNB , respectively , representing increases of $ 10 billion and $ 2 billion .
The FOMC extended the term of these swap lines through September 30 , 2008 .
Pulling Out All The Stops
Two quick observations this morning regarding the Fed announcement : First , as I write the headline on Marketwatch reads " The Fed Pulling Out All The Stops . "
While the short covering rally will suggest euphoria , I can not emphasize enough how much the regulators have raised the stakes this morning .
As any church organist will tell you , you can't make the sound any louder once you " pull out all the stops . "
Second , and just as important , the line - up of regulatory participants in this morning 's actions spanned the globe - from the ECB to the Bank of England to the Bank of Canada to the Bank of Japan : an unprecedented step .
By my count these central banks , along with the Fed , manage the monetary policy for economies representing almost 90 % of global GDP .
Anyone still harboring the notion of " decoupling " may want to reflect on the implications of today 's actions .
Running Out Of Bullets
The Fed is taking this step to avoid complete financial collapse .
That much is becoming evident very quickly .
They are using up their bullets much more quickly than they want to , thus confirming the severity of the state of the financial system , something Minyanville has been pointing out for some time .
Their last bullet comes when they directly lend to some major institution in a big way to avoid its collapse .
As far as this move , it does nothing to solve the solvency issue .
The Fed is just saying we will take that risk for the market .
That is very similar to nationalization .
The irony is that the Fed continues to address the situation as if it is a dislocation from fundamentals ( or they continue to hope that people view it that way .
In actuality this is exactly what should be happening to these credits : the market should destroy them .
The government will never give up trying to forestall the inevitable , but that does not mean they have the power to do so .
Stay the course :
It is still early in this unwind with more flawed logic from the government to come .

BAGHDAD — Staff Sgt. David Safstrom does not regret his previous tours in Iraq , not even a difficult second stint when two comrades were killed while trying to capture insurgents .
“ In Mosul , in 2003 , it felt like we were making the city a better place , ” he said .
“ There was no sectarian violence , Saddam was gone , we were tracking down the bad guys .
It felt awesome . ”
But now on his third deployment in Iraq , he is no longer a believer in the mission .
The pivotal moment came , he says , this past February when soldiers killed a man setting a roadside bomb .
When they searched the bomber ’s body , they found identification showing him to be a sergeant in the Iraqi Army .
“ I thought , ‘ What are we doing here ?
Why are we still here ? ’ ” said Sergeant Safstrom , a member of Delta Company of the First Battalion , 325th Airborne Infantry , 82nd Airborne Division .
“ We ’re helping guys that are trying to kill us .
We help them in the day .
They turn around at night and try to kill us . ”
Here 's the first paragraph from Barack Obama 's speech this a.m. in New York :
I want to thank Mayor Bloomberg for his extraordinary leadership .
At a time when Washington is divided in old ideological battles , he shows us what can be achieved when we bring people together to seek pragmatic solutions .
Not only has he been a remarkable leader for New York –he has established himself as a major voice in our national debate on issues like renewing our economy , educating our children , and seeking energy independence .
Mr. Mayor , I share your determination to bring this country together to finally make progress for the American people .
The First Read gang is all a - buzz at the Obama - Needs - A - Jew - On - The - Ticket - Angle , but I think the best way to look at an Obama - Bloomberg ticket is by noticing their complimentary traits .
Obama is n't much of an administrator or a details guy by his own admission , while Bloomberg is so concerned about Your Health and Welfare that he studies intently the ins and outs of congestion pricing and trans - fats .
He 's a prime minister - type -- although he brings an outsider 's sense of efficiency to the bureaucracy .
Let Obama be the vision guy ; Bloomberg could be the brass - tacks administrator .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
I suggest that the only books that influence us are those for which we are ready , and which have gone a little further down our particular path than we have gone ourselves .

“ In the beginning doth the Magus speak Truth , and send forth Illusion and Falsehood to enslave the soul .
Yet therein is the Mystery of Redemption . ” — Aleister Crowley , Liber B vel Magi , sub Figura I , v. 1
Summary Overview
The Law of Thelema was revealed to the world by a praeterhuman Intelligence calling himself Aiwass in Cairo , Egypt in March and April , 1904 e.v.
Aiwass appeared first to Rose Edith Kelly nee Crowley , in an altered state of consciousness ( ASC ) , and subsequently to the British poet and magical adept , Aleister Crowley ( born in Leamington , England on October 12 , 1875 e.v. ) .
Aiwass proceeded to demonstrate his objective existence independently of the psyches of both Crowley and Rose , by leading them to the stele of Ankh - af - na - khonsu , a Theban Egyptian priest of the 8th century B.C.E. , in the Boulak Museum , where they had never been .
He then dictated a sacred text to Crowley called the Book of the Law .
For five years thereafter , Crowley resisted the Law of Thelema and the mission of Thelemic prophet laid upon him by Aiwass , regarding the Cairo Working , as it is called , as an “ astral vision ” ( i.e. , a purely imaginative — but not “ imaginary ” — experience ) .
However , Crowley 's subsequent attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple in the Supreme College of the Great White Brotherhood resulted in his acceptance of the Law of Thelema and of his own prophetic role as described in the Book of the Law .
Crowley proclaimed himself as the prophet of a new [ a ] eon for humanity for the first time in his long mystical poem , Aha ! ( 1909 ) , which has been compared in beauty and profundity to the Bhagavad - Gita .
Thereafter he signed his correspondence and formal instructions with the two main slogans of the Book of the Law , “ Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law ” and “ Love is the law , love under will . ”
Crowley founded a magical society , the A∴A∴ , took over the leadership of another , the O.T.O. , and wrote a series of formal instructions promulgating the Law of Thelema , as well as teaching Scientific Illuminism and Magick .
Many of these formal instructions were published during his lifetime in his Equinox periodical and elsewhere .
Crowley believes that the Law of Thelema resolves all spiritual quandaries , harmonizes science and religion , and supersedes all historical dispensations , establishing a new cultural epoch for humanity , which he calls the New Aeon of Horus , the Crowned and Conquering Child .
According to Crowley , the New Aeon will endure for at least several hundred years , possibly for as long as two thousand years .
During his lifetime Crowley succeeded in attracting a small following , mainly in Germany and America , of no more than one or perhaps two hundred souls ( counting all those who adhered to Crowley at any time , for any length of time ; a much smaller number remained faithful to Crowley at the end of his life ) .
Crowley lost many followers due to his troublesome personality and libertine lifestyle , especially after he came to the attention of the British tabloid press following the First World War .
After his death , Crowley left behind him a disorganized and demoralized O.T.O. movement which has since split up into several competing factions , notably the American Caliphate founded by McMurtry , the Swiss O.T.O. founded by Metzger , the English O.T.O. under the leadership of Kenneth Grant , and a Brazilian O.T.O. founded by Marcelo Ramos Motta .
A very few members of the original A∴A∴ also carried on the work in a very limited way , but the A∴A∴ organization did not survive Crowley , at least not openly .
A larger number of revivals of the O.T.O. , A∴A∴ , and other self - professed Thelemic groups , without any clear historical link to Crowley , with various , sometimes divergent points of view , have also come into existence since a revival of interest in Crowley 's work associated with the counterculture revolution of the 1960s and 1970s .
Today , the Law of Thelema has attracted several thousand adherents worldwide , as well as a larger following of curiosity seekers , including several prominent rock stars .
The Law of Thelema has a strong presence on the Internet , and many of Crowley 's writings are available online .
Crowley first editions are in demand , and fetch high prices in the rare book market .
Introduction — History
The Law of Thelema , also called Scientific Illuminism and Magick ( spelled with a terminal ' k ' to distinguish the authentic science of the Magi from sleight of hand ) , originated in the Cairo Working .
At the time , Crowley interpreted the Cairo Working as an astral vision .
At this time , Crowley was a Minor Adept of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn .
The Golden Dawn was the most distinguished occult society of recent times , which included such luminaries as the poet William Butler Yeats and the Buddhist bhikkhu , Allan Bennett ( Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya ) .
Thus , at the time of the Cairo Working Crowley was an advanced experimental occultist in his own right , although Rose , who was pregnant with their only child , had no experience as a clairvoyant .
Crowley was also a published and fairly well known minor poet of controversial verse , yogi , world - class traveler and mountaineer , drug taker , and wealthy libertine .
Crowley 's father , Edward Crowley , used the leisure that the small brewing fortune that he inherited from his father provided him to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ according to the fundamentalist teachings of the Plymouth Brethren sect .
Crowley reacted against this fundamentalist and evangelical upbringing but his interest in religion , which , despite his promiscuous lifestyle , was serious and sincere , persisted .
Because of his wife 's and his contact with Aiwass , Aiwass dictated to Crowley a sixty - five - page document , called the Book of the Law , in length about equal to Lao - tse 's Tao -te Ching .
Crowley came to regard the Book of the Law as having nothing whatever to do with himself , despite the similarity of style and sentiment to Crowley 's previously published writings ( despite these similarities , the Book of the Law is also very different , being far more disorganized and ecstatic than anything Crowley produced before or after , and referring to events in Crowley 's future that subsequently occurred ) .
During this dictation Crowley “ saw ” Aiwass , who appeared as an Assyrian or Persian aristocrat with veiled eyes .
Crowley also stated that Aiwass ' English was devoid of any accent .
The Book of the Law is written in a flamboyant style , punctuated by innumerable exclamation points as well as powerful passages of real sublimity , profundity , and beauty , addressing a host of real spiritual problems , and prophesying various events , most notably the advent of the Second World War in the 1940s , which was fulfilled thirty - five years later .
The Book of the Law is both a radical postmodernist critique and an endorsement of religion , which claims to go beyond all previous historical dispensations and reveal to humanity nothing less than the basis of a new spiritual epoch , the New Aeon of Horus , the Crowned and Conquering Child .
In Egyptian mythology , Horus is the son of Isis , the Great Mother goddess , and Osiris , the Dying God .
After Osiris is slain by his murderous brother Set , Horus rises up against Set and assumes the throne and place of his father , Osiris .
In the Thelemic exegesis , Horus represents the inauguration of a new spiritual way , which will be preceded by a transitional period of unprecedented disaster and suffering ( Set ) , in the very beginning of which we are now ( Crowley believed that this period would last several centuries , and would ultimate in the destruction of Judaeo - Christian civilization , which he identified with Osiris , the Dying God ) .
In fact the Book of the Law is heavily indebted to various literary precedents , including the Judaeo - Christian apocalyptic writings , Gnosticism , Zoharic Cabala , magic , the Enochian writings of Dee and Kelly , the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , Hindu and Buddhist Tantra , Taoism , and even Vodou , and , more recently , the writings of Francois Rabelais , Max Stirner , Friedrich Nietzsche , and others .
The word “ Thelema ” is derived from the Greek , meaning “ will , ” and is believed to conceal various symbolic allusions in the letters and their numerical values ( like Hebrew and Arabic , Greek letters are also numbers ) .
Will is preeminently , however , not free , but true , thus raising the Law of Thelema above simple libertarianism .

Thelemites are divided into two main spiritual schools or orders , the A∴A∴ ( Astrum Argentium , or Silver Star ) , and the O.T.O. ( Ordo Templi Orientis , or Order of the Temple of the Orient ) ( there are at least two more Thelemic organizations authorized by Crowley , viz. , the L.I.L. and the G.B.G. , and a few that appeared posthumously , but the former are the main ones ) .
The A∴A∴ is a temporal manifestation of the Great White Brotherhood , and not necessarily the only one , one of the three fundamental spiritual schools of humanity , the others being the Black School , associated mainly with Buddhism and Gnosticism , and the Yellow School , associated mainly with Taoism .
In addition to the White , Black , and Yellow Schools , there is a fourth group called the Black Brotherhood , not to be confused with the Black School , whose adherents consist of high ranking adepts who , through fear and selfishness , failed to transcend the limitations of the human personality and hence “ fall back into ” or “ remain in ” the abyss , where they morally disintegrate .
The Black Brothers are at odds with all true spiritual schools , and seek to dominate the human race , subjecting them for their own purposes .
They are closely associated with the exoteric systems based on priest craft and rules , which almost completely reject the pursuit of personal spiritual experience in favour of a rule - based ethic of obedience , conformity , and vicarious salvation .
The Black Brothers interfere with human history in pursuit of their own agenda , precipitating wars , chaos , and social strife , promoting authoritarianism , materialism , rationalism , industrialism , urbanism , scientism , and collectivism , and repressing all authentic spirituality in the pursuit of global domination and the subjection of the human race .
The White School is also involved in human history , much more so than either the Black or Yellow Schools , which avoid worldly involvements .
Many of the greatest historical spiritual teachers , as well as many artistic and scientific geniuses , have actually been Secret Chiefs of the Great White Brotherhood , who have entered into incarnation in order to help guide humanity towards the realization of the ultimate goal , the attainment of universal enlightenment .
Aleister Crowley himself claimed to be a Secret Chief of the White School , and not a Black Brother , although in a moment of pique he described himself as a “ black magician . ”
The A∴A∴ is divided into ten grades , plus four intermediate grades ( shown below in square brackets ) , divided into three orders , which altogether comprise a complete system of spiritual attainment , as follows ( from highest to lowest ) : The Order of the Silver Star ( The S.S. ) Ipsissimus 10°=1° Magus 9°=2° Magister Templi 8°=3°
[ The Link — Babe of the Abyss ]
The Order of the Rose - Cross ( The R.C. ) Adeptus Exemptus 7°=4° Adeptus Major 6°=5° Adeptus Minor ( “ without ” and “ within ” ) 5°=6
°
[ The Link — Dominus Liminis ]
The Order of the Golden Dawn ( The G.D. ) Philosophus 4°=7° Practicus 3°=8° Zelator 2°=9° Neophyte 1°=10
°
[ The Link — Probationer 0°=0° ]
[ Student ]
The ten main grades correspond to the Qabalistic Tree of Life , a diagram that represents the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm , reality and consciousness .
As in the A∴A∴ , the O.T.O. is divided into three sets of three grades , the three main grades being ( from lowest to highest ) the Man of Earth , Lover , and Hermit , based on the grades described in the Book of the Law .
However , unlike the A∴A∴ , these grades are ritually conferred in the style of Freemasonry and correspond to increasing degrees of intelligence not tied to actual magical or mystical tasks or attainments .
Practices
The Law of Thelema is a system of experiential spirituality .
This means that Thelemites engage in various spiritual practices in order to realize the truth of the spiritual life in and for themselves .
The ultimate goal of the spiritual life is to identify with and actually become a spiritual being , free of the constraints and constrictions of conditioned existence .
The state of being a spiritual being is an ecstatic , powerful state of union with everything ( Thelemic “ compassion ” ) .
The Law of Thelema also teaches that all religions are variations of one fundamental underlying spiritual truth , which become fragmented into different religious traditions as a result of variations of place , time , and degree of realization and mutual isolation and hostility as , with the passage of time , religions become increasingly diversified and exclusive .
Religions thus harden into increasingly exoteric systems , based on devotion to priest craft and rules , in which individual spiritual experience is increasingly repressed in favour of an official orthodoxy , ultimately the prerogative of the Black Brothers , which becomes increasingly metaphorical and vicarious .
Thus , the Law of Thelema rejects “ religiosity ” altogether , and actively seeks to destroy it , since the religious attitude in this sense is harmful to the spiritual life and impedes , blocks , restricts , and interferes with real spiritual progress .
Consequently ,
Thelemites incorporate practices from all religious traditions without distinction , in order to reconstitute the primordial tradition that underlies them all .
Crowley compared this process to recombining the colours of the spectrum into white light .
This reconstruction is the special task of Scientific Illuminism , which is one aspect of the Law of Thelema , the operative branch of which is Magick .
Spiritual practices are pursued in the context of various systems of attainment , which are appropriate to different types of aspirant , differentiated by race , culture , personal psychology , and degree of realization or “ grade . ”
Consequently , not all practices are suitable for all aspirants at all stages of development .
Recognizing which practices are suitable to which aspirants at different stages of their spiritual development is the special skill of a spiritual master .
In the system of the A∴A∴ , the grades correspond to specific tasks and corresponding attainments , arranged in an hierarchy .
Many of these tasks and attainments have become the special study of parapsychology and transpersonal psychology in recent years .
In the system described by Crowley , these are the main attainments of the Outer Order ( collated from the three main documents describing these attainments , Liber XIII , Liber CLXV , and “ One Star in Sight ” ) :
The Neophyte formulates the Body of Light ( popularly known today as “ astral projection ” ) .
The Zelator masters Hatha Yoga , specifically , Asana and Pranayama , resulting in the experience of “ psychic opening . ”
The Practicus achieves Kundalini Awakening , so - called ( see Lee Sanella , The Kundalini Experience ) .
The Philosophus masters Rising on the Planes ( popularly known as the “ out of body experience ” or “ OBE ” ) .
The Dominus Liminis acquires the power of mental Concentration ( ekagrata ) .
The Adeptus Minor attains the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel , so - called , corresponding to the Hindu trance - state known as Atmadarshana , but with important differences as well .
The work of an aspirant to the A∴A∴ is so subtle and advanced that it is beyond the ability of most people , although a few aspirants attained high grades in the A∴A∴ during Crowley 's lifetime .
The tests , some of which are published , which Crowley applied to aspirants in order to qualify were very stringent , and Crowley did not grant grades casually .
For example , one has to “ astral travel ” through an abstract symbol that one has never seen before and describe a vision the character of which is consistent with the symbol 's meaning in order to pass the test for “ rising on the planes . ”
Crowley was promoted to the leadership of the English branch of the O.T.O. in 1912 e.v. , and he used this order ever afterwards as a vehicle for popularizing the Law of Thelema , as well as the practice of the Supreme Secret of the O.T.O .
During his lifetime , this secret was zealously guarded , although it is not always discreetly hinted at in the esoteric literature of the day and by Crowley himself .
However , since Crowley 's death the cat has long been out of the bag .
The Supreme Secret of the O.T.O. is nothing other than the use of sex in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment , equivalent in fact to a Western Tantra .
Sex is , of course , the single most powerful psycho- physiological energy in man , so pressing it into the service of spiritual development is a natural evolution , once one overcomes the restriction of shame .
From the Tantric point of view , sexual abstinence is really a form of “ sex magick , ” so - called , since sexual abstinence modifies the sexual instinct .
Exotericism sees in sexual abstinence the rejection of sexuality per se as contrary to the spiritual life , but the Tantric view is more subtle and profound .
Rather than rejecting sex , the Tantric practitioner seeks to sublimate the sexual energy , inhibiting its outflow so that the energy accumulates in the brain , its original source , where it induces the state of illumination ( the physiological precursor of enlightenment ) .
Once one realizes that this is how sexual abstinence actually works , the possibility of a contrary methodology presents itself to the discerning consciousness .
Instead of repressing the sexual energy , one can intensify it to the point where the sheer excess of sexual arousal causes the energy to ascend the spine and , once again , “ illuminate ” the brain .
In the latter case , however , the body is also “ illuminated . ”
Thus , the formulae of sexual abstinence and orgiastic excess are realized to be essentially identical , variations of the same underlying energy - economy .
The members of the O.T.O. are encouraged to engage in practical experimentation , and many members pursue various tasks connected with the Great Work .
This is especially true of the followers of Kenneth Grant , who has created a system of Thelemic attainment strongly suggestive of Vodou , the primal religion of Africa and humanity , since , according to current archaeological research , humanity originated in Africa .
In addition to the major tasks of the Great Work described above , committed Thelemites are enjoined to engage in a number of regular daily practices that have the effect of disciplining and directing the mind and regulating one 's life according to objective natural cycles .
These include ( based on the Official Publications of the A∴A∴ ) : A short reminder of one 's dedication to the Great Work , spoken before meals .
Rituals of purification and empowerment , performed at the beginning and end of each day ( see Libers V , XXV , and XXXVI ) .
A daily eucharist ( see Liber XLIV ) .
The adoration of the Sun , followed by one hour of meditation , repeated four times daily ; thus , the truly committed Thelemite , like the followers of the Sant Mat , meditates four hours per day ( see Liber CC ) .
Adoration of one 's Star , performed as it rises above the horizon ( see Liber CMLXIII )
In addition to the foregoing , members of the O.T.O. observe the Gnostic Mass ( see Liber XV ) , in which the Supreme Secret is rehearsed and an eucharist consumed by the celebrants , and various visualization practices .
The Book of the Law also refers to the spiritual use of drugs , which informed the spiritual practice of many significant spiritual teachers before their criminalization , including Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff ( according to Timothy Leary ) , Julius Evola , Aldous Huxley and others .
Drugs are also an integral part of many different South American aboriginal shamanic cultures .
The traditional cultures of the Quiches , Incans , Mayans , and Aztecs bears many striking affinities to the Law of Thelema , more so even than Africa .
Sacred Texts
The Book of the Law was written when Aleister Crowley was a Minor Adept of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn .
Subsequently he underwent an experience , called the “ ordeal of the abyss , ” similar to the “ dark night of the soul ” of the mystics , in which he completely annihilated his human personality and achieved an extreme state of “ psychic opening . ”
He became completely open and receptive to the influx of the divine consciousness , an intense , intuitive , transrational , and ecstatic state of self - perfection and realization of reality in its fundamental and ultimate aspects .
In this state , intermittently over a period of five years , Crowley wrote a series of books , ranging in length from several hundred to several thousand words , concerning which he declares that they are beyond rational criticism , i.e. , absolutely and indubitably true .
These books were written “ automatically , ” i.e. , without rational reflection , in a state of trance .
These works constitute the revelatory foundation of the Law of Thelema , and are referred to , including the Book of the Law , as the Holy Books of Thelema .
In order of writing , they are : Liber AL vel Legis ( 1904 e.v. )
Liber Liberi vel Lapidis Lazuli ( 1907 e.v. )
Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente ( ibid )
Liber Stellae Rubeae ( ibid )
Liber Porta Lucis ( ibid )
Liber Tau vel Kabbalae Trium Literarum ( ibid )
Liber Trigrammaton ( ibid )
Liber Ararita ( 1907 or 1908 e.v. )
Liber Arcanorum … Atu … Tahuti , etc. ( 1907 and 1911 e.v. )
Liber B vel Magi ( 1911 e.v. )
Liber Tzaddi vel Hamus Hermeticus ( 1911 e.v. )
Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni ( 1911 e.v. )
Liber A´ash vel Capricorni Pneumatici ( 1911 e.v. )
In addition to the foregoing , Crowley wrote ( or , rather , dictated to his disciple and lover , the poet Victor Neuburg , in an ASC ) The Vision and the Voice .
The Vision and the Voice ( properly , Liber XXX Aerum vel Saeculi ) is a series of visions based on the Enochian magical workings of famed Elizabethan scholar John Dee and his skryer Edward Kelley , to which Crowley traces the beginning of the process culminating in the advent of the New Aeon in 1904 e.v. Crowley claimed to be Edward Kelley 's reincarnation .
All but the first two visions were received in the Sahara Desert in 1909 e.v. , to which he ascribed a combined classification , viz. , A - B , Class ' A ' being a “ holy book ” as discussed above , and Class ' B ' an ordinary work of rational scholarship .
A prefatory note to The Treasure House of Images , published in The Equinox in 1910 e.v. , was assigned the ' A ' classification .
Liber NU and Liber HAD also contain instructions received directly from V.V.V.V.V. , Crowley 's motto as a Master of the Temple of the A∴A∴ , which are presumably also Class ' A , ' since V.V.V.V.V. corresponds to Crowley 's neschamah , the soul in its static aspect .
Finally , in 1925 e.v. , after a hiatus of more than a decade , Crowley penned the last and the shortest of the Holy Books of Thelema , a short preamble to the Book of the Law of only 77 words ( plus 27 words of quotation from the Book of the Law ) , in which both the study and discussion of the Book of the Law are specifically and absolutely prohibited .
Most Thelemites today follow Crowley 's lead in interpreting The Comment to mean that no one may publicly interpret the Law of Thelema , and that those who do so are to be shunned , despite the fact that the prohibition is only applied to the text of the Book of the Law itself , and not any other holy book .
Consequently , little critical literature on the Law of Thelema ( as distinct from biography ) has appeared since Crowley 's death in 1947 e.v. , the only notable exception being the writings of Kenneth Grant ( most importantly , The Magical Revival , Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God , and Hecate 's Fountain ) .
However , Grant and his followers are shunned as heretics by many Thelemites , especially the followers of the American Caliphate , who accuse him of collaborating with John Symonds .
Symonds , who many
Thelemites believe exploited the “ old man ” for personal profit and gain by hypocritically maneuvering himself into the position of Crowley 's literary executor , is the author of several extremely hostile biographies of Aleister Crowley , as well as the co-editor with Kenneth Grant of a number of Crowley 's writings .
In his final Crowley biography , King of the Shadow Realm , Symonds claims that Crowley was actually psychotic ( similar assertions are sometimes made about Carl Gustav Jung as well , and are clearly ideologically motivated ) .
The Holy Books of Thelema are remarkable by any standard , especially the two longest books , Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente and Liber Liberi vel Lapidis Lazuli , although personal hostility towards Crowley has caused them not to be as widely regarded as they should .
Except the Book of the Law , the Holy Books of Thelema represent the high water mark of Aleister Crowley 's literary career for sustained philosophical sublimity , lyric and symbolic beauty , and structural elegance .
Often obscure , they are nevertheless potent and profound testaments to the ecstatic integrity of Aleister Crowley 's spiritual realization .
Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente is an account of the Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel .
Crowley also wrote a long and interesting commentary on this particular holy book .
Liber Liberi vel Lapidis Lazuli describes the Ordeal of the Abyss from an universal perspective , whereas The Vision and the Voice documents Crowley 's own attainment of this grade as well as offering innumerable insights into the Law of Thelema and the New Aeon in general .
These two attainments , the Angel and the Abyss , constitute the two critical events in the life of the adept in Crowley 's system , by which the aspirant becomes a Major Adept and a Master of the Temple respectively , and have considerable resonance with the perennial philosophy from which all authentic spiritual insights derive .
Another holy book , Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni , describes the grade of Babe of the Abyss , and Liber B vel Magi describes the grade of Magus .
Liber Porta Lucis and Liber Tzaddi vel Hamus Hermeticus describe Crowley 's mission as Thelemic prophet and the task of initiation in the New Aeon .
Liber Tau vel Kabbalae Trium Literarum explains the ordeals of the grades .
Liber Ararita is a description of the spiritual path in extremely subtle and abstract language .
Liber Trigrammaton describes the process of cosmic devolution .
Liber Arcanorum interprets the Tarot trumps as an initiatory sequence .
Liber A´ash and Liber Stellae Rubeae offer practical instruction in sexual Tantra .
Liber AL vel Legis , the Latin rendering of the Book of the Law , is of course Aiwass ' proclamation of the advent of the New Aeon and its essential formulae ( even although Crowley had not crossed the abyss when Aiwass revealed the Book of the Law , he classifies it as a holy book because it represents the dictation of Aiwass himself , who holds the rank of Ipsissimus , i.e. , the highest possible grade .
Crowley himself only attained this grade seventeen years later , in 1921 e.v. , at which time he and Aiwass became one being : thus the relationship with the Holy Guardian Angel represents in the Thelemic view a kind of spiritual marriage ) .
Holy Days
Part of the spiritual discipline of a Thelemite consists in the coordination of his personal , individual , terrestrial life with the great cosmic cycles that regulate the life of the earth and humanity .
Accepting the Law of Thelema is itself such an act of coordination or alignment with the cosmic cycle known as the precession of the equinoxes .
Crowley implies that the New Aeon of Horus , the Crowned and Conquering Child , which began with the self - revelation of Aiwass at the Vernal Equinox , 1904 e.v. , corresponds to the advent of the astrological Age of Aquarius .
By aligning one 's personal life with the universal life mediated by these cycles one becomes a vehicle of the manifestation of the universal life , thus making oneself a channel of higher spiritual forces which in turn accelerate one 's natural spiritual evolution and affect the karma of the planet .
Other cycles with which the Thelemite aligns his life are the diurnal motion of the Sun , specifically , sunrise , noon , sunset , and midnight ; the diurnal rising of the star or constellation rising in his horoscope ; the diurnal rising of the lunar orb ; the monthly lunar cycle , especially the new and full moons ; the monthly entry of the sun into the signs of the zodiac ; the annual solar cycle of the equinoxes and solstices ; and an annual calendar of holy days prescribed in the Book of the Law , as follows : The First Night of the Prophet and His Bride , corresponding to the consummation of the marriage of Aleister Crowley and Rose Edith Crowley on August 12 , 1903 e.v. ;
The Writing of the Book of the Law , on April 8 , 9 , and 10 , 1904 e.v. ; and
The Supreme Ritual , commemorating the successful Invocation of Horus on March 20 , 1904 e.v .
All these times are celebrated by means of rituals , in which energy is generated , and feasts , in which energy is both discharged and absorbed .
In addition , Aiwass ' directs that the birth , puberty , and death of Thelemites and their children are to be celebrated .
Many
Thelemites also observe the “ quarter - days ” of the Wiccan religion , viz. , Samhain ( November 1 eve ) , Imbolc ( February 1 eve ) , Beltaine ( May 1 eve ) , and Lammas ( August 1 eve ) .
Finally , the Book of the Law alludes to a mysterious feast of Tahuti , which has never been satisfactorily explained .
The Problem of Aleister Crowley 's Reputation
Many criticisms of the Law of Thelema are based on a moral critique of the personal character and conduct of Aleister Crowley .
These accusations generally resolve themselves into seven basic assertions : that he was a traitor , sexual deviant , sado - masochist , womanizer , drug addict / alcoholic , or even psychotic .
Each of these accusations can be discussed in the context of the evidence .
It is certainly true that Crowley published or wrote pronographic poems and stories , and was extremely interested in extreme sexual experimentation ; that he wrote apparently pro-German propaganda in America during the First World War ; that he engaged in sexual relationships with both men and women ; that he engaged in physically and psychologically abusive sexual relationships ; that he professed contempt for women ; that he drank heavily and became severely addicted to heroin in middle - age ; and that he experienced ASCs , generally induced rather than spontaneous .
Strictly speaking , however , the truth or falsehood of any of these claims is unrelated to the truth or falsehood of the Law of Thelema , just as the truth or falsehood of the Tractatus Philosophicus is unrelated to the fact that Wittgenstein was an homosexual .
As every first year philosophy student learns , truth or falsehood is not a moral quality or a function of the personal psyche , and it is quite possible for a morally mean or even psychologically dysfunctional person to experience and express insights that are both beautiful and true .
The history of Western civilization provides numerous examples , many of whom are studied in universities .
Crowley himself regards the pursuit of spiritual realization as a science , in which moral considerations are either secondary or entirely irrelevant .
Crowley himself writes , “ Since the ultimate truth of teleology is unknown , all codes of morality are arbitrary .
Therefore the student has no concern with ethics as such . ”
Philosophically , then , Aleister Crowley is an amoralist .
Nevertheless , the Law of Thelema does imply an ethical teaching .
The doctrine of the Black Brothers itself implies a kind of moral judgement .
The essential ethical teaching of the Law of Thelema is that each and every individual has an absolute and inalienable right to pursue his own True Will without restriction by others , and that no one has the ethical or moral right or duty to compel another to pursue any other path , or even the capacity to criticize them .
A Thelemite who knows his True Will can however guide others in accordance with universal principles , but the relationship should not be one of imitation .
If Aleister Crowley violated his own or any other individual 's True Will at any time , he simply violated his own law and paid the karmic price , but this does not invalidate the Law itself .
Great art and true philosophies are both created by scoundrels , but we balk when a scoundrel creates a true religion .
The imitative tendency , which Crowley despised , is deep .
Since imitating the moral example of a founder is not the ethical teaching of the Law of Thelema , every Thelemite is free to imitate Aleister Crowley 's personal lifestyle or not as they choose , although Crowley himself advises against it , warning that those who try to do so will be possessed or obsessed by the “ vision of the demon Crowley ” ( Crowley , who was an amateur artist , even drew a sketch of this particular demon ) .
Unfortunately , as the history of the Law of Thelema shows with great clarity , Crowley 's advice was accurate , and numerous heedless Thelemites have been devoured as a result .
The True Will represents the inertia of the universe , and is irresistible ( if not , that simply proves that it is not the True Will ) .
However , no one may restrict the True Will of another , unless another chooses , without coercion , to be so restricted .
Aleister Crowley should be understood as a natural phenomenon , without moral judgement .
A prophet is himself merely a symptom of the zeitgeist .
A storm is not “ evil . ”
Aleister Crowley was a storm , which may yet sink the ship of the Judaeo - Christian civilization that he despised .

PARIS —
The more things change , as the French are fond of saying , the more they remain the same .
But things have really changed here in France , at least since the long ago days of my youth in the later 1950 ’s and early 1960 ’s , and they are no longer the same .
In those bygone days , France was still deep in shock from its disaster in World War II .
The nation was closed in on itself , completely self - absorbed , racked by postwar guilt and rent by mutual recriminations .
The one fixed point for the French was their national individuality and unique , sharply etched character .
They found a measure of solace in being resolutely French and abjuring the outside world .
Most French refused to speak English , a process they found unworthy , undignified , and even painful .
The British were hated for stabbing France in the back early in the war by pulling their troops out at Dunquerque and sinking part of the French Fleet .
France deeply resented being ordered about by the United States and treated like a third - rate nation .
France was glum , grumpy and depressed .
On top of the malaise , the communists were threatening to take over the government .
In the early 1960 ’s , France even began quietly refurbishing and upgunning the Maginot Line forts in fear of the mighty , 100 - division Soviet Red Army .
That was yesterday .
Today , the new globalized generation of young and even middle - aged French enjoys speaking English and often does so at the slightest excuse .
France is becoming bilingual .
Even France ’s entry into the Eurosong competition is , mon dieu ! , in English .
It gets increasingly hard to speak French here in Paris .
Paris ’ notorious taxi drivers , who once sought to install metal plates in their rear seats to electrocute unruly or , more likely , low - tipping passengers , have become shockingly polite .
Retailers and waiters actually seem pleased to see you .
Americans are again welcome .
A young man offered me his seat on the Metro .
French seem to have discovered a new happy pill .
Wine and bread consumption , once staples of French life , are way down .
Oppressed French smokers have been forced out of cafes into the cruel street .
Young French seem to live on predigested junk food .
The wonderful old smoky , black and white France of my youth , with her violent riots , Edith Piaf and Yves Montand , army plots , silly Left Bank intellectuals , and weird little cars like the Panhard and Simca , has vanished .
French have been paying a lot of attention to their new president , Nicholas Sarkozy , and his smashing second wife , Carla Bruni , who is widely regarded as a huge asset for " Sarko . "
But right now , French and other Europeans are absolutely fascinated by the US presidential race .
During two weeks of TV and radio broadcasting in Paris , the number one question I was asked is who will win the US primaries and November vote .
The president of the United States has at least as much if not more influence over many nations than their own governments .
So , I ’ve always favored a one - tenth vote for all non-Americans .
If this were the case , then Barack Obama would win in a landslide .
Like North Americans , most Europeans really do n’t know much about the experience - light senator , but what they see , they like " beaucoup . "
You can feel a passion here for Obama that is quite remarkable , and an earnest hope that America may soon return to being its old , pre-Bush , pre-9/11 self .
Obama is wildly popular because he is , of course , the non-Bush .
But so is Hillary Clinton , yet she inspires surprisingly little support even though husband Bill , for reasons that elude me , was widely admired abroad .
Hillary is regarded simply as an avatar of the Clinton political machine which , however formidable , is seen as empty of substance , and dedicated only to the relentless pursuit of power and money .
The three Americans public figures most respected internationally are Barack Obama , Jimmy Carter , and Al Gore .
They are widely seen as representing many of America ’s best qualities .
They are also a potent antidote to the yahoos , holy rollers and totalitarian neoconservative ideologues who hijacked the Republican Party — my lifelong party — and blackened America ’s name around the globe .
Obama is seen abroad as the candidate who can end the shameful Bush era and return America to a moderate , productive role in world affairs .
He is expected to end the Iraq War and Bush ’s militarized foreign policy , and reintegrate the United States into the company of law - respecting , environmentally conscious nations , of whom the European Union is now the leader .
Obama comes across to Europeans as dignified , decent , eloquent , and truthful , qualities notably lacking in either Bush and Dick Cheney who too often seem to symbolize America ’s cruder instincts and its wallowing in synthetic patriotism .
Just a few days ago , for example , Republicans accused Obama of not being patriotic because he does not wear an American flag on his lapel .
Much of the world would hail and admire America for electing a man of color , but even more so , one who appears to capture so much of what is great and admirable about the United States .
There are fears here the bitter Hillary - Obama contest may ruin both candidates , leading to four more years of Bush under John McCain .
But it may also benefit Obama .
He needs to toughen up before facing the ferocious Republican attack machine that sunk war veteran John Kerry ’s campaign under a torrent of " Swiftboat " lies about his military service in Vietnam .
John McCain is a gentleman , but not so Republican strategist Carl Rove ’s waiting character assassins .
Obama could sharply alter America ’s highly negative image created by Bush & Co. as a determined enemy of the Muslim world .
Not because his father was Muslim , but because of his image of fairness and sensible foreign policy proposals calling for open dialogue with the Muslim World , including Iran , instead of confrontation .
If Americans want to repair relations with the Muslim world , electing Obama is a good way to start .
It ’s distressing listening to the rich John McCain and equally rich Clintons scourge Obama an " elitist " because he is intelligent , articulate , and poised .
Next , they will brand him as , " too French . "

Questions have been asked as to how Mr Fritzl could keep the cellar a secret DNA evidence supports an Austrian man 's confession that he fathered six children by his daughter while keeping her prisoner for 24 years , police say .
Lower Austria police chief Franz Polzer said Josef Fritzl , 73 , had completely deceived his wife , his family and the authorities in the town of Amstetten .
Hospital officials meanwhile said Mr Fritzl 's daughter and her children had experienced an " astonishing " reunion .
They met at the clinic where they are receiving psychiatric treatment .
Earlier , Mr Fritzl was detained for a further 14 days by a regional court in the provincial capital of St Poelten .
On the advice of his lawyer , he did not speak to the examining magistrate .
His lawyer told the BBC that although Mr Fritzl showed no signs of remorse , he looked very sad and " emotionally broken " .
Reunion Speaking at a news conference in Amstetten afterwards , the director of the psychiatric clinic at a local hospital said Fritzl 's daughter Elizabeth , now 42 , had been reunited with five of her six children and her mother there on Sunday morning .
KEY FACTS IN CASE Elisabeth reappeared at home after disappearing 24 years ago Six children she says are hers have been found and placed in care
One of the children , aged 19 , is seriously ill in hospital Elisabeth 's father Josef Fritzl , 73 , has been arrested on suspicion of incest and abduction Police say Mr Fritzl confesses to imprisoning Elisabeth and fathering her seven children
Profile : Josef Fritzl
Hope for children of the cellar Coming to terms with the horror " It was astonishing how easily it happened - how the mother and grandmother came together , " Berthold Kepplinger said .
Three of the children were kept in the cellar with their mother and had never seen daylight .
The other three were adopted or fostered by Mr Fritzl , after he forced Elisabeth to write letters saying she could not look after them .
The eldest , 19 - year - old Kerstin , became seriously ill earlier this month and had to be taken to hospital , where she is currently in a coma .
She was imprisoned by Mr Fritzl along with her 18 - and five - year - old brothers .
Police have said there is no evidence to suggest the grandmother , Rosemarie , nor any of the seven children she had with Mr Fritzl , were aware of any of the alleged crimes .
Mr Kepplinger said the family members had interacted very naturally , although he said two of the children who had spent their lives underground had a way of communicating that was " anything but normal " .
" The children are quite well , they are under investigation , there is a professional team consisting of psychiatrists , neurologists , psychotherapists , speech therapists , physiotherapists , a whole team is working on this , " he said .
" One important thing is not to over - treat them . "
Mr Kepplinger said Elisabeth had spoken " quite a lot " about what she had gone through in captivity , but declined to provide details .
" It was definitely dreadful for her and for her children , " he added .
' Decisive evidence '
Speaking at the same news conference , police officials said their investigations and genetic evidence gathered since Sunday had confirmed statements made by Elisabeth and Mr Fritzl 's confession .
" The DNA tests provided decisive evidence that the six children that Elisabeth gave birth to have the same father , " Franz Polzer said .

Mr Polzer said that letters which Mr Fritzl had forced Elisabeth to write had played an important part in deceiving his family and the authorities since her disappearance in 1984 , when he allegedly lured her into the cellar of their house and locked her up .
The first letter said Elisabeth had run away , joined a religious sect and asked police not to look for her .
Others explained why she had left three of the children on the doorstep of the family home over the years .
Mr Polzer said the last two letters Elisabeth was forced to write had provided considerable evidence to confirm her allegations .
The second to last was found in the clothes of Kerstin , when she was admitted to hospital on 19 April .
Mr Fritzl also had another letter with him , Mr Polzer said , where his daughter raises the possibility of returning to the family , bringing with her two sons , aged 18 and five years old .
Mr Polzer said Mr Fritzl had shown the last letter to police as evidence that he did not know about his daughter 's whereabouts .
He looks very sad .
It is like he is emotionally broken
Rudolf Mayer
Mr Fritzl 's lawyer " The biological tests show clearly that this letter , a normal letter with a stamp , was without doubt created by one Josef Fritzl , " he added .
" You can be sure that this man left nothing undone in order to deceive the family , his wife , the relatives , the children and everybody around him , " he added .
" He had no scruples to use every possible means to deceive the public and cover up his crime . "
Mr Polzer said official records showed that Mr Fritzl had no criminal convictions from the past 15 years and that the statute of limitations would apply to any earlier offences he may have committed .
' No sympathy ' Police investigations at the house are meanwhile continuing .
The cellar where Elisabeth and three of her children were held captive is being searched inch by inch , in addition to the upstairs flat .
Prosecutors have said Mr Fritzl faces up to 15 years in prison if he is eventually convicted on charges of raping and beating his daughter , and sequestration .

They are also considering charges of " murder through failure to act " in connection with the death of one of the seven children he fathered .
Police said on Monday that Mr Fritzl had admitted burning the infant 's body shortly after it died .
Asked whether Mr Fritzl would plead guilty to any of the charges , his lawyer , Rudolf Mayer , told the BBC's Europe Today programme : " He had made ... a confession , but I will speak to him about whether this is right or not . "
Mr Mayer said his client had not shown any remorse for what he is accused of doing .
" I can tell you that no sympathy is there at all .
The print mediums and all the televisions in Austria write that he is a monster , and no sympathy , nothing . "
" He looks very sad .
It is like he is emotionally broken , " he said , adding that his client was receiving psychiatric care in prison .
The BBC's Bethany Bell says the case is reminiscent of that of Natascha Kampusch , the Austrian teenager held captive in a cellar in a house in a Vienna suburb for eight years , who ran to freedom in 2006 .
On Monday , Ms Kampusch , now 20 , told reporters that she wanted to contact Elisabeth to offer emotional and financial help .

What are these ?
Given the clarity of Article II , Sec. 2 of the Constitution , and the fairly obvious role Congress is supposed to have in approving treaties , there really should n’t be any question about lawmakers ’ role in approving a new security agreement struck between the White House and the Maliki government .
But this is Bush we ’re talking about , so unambiguous constitutional language may not matter .
The Bush administration yesterday advanced a new argument for why it does not require congressional approval to strike a long - term security agreement with Iraq , stating that Congress had already endorsed such an initiative through its 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force against Saddam Hussein .
The 2002 measure , along with the congressional resolution passed one week after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks authorizing military action “ to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States , ” permits indefinite combat operations in Iraq , according to a statement by the State Department ’s Bureau of Legislative Affairs .
The statement came in response to lawmakers ’ demands that the administration submit to Congress for approval any agreement with Iraq .
U.S. officials are traveling to Baghdad this week with drafts of two documents — a status - of - forces agreement and a separate “ strategic framework ” — that they expect to sign with the Iraqi government by the end of July .
It is to go into effect when the current U.N. mandate expires Dec. 31 .
Rep. Gary L. Ackerman ( D - N.Y. ) , whose questions at a House hearing Tuesday elicited the administration statement , described it as an “ open-ended , never - ending authority for the administration to be at war in Iraq forever with no limitations . ”
The conditions of 2002 no longer exist , he said .
“ I do n’t think anybody argues today that Saddam Hussein is a threat , ” Ackerman said .
“ Is it the government of Iraq that ’s a threat ? ”
LANGLEY , B.C.
–One of three men heading off on a dream vacation to Hawaii was mowed down by a pickup truck early yesterday in what RCMP suspect is a horrifying case of road rage .
Silas O'Brien , a 21 - year - old Abbotsford man , was killed after police say the vehicle he and his friends were in was deliberately run off a rural road in Langley while driving to Vancouver airport .
The three men , all members of Cloverdale Bible Way church , had been at a prayer meeting the night before , joined by more than 500 members of their congregation , including their families .
The congregation was there to wish the three 21 - year - olds a fond farewell .
Langley RCMP say the deadly run-in started just after 2 a.m. as the young men's Chevy Silverado truck came up behind a white Ford pickup truck .
Langley RCMP say the trio's Chevy Silverado truck may have tried to pass the Ford .
The driver of the Ford then forced their Chevy off the road and into a ditch , police say .
The three men got out of the Chevy to survey the damage .
Police say the driver of a silver Honda stopped to make sure everyone was OK .
The three said they were and the Honda driver left .
That 's when the driver of the Ford pickup drove back , heading straight at them .
Sam Dooley , Luke Stevens and O'Brien were standing on the side of the road when the truck came directly at them .
Dooley and Stevens jumped out of the way but O'Brien was hit .
O'Brien died at the scene .
" These males were still standing on the side of the roadway and the truck came directly toward them , " says Langley RCMP Cpl. Brenda Marshall .
" We are currently looking for that vehicle .
We suspect it has front - end damage as well as damage to the driver 's side . "
The Ford truck is a pick - up equipped with a rack able to hold recreational vehicles like snowmobiles .
The truck was modified with a flat deck to carry a snowmobile but Marshall says that distinctive feature wo n't necessarily make it easier to trace .
Police hope the driver of the Honda who spoke with the victims just before the Ford returned may have some important clues about the accident , but so far , that driver has not come forward .
" I am sure that if that driver was listening to the news or happened to hear about this incident then they would be aware that they were the person that we would be looking for , " Marshall said .
Marshall said Dooley and Stevens are traumatized by the incident .
" They are receiving counselling and assistance from our victim 's assistance team right now , " he said .
" It 's obviously something that will impact them for the rest of their lives . "
The three men's senior pastor , Ed Byskal , arrived at the crime scene yesterday morning , only hours after he had led the men in prayer .
" These young men were well thought of .
These are very fine young men , " said Byskal .
" Last night he ( O' Brien ) got to say goodbye to his family . "

無意味なマーケティング競争か、次世代Webへの期待か
Webブラウザ戦争 でAcidレースの局地戦が白熱
Internet Explorerのシェアを緩やかにFirefoxが奪いつつあるという調査が多くある一方、“世界最速”をうたうSafariがWindows版でもリリースされて評判となるなど、今また「
Webブラウザ戦争」という言葉がささやかれ出している。1990年代後半のマイクロソフト対ネットスケープの激戦を第1次とすれば、今回は第2次Webブラウザ戦争だ。
ここ数日、第2次Webブラウザ戦争の局地戦“ Acidレース ” が加熱気味だ 。Webブラウザの標準規格への適合度合いをテストする「 Acidテスト」の最新バージョン「 Acid3」が3月3日に登場して以来、どのWebブラウザが一番にAcid3に合格するかを巡ってデッドヒートが繰り広げられている。
Acidテスト はWeb技術の標準化を目指した活動を行うWeb Standard Project （WaSP）が開発するテストスイート。2005年にリリースされた前バージョンのAcid2ではHTMLのレイアウトに使われるCSS規格への準拠の度合いを測る目的で設計されていたが、2008年3月に登場したAcid3は、ECMAScript（JavaScript）やW3CのDOMレベル2関連の規格が新たにテスト項目として大幅に加えられている。より動的なWebページに対応したことで、Webアプリケーションが一般化した現状にキャッチアップした形だ（参考記事：新Acidテストは、Webアプリケーションに焦点）。
ブラウザ に 「 Acid（意地悪）」なテストスイート
過去にもそうであったように 、Acidテストはリリース時点では、すべてのWebブラウザがテストに不合格となるよう設計されている。Acid（アシッド）は化学で「酸性の」という意味があり、日常用語では「辛辣な 」
「意地悪な」というニュアンスで使われる形容詞だ。
Acidテストは結果がビジュアルに表示されることも大きな特徴だ。Acid2ではテスト項目の大多数にパスすればスマイルマークが見えてくる。若干の項目で不合格になる程度であれば、目や鼻の位置がずれたりするだけで顔だと認識できるが、大幅に不合格となると最終的な目標イメージが顔だと言うことすら分からなくなる。
Opera 9.5ベータ版でAcid2テストを実行。正しく表示されている
Firefox2 でAcid2テストを実行した例。顔が崩れていて「不合格」であることが一目瞭然
崩れた顔は哀れを誘う。それ はWebブラウザに突きつけられた“ ダメ出し” だった。
Acid3では最終的に正しくレンダリングされた場合のイメージは顔ではなく、より工業的印象の強い色見本のようなグラフィックになるが、最終的にテストされたWebブラウザが100点満点中何点であるかが表示されるなど、やはりダメ出しといったニュアンスが強い。
Acidテストには批判が根強く、論争が絶えない。テスト項目が恣意的であるし、本当に実用的価値があるのかどうか、現場のデザイナや技術者の間でも意見が割れる。
ただ、最 新 のAcid3について言えば、従来のAcidテストとは事情が異なっているように見える。
“ Acidテスト合 格 ” の宣伝効 果
ほんの2、3年前のAcid2のころには「 Acid2テストに合格」ということを誇らしげに発表するのは、SafariかOperaぐらいだった。Mozilla Firefox もAcid2合格を目指していたが、今にいたるまで不合格のままだ。Firefox3にならなければAcid2に合格するレンダリングエンジンに置き換わらない。
SafariはAcid2テストがリリースされた約2週間後に早々とAcid2に合格しているが、OperaがAcid2に合格するには1年弱かかっている。Firefox3のレンダリングエンジンとなるGecko1.9も1年8カ月ほどかかっている。
この差は技術力や技術的困難さによるものと考えるよりも、どれだけAcidテストを重視していたかによるものと考えたほうが自然だ。Acidテスト合格にはマーケティング上の宣伝効果がある。Acidテストに合格することで「われわれはWebの標準技術を重視しており、誰よりも真剣に取り組んでいる」というメッセージを発信できるからだ。IEやFirefoxというシェア上位のWebブラウザではなく、SafariやOperaがAcidテストに熱心だった背景には、そういう理由がありそうだ。
SafariとOperaがAcid3合格第1号を巡って激戦
Acid2に、リリース後1カ月以内に対応したのはSafariだけだった。ところが、今回のAcid3では少し様子が異なる。Safari開発チームとOpera開発チームが激しいデッドヒートを繰り広げた。
2008年3月18日、世間がSafariの最新リリース版「 Safari 3.1」に沸き立っていたころ、Safariで使われているレンダリングエンジン“ WebKit”の開発チームはAcid3合格を目指して猛烈なスピードでバグ修正を行っていた。Safari 3.1 はAcid3テストで75点だが、WebKitのほうは18日の時点で、すでに90点を超えていた。そして17日に93点、22日に95点、25日96点、26日98点とスコアを伸ばし、3月27日についにWebKit開発チームは、ビルド番号「r31356」におけるAcid3合格を宣言した（参考リンク）。
Operaの開発チームも、ほぼ同時となる2008年3月26日、開発中のレンダリングエンジンでAcid3の満点である100点を達成したと発表。今後1週間程度でプレビュー版を公開するという（参考リンク）。
Acid3に合格したと伝えるSafari（WebKit）開発者のブログエントリ
Acid3で100点満点を取ったと伝えるOpera開発者のブログエントリ
現行 のFirefox2 でAcid3テストを実行した例
こうし たAcid3レースを横目で見てたMozilla開発チームのロブ・セイヤー（Rob Sayre）氏が3月26日のブログエントリで「 Acid3は基本的に無意味」と題する皮肉なコメントを発表している。Acid3が指摘するMozillaの問題点に対して、実践的立場から技術的批判をしている。Acid3で不合格となる問題点を修正したところで、どれも「
WebやWebブラウザの発展に寄与することにならない」（セイヤー氏）としている。「これらはバグだけど、いずれ修正される（たぶんSMIL以外……、それがどうした？）、でもWebデザイナやユーザーには何の影響もないね」（セイヤー氏）。セイヤー氏は、Acid3対応だけを目標としたようなWebKitチームの場当たり的なバグ回避策（参考リンク）をあげつらって、「恥ずかしい！」とまでAcid3レースを揶揄している。Acid3テストについても、「Mozillaは標準技術に強くコミットしている、ただ、自分たちの実装に対して安易なゴム印を押すようなことに腐心したりはしない」
と“ Acid3テスト合格”というラベルをゴム印にたとえるなど手厳しい。
Mozilla のAcidテストに対する冷めた態度はAcid2のときとあまり変わらないようだ。だが、WebKitとOperaが繰り広げるAcid3レースを黙殺することができず、あえて「無意味だ」と言わざるを得なかったところに、時代の潮流が感じられる。
Acid3をデザインしたのはW3CでHTML5の開発・策定をリードしている米グーグルのイアン・ヒクソン氏だ。ヒクソン氏はSafari、Moziila、Operaの開発者が集まって作った業界団体「WHAT WG 」 （Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group）で独自に次世 代Web標準規格を設計していたが、2007年5月にはW3CのHTML5ワーキンググループの共同責任者の1人として迎え入れられた経緯がある。ヒクソン氏は時代の流れに乗る次世代Web標準の鍵を握るキーパーソンだ。Acidテストの実践的意義がどうあれ、Mozilla開発チームがAcid3テストを単純に無視できなかったのにも、こうした背景がありそうだ。
“ Web標 準 ” という理想主義者への批 判
とはいえ 、Acidテストは標準化が重要だと考える人々が勝手に作り出したテストスイートに過ぎない。例えば、元マイクロソフトの開発者でソフトウェアコンサルタントのジョエル・スポルスキー氏は自身のブログで、Web標準などというものは幻想に過ぎないと切り捨てている（参考リンク）。規格は規格でしかなく、どこにも実装がなければ「規格準拠」というのは空想の産物に過ぎないという。Webの世界にあるのは、複数の“ Web標準たち” で、それはIE標準であり、Firefox標準であったりするという。IEだけをとっても、IE6互換モード、IE7互換モードのほか、IE8では新たにWeb標準に準拠したモードが搭載される予定だ。
スポルスキー氏は、最近のIE開発チームの開発ポリシーの転換を強く批判している。IE8では従来、よりWeb標準に適合した新しいレンダリングエンジンはスイッチ切り替えで使えるようになる予定で、デフォルトは旧バージョンのIEと互換性があるレンダリングエンジンが優先されるはずだった。ところが2008年3月5日、IE開発チームはこのポリシーを180度ひっくり返し、互換モードのほうをオプションとすると発表した。マイクロソフトの戦略がどうあれ、IEまでもが過去の互換性よりもWeb標準準拠をうたう時代になったのだ。
IE さえなければページデザインもWebアプリケーションの開発もずっと楽なのに――。そうこぼす開発者たちはIE開発チームのこの決定を歓迎したが、スポルスキー氏の反応は正反対だ。IE8のベータ版でガタガタに崩れたGoogle Mapsの表示を見せて、Web標準の信奉者たちをこう論難する。
「 独りよがりの理想主義者の君たちはみんなは、Google
Mapsの崩れた表示を見て戸惑う初心者のことを笑うだろう。コンシューマーはバカじゃない。それは君の奥さんだ。だから笑うのはやめろ。世界の98％のユーザーはIE8を入れて、“バグがあって、いつものWebサイトが見えない”というだろう。彼らは君らの宗教がかったバカな熱狂なんて、これっぽっちも、みじんも気にしないんだよ。どこにも実装が存在しない、架空の、プラトン的イデアみたいな“ 標準” に適合す るWebブラウザを作るだなんてね。誰も君たちの小汚いハックの話なんて聞きたくないんだ。ほしいのは、現に存在しているWebサイトがちゃんと表示されるWebブラウザなんだよ」。
IE8がもし互換性を捨ててドラスティックな変更を行うと、数十億のWebページが正しく表示されなくなる可能性がある。
IE8に関するスポルスキー氏の予言は、こうだ。ベータテスト中にあまりにユーザーから「表示できない」という不満の声が多いので、IE8開発チームは出荷直前になって再びIE6やIE7との後方互換性を重視したポリシー転換をするだろう。
マイクロソフトは後方互換性にこだわるか
少し話がそれるが 、Webブラウザ戦争の今後を、スポルスキー氏の別のエッセイを引き合いにして占ってみたい。
スポルスキー氏は2004年にマイクロソフトの基本的な戦略について興味深いことを書いている。DOSからWindowsへ移行する時期に、バギーなアプリケーションをWindows上で走らせるためにアドホックな機能追加を行っていたと証言しているのだ（参考リンク）
その具体例に驚かされる。往年のヒットゲーム「SimCity」はメモリの扱いで致命的なバグがあった。開放したメモリを、開放した直後に再び使ってしまうというバグだ。これは1度に1つのアプリケーションしか動かないシングルタスクのDOSでは問題がないが、マルチタスク環境のWindowsでは重大な問題を引き起こす。開放したメモリは、すぐに別のアプリケーションによって利用されるからだ。このためSimCityはWindows上でクラッシュを繰り返したという。SimCityのバグの原因をディスアセンブルして突き止めたマイクロソフトは、SimCityの稼働を検知したらメモリアロケータを特殊なモードで走らせるという機能追加を行った。
これは特殊な話ではなく 、Windowsを新バージョンにアップデートしたときに、あらゆるアプリーションが稼働するよう同社のテストチームは非常に多くの“回避策”
をWindows上に仕込んでいったという。たとえアプリーション側に問題があったとしても、それはWindowsユーザーには関係ない。ユーザーは、Windowsをアップデートしたら自分のアプリケーションが動かなくなったと考える。問題のあるアプリケーション開発者全員に修正させることができない以上、Windows側で回避策を打つ、というアプローチだ。
スポルスキー氏は、こうしたアプローチに賛同しない設計者や技術者が多いことも承知している。もしアプリケーションが何かおかしなことをしていたり、OSの隠し機能を使っていたりしていたら、OSのバージョンアップでそうしたアプリケーションは動かなくなってしかるべきだ、という理想主義的技術論がある。
スポルスキー氏は、アップルはOSで常にそういうアプローチを取っていたといい、またそれこそがアップルがマイクロソフトに勝てない理由だと主張している。氏は後にVistaと呼ばれることになるOSが、このマイクロソフトの長年の基本戦略を踏み外していることを戦略的失敗だと2004年に指摘している。それから約4年後のいま、まさにその心配が現実のものとなっているように見える。
それでも時代 はWeb標準を求めている
スポルスキー氏の考えはOS とWebブラウザで一貫している。たとえユーザーが間違ったアプリケーションはHTMLを作成しようとも、それをサポートするのが大切だ、ということだ。なぜなら多くの理想主義的な技術者が考えるほど、世の中のクリエイターたちは律儀にルールを守ってくれなどしないし、そもそもルールを知ろうともしない人々も多いからだ。
この指摘には一理あるが 、OS時代の考え をWeb時代に当てはめるのは無理がある。高機能化したとはいえ、WebブラウザはOSほど複雑ではない。Webではアプリケーションのロジック、データ、UIの分離がOSよりも明確で、部分的進化がやりやすい。そもそも、OperaやFirefox、Safariを使っていてスポルスキー氏がいうほどレイアウトが崩れてしまうWebサイトなど、今やほとんどない。
2004年の時点で、だからアップルのパソコンは売れないのだと言っていたのが氏の言葉が皮肉だ。昨今Macの売れ行きは好調で、ガートナーの調査によれば北米では前年比37.2％の伸びで2007年のMacのシェアは8％に届いた。後方互換性は低いかもしれないが、アップルのパソコンは売れているのだ。必要なアプリケーションは、ほとんど無償でプリインストールされていて、よく使うアプリケーションはWebの向こう側だ。もうOSの違いが、かつてのように問題になる時代ではない。
こうなってくると、後方互換性の確保こそがユーザー獲得の至上命題だというスポルスキー氏の主張が古く感じられる。スポルスキー氏の主張の根底には「IEという圧勝したプレーヤ対その他弱小プレーヤ」という構図があるようだが、モバイル端末のことまで考えに入れると、こうしたWebブラウザの勢力図は一面的だ。Webブラウザの選択肢が増え、Web技術が進化しようというこのタイミングでIEの後方互換性がユーザーにとって重要だなどというのは時代錯誤だ。IE8のベータテスト期間中に起こることは、大手WebサイトのIE8への対応で、Google Mapsが崩れたままの状態でIE8がリリースされるとは思えない。
後方互換性よりも、ユーザーが本当に気にしているのは、写真やメール、ドキュメントなどのデータのポータビリティであり、どこでもいつでもそれらにアクセスして編集し、ほかのユーザーと共有できる環境があることだ。そうした環境は、オープンなWeb標準に支えられて徐々に現出してくるだろう。
Acid3レースは確かにナンセンスな面はあるかもしれない。しかし、それがWeb標準技術、ひいてはHTML5につながる新世代のWebの世界に対する人々の熱狂の裏返しだと考えれば、冷笑する気にはなれない。第2次Webブラウザ戦争の主戦場は、オープンなWeb標準技術となるはずだ。

The Nordic Battlegroup , a 2,400 soldiers - strong rapid reaction troop , lost a legal battle over its army and was forced to castrate the overtly male heraldic lion :
The proud motto of northern Europe ’s crack rapid - reaction force is ad omnia paratus .
Prepared for everything , everywhere .
But the heraldic lion above the Latin tag now sends a less plucky message – he has just been digitally emasculated and , though technically still a lion rampant , he does not seem to be ready for anything , anywhere .
The change was implemented after a group of women Swedish soldiers protested that they could not identify with such an ostentatiously male lion on their army crest .
A complaint of sex discrimination was then lodged with the European Court of Justice .
“ We were forced to cut the lion ’s willy off with the aid of a computer , ” Christian Braunstein , from the Tradition Commission of the Swedish Army , said .
Now the Nordic Battlegroup , a force of 2,400 soldiers , is looking deeply embarrassed .
For sceptics who already consider the Nordic Battlegroup to be something of an oxymoron – it is led by the Swedes , who were last in battle in 1809 – the operation on the lion is not an auspicious omen .
“ A castrated lion – the perfect symbol for European defence policy , ” an American military blogger sneered .
Exclusive to STR
Ever since I was nine years old , I 've had huge respect for the writer Arthur Ransome .
Some here will recognize him as the author of a delightful series of children 's books starting with Swallows and Amazons , good for reading at any age and full of wholesome stuff ; siblings in each of several families are portrayed , discovering and practising virtues like respect , self - reliance , individual responsibility and courage , and just having adventures and fun .
If you have n't read S&A , your childhood was deprived ; go get a copy and read it now , lest you grow up without the pleasure and it become too late .
Ransome was to the 1930s and ' 40s what J.K. Rowling is to the 1990s and 2000s .
He had me at Hello , and inspired in me a lifelong love of sailing , for all his characters sail .
Sailing has been the single most enjoyable pastime of my life , so I owe him much gratitude .
One of my treasures is a short hand - signed reply he sent me to some boyhood query about where best to drop anchor .
It was therefore quite a shock to discover last year that although Ransome lived most of his life as a genial , avuncular , conventional member of the English middle class -- perhaps , a typical bourgeois -- for ten years in his 30s he was in bed with the Bolsheviks , literally in one case , for he married Evgenia Shelepina , a secretary to Leon Trotsky .
Ransome 's family background was in the ( Classical ) Liberal tradition , and he blossomed late , being undistinguished at school .
As a young writer in London , he was gregarious , talented and very well liked -- but still struggling , as writers often must , and by 1914 was reeling from a failed first marriage .
His strong ambition then led him to Russia , in search of folk stories he could translate and publish back home , so he went to St. Petersburg and in a few months taught himself Russian (! ) and got to work .
His labors on what became Old Peter 's Russian Tales were disturbed by WWI , and as he'd become friendly with foreign journalists in Petersburg , he found himself in demand as a reporter from the Eastern Front .
He was hired by a London daily and later by the Manchester Guardian .
He then made it his business to get to know as many in Russian public life as he could , and among his contacts after 1916 was the band of revolutionaries called Bolsheviks .
Ransome repeatedly claimed he was never " political , " but made friends with all ; so he was able to befriend these too -- before , during and after their acquisition of power -- despite his freely - admitted dislike of politics and ignorance of economics .
His newspaper articles showed empathy , at least , for the new régime , and when the British and other governments invaded Russia to try to put down the Communists , Ransome wrote against the intervention as sheer folly .
So , I hope , would have you and I -- though it threw the Brits into a tizzy ; they did n't know whether to trust him as a part - time spy or denounce him as a Red .
Such foreign support was rare , and the new Russian leaders appreciated it and gave Ransome extraordinary access .
In 1919 he was on first - name terms with most of them including Lenin ( with whom he would play chess and sometimes win ! -- yet lived to tell the tale ) and especially close to Karl Radek , of whom Ransome 's cheery snapshot appears here and who was # 2 to Trotsky .
Radek had been in exile until 1916 with Lenin , and it was his achievement to persuade the German government to support the Bolsheviks with money and with that very special train which brought them all across Germany and Scandinavia and back to Russia in 1917 ready to complete the Revolution .
Early in 1918 it was Radek , again , who led negotiations with the Germans in Brest - Litovsk , which gave the Germans a handsome return on their investment by taking Russia out of the war so that the Kaiser could focus his armies on the French , British and Americans on the Western Front -- while giving the Bolsheviks respite to deal with the chaos and deprivation at home which the Tsar 's war had produced .
Kark Radek can therefore be said to be the one who ( 1 ) enabled the Russian Revolution to take place , ( 2 ) enabled it to survive the first few critical months of life , and ( 3 ) thereby changed the course of history for the worse .
And this was the roommate of my long - time favorite author .
Life is full of surprises .
Stalin , who later murdered seven million owners of small farms by stealing their produce , was around when Ransome drank tea and vodka with his friends , but was in the second rank , waiting his chance for a power grab ; and Stalin was what Lenin , Trotsky , Radek and company made possible .
These were people whom journalist Ransome knew as human beings , and supposed they were trying to do what they thought best .
In our own time we rightly damn Bush and Cheney as mass murderers and warmongers ; yet on a personal level , I would not be surprised to find each of them as affable a fellow as might be met at a cocktail party -- to say nothing of Condi Rice , among whose admirable attributes is the ability to play music .
Ransome returned to England in 1924 and by the decade 's end had started his series of children 's books that would bring him fame and fortune ; he and Evgenia lived most often in the Lake District , where many of the stories are based and where I walked many a fell in my youth .
Having been thought a Red sympathizer , he had some difficulty being admitted to the local yacht club , and had to emphasize again that he had neither interest in nor understanding of politics and swore that he was not only not a Communist , he was n't even a Socialist .
I think I believe him ; I think he was just as naïve as he asserted , just a good writer who researched deeply and befriended whomever he could .
Was there , however , a line that he crossed - - was he too uncritical ?
Was there a point at which he ought to have said to his friend Karl Radek , " Enough !
Your friends are murdering innocents in the street , I will no longer regard you as honest reformers . "
Never mind that had he done so , he would instantly have been excluded from the inner Bolshevik circle that gave him such influence as a reporter .
Should he not have recognized evil when he saw it , and walked away on moral grounds ?
It 's easy enough to say now that he should , but in pointing an accusing finger at Ransome , we have to take care that three other fingers do n't point back at ourselves .
Should Ransome have walked out on his friends ?
Not unless you and I walk out on our neighbors .
Yes , his friends killed adversaries without trial ; yes , they set out to ( and did ) govern millions of people who had the absolute right to govern themselves .
These things were evil , for " evil " is best defined as something like taking " any action which imposes force upon another human being . "
Thus , Stalin and Hitler were not evil per se , but they did evil when they starved seven million peasants and gassed six million Jews .
Ransome 's friends were as amiable as he thought -- but they did evil when they set out to exercise rule .
Were they worse than their predecessor the Czar ?
Perhaps , but Ransome had seen the awful catastrophe caused by that " autocracy " and might be forgiven for thinking , at the time , that his friends were not .
Ransome could not have been unaware of those summary executions ; his serious error was to condone them , to be so tolerant in his friendliness as to suppose that even a worthy end can result from an evil means .
Those who today suppose that freedom can come from the barrel of a political gun in the 2008 or any other election are making a similar error , and Stefan Molyneux made a comparable point here in his brilliant article about running for public office .
Ransome 's error was exactly that of virtually all of our neighbors at election time -- for ballots are merely bullets , in drag .
Failing clearly to understand politics and economics , once one accepts that government is in some way necessary , it 's a very short step to accepting that it 's okay to use force to put or keep it in place .
The voter is saying , as he pulls the lever or presses the screen , " I want you to be ruler , and if you win and anyone refuses to submit to your rule , it 's okay by me if you kill him . "
Ultimately , that 's exactly what always occurs ; on the chaotic streets of Petersburg in 1917 , they just took a short cut .
This definition of " evil " fits the whole political world , from the tyrants who control vast armies to the tin gods of Town Hall who forbid anyone to modify his own property without their permission .
The imposition of force or fraud is what evil is .
Governments never do anything else but impose force , and so government is always , invariably evil in all it does .
Sometimes other people impose force too , by doing violence such as rape and murder and by stealing property .
They are not evil , but those actions are -- by definition .
They are -- for those moments when they impose their wills upon others -- acting as miniature , one - person governments .
That 's the nature and full extent of evil .
It had nothing to do with Eve desiring an apple , allegedly signifying the knowledge of right and wrong ( without which sense the human race would be in a very bad way ) , but everything to do with using force instead of persuasion and voluntary exchange .
It follows that the only kind of society that can eliminate or at least minimize evil is one in which no mechanism exists for the imposition of force .
We call that kind of society " anarchist , " for it 's one from which the institution of government has vanished .
If we wish ourselves and our fellow - humans well , we can have no better aim than to cause it -- by persuasion only -- to come about .
WASHINGTON  The Senate voted 51 to 45 on Wednesday afternoon to ban waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency against high - level terrorism suspects .
Senate Republicans generally opposed the bill , but several of them also did not want to cast a vote that could be construed as supporting torture , and so were relying on President Bush to make good on a threat to veto legislation limiting C.I.A. interrogation techniques .
The prohibition of harsh interrogation techniques is part of a wider intelligence authorization bill and would restrict all American interrogators to techniques allowed in the Army Field Manual , which bars the use of physical force .
The House approved the bill in December by a vote of 222 to 199 , mostly along party lines .
Wednesday ’s vote in the Senate was also along party lines .
All the “ no ” votes were cast by Republicans , except for those of Senators Joseph I. Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut , and Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska .
Five Republicans and Senator Bernard Sanders , independent of Vermont , voted “ yes . ”
The US government agency responsible for compiling the country 's list of endangered species will face a new legal challenge today over its failure to protect the polar bear .
Environmental groups are set to sue the Bush administration in a federal court in California , claiming the Fish and Wildlife Service is now in breach of its own mandate .
The FWS was due to have decided by January 9 whether to classify the polar bear as threatened due to climate change .
This date itself was a full year after consultations began on the issue .
But the service has said it is still reviewing technical data along with more than 670,000 comments on the issue .
The FWS inspector general has announced a preliminary investigation into the delay to determine whether a full - fledged investigation is warranted .
Environmental campaigners widely believe the decision is being held up by the Bush administration so it can complete sale of valuable oil and gas leases in coastal waters in Alaska — areas considered to be prime bear habitats .
" The Bush administration seems intent on slamming shut the narrow window of opportunity we have to save polar bears , " said Kassie Siegel , climate program director at the Center for Biological Diversity , which , along with Greenpeace and the National Resource Defence Council , is involved in the legal challenge .
With the polar bear having become a leading symbol of the planet 's deepening environmental crisis , its inclusion on the endangered list is a key issue to groups seeking to force the Bush administration to recognise the fact of climate change as a consequence of man-made atmospheric pollution .
While US law requires an endangered species listing decision to be made strictly on the basis of scientific information regarding the foreseeable future , groups believe that recent sales of oil and gas leases in the Chukchi Sea , as well as expectations of an energy and mining boom across the entire Arctic region , is the truer measure of the administration 's motivation .
" This administration has listed fewer species than any other — ever — under the Endangered Species Act , " said Siegel .
" Time and again we have seen political interference in listing proposals that are supposed to be based on science . "
Environmental groups hope that the courts will force the administration to make a decision to protect the species — a decision that would be widely interpreted as a significant step toward acknowledging the extent of climate change .
" For seven years they have denied or downplayed global warming , " added Siegel .
" This is the thing that has pinned them into a corner ; either they go to court and lose , or acknowledge it — and acknowledge that our greenhouse gas emissions are driving the polar bear to extinction . "
Disputed figures
There is disagreement over population numbers for polar bears .
The animals are difficult to count in the wild .
Unlike ring seals or walruses , which live and hunt exclusively on ice , polar bears are considered relatively adaptable .
Alaskan political figures led by Governor Sarah Palin , a consistent advocate of increased oil and gas drilling , maintain the bears ' population is steady .
But a recent US Geological Survey report stated that unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed significantly , two - thirds of the world 's polar bears , including all Alaskan bears , will disappear by 2050 .
What is not in dispute is the decline of ice cover .
Surveys have shown there was 1 m square miles less sea ice last summer than the average minimum extent observed between 1979 - 2000 .
Even this analysis is considered cautious .
A study released in January by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center says the North Pole could be free of summer sea ice by 2030 ; one Nasa scientist says it might gone by 2012 ; and a meteorologist in Resolute Bay , Canada , told theguardian.com last summer of a projection in which the region could have " Florida summers in 40 years " .
Still , the forces arrayed against listing the bear are formidable .
Listing a species obligates the Fish and Wildlife Service to develop a recovery plan and to designate critical habitats .
In a cascade of knock - on effects , this would force all government agencies to ensure they do not jeopardise the species or adversely affect its habitats .
To Alaskan political figures , the implications are clear .
Alaska senator Ted Stevens recently voiced concern that bear protections could interfere with construction of a pipeline from the state 's North Slope gas field .
Adding polar bears to the endangered list , Stevens said , " would establish a dangerous precedent " .
Given the economic and strategic value of the oil and gas reserves in the US High Arctic — the leases on 29 m acres of the Chuchki Sea raised $ 2.6bn and a further 83 m acres are being made available — it is conceivable that the administration could reject listing the bear altogether .
" The science is unequivocal , " said Margaret Williams , director of World Wildlife Fund 's Bering Sea programme .
" But anything is possible given this administration 's poor record on listing species .
It 's hard to imagine such a decision could be made in good faith . "
Still , those opposed to the listing argue that the scientific justification to declare the bear as threatened is n't there .
They dispute evidence that bear populations are showing the signs of environmental stress — such as declining numbers , declining life expectancy , and low birth weight .
" From my perspective , it 's very difficult to put a population on the list that 's healthy , based on a projection 45 years into the future , " said Ken Taylor , Palin 's deputy commissioner of fish and game , recently .
" That 's really stretching scientific credibility . "
Hunting
Across the Arctic region of the North American continent , there is resentment over what Inuit regard as meddling southerners .
Under Canadian regulations , indigenous communities are awarded licences to kill a certain number of bears each season .
These " tags " are typically sold to wealthy US and European hunters , each bringing in as much as $ 50,000 each to impoverished communities .
If polar bears were listed , a complete ban on hunting on US territory would follow .
Furthermore , the skins of bears shot in Canada would be banned from the entering the US .
These measures would be a strong disincentive to US trophy hunters , who might take their lucrative business elsewhere .
Inuit elders say that since those in the south are the cause of the imbalance between nature and man , they have no right to challenge the Inuit 's tradition as huntsmen .
But environmentalists stress their objective is not to deprive indigenous people of their livelihood .
Other Arctic species have been listed before — Kittlitz 's murrelets , for example — and more are proposed , including the walrus and ringed seal .
But as the argument over the polar bear 's status intensifies , there 's no underestimating the emotional value invested in the outcome .
" It 's a landmark decision and [ a ] landmark case , " said Williams .
" But we still do n't know how it will play out . "

The trouble with throwing a party is that the guests get in the way .
Some turn up at the wrong time , others are not dressed for the occasion and yet more fail to mind their manners .
Read her incredible email in full
Story : Live webcam foils transatlantic burglary
On the occasion of her 21st birthday bash at the Ritz Hotel , however , bank worker Lucy Gao decided there would be none of these problems .
She sent a detailed e-mail to 39 of her friends setting out the schedule for the evening .
It gave them staggered time slots for arrival and told them what to wear and even what to say .
There were also helpful hints such as : ‘ It goes without saying that the more upper - class you dress , the less likely you shall be denied entry . ’
The meticulous Miss Gao , however , saw her best - laid plans backfire on her .
One colleague at Citigroup bank was so stunned by the message that he forwarded it on to a friend .
She in turn sent it to 12 colleagues in her department with four additional words at the top – ‘ Her best yet … enjoy ’ .
And as always seems to happen in these cases , the e-mail has pinged around the world , entertaining bank workers by the thousand .
Miss Gao was a pupil at Parkstone Grammar School for girls in Poole , Dorset , before studying engineering at Balliol College , Oxford .
Her father Zhiyong , 49 , and mother Pin Lui , 48 , both have doctorates .
Mr Gao works for Sony while his wife works for Marconi .
They recently moved to Coventry while their daughter took up a work - experience internship with Citigroup in Real Estate Equity Research at the bank ’s headquarters in Canary Wharf , East London .
Her birthday party began last Friday evening with a champagne reception at the Rivoli Bar in the Ritz , and ended at the Pangea nightclub in Mayfair .
Miss Gao opened the e-mail by briefly thanking her friends for confirming they would attend .
She then launched into 350 words of instructions about precisely where they should go and when .
The honoured few were given slots in staggered arrival times and told that if they had any problems on the night to call her ‘ PA ’ – believed to be university friend Sanampreet Gill .
The message went on : ‘ Please read ALL the following to ensure your entry into the Ritz .
I have arranged the Ritz to host a Champagne Reception with a selection of Ritz Champagne for all my guests , this will be on me so please come and indulge .
‘ A specially made birthday cake has also been ordered and the Ritz waiters will kindly serve you each a generous slice with Ritz cutleries , etc … also on me . ’
Men were to wear shirts , jackets and ties while women should stick to cocktail dresses and skirts .
If in doubt , they should contact the birthday girl who gave her mobile number , direct line at work and fax number .
She stipulated that when asked by staff : ‘ How can I help you Sir / Madame ? ’ partygoers should reply : ‘ I am here for Lucy ’s Birthday Party at the Rivoli Bar ’ .
One recipient wrote on the e-mail : ‘ Maybe we need to revisit the intern selection criteria – I think the emphasis on control may be too high !’
Yesterday a message , claiming to be from Miss Gao , was posted on an Oxford University gossip website .
It said that the e-mail was meant to be a joke between friends , but that things were now ‘ seriously getting out of control ’ .
The message went on : ‘ I am sorry if you found the content of the invitation details offensive and I am glad to entertain .
‘ But please stop now because it is getting really unprofessional and unnecessary , and a lot of you know me anyway and have heard about this so I apologise for repeating this again , but hopefully for the final time . ’
A Citigroup spokesman said Miss Gao had done nothing wrong and her employment was unaffected .
