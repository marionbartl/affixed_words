A Million - user Comet Application with Mochiweb , Part 2
In Part 1 , we built a ( somewhat useless ) mochiweb comet application that sent clients a message every 10 seconds .
We tuned the Linux kernel , and built a tool to establish a lot of connections in order to test performance and memory usage .
We found that it took around 45 KB per connection .
Part 2 is about turning the application into something useful , and saving memory :
Implement a message router with a login / logout / send API
Update the mochiweb app to receive messages from the router
Setup a distributed erlang system so we can run the router on a different node / host to mochiweb
Write a tool to spam the router with lots of messages
Graph memory usage over 24hrs , and optimise the mochiweb app to save memory .
Implementing the message router
This means we are decoupling the message sending logic from the mochiweb app .
In tandem with the floodtest tool from part 1 , we can benchmark a setup closer to a production scenario .
The router API is just 3 functions :
login( Id , Pid ) register a process ( of pid Pid ) to receive messages for Id
register a process ( of pid ) to receive messages for logout ( Pid ) to stop receiving messages
to stop receiving messages send ( Id , Msg ) sends the message Msg to any client logged in as Id
Id
Note that , by design , it is possible for one process to login with multiple differents .
This example router module uses 2 ets tables to store bidirectional mappings between Pids and Ids .
( pid2id and id2 pid in the #state record below . )
router.erl :
- module ( router ) . - behaviour ( gen_server ) . - export ( [ start_link / 0 ] ) . - export ( [ init / 1 , handle_call / 3 , handle_cast / 2 , handle_info / 2 , terminate / 2 , code_change / 3 ] ) . - export ( [ send / 2 , login / 2 , logout / 1 ] ) .
- define ( SERVER , global : whereis_name ( ? MODULE ) ) . % will hold bidirectional mapping between id <--> pid - record ( state , { pid2id , id2 pid } ) . start_link ( ) -> gen_server : start_link ( { global , ?
MODULE } , ? MODULE , [ ] , [ ] ) .
% sends
Msg to anyone logged in as Id send ( Id , Msg ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { send , Id , Msg } ) .
login ( Id , Pid ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { login , Id , Pid } ) .
logout ( Pid ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { logout , Pid } ) . % % init ( [ ] ) -> % set this so we can catch death of logged in pids : process_flag ( trap_exit , true ) , % use ets for routing tables { ok , # state { pid2id = ets : new ( ?
MODULE , [ bag ] ) , id2 pid = ets : new ( ?
MODULE , [ bag ] ) } }. handle_call ( { login , Id , Pid } , _ From , State ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> ets : insert ( State # state.pid2id , { Pid , Id } ) , ets : insert ( State # state.id2pid , {
Id , Pid } ) , link ( Pid ) , % tell us if they exit , so we can log them out io : format ( " ~w logged in as ~w
" , [ Pid , Id ] ) , { reply , ok , State } ; handle_call ( { logout , Pid } , _ From , State ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> unlink ( Pid ) , PidRows = ets : lookup ( State # state.pid2id , Pid ) , case PidRows of [ ] -> ok ; _ -> IdRows = [ { I , P } || { P , I } <- PidRows ] , % invert tuples % delete all pid-> id entries ets : delete ( State # state.pid2id , Pid ) , % and all id -> pid [ ets : delete_object ( State # state.id2pid , Obj ) || Obj <- IdRows ] end , io : format ( " pid ~w logged out
" , [ Pid ] ) , { reply , ok , State } ; handle_call ( { send , Id , Msg } , _ From , State ) -> % get pids who are logged in as this Id Pids = [ P || { _
Id , P } <- ets : lookup ( State # state.id2pid , Id ) ] , % send Msg to them all M = { router_msg , Msg } , [ Pid !
M || Pid <- Pids ] , { reply , ok , State }. % handle death and cleanup of logged in processes handle_info ( Info , State ) -> case Info of { ' EXIT ' , Pid , _ Why } -> % force logout : handle_call ( { logout , Pid } , blah , State ) ; Wtf -> io : format ( " Caught unhandled message : ~w
" , [ Wtf ] ) end , { noreply , State }. handle_cast ( _ Msg , State ) -> { noreply , State }. terminate ( _ Reason , _ State ) -> ok .
code_change ( _ OldVsn , State , _ Extra ) -> { ok , State } .
Updating the mochiweb application
Let 's assume a user is represented by an integer
Id based on the URL they connect to mochiweb with , and use that id to register with the message router .
Instead of blocking for 10 seconds then sending something , the mochiweb loop will block on receiving messages from the router , and send an HTTP chunk to the client for every message the router sends it :
Client connects to mochiweb at http://localhost:8000/test/123
Mochiweb app registers the pid for that connection against the id ' 123 ' with the message router
If you send a message to the router addressed to id ' 123 ' , it will be relayed to the correct mochiweb process , and appear in the browser for that user
Here 's the updated version of mochiconntest_web.erl :
- module ( mochiconntest_web ) . - export ( [ start / 1 , stop / 0 , loop / 2 ] ) . %%
External API start ( Options ) -> { DocRoot , Options1 } = get_option ( docroot , Options ) , Loop = fun ( Req ) -> ?
MODULE : loop ( Req , DocRoot ) end , % we 'll set our maximum to 1 million connections .
( default : 2048 ) mochiweb_http : start ( [ { max , 1000000 } , { name , ?
MODULE } , { loop , Loop } | Options1 ] ) . stop ( ) -> mochiweb_http : stop ( ? MODULE ) . loop ( Req , DocRoot ) -> " / " ++
Path = Req : get ( path ) , case Req : get ( method ) of Method when Method =:= ' GET ' ; Method =:= ' HEAD ' -> case Path of " test / " ++
Id ->
Response = Req : ok ( { " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " , [{ " Server " , " Mochiweb - Test " } ] , chunked } ) , % login using an integer rather than a string { IdInt , _} = string : to_integer ( Id ) , router : login ( IdInt , self ( ) ) , feed ( Response , IdInt , 1 ) ; _ ->
Req : not_found ( ) end ; ' POST ' -> case Path of _ -> Req : not_found ( ) end ; _ ->
Req : respond ( { 501 , [ ] , [ ]} ) end .
feed ( Response , Id , N ) -> receive { router_msg , Msg } ->
Html = io_lib : format ( " Recvd msg # ~w : ' ~s ' " , [ N , Msg ] ) , Response : write_chunk ( Html ) end , feed ( Response , Id , N + 1 ) . %%
Internal API get_option ( Option , Options ) -> { proplists : get_value ( Option , Options ) , proplists : delete ( Option , Options ) }.
It 's Alive !
Now let 's bring it to life - we 'll use 2 erlang shells , one for mochiweb and one for the router .
Edit start - dev.sh , used to start mochiweb , and add the following additional parameters to erl :
- sname n1 to name the erlang node ' n1 '
to name the erlang node ' n1 ' + K true to enable kernel - poll .
Seems daft not to when dealing with lots of connections
to enable kernel - poll .
Seems daft not to when dealing with lots of connections +P 134217727 the default maximum number of processes you can spawn is 32768 .
Considering we need one process per connection ( and I do n't know of any good reason not to ) I suggest just setting this to the maximum possible value .
134,217,727 is the max according to " man erl " .
make && ./start - dev.sh
( n1@localhost ) 1 >
Now runand you should see a prompt like this :- your mochiweb app is now running and the erlang node has a name .
Now run another erlang shell like so : erl - sname n2 Currently those two erlang instances do n't know about each other , fix that : ( n2@localhost ) 1 > nodes ( ) .
2 > net_adm:ping ( n1@localhost ) .
pong ( n2@localhost ) 3 > nodes ( ) .
[ n 1@localhost ]
Now compile and start the router from this shell : ( n2@localhost ) 4 > c( router ) .
{ok , router} ( n2@localhost ) 5 > router: start_link ( ) .
{ok , <0.38.0>}
Now for the fun bit , go to http://localhost:8000/test/123 in your browser ( or use lynx -- source " http://localhost:8000/test/123 " from the console ) .
Check the shell you launched the router in , you should see it logged in one user .
You can now send messages to the router and watch them appear in your browser .
Only send strings for now , because we are using ~s to format them with io_lib : format in the feed function , and atoms will crash it :
Just borrow the shell you used to launch the router :
( n2@localhost ) 6 > router : send ( 123 , " Hello World " ) .
( n2@localhost ) 7 > router : send ( 123 , " Why not open another browser window too ? " ) .
( n2@localhost ) 8 > router : send ( 456 , " This message will go into the void unless you are connected as / test / 456 too " ) .
Check your browser , you 've got comet :)
Running in a distributed erlang system
It makes sense to run the router and mochiweb front - end (s ) on different machines .
Assuming you have a couple of spare machines to test this on , you should start the erlang shells as distributed nodes , i.e. use - name n1@host1.example.com instead of - sname n1 ( and the same for n 2 ) .
Make sure they can see each other by using net_adm : ping ( ... ) as above .
Note that on line 16 of router.erl , the name of the router process ( ' router ' ) is registered globally , and that because we are using the following macro to identify / locate the router in calls to gen_server , it will already work fine in a distributed system :
- define ( SERVER , global: whereis_name(?
MODULE ) ) .
A global name registry for processes in a distributed system is just one of the things you get for free with Erlang .
Generating lots of messages
In a real environment we might see a long - tail like usage pattern , with some very active users and many infrequent users .
However for this test we 'll just indiscriminately spam random users with fake messages .
msggen.erl :
- module ( msggen ) . - export ( [ start / 3 ] ) . start ( 0 , _ , _ ) -> ok ; start ( Num , Interval , Max ) ->
Id = random : uniform ( Max ) , router : send ( Id , " Fake message Num = " ++ Num ) , receive after Interval -> start ( Num - 1 , Interval , Max ) end .
This will send Num messages to random user Ids between 1 and Max , waiting Interval ms between each send .
You can see this in action if you run the router and the mochiweb app , connect with your browser to http://localhost:8000/test/3 then run :
erl - sname test ( test@localhost ) 1> net_adm:ping ( n1@localhost ) .
pong ( test@localhost ) 2 > c( msggen ) .
{ok , msggen} ( test@localhost ) 3> msggen:start ( 20 , 10 , 5 ) . ok
This will send 20 messages to random Ids between 1 - 5 , with a 10ms wait between messages .
Chances are Id 3 will receive a message or four .
We can even run a few of these in parallel to simulate multiple sources for messages .
Here 's an example of spawning 10 processes that each send 20 messages to ids 1 - 5 with a 100 ms delay between each message :
[ spawn ( fun ( ) -> msggen : start ( 20 , 100 , 5 ) , io : format ( " ~w finished .
" , [ self ( ) ] ) end ) || _ <- lists : seq ( 1 , 10 ) ] .
C10 K again , with feeling
We have the pieces we need to run another larger - scale test now ; clients connect to our mochiweb app , which registers them with the message router .
We can generate a high volume of fake messages to fire at the router , which will send them to any registered clients .
Let 's run the 10,000 concurrent - user test again from Part 1 , but this time we 'll leave all the clients connected for a while while we blast lots of messages through the system .
Assuming you followed the instructions in Part 1 to tune your kernel and increase your max files ulimit etc , this should be easy .
You already have the mochiweb app and router running , so let 's dump more traffic on it .
Without any clients connected , the mochiweb beam process uses around 40 MB ( resident ) :
$ ps -o rss = -p ` pgrep -f ' sname n 1 ' ` 40156
This greps for the process ID of the command with ' sname n1 ' in it , which is our mochiweb erlang process , then uses some formatting options to ps to print the RSS value - the resident memory size ( KB )
I concocted this hideous one - liner to print the timestamp ( human readable and a unixtime in case we need it later ) , current memory usage of mochiweb ( resident KB ) , and the number of currently established connections every 60 seconds - leave this running on the mochiweb machine in a spare terminal :
Reformatted for readability :
MOCHIPID = ` pgrep -f ' name n1 ' ` while [ 1 ] do NUMCON = ` netstat -n | awk '/ ESTABLISHED / && $ 4= = " 127.0.0.1:8000 " ' | wc -l ` MEM = ` ps -o rss = -p $ MOCHIPID ` echo -e " ` date ` \t ` date +%s ` \t $ MEM \t $ NUMCON " sleep 60 done | tee - a mochimem.log
If anyone knows a better way to plot memory usage for a single process over time please leave a comment ..
Now launch the floodtest tool from Part 1 in a new erl shell :
erl > floodtest : start ( " /tmp/mochi-urls.txt " , 10 ) .
This will establish 100 new connections per second until all 10,000 clients are connected .
You 'll see it quickly reaches 10 k connections :
erl > floodtest : start ( " /tmp/mochi-urls.txt " , 10 ) .
Stats : { 825,0,0} Stats : { 1629,0,0} Stats : { 2397,0,0} Stats : { 3218,0,0} Stats : { 4057,0,0} Stats : { 4837,0,0} Stats : { 5565,0,0} Stats : { 6295,0,0} Stats : { 7022,0,0} Stats : { 7727,0,0} Stats : { 8415,0,0} Stats : { 9116,0,0} Stats : { 9792,0,0} Stats : { 10000,0,0} ...
Check the hideous memory usage one - liner output :

Oct 20 17:04:51 BST
2008 1224518691 90964 10001
It reached 10 k concurrent connections ( plus one I had open in firefox ) and the resident memory size of mochiweb is around 90 MB ( 90964KB ) .
Now unleash some messages :
[ spawn ( fun ( ) -> msggen : start ( 1000000 , 100 , 10000 ) end ) || _ <- lists : seq ( 1 , 100 ) ] .
That 's 100 processes each sending a million messages at a rate of 10 messages a second to random Ids from 1 to 10,000 .
That means the router is seeing 1000 messages per second , and on average each of our 10 k clients will get one message every 10 seconds .
Check the output in the floodtest shell , and you 'll see clients are receiving http chunks ( remember it was { NumConnected , NumClosed , NumChunksRecvd} ) :
... Stats : { 10000,0,5912} Stats : { 10000,0,15496} Stats : { 10000,0,25145} Stats : { 10000,0,34755} Stats : { 10000,0,44342} ...
A million messages at a rate of 10 per second per process will take 27 hours to complete .
Here 's how the memory usage looks after just 10 mins :

You can see the size already crept up from 40 MB to 90 MB when all 10 k clients were connected , and to 125 MB after running a bit longer .
It 's worth pointing out that the floodtest shell is almost CPU - bound , the msggen shell is using 2 % CPU and the router and mochiweb less than 1 % .
( ie , only simulating lots of clients is using much CPU - the server app itself is very light on the CPU ) .
It helps to have multiple machines , or a multicore CPU for testing .
Results after running for 24 hours
I ran this for 24 hours , whilst logging memory usage of the mochiweb process to mochimem.log .
This is with 10,000 connected clients , and 1000 messages per second being sent to random clients .
The following bit of bash / awk was used to trick gnuplot into turning the mochimem.log file into a graph :
Reformatted for readability :
( echo " set terminal png size 500,300 " echo " set xlabel \ " Minutes Elapsed \ " " echo " set ylabel \ " Mem ( KB ) \ " " echo " set title \ " Mem usage with 10 k active connections , 1000 msg/ sec \ " " echo " plot \ " - \ " using 1:2 with lines notitle " " awk ' BEGIN{FS= " \t " ;} NR% 10==0 {if( !t ) {t= $ 2 } mins= ( $ 2 - t )/60 ; printf ( " %d %d
" , mins , $ 3 ) } ' mochimem.log echo " end " ) | gnuplot > mochimem.png
Memory usage with c10 k , 1000msg/sec , 24hrs
This graph shows the memory usage ( with 10 k active connections and 1000 msgs / sec ) levels off at around 250 MB over a 24 hour period .
The two big drops , once near the start and once at the end of the test , are when I ran this in the mochiweb erlang process , just out of curiosity :
[ erlang : garbage_collect ( P ) || P <- erlang : processes ( ) ] .
This forces all processes to garbage collect , and reclaimed around 100 MB of memory - next up we investigate ways to save memory without resorting to manually forcing garbage collection .
Reducing memory usage in mochiweb
Seeing as the mochiweb app is just sending messages and then immediately forgetting them , the memory usage should n't need to increase with the number of messages sent .
I 'm a novice when it comes to Erlang memory management , but I 'm going to assume that if I can force it to garbage collect more often , it will allow us to reclaim much of that memory , and ultimately let us serve more users with less overall system memory .
We might burn a bit more CPU in the process , but that 's an acceptable trade - off .
Digging around in the erlang docs yields this option :
erlang:systemflag(fullsweepafter , Number )
Number is a non-negative integer which indicates how many times generational garbages collections can be done without forcing a fullsweep collection .
The value applies to new processes ; processes already running are not affected .
In low - memory systems ( especially without virtual memory ) , setting the value to 0 can help to conserve memory .
An alternative way to set this value is through the ( operating system ) environment variable ERLFULLSWEEPAFTER .
Sounds intriguing , but it only applies to new processes and would affect all processes in the VM , not just our mochiweb processes .
Next up is this :
erlang:systemflag( minheapsize , MinHeapSize )
Sets the default minimum heap size for processes .
The size is given in words .
The new minheapsize only effects processes spawned after the change of minheapsize has been made .
The minheapsize can be set for individual processes by use of spawnopt / N or process_flag / 2 .
Could be useful , but I 'm pretty sure our mochiweb processes need a bigger heap than the default value anyway .
I 'd like to avoid needing to patch the mochiweb source to add spawn options if possible .
Next to catch my eye was this :
erlang : hibernate ( Module , Function , Args )
Puts the calling process into a wait state where its memory allocation has been reduced as much as possible , which is useful if the process does not expect to receive any messages in the near future .
The process will be awaken when a message is sent to it , and control will resume in Module : Function with the arguments given by Args with the call stack emptied , meaning that the process will terminate when that function returns .
Thus erlang : hibernate / 3 will never return to its caller .
If the process has any message in its message queue , the process will be awaken immediately in the same way as described above .
In more technical terms , what erlang : hibernate / 3 does is the following .
It discards the call stack for the process .
Then it garbage collects the process .
After the garbage collection , all live data is in one continuous heap .
The heap is then shrunken to the exact same size as the live data which it holds ( even if that size is less than the minimum heap size for the process ) .
If the size of the live data in the process is less than the minimum heap size , the first garbage collection occurring after the process has been awaken will ensure that the heap size is changed to a size not smaller than the minimum heap size .
Note that emptying the call stack means that any surrounding catch is removed and has to be re-inserted after hibernation .
One effect of this is that processes started using proclib ( also indirectly , such as genserver processes ) , should use proc_lib : hibernate / 3 instead to ensure that the exception handler continues to work when the process wakes up .
This sounds reasonable - let 's try hibernating after every message and see what happens .
Edit mochiconntest_web.erl and change the following :
Make the last line of the feed ( Response , Id , N ) function call hibernate instead of calling itself
function call hibernate instead of calling itself Call hibernate immediately after logging into the router , rather than calling feed and blocking on receive
and blocking on receive Remember to export feed / 3 so hibernate can call back into the function on wake - up
Updated mochiconntest_web.erl with hibernation between messages :
- module ( mochiconntest_web ) . - export ( [ start / 1 , stop / 0 , loop / 2 , feed / 3 ] ) . %%
External API start ( Options ) -> { DocRoot , Options1 } = get_option ( docroot , Options ) , Loop = fun ( Req ) -> ?
MODULE : loop ( Req , DocRoot ) end , % we 'll set our maximum to 1 million connections .
( default : 2048 ) mochiweb_http : start ( [ { max , 1000000 } , { name , ?
MODULE } , { loop , Loop } | Options1 ] ) . stop ( ) -> mochiweb_http : stop ( ? MODULE ) . loop ( Req , DocRoot ) -> " / " ++
Path = Req : get ( path ) , case Req : get ( method ) of Method when Method =:= ' GET ' ; Method =:= ' HEAD ' -> case Path of " test / " ++ IdStr ->
Response = Req : ok ( { " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " , [{ " Server " , " Mochiweb - Test " } ] , chunked } ) , { Id , _} = string : to_integer ( IdStr ) , router : login ( Id , self ( ) ) , % Hibernate this process until it receives a message : proc_lib : hibernate ( ?
MODULE , feed , [ Response , Id , 1 ] ) ; _ ->
Req : not_found ( ) end ; ' POST ' -> case Path of _ -> Req : not_found ( ) end ; _ ->
Req : respond ( { 501 , [ ] , [ ]} ) end .
feed ( Response , Id , N ) -> receive { router_msg , Msg } ->
Html = io_lib : format ( " Recvd msg # ~w : ' ~w ' < br / > " , [ N , Msg ] ) , Response : write_chunk ( Html ) end , %
Hibernate this process until it receives a message : proc_lib : hibernate ( ?
MODULE , feed , [ Response , Id , N + 1 ] ) . %%
Internal API get_option ( Option , Options ) -> { proplists : get_value ( Option , Options ) , proplists : delete ( Option , Options ) }.
I made these changes , ran make to rebuild mochiweb , then redid the same c10 k test ( 1000 msgs/sec for 24hrs ) .
Results after running for 24 hours w/ proc_lib: hibernate ( )
Memory usage with c10 k , 1000msg / sec , 24hrs , using hibernate ( )
Judicious use of hibernate means the mochiweb application memory levels out at 78 MB Resident with 10 k connections , much better than the 450 MB we saw in Part 1 .
There was no significant increase in CPU usage .
Summary
We made a comet application on Mochiweb that lets us push arbitrary messages to users identified by an integer ID .
After pumping 1000 msgs / sec through it for 24 hours , with 10,000 connected users , we observed it using 80 MB , or 8 KB per user .
We even made pretty graphs .
This is quite an improvement from the 45 KB per used we saw in Part 1 .
The savings are attributed to making the application behave in a more realistic way , and use of hibernate for mochiweb processes between messages .
Next Steps
In Part 3 , I 'll turn it up to 1 million connected clients .

Officer forced to quit after 15 years over views on gay sex , says the service has a ' bias against faith '
Duty : PC Cogman served in the force for 15 years
The Christian policeman sacked after a row over gay rights has told how his dismissal after 15 years in the force has ‘ devastated ’ his family .
As The Mail on Sunday revealed in the summer , Graham Cogman objected to being ‘ bombarded ’ at work by emails and posters promoting events such as Gay History Month .
He responded to the ‘ politically correct ’ campaign by sending emails to colleagues quoting Biblical texts suggesting that homosexual sex was sinful .
But he faced accusations of homophobia and a series of disciplinary hearings , culminating 12 days ago in his sacking by Norfolk Police for misconduct .
The twice - commended officer said yesterday : ‘ I am totally devastated .
It was a job I loved .
This is destroying me and my family . ’
He admitted he had ‘ stupidly ’ breached a ban by using the internal communications system to post a link to an American Christian organisation , but said the force ’s decision to sack him was ‘ harsh and disproportionate ’ .
Mr Cogman , 50 , accused the police service of becoming so sensitive to the rights of gays that Christians could no longer safely express their views .
Speaking at his home in Sea Palling , Norfolk , which he shares with his wife Elaine , 46 , and his two children , Mr Cogman said : ‘ In the service in general there is a feeling of fear .
There is a definite bias against faith – any faith – if it takes a critical view of homosexual sex .
‘ The easy option for me would have been to keep quiet but when there is such prejudice towards one point of view , how can that be right ?
That does n’t sound like equality and diversity to me .
‘ I do n’t have any worries with what people do in their private lives – if they are gay , that ’s fine .
I have n’t gone after anyone maliciously . ’
Mr Cogman , backed by the Police Federation , is appealing against his sacking and is planning to take his force to an employment tribunal next year , funded by the Christian Legal Centre .
He said he had received a huge amount of support both from within and outside the force .
Last week the Rev Martin Young , vicar of St Andrew ’s church in Norwich , wrote an open letter to Norfolk Police protesting that it had ‘ manifestly failed to uphold PC Cogman ’s right to express his Christian faith ’ .
The vicar added : ‘ His views are not extreme or unusual .
They are consistent with the published understanding of the Church of England , of which he is a member . ’
Mr Cogman said he had no problems with colleagues until gay liaison officers circulated an email to officers in early 2005 encouraging staff to wear a pink ribbon on their uniforms during Gay History Month .
Sacked : Graham Cogman is to appeal
He emailed colleagues suggesting they might want to read biblical texts suggesting homosexual sex was sinful .
As a result , he was ordered to stop using the internal messaging system for failing to show ‘ tolerance and respect ’ for fellow officers .
The following year , when officers were encouraged to wear rainbow ribbons during Gay History Month , Mr Cogman said it was ‘ inappropriate , thoughtless and insensitive ’ as the rainbow symbolised God ’s faithfulness .
He was accused of unlawfully using the internal messaging system and victimising another gay liaison officer by saying : ‘ Love the sinner , hate the deed . ’
He was docked 13 days ’ pay .
In April this year , he was questioned again after circulating a link to a helpline for people struggling with their sexuality on a website headed by the controversial American preacher Pat Robertson .
At the misconduct hearing , overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission , a panel found that Mr Cogman had ignored an order banning him from using the police computer system and had failed to treat a colleague with politeness and respect .
Mr Cogman said : ‘ I felt physically sick when I heard the ruling .
If I had n’t posted that link I would still have a job .
That was my downfall , my stupidity , however you want to put it .
But my intention was to help . ’
He claimed a small group of pro-gay officers had been determined to oust him .
‘ They have their own agenda and now they have my scalp . ’
Norfolk Police said : ‘ The issue is not about Mr Cogman ’s beliefs but about his behaviour .
He ignored repeated warnings about his behaviour and was dismissed for failing to obey a lawful order and required to resign for failing to show politeness and tolerance to colleagues . ’

Ext4 is part of the Linux 2.6.28 kernel , read the previous link to know more details about that release .
1. Introduction
Ext4 is the evolution of the most used Linux filesystem , Ext3 .
In many ways , Ext4 is a deeper improvement over Ext3 than Ext3 was over Ext2 .
Ext3 was mostly about adding journaling to Ext2 , but Ext4 modifies important data structures of the filesystem such as the ones destined to store the file data .
The result is a filesystem with an improved design , better performance , reliability and features .
2. EXT4 features
2.1. Compatibility
Any existing Ext3 filesystem can be migrated to Ext4 with an easy procedure which consists in running a couple of commands in read - only mode ( described in the next section ) .
This means that you can improve the performance , storage limits and features of your current filesystems without reformatting and / or reinstalling your OS and software environment .
If you need the advantages of Ext4 on a production system , you can upgrade the filesystem .
The procedure is safe and does n't risk your data ( obviously , backup of critical data is recommended , even if you are n't updating your filesystem :) .
Ext4 will use the new data structures only on new data , the old structures will remain untouched and it will be possible to read / modify them when needed .
This means , of course , that once you convert your filesystem to Ext4 you wo n't be able to go back to Ext3 again ( although there 's a possibility , described in the next section , of mounting an Ext3 filesystem with Ext4 without using the new disk format and you 'll be able to mount it with Ext3 again , but you lose many of the advantages of Ext4 ) .
2.2 . Bigger filesystem / file sizes
Currently , Ext3 support 16 TB of maximum filesystem size , and 2 TB of maximum file size .
Ext4 adds 48 - bit block addressing , so it will have 1 EB of maximum filesystem size and 16 TB of maximum file size .
1 EB = 1,048,576 TB ( 1 EB = 1024 PB , 1 PB = 1024 TB , 1 TB = 1024 GB ) .
Why 48 - bit and not 64 - bit ?
There are some limitations that would need to be fixed before making Ext4 fully 64 - bit capable , which have not been addressed in Ext4 .
The Ext4 data structures have been designed keeping this in mind , so a future update to Ext4 will implement full 64 - bit support at some point .
1 EB will be enough ( really until that happens .
( Note :
The code to create filesystems bigger than 16 TB is - at the time of writing this article - not in any stable release of e2fsprogs .
It will be in future releases . )
2.3 . Sub directory scalability
Right now the maximum possible number of sub directories contained in a single directory in Ext3 is 32000 .
Ext4 breaks that limit and allows an unlimited number of sub directories .
2.4 . Extents
The traditionally Unix - derived filesystems like Ext3 use an indirect block mapping scheme to keep track of each block used for the blocks corresponding to the data of a file .
This is inefficient for large files , specially on large file delete and truncate operations , because the mapping keeps a entry for every single block , and big files have many blocks -> huge mappings , slow to handle .
Modern filesystems use a different approach called " extents " .
An extent is basically a bunch of contiguous physical blocks .
It basically says " The data is in the next n blocks " .
For example , a 100 MB file can be allocated into a single extent of that size , instead of needing to create the indirect mapping for 25600 blocks ( 4 KB per block ) .
Huge files are split in several extents .
Extents improve the performance and also help to reduce the fragmentation , since an extent encourages continuous layouts on the disk .
2.5 . Multiblock allocation
When Ext3 needs to write new data to the disk , there 's a block allocator that decides which free blocks will be used to write the data .
But the Ext3 block allocator only allocates one block ( 4KB ) at a time .
That means that if the system needs to write the 100 MB data mentioned in the previous point , it will need to call the block allocator 25600 times ( and it was just 100 MB ! ) .
Not only this is inefficient , it does n't allow the block allocator to optimize the allocation policy because it does n't knows how many total data is being allocated , it only knows about a single block .
Ext4 uses a " multiblock allocator " ( mballoc ) which allocates many blocks in a single call , instead of a single block per call , avoiding a lot of overhead .
This improves the performance , and it 's particularly useful with delayed allocation and extents .
This feature does n't affect the disk format .
Also , note that the Ext4 block / inode allocator has other improvements , described in detail in this paper .
2.6 . Delayed allocation
Delayed allocation is a performance feature ( it does n't change the disk format ) found in a few modern filesystems such as XFS , ZFS , btrfs or Reiser 4 , and it consists in delaying the allocation of blocks as much as possible , contrary to what traditionally filesystems ( such as Ext3 , reiser3 , etc ) do : allocate the blocks as soon as possible .
For example , if a process write ( ) s , the filesystem code will allocate immediately the blocks where the data will be placed - even if the data is not being written right now to the disk and it 's going to be kept in the cache for some time .
This approach has disadvantages .
For example when a process is writing continually to a file that grows , successive write ( ) s allocate blocks for the data , but they do n't know if the file will keep growing .
Delayed allocation , on the other hand , does not allocate the blocks immediately when the process write ( ) s , rather , it delays the allocation of the blocks while the file is kept in cache , until it is really going to be written to the disk .
This gives the block allocator the opportunity to optimize the allocation in situations where the old system could n't .
Delayed allocation plays very nicely with the two previous features mentioned , extents and multiblock allocation , because in many workloads when the file is written finally to the disk it will be allocated in extents whose block allocation is done with the mballoc allocator .
The performance is much better , and the fragmentation is much improved in some workloads .
2.7 . Fast fsck
Fsck is a very slow operation , especially the first step : checking all the inodes in the file system .
In Ext4 , at the end of each group 's inode table will be stored a list of unused inodes ( with a checksum , for safety ) , so fsck will not check those inodes .
The result is that total fsck time improves from 2 to 20 times , depending on the number of used inodes ( http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Improving_fsck_Speeds_in_Ext4).
It must be noticed that it 's fsck , and not Ext4 , who will build the list of unused inodes .
This means that you must run fsck to get the list of unused inodes built , and only the next fsck run will be faster ( you need to pass a fsck in order to convert an Ext3 filesystem to Ext4 anyway ) .
There 's also a feature that takes part in this fsck speed up - " flexible block groups " - that also speeds up filesystem operations .
2.8 . Journal checksumming
The journal is the most used part of the disk , making the blocks that form part of it more prone to hardware failure .
And recovering from a corrupted journal can lead to massive corruption .
Ext4 checksums the journal data to know if the journal blocks are failing or corrupted .
But journal checksumming has a bonus : it allows one to convert the two - phase commit system of Ext3's journaling to a single phase , speeding the filesystem operation up to 20 % in some cases - so reliability and performance are improved at the same time .
( Note : the part of the feature that improves the performance , the asynchronous logging , is turned off by default for now , and will be enabled in future releases , when its reliability improves )
2.9 . " No Journaling " mode
Journaling ensures the integrity of the filesystem by keeping a log of the ongoing disk changes .
However , it is known to have a small overhead .
Some people with special requirements and workloads can run without a journal and its integrity advantages .
In Ext4 the journaling feature can be disabled , which provides a small performance improvement .
2.10 .
Online defragmentation
While delayed allocation , extents and multiblock allocation help to reduce the fragmentation , with usage filesystems can still fragment .
For example :
You write three files in a directory and continually on the disk .
Some day you need to update the file of the middle , but the updated file has grown a bit , so there 's not enough room for it .
You have no option but fragment the excess of data to another place of the disk , which will cause a seek , or allocate the updated file continually in another place , far from the other two files , resulting in seeks if an application needs to read all the files on a directory ( say , a file manager doing thumbnails on a directory full of images ) .
Besides , the filesystem can only care about certain types of fragmentation , it can't know , for example , that it must keep all the boot - related files contiguous , because it does n't know which files are boot - related .
To solve this issue , Ext4 will support online fragmentation , and there 's a e4defrag tool which can defragment individual files or the whole filesystem .
2.11 . Inode - related features
Larger inodes , nanosecond timestamps , fast extended attributes , inodes reservation ...
Larger inodes : Ext3 supports configurable inode sizes ( via the - I mkfs parameter ) , but the default inode size is 128 bytes .
Ext4 will default to 256 bytes .
This is needed to accommodate some extra fields ( like nanosecond timestamps or inode versioning ) , and the remaining space of the inode will be used to store extend attributes that are small enough to fit it that space .
This will make the access to those attributes much faster , and improves the performance of applications that use extend attributes by a factor of 3 - 7 times .
Inode reservation consists in reserving several inodes when a directory is created , expecting that they will be used in the future .
This improves the performance , because when new files are created in that directory they 'll be able to use the reserved inodes .
File creation and deletion is hence more efficient .
Nanoseconds timestamps means that inode fields like " modified time " will be able to use nanosecond resolution instead of the second resolution of Ext3 .
2.12 . Persistent preallocation
This feature , available in Ext3 in the latest kernel versions , and emulated by glibc in the filesystems that do n't support it , allows applications to preallocate disk space :
Applications tell the filesystem to preallocate the space , and the filesystem preallocates the necessary blocks and data structures , but there 's no data on it until the application really needs to write the data in the future .
This is what P2P applications do in their own when they " preallocate " the necessary space for a download that will last hours or days , but implemented much more efficiently by the filesystem and with a generic API .
This has several uses : first , to avoid applications ( like P2P apps ) doing it themselves inefficiently by filling a file with zeros .
Second , to improve fragmentation , since the blocks will be allocated at one time , as contiguously as possible .
Third , to ensure that applications always have the space they know they will need , which is important for RT - ish applications , since without preallocation the filesystem could get full in the middle of an important operation .
The feature is available via the libc posix_fallocate ( ) interface .
2.13 .
Barriers on by default
This is an option that improves the integrity of the filesystem at the cost of some performance ( you can disable it with " mount - o barrier=0 " , recommended trying it if you 're benchmarking ) .
From this LWN article : " The filesystem code must , before writing the [ journaling ] commit record , be absolutely sure that all of the transaction 's information has made it to the journal .
Just doing the writes in the proper order is insufficient ; contemporary drives maintain large internal caches and will reorder operations for better performance .
So the filesystem must explicitly instruct the disk to get all of the journal data onto the media before writing the commit record ; if the commit record gets written first , the journal may be corrupted .
The kernel 's block I/O subsystem makes this capability available through the use of barriers ; in essence , a barrier forbids the writing of any blocks after the barrier until all blocks written before the barrier are committed to the media .
By using barriers , filesystems can make sure that their on - disk structures remain consistent at all times . "
3 . How to use Ext4
At this time , all relevant distros support it .
GRUB also supports Ext4 .
Just use it .
Switching to Ext4 is very easy .
There are three different ways to switch :
3.1 . Creating a new Ext4 filesystem from the scratch
The easiest one , recommended for new installations .
Just update your e2fsprogs package to Ext4 , and create the filesystem with mkfs.ext4 .
3.2 . Migrate existing Ext3 filesystems to Ext4
You need to use the tune2fs and fsck tools in the filesystem , and that filesystem needs to be unmounted .
Run :
tune2fs - O extents , uninit_bg , dir_index /dev/yourfilesystem
After running this command you MUST run fsck .
If you do n't do it , Ext4 WILL NOT MOUNT your filesystem .
This fsck run is needed to return the filesystem to a consistent state .
It WILL tell you that it finds checksum errors in the group descriptors - it 's expected , and it 's exactly what it needs to be rebuilt to be able to mount it as Ext4 , so do n't get surprised by them .
Since each time it finds one of those errors it asks you what to do , always say YES .
If you do n't want to be asked , add the " - p " parameter to the fsck command , it means " automatic repair " :
fsck - pDf /dev/ yourfilesystem
There 's another thing that must be mentioned .
All your existing files will continue using the old indirect mapping to map all the blocks of data .
The online defrag tool will be able to migrate each one of those files to an extent format ( using an ioctl that tells the filesystem to rewrite the file with the extent format ; you can use it safely while you 're using the filesystem normally )
3.3 . Mount an existing Ext3 filesystem with Ext4 without changing the format
You can mount an existing Ext3 filesystem with Ext4 but without using features that change the disk format .
This means you will be able to mount your filesystem with Ext3 again .
You can mount an existing Ext3 filesystem with " mount -t ext4 / dev / yourpartition / mnt " .
Doing this without having done the conversion process described in the previous point will force Ext4 to not use the features that change the disk format , such as extents , it will use only the features that do n't change the file format , such as mballoc or delayed allocation .
You 'll be able to mount your filesystem as Ext3 again .
But obviously you 'll be losing the advantages of the Ext4 features that do n't get used ...
The " Shadow ECB " , a panel of private economists from across Europe , last week called for immediate and drastic rate cuts , demanding to know what the ECB 's strategy now is – if it has any at all .
It would be going too far to describe the ECB 's policy utterings as primitive gibberish – as two Nobel Laureates put it – but the bank is bent on a course of action that is at best very different from the reflation strategies of the Anglo - sphere , China and Switzerland , and risks repeating the errors of 1931 to 1933 .

Tina Fey : Gorgeous Vanity Fair PHOTOS
Actress and comedianhas been riding high with her hit show 30 Rock and her hilarious portrayal ofon Saturday Night Live .
She graces the cover of the January 2009 issue of Vanity Fair .
The talented Fey 's career slipped into high gear this fall when she captured the full attention of a nation with her ' dead on ' impersonation of John McCain 's V.P. running mate .
That short stint of comedic episodes snared her a $ 5 million book deal .
Fey is married to Jeff Richmond , an SNL composer .
They have a three year old daughter Alice .
The actress calls her spouse " the Joe Biden of husbands " , likely to " drop the bomb " in interviews .
That said , the two sat down with Vanity Fair to share some insights into their life .
Check out the link to the full article at the bottom of this post .
In the course of their conversation with VF , Jeff spoke on a subject that has not previously been discussed - Tina Fey 's facial scar .
Said Richmond , " It was in , like , the front yard of her house and some body just came up , and she just thought somebody marked her with a pen . "
The actress was injured when she was five , and would only say , " It 's impossible to talk about it without somehow seemingly exploiting it . "

LIKE professional wrestling , private equity has a butch subculture that is hard to take entirely seriously .
One of its defining characteristics is never , ever , to admit to a mistake in public .
By convention , most buy - out bosses maintain that they anticipated a recession and acted cautiously .
In reality , the buy - out industry had its biggest - ever binge just before the bust began .
Most big firms paid silly prices for companies using sillier levels of debt .
A reminder of just how reckless some deals were was provided on November 26th by BCE , a Canadian telecoms firm and the target of the second - largest buy - out bid on record .
Its auditors judged that if the transaction went ahead the company would become technically insolvent .
As more companies owned by private - equity firms go bust , the industry will have to admit its sins .
Until then executives can enjoy the latitude created by the valuation conventions that govern their portfolios .
Accounting rules require that investments are held at “ fair value ” — the price at which they can be sold to a third party in an orderly transaction .
Valiant efforts to interpret these rules are being made by the International Private Equity Valuations Board , an industry body that some buy - out firms support .
But the calculations involve inevitably subjective comparisons with quoted companies .
Conflicts of interest are possible : some buy - out firms ' in - house dealmakers conduct valuations , which are reviewed by consultants and auditors and approved by senior executives .
Just how optimistic are these valuations ?
In the nine months to the end of September , developed - world shares dropped by about a quarter in dollar terms .
Given their extra leverage , that is consistent with a fall in the value of companies owned by private equity of well over 50 % .
Yet Blackstone has said that its private - equity portfolio fell by just 13 % .
Two Dutch - listed vehicles run by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and by Apollo , which have high exposures to boom - era deals , have both reported drops of about a quarter in their net assets .
Private - equity firms maintain they bought defensive firms which are being run better than quoted peers are .
But the limited price signals available also suggest low confidence in their valuations .
The loans that funded the big deals typically trade at three - quarters of their face value , implying distress .
The shares of the two Dutch - listed vehicles are worth less than 20 % of their net asset values ( see chart ) .
Trading in all of these instruments is admittedly very illiquid , but the implication is hard to ignore .
However clear , does this message actually matter ?
It is hard to see why private - equity firms feel they need to be defensive about falling valuations .
After all , they are paid if and when they sell companies for a profit , not on the basis of current marks .
They lock in their clients ' capital for many years and do not face the collateral calls and liquidity squeezes that make hedge funds so sensitive to calculations of net asset value .
The same cannot be said of the pension funds and endowments that invest in private equity .
Even if they hold investments to maturity , they should care about their current value .
And given the collapse of all asset classes ( with the exception of private equity , of course ) they are now being forced to reshuffle their entire portfolios .
Using unrealistic values for their private - equity stakes pollutes this process .
Many may choose to lower the absolute value of private - equity investments in their portfolios and concentrate their holdings on the best - performing funds .
All of this requires accurate valuations .
It is striking that so - called “ secondary ” sales by clients of stakes in buy - out funds are reputedly taking place at large discounts to their reported values , although again trading remains very thin .
In the end pressure for consistent and conservative valuations must come from clients .
Still there are some signs that private - equity firms , behind the scenes , are preparing for a downturn far more severe than their valuations suggest .
James Hickman , a private - equity specialist at Russell Reynolds , a headhunter , says that requests from buy - out firms to find operational managers have risen by 30 - 50 % .
Veterans with experience of recessions or of restructuring companies are in hot demand .
As are , hopefully , straight talkers .

The odd collection of con men , carpetbaggers , mercenaries , court jesters , and professional propagandists that gathered around W. the way pilot fish jostle about a great white shark has now scattered to more obscure reefs .
Now , as Meyrav Wurmser admitted , they are thinking about how to make money .
They seek perches in the “ think tanks ” of kooky rich old white men , on the airwaves of corporate media , in the halls of the more corrupt corners of academia , or on the opinion pages of the wackier capitalist tools .
So it is that we now have to listen to Fouad Ajami attacking Barack Obama as a coddler of dictators , in the pages of Rupert Murdoch ’s Wall Street Journal , whose editorial line brought us the current meltdown of the American economy and our ruinous foreign imbroglios .
Ajami , from a southern , Lebanese Shiite background , has been for decades a trenchant critic of the pieties of Arab nationalism and a theorist of Neoconservatism .
Ajami appears not to recognize that in demanding that his adopted country , the United States , go about invading or bullying the Arab world and imposing American institutions on it , he is guilty of the same authoritarianism and lack of faith in the Arab little people as the dictators he professes to decry .
Paul Bremer said as he arrived in Iraq , “ We dominate the scene and we will continue to impose our will on this country , ” and Ajami cheered him on , playing a swooning La Malinche to Bremer ’s Hernan Cortes .
Ajami is so mesmerized by elite power that he even mistakenly attributes the success of Tom Paine ’s ideas to British arms ( yes ; see below ) .
Ajami begins his essay by quoting a passage from Obama ’s interview on al - Arabiya :
“ To the Muslim world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect , ” President Barack Obama said in his inaugural .
But in truth , the new way forward is a return to realpolitik and business as usual in America ’s encounter with that Greater Middle East .
As the president told Al - Arabiya television Monday , he wants a return to “ the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago . ”
Ajami maintains that George W. Bush put “ the autocracies ” of the Middle East “ on notice . ”
He toppled the Taliban and overthrew the tyranny of Saddam Hussein .
He frightened Muammar Qaddafi of Libya , he writes , and helped drive Bashar al - Asad ’s troops willy - nilly from Lebanon .
But Ajami ’s narrative is selective and slanted .
The original plan of the Bush administration for Iraq was to turn it over to corrupt financier Ahmad Chalabi as a soft strongman .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld spoke before the invasion of installing “ something like ” democracy in Iraq .
But democracy is like pregnancy , an all or nothing matter , and Rumsfeld ’s hope that he could get Iraq a little bit pregnant predictably faltered on Iraqi popular mobilization and the fatwas of Grand Ayatollah Sistani , who , along with the Sunni Arab insurgency , forced Bush to grant open elections .
That Bush ’s panegyrists always invoke Libya is bizarre .
Qaddafi clearly was maneuvered into coming in from the cold primarily by EU economic sanctions , and was also motivated by his own fear of a Muslim radicalism far more extreme than his own .
As I noted five years ago ,
‘ One caveat : Qadhafi has n’t offered to step down or become less dictatorial .
This is n’t an advance for democracy .
The Bush administration , despite its rhetoric of democratization , still has to choose in the Middle East between having malleable , known strongmen in power , or having unpredictable democracies that might elect radical Islamists or others odious to Washington .
I would n’t bet a lot on the democratization policy .
The US if anything has been urging countries like Tunisia and Yemen to be less democratic and less concerned about civil rights , in the cause of stamping out radical Islamism . ’
So despite Ajami ’s attempt at misdirection , Bush ’s Libya policy involved coddling a dictator , and cannot be cited as an instance of steadfast commitment to democratization .
As for Lebanon , Bush did not force Syria out , the Lebanese people did .
The first thing that happened to them once they chose Bush ’s security umbrella in preference to that of Damascus was that Bush gave the green light to the Israelis to bomb the country back to 1975 , wiping out a generation of economic recovery , degrading infrastructure , scaring off foreign investment , creating massive unemployment , and dropping a million cluster bombs on the farms of Ajami ’s relatives in the south .
Far from destroying Hizbullah , the Bush - Israeli program of what Ajami appears to think was tough love for his native land strengthened radical Shiism and paved the way for a national unity government in which Hizbullah has a virtual veto over government policy and has had its militia formally recognized as an arm of the Lebanese state .
Syria ’s domination of little Lebanon was wrong , but Bush and Ajami ’s friends among the Neoconservatives were no friends of Beirut and were entirely willing to crush the Lebanese like cockroaches to attain their aims there .
To laud Bush as a liberator of the land of the cedars after he actively lobbied against an Israeli ceasefire , prolonging the agony at least an extra month , is like lauding Boris Yeltsin as a liberator of Chechnya .
Ajami cites Samuel Huntington to argue that democracy does not well up from the people but is often “ midwifed ” by the “ dominant power . ”
He says that of 30 democratic countries in 1970 , about half had become democratic via foreign rule or made the transition to democracy “ right after independence from foreign occupation . ”
But 30 is a very small N on which to generalize , and the Nazi conquest of much of Europe in addition to decolonization in the post - war period introduced profound ambiguities into the whole analysis .
Dutch democracy was vital before the German conquest , but was restored by the Allied invasion ; so do we count Holland ’s democracy as being the result of American and British foreign power , or as a result of internal class and economic developments in Holland over centuries , which were briefly interrupted by the Nazis ?
And , I ’ll bet you Ajami is counting India as such a case , even though the British ruled India autocratically and it was Indian social and political forces that opted for independent democracy , something Churchill would never have allowed .
Why Ajami wants to cite 40 - year - old scholarship on democratization should be clear : because if we looked at The Economist ’s ranking [ pdf ] of 167 contemporary countries , we would find that 82 or about half , are “ full ” or “ flawed ” democracies .
And among those 82 , vanishingly few underwent a successful democratic transition because of foreign conquest .
Moreover , Ajami is sidestepping the most important question in democratic transitions , which is not what kicks them off but why they fail or succeed .
Adam Przeworski has found that a relatively high per capita income ( $ 8000 a year or more ) is highly correlated with successful democratic transitions , whereas very poor countries often fail .
The literature on states that depend on income from a single pricey primary commodity ( “ rentier ” states ) finds that they seldom function as democracies ( Norway is the major exception and it developed its political institutions well before it got oil ) .
So in today ’s world , democracy is very seldom the result of foreign conquest , and successful democracy even less so .
( The Economist is apparently not convinced that Patton ’s invasion of Italy has yet borne firm fruit ) .
Ajami even dares say that “ The appeal of the pamphlets of . . .
Paine relied on the guns of Pax Britannica . ”
Tom Paine ?
Did Ajami really say that ?
His appeal depended on George III ’s guns ?
I mean , Ajami is supposed to be a historian .
His topsy - turvey theory of democracy imposed from above has led him to erase the real Tom Paine from history and substitute a bizarro Tom Paine who , instead of hanging out with Jacobins in revolutionary Paris , goes out to vanquish tyranny with the Red Coats at his back !
Ajami appears to have gotten Tom Paine mixed up with Benedict Arnold .
It might be a telling error .
Some of us think we know exactly what Tom Paine would have thought of W .
Ajami argues that the image of Saddam Hussein flushed out of his spider hole has given hope to the Arab masses that tyrants can be overthrown .
But I do n’t know any Arabs who look at it that way .
Most seem to see the humiliation of Saddam as a joint project of American imperialism and Iranian , Shiite plotting , and they see Saddam ’s botched execution as a Shiite lynching .
Ajami ’s own Shiite background makes him so unsympathetic to Sunni Arab nationalism that he is a poor guide to mass sentiment outside the two Souths , of Lebanon and Iraq .
Ajami argues that W. was a “ force for emancipation in Muslim lands , ” whereas Obama was signaling in his speech that he would accept the established order .
He calls on Obama to “ recognize ” Bush as having been a liberator !
But a US military occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan is not liberation , and nobody thinks it is , even the Iraqi Shiite political elite that Bush “ midwifed ” ( he actually tried to forestall it by installing ex-Baathist strong man Ayad Allawi , but the Iraqi masses outfoxed him ) .
If Ajami thinks that the basket case that is Afghanistan deserved flowery rhetoric and soaring figures of speech , he should compose an ode to Somalia while he is at it .
Ajami contrasts Obama , whom he configures as a Republican Realist in the Brent Scowcroft tradition , to emancipator Bush .
But note that it was Bush who backed Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan to the hilt against the masses and the politicians clamoring for a free judiciary and open parliamentary elections .
And it was Barack Obama who congratulated Pakistanis on their return to civilian democracy .
Ajami invents an imaginary democratic Bush and an imaginary Republican Obama .
Let us consider Bush ’s actual relations with Middle Eastern states beyond Pakistan , which would in itself be enough to demonstrate the falsity of Ajami ’s case .
At what point did Bush pressure King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to turn himself into a constitutional monarch ?
When did Bush cut off the $ 2 billion a year his government bestowed on Hosni Mubarak ’s soft military dictatorship in Egypt ?
Did he not accept Qaddafi back into the fold without putting any ‘ democratic ’ preconditions on the deal ?
What of Gaza and the West Bank ?
Does Israel run them as “ democracies ” ?
Did Bush give a rat ’s ass ?
Ajami the prestidigitator makes the elephant of Abu Ghraib , military occupation , the displacement of 4 million Iraqis from their homes , the excess deaths of a million , all disappear in favor of a shining Baghdadi democracy on a hill .
The unstable and possibly violent confrontation of Arab and Kurd is celebrated as a tolerant binational state .
By focusing on this fantasy , of a stable democratic transition in places like Afghanistan (! ) , and by selectively ignoring all the dictatorial regimes Bush held hands with and kissed on both cheeks , Ajami sets up a false dichotomy that allows him to smear Obama .
Ajami descends to new lows in denying that the Palestinians have any legitimate grievances or that their resistance is grounded in those discontents , and blames Obama for acknowledging this obvious fact .
( Readers should know that when the Israeli army expelled 100,000 Palestinians into south Lebanon in 1948 , the Palestinian refugees found themselves competing for resources with Lebanese Shiites .
While Shiite Islamists made common cause with the Palestinians , many traditional or secular Lebanese Shiites came to dislike them .
They even garlanded Israeli soldiers who invaded Lebanon in 1982 to destroy the Palestine Liberation Organization , whose local leaders or za’ims had often assassinated or displaced Shiite notables in the south ) .
Ajami ’s hatred of the Palestinians has a local history , which he has not transcended , and he apparently still keeps garlands to give out to the enemy of his enemy .
Ajami makes a pitiful plea for Obama and the US to go back to imagining that Osama Bin Laden is ten feet tall and that we are still plunged into a fateful confrontation with a new Soviet Union - type threat .
In fact , al - Qaeda was a small , clever terrorist organization that has been largely if not completely disrupted .
Further bankrupting the country by exaggerating its importance makes no sense to anyone who does n’t get millions of dollars in consulting fees as a “ terrorism expert . ”
This is not to say that al - Qaeda or other groups of that sort are not dangerous or should not be fought .
It is to say that they are not the end - all and be-all of American foreign policy , however much Ajami would like them to be .
Ajami keeps warning us against the return of the Clinton age , as though peace and prosperity were bad and we should be nostalgic for the cataclysmic Bush era .
Let the Middle East get to democracy as Brazil and the Czech Republic and Taiwan have .
We live in the age of the Third Wave of demoratization , not in 1945 .
We know the paths by which advances are made in our own time .
Ajami ’s ways are those of another , darker era , and his aspirations , of playing comprador or dragoman to a friendly enlightened emperor , belong to an imperial epoch that is long past .
Ajami and his fellow travelers have gone a large way toward destroying everything good about the United States .
If he wants to be a democratic revolutionary , let him emulate the real Tom Paine and go back to the Middle East and agitate for democracy there , instead of lolling about on the emoluments of the Hoover Institution in perilous Palo Alto .
Tom Paine did not actually have the Empire ’s armies marching alongside him , and neither should Ajami expect to .
Even less should he expect the rest of us to go on frittering away billions that we do not even have on his fantastic project of making fourth - world countries into advanced democracies at the point of a bayonet .
One of the most delightful things about January 20 is that it marked the end of a long Dark Age in which persons with Ajami ’s views had the ear of power in Washington .

A drug based on a chemical found in garlic can treat diabetes types I and II when taken as a tablet , a study in the new Royal Society of Chemistry journal Metallomics says .
When Hiromu Sakurai and colleagues from the Suzuka University of Medical Science , Japan , gave the drug orally to type I diabetic mice , they found it reduced blood glucose levels .
The drug is based on vanadium and allaxin , a compound found in garlic , and its action described in an Advance Article from Metallomics available free online from today .
The first issue of the new journal will be published in 2009 .
In previous work they had discovered the vanadium - allaxin compound treated both diabetes types when injected , but this new study shows the drug has promise as an oral treatment for the disease .
Type I diabetes ( insulin dependent ) is currently treated with daily injections of insulin , while type II ( non-insulin dependent ) is treated with drugs bearing undesirable side - effects – the authors note neither treatment is ideal .
The researchers aim to test the drug in humans in future work .

The second girl did wonderfully , learning hairdressing and marrying a terrific man .
But Srey Mom , it turned out , was addicted to methamphetamine and fled back to the brothel world to feed her craving .
Image Nicholas D. Kristof Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
I just returned again to Ms. Khorn ’s brothel to interview her , and found something remarkable .
It had gone broke and closed , like many of the brothels in Poipet .
One lesson is that the business model is more vulnerable than it looks .
There are ways we can make enslaving girls more risky and less profitable , so that traffickers give up in disgust .
For years , Ms. Khorn had been grumbling to me about the brothel  the low margins , the seven - day schedule , difficult customers , grasping policemen and scorn from the community .
There was also a personal toll , for her husband had sex with the girls , infuriating her , and the couple eventually divorced bitterly .
Ms. Khorn was also troubled that her youngest daughter , now 13 , was growing up surrounded by drunken , leering men .
Then in the last year , the brothel business became even more challenging amid rising pressure from aid groups , journalists and the United States State Department ’s trafficking office .
The office issued reports shaming Cambodian leaders and threatened sanctions if they did nothing .
Many of the brothels are owned by the police , which complicates matters , but eventually authorities in Cambodia were pressured enough that they ordered a partial crackdown .

Why is tuition so high in state universities that the NYT is wondering if families will go on being able to afford it ?
As someone who has observed this rise in tuition over an academic career of 30 years , as graduate student and professor , I have some theories from an insider perspective .
State universities have had to raise tuition because state legislatures have continually cut back every year the amount of state funding for them .
Already in 2005 this article in Philanthropy News Digest explained :
‘ For example , less than 14 percent of the University of Oregon ’s total revenue came from state funds in 2003 - 04 , compared to 32 percent in 1985 - 86 , while tuition fees accounted for more than 33 percent of the university ’s budget , compared to 22 percent twenty years ago .
Meanwhile , the University of Michigan has lost 12 percent of its state funding , or $ 43 million , over the past two years .
According to UM spokeswoman Julie Peterson , state money now only accounts for 8 percent of the university ’s budget .
“ We ca n’t rely on state funding alone , ” said Peterson .
“ It simply is n’t enough . ” ‘
That statistic , whereby the University of Oregon went from having 33 percent of its total revenue from state sources in 1985 to 14 percent in 2005 , was typical of what happened throughout the whole country .
The typical revenue streams for state universities used to be 1 ) State support , 2 ) tuition and fees , 3 ) Federal grants , and 4 ) alumni donations and the resulting endowment .
At some state universities , the state contribution may now be the fourth largest source .
Now , why did states cut back the universities so much ?
It was n’t that the state legislators were bad people or anti-intellectuals for the most part .
The Reagan / Grover Norquist line that government is not the solution , government is the problem , and the demand for lower taxes ( especially on the wealthy ) was influential in many states .
So essentially the American big business class of about 3 million people was given the opportunity to quadruple its vast wealth through lower taxes ( when you lower taxes on a particular segment of the public , that is wealth distribution in their favor ) .
Meanwhile public functions of government are cut back and everybody else gets potholes , closed public libraries , underfunded state universities , etc .
I can remember when I started grad school at UCLA in 1979 I heard on the radio that because of steep cutbacks in property taxes , the state would no longer be able to afford to spray for mosquitoes .
I thought to myself , lord , they ’ll end up giving themselves malaria to avoid a millage !
A big drain on state budgets is the penitentiary system .
In just the decade 1980 to 1990 , the prison and jail population in the US doubled .
Since 1980 , the prison population has quadrupled .
By the end of 2006 , over 2 million persons were in prison and another 5 million were on probation or on parole .
I remember reading in the Ann Arbor News in 1988 about a big debate at the statehouse in Lansing over funding for prisons versus funding for universities .
The prisons won .
In these same nearly four decades , there have been substantial declines in violent crimes and crimes against property in the US .
The vastly increased prison population was produced by unreasonably long prison sentences for non-violent crime , by ridiculous 3 - strikes - and - you - are - out life sentences and by the completely failed ‘ war on drugs ’ and by mandatory sentencing guidelines imposed by legislatures on judges in drug cases .
Half of prisoners in state prisons did not commit a violent crime , and 20 % are drug offenders .
This vast expansion in the number of imprisoned Americans required states to build prisons and to pay large amounts of money to keep people in them .
The states had to put their money into prosecuting , trying , imprisoning and then supporting to the tune of like $ 20,000 a year a bunch of . . . potheads .
So obviously the states had no money to spend on state universities , which were cut loose , and had to raise tuition and hit their alumni up for contributions just to try to keep their heads above water .
Of course , universities faced increased costs at the same time .
European monopolies drove up the costs of medical journals in ways that the European Union should look into .
Digitalization has been a huge added cost that cannot be escaped ( in many cases it means paying twice for books and other materials , once in hard copy and once in digital form . )
Universities with medical schools face the high costs of acquiring increasingly high tech , state of the art medical equipment .
Etc .
But I think the ‘ war on drugs ’ and the cost of prisons has deeply harmed state economies and has hurt access to state universities for working and middle class families .
Marijuana in particular may well have important medicinal properties , and it should just be legalized .
This is a conclusion a lot of frustrated law enforcement officials have come to , and they are campaigning for an end to prohibition .
Reuters has more .
It is true that some proportion of the population may face addiction problems from marijuana .
But it is not as if it is n’t already a multi-billion dollar business and widely available .
About 15 percent of Americans regularly use it .
And about 1/5 of the population is susceptible to alcohol addiction , but that does n’t impel us to a second Prohibition in its regard .
Use some of the tax receipts on the industry to fund treatment of those who ca n’t handle it .
A lot of the deleterious effects of being high come from people driving under the influence .
But actually you could just mandate that the auto industry put in ignition switches that only a sober person has the reflexes to make work .
Since we are likely to own the auto industry soon , we should be able to do what we want .
And besides , green mass transit is much better than individuals driving around wreaking mayhem , and a pothead on a subway is n’t much of a threat to anyone .
We should move in that direction for all sorts of reasons .
I can remember reading an op-ed in the NYT years ago arguing that there are 60 million crimes a year in the United States , but only a tiny fraction of the perpetrators is ever actually prosecuted and a smaller fraction still brought to trial .
I thought to myself , and a good thing too !
How would we pay for 60 million prisoners ?
And , if you have a country of 280 million people committing 60 million crimes a year , you clearly just have way too many laws .
The baneful impact on the United States of Puritanism , which comes in part from the Religious Right , has diverted our energies from educating ourselves , and developing our society , toward instead creating a Nanny State that employs people to make sure you only get high from alcohol , not from other substances .
Bush even created an FBI porn squad .
As if wealthy Republican hoteliers were n’t the primary distributors of porn ( via pay per view channels ) in the country .
If the Religious Right could , it would just close down all the biology classes in the country ( because after all they teach that wicked Darwin ) and leave the development of biotech to the South Koreans , with Americans–denied the wealth that biotechnological innovation will bring in–turned into unemployed riffraff .
It turns out that if we had more personal freedoms , we ’d have more state monies and could educate ourselves to develop our potential as free human beings .
In the past 40 years , the snowball has been going in the other direction– fewer personal freedoms , a vast gulag of the incarcerated , and less and less state money for the development of the minds of the public .
We ’ve built ourselves a big ignorant prison , with a loud - mouthed fundamentalist preacher for a warden , and called it America .
We should legalize pot , and tax the resulting industry .
We should repeal mandatory sentencing guidelines and develop rehabilitation strategies rather than putting the ill - behaved in expensive state hotels .
And we should go back to having state - funded state universities .
A war with Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein would be the first test case in the Bush administration 's larger strategy for projecting U.S. power and influence in the post - Cold War world .
Here 's an overview of the people , the events , the major statements , and the policy battles behind what 's become known as the Bush Doctrine .
The Gulf War's Ragged Ending ; U.S. Decides on Containment Policy for Iraq General Norman Schwarzkopf ( l ) and Paul Wolfowitz ( r ) With a Gulf War cease fire declared , President Bush , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell believe Saddam 's hold on Iraq is tenuous .
Bush urges Iraqis to rise up .
They do , and within days Saddam has lost control of southern Iraq .
But the rebellion is soon overwhelmed by Saddam 's forces , which include helicopter gunships , and Bush orders U.S. troops not to intervene .
It is estimated that thousands of Shiites were killed .
The failed uprising is a defining moment for neo-conservatives such as Richard Perle , William Kristol , and Paul Wolfowitz .
Wolfowitz complains that the U.S. inaction is comparable to " idly watching a mugging . "
With Saddam clinging to power , Bush decides on a containment strategy towards Iraq : tough U.N. inspections , economic sanctions , and no-fly zones to protect the Kurds in the north and south of the country .
First Hints of a Preemption Strategy Paul Wolfowitz , under secretary of defense for policy ( the Pentagon 's third - highest ranking civilian ) , takes the lead in drafting an internal set of military guidelines , called a " Defense Planning Guidance , " which is routinely prepared every few years by the Defense Department .
Wolfowitz 's draft argues for a new military and political strategy in a post - Cold War world .
Containment , it says , is a relic of the Cold War .
America should talk loudly , carry a big stick , and use its military power to preempt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
And if America has to act alone , so be it .
( Read excerpts from the Wolfowitz draft . )
Controversy erupts after the draft is leaked to the press .
The White House orders Defense Secretary Cheney to rewrite it .
In the new draft there is no mention of preemption or U.S. willingness to act alone .
Bill Clinton Becomes President ; Iraq Containment Policy Continues During the Clinton administration , Saddam repeatedly pushes the envelope on U.N. inspections and sanctions .
For a detailed chronology of Saddam Hussein 's battles with U.N. weapons inspectors , see FRONTLINE 's 1999 report " Spying on Saddam . "
In 1995 , Saddam 's son - in - law , who is head of Iraq 's WMD program , defects and tells inspectors about Iraq 's arsenal .
Armed with the new information , the U.N. inspectors raid Iraq 's main biological weapons plant and destroy the equipment and growth medium .
But most of the chemical and biological weapons the inspectors believe to have been manufactured is never found .
Hawks Send Open Letter to Clinton Letter to Clinton
A group of neo-conservatives , who have formed The Project for a New American Century , argue for a much stronger U.S. global leadership exercised through " military strength and moral clarity . "
In an open letter to Clinton , the group warns that the policy of containing Iraq is " dangerously inadequate . "
They write :
The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction .
In the near term , this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing .
In the long term , it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power .
That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy .
The letter 's signatories include Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle , William Kristol , and other current members of George W. Bush 's administration , including Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Under Secretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton .
Saddam Blocks Weapons Inspectors
In early August , Saddam suspends cooperation with weapons inspectors and on Oct. 31 shuts down all inspections .
The inspectors say they have evidence that Saddam had created thousands of tons of chemical and biological agents and that he is working on a nuclear device .
In November , Clinton -- in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- orders a bombing campaign against Iraq , but calls it off at the last minute when U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan works out a deal in which Iraq promises to unconditionally cooperate with U.N. inspectors .
Within days of the inspectors ' return , however , Iraq returns to intimidation and withholding information .
Operation Desert Fox U.S. and British military forces launch a four - day air and cruise missile campaign against approximately 100 key Iraqi military targets to punish Saddam for defying U.N. weapons inspections .
On Dec. 16 , the day the bombing begins , the U.N. withdraws all weapons inspectors .
[ Inspections will not resume in Iraq until November 2002 , following passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 . ]
George W. Bush Considers Presidential Run The Texas Governor 's Mansion Bush sets up an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign and foreign policy experts descend on Austin , Texas , to help prepare him for a White House run .
His tutors include both neo-conservative hawks , such as Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld , and pragmatic realists , including Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice .
During the campaign , neither side will really know where it stands with the candidate .
The Second Bush Presidency Begins Both hawks and realists present Bush with candidates for foreign policy posts in the new administration .
The hawks end up with three important jobs : Lewis " Scooter " Libby becomes Cheney 's chief of staff , Donald Rumsfeld becomes secretary of defense , and Paul Wolfowitz becomes deputy secretary of defense .
But Colin Powell 's nomination as secretary of state is viewed as a formidable counterweight to the Pentagon hawks .
The two groups express varying views on how to deal with Saddam Hussein .
The hawks develop a military option and push for increased aid to the Iraqi opposition .
Colin Powell advocates " smart sanctions " that would allow more humanitarian goods into Iraq , while tightening controls on items that could have military applications .
Terrorists Attack World Trade Center and Pentagon
In his address to the nation on the evening of Sept. 11 , Bush decides to include a tough new passage about punishing those who harbor terrorists .
He announces that the U.S. will " make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them . "
To many observers , the president 's words set the tone and direction for the Bush administration 's policy on Afghanistan and Iraq .
Wolfowitz v. Powell Wolfowitz speaking at a Pentagon briefing
Two days later , Wolfowitz expands on the president 's words at a Pentagon briefing .
He seems to signal that the U.S. will enlarge its campaign against terror to include Iraq : " I think one has to say it 's not just simply a matter of capturing people and holding them accountable , but removing the sanctuaries , removing the support systems , ending states who sponsor terrorism .
And that 's why it has to be a broad and sustained campaign . "
Colin Powell and others are alarmed by what they view as Wolfowitz 's inflammatory words about " ending states . "
Powell later responds during a press briefing : " We 're after ending terrorism .
And if there are states and regimes , nations that support terrorism , we hope to persuade them that it is in their interest to stop doing that .
But I think ending terrorism is where I would like to leave it , and let Mr. Wolfowitz speak for himself . "
Camp David Meeting : Iraq Debated Four days after the Sept. 11 attacks , Bush gathers his national security team at Camp David for a war council .
Wolfowitz argues that now is the perfect time to move against state sponsors of terrorism , including Iraq .
But Powell tells the president that an international coalition would only come together for an attack on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan , not an invasion of Iraq .
The war council votes with Powell .
Rumsfeld abstains .
The president ultimately decides that the war 's first phase will be Afghanistan .
The question of Iraq will be reconsidered later .
Speech to Joint Session of Congress President George W. Bush addressing a Joint Session of Congress ( photo : Eric Draper / White House )
Bush 's address to Congress builds on his speech on the night of Sept. 11 : " We will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism .
Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make .
Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists .
From this day forward , any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . "
Bush 's speech also outlines a vision for a strong American leadership in the world , a leadership that would project America 's power and influence : " Freedom and fear are at war .
The advance of human freedom -- the great achievement of our time , and the great hope of every time -- now depends on us .
Our nation -- this generation -- will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future .
We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts , by our courage .
We will not tire , we will not falter , and we will not fail . "
State of the Union Speech Signals Possible Action in Iraq Bush 's State of the Union address introduces the idea of an " axis of evil " that includes Iraq , Iran , and North Korea , and signals the U.S. will act preemptively to deal with such nations .
" North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
...
" Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror ....
" Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror .
... " States like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
" We 'll be deliberate , yet time is not on our side .
I will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
I will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer .
The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons . "
Bush Calls for a Policy of Preemption
In a graduation speech at West Point , Bush cites the realities of a new post - Cold War era and outlines a major shift in national security strategy -- from containment to preemption .
" Our security will require all Americans to be forward - looking and resolute , to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives . "
The president also calls for an American hegemony : " America has , and intends to keep , military strengths beyond challenge . "
Both strategic aims -- preemption and hegemony -- echo the recommendations Paul Wolfowitz made back in 1992 in his controversial Defense Planning Guidance draft .
Within Administration , Open Debate on Iraq
The chambers of the U.N. Security Council Powell reports trouble getting U.S. allies on board for a war with Iraq and wants to consult the U.N .
At a private dinner with Bush on Aug.
5 , Powell warns the president that the U.S. should not act unilaterally and must fully consider the economic and political consequences of war -- particularly in the Middle East .
Powell 's view is championed by Brent Scowcroft , former National Security Adviser in the Bush I administration , who publishes an op -ed in The Wall Street Journal on Aug. 15 in which he argues that Bush is moving too quickly on Iraq , and advocates pressing for the return of U.N. inspectors .
Soon after , Vice President Cheney emerges as the administration voice advocating action against Iraq .
In a Nashville speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , Cheney warns that " a return of inspectors would provide no assurance whatsoever of [ Saddam 's ] compliance with U.N. resolutions . "
Cheney also outlines a larger , long - term strategy whereby regime change in Iraq could transform the Middle East : " Regime change in Iraq would bring about a number of benefits to the region .
When the gravest of threats are eliminated , the freedom - loving peoples of the region will have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting peace .
As for the reaction of the Arab ' street , ' the Middle East expert Professor Fouad Ajami predicts that after liberation , the streets in Basra and Baghdad are ' sure to erupt in joy in the same way the throngs in Kabul greeted the Americans . '
Extremists in the region would have to rethink their strategy of Jihad .
Moderates throughout the region would take heart .
And our ability to advance the Israeli - Palestinian peace process would be enhanced , just as it was following the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 . "
As Bush leaves for an August vacation in Crawford , Texas , he agrees to take his case to the U.N. and asks his advisers to start preparing the speech .
Bush U.N. Address on Iraq
In the United Nations speech , Bush seems to be siding with Powell in calling for a new U.N. resolution on Iraq .
But the president also warns :
" The purposes of the United States should not be doubted .
The Security Council resolutions will be enforced -- the just demands of peace and security will be met -- or action will be unavoidable .
And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power . "
U.S. National Security Strategy Released
Twenty months into his presidency , George W. Bush releases his administration 's National Security Strategy ( NSS ) .
It is the first time the various elements of the Bush Doctrine have been formally articulated in one place .
The 33 - page document presents a bold and comprehensive reformulation of U.S. foreign policy .
It outlines a new and muscular American posture in the world -- a posture that will rely on preemption to deal with rogue states and terrorists harboring weapons of mass destruction .
It states that America will exploit its military and economic power to encourage " free and open societies . "
It states for the first time that the U.S. will never allow its military supremacy to be challenged as it was during the Cold War .
And the NSS insists that when America 's vital interests are at stake , it will act alone , if necessary .
Policy analysts note that there are many elements in the 2002 NSS document which bear a strong resemblance to recommendations presented in Paul Wolfowitz 's controversial Defense Planning Guidance draft written in 1992 under the first Bush administration .

( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama formally announced Sunday that retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki , a decorated veteran and popular figure among critics of the Bush administration , is his pick to be secretary of Veterans Affairs .
Retired Gen. Eric Shinseki Sunday promised to work for veterans " each and every day . "
" There is no one more distinguished , more determined , or more qualified to build this VA than the leader I am announcing as our next secretary of Veterans Affairs -- Gen. Eric Shinseki , " Obama said at a press conference .
" No one will ever doubt that this former Army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans .
No one will ever question whether he will fight hard enough to make sure they have the support they need , " Obama added .
Obama said the nation must focus on helping troops who have served their country especially during bad economic times .
" We do n't just need to better serve veterans of today 's wars .
We also need to build a 21st century VA that will better serve all who have answered our nation 's call , " Obama said .
Watch Obama talk about Shinseki »
Obama said Shinseki , who served two combat tours in Vietnam and lost part of his foot , " understands the changing needs of our troops and their families .
And he will be a VA secretary who finally modernizes our VA to meet the challenges of our time . "
Shinseki , who spoke after Obama , made a vow to his fellow veterans .
If confirmed , he said , he will " work each and every day " to ensure the nation is serving them " as well as you have served us . "
The official announcement took place in Chicago , Illinois , on Sunday , the anniversary of Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 .
In an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's " Meet the Press , " Obama called Shinseki " exactly the right person " for the post .
Host Tom Brokaw said Shinseki lost his job in the Bush administration " because he said that we would need more troops in Iraq than the secretary of defense , Don Rumsfeld , thought that we would need at that time . "
" He was right , " Obama replied .
Veterans groups appeared to support the selection .
" I am excited .
I do n't know him personally but this is a huge move , " said Paul Rieckhoff , executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
For years , Shinseki , a highly decorated Vietnam veteran , has been cited as an example by Pentagon critics who say the former Army chief 's sage advice was ignored in 2003 , resulting in too few U.S. troops being sent to Iraq after the invasion .
Shinseki testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2003 that " something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers would be required " to pacify the country .
The comment infuriated some Bush administration officials , and he retired just a few months later .
Shinseki has never spoken publicly about his testimony , which has often been cited by critics as evidence that Rumsfeld ignored the advice of one of his key generals .
But as Army chief of staff , Shinseki was not in the chain of command , and played no direct role in drawing up the war plans .
Pentagon sources say that , in fact , Shinseki never advocated higher troop levels for Iraq , in part because it was not his job to do so .
And sources say that just before the invasion , when asked by then - Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers if he agreed with the war plans , Shinseki voiced no objections .
Still , Rieckhoff said , " Shinseki is a guy who had a career putting patriotism above politics .
He is a wounded veteran so he understands the plight of veterans . "

What do you think of Obama 's cabinet picks so far ?
He said Shinseki would have to make key connections with the veterans community , adding , " This is a big name and it shows that he [ Obama ] is not going to treat the Veterans Affairs secretary as a low priority . "
John Rowan , president of Vietnam Veterans of America , called the reported pick an " interesting choice . "
" I am satisfied with it , " Rowan told CNN on Saturday , adding that the choice seems to be in the Obama transition team 's pattern of " bringing in strong personalities into all the positions who are n't going to ' yes ' him to death . "
" When Shinseki had his disagreements with the administration , he was n't afraid to speak up , " Rowan said .
Veterans for Common Sense also weighed in , issuing a statement " strongly " supporting Shinseki .
" In February 2003 , Gen . Shinseki honestly and correctly assessed our nation 's military needs before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , " the statement said .
" This same level of candor and honesty will serve President - elect Obama well so he can quickly and accurately identify VA 's many challenges and then implement responsible solutions that take into consideration our veterans ' needs and concerns . "

Tough times on the morality business front too , it seems .
Published reports in Colorado say that Focus on the Family , the conservative evangelical group founded and headed by Dr. James Dobson , is laying off about 200 of its employees .
It 's the second time in recent months the influential group that does so much mailing it has its own ZIP code has released workers from its mountainside headquarters in Colorado Springs .
The latest cuts leave the national organization with about 950 employees from a onetime high of some 1,500 .
The cutbacks come after Focus , formerly headquartered in California until 1991 , spent a reported half - million dollars to successfully support Proposition 8 in the Golden State , overturning a state court decision to allow same - sex marriages .
The support of Dobson , who speaks to millions in his daily broadcasts on some 3,000 domestic outlets and hundreds more abroad from the organization 's in - house studio , is eagerly sought by conservative politicians .
After opposing John McCain in 2007 for restrictions on nonprofit political activities in his McCain - Feingold campaign finance reform law and Rudy Giuliani for his abortion support , Dobson endorsed ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee late in the Republican primary season this year .
But faced with the choice of McCain or Democrat Barack Obama , Dobson eventually said he would personally support the Arizona senator because the Illinois senator posed such a threat to family values .
Since Obama 's victory , Dobson has worried online about the direction of the country .
Apparently , that support was insufficient as polling showed millions of religious regulars chose not to vote on Nov. 4 .

Francis Ysidro Edgeworth , the grandfather of modern economic theory , referred to individual self - interest as “ the first principle of pure economics . ”
Until recently , economists routinely equated being rational with being selfish .
The assumption was that , because humans are biological creatures , we ’d been programmed by Darwinian evolution to put our own interests first — survival , after all , is a tough competition .
As a result , even seemingly altruistic traits , such as giving money to charity or helping strangers in need , were seen as traits ultimately rooted in self - interest .
Richard Dawkins , for instance , has claimed that “ we are survival machines — robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes .
This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior . ”
Although Dawkins allows for morality in social life , it must be socially imposed on a fundamentally selfish agent .
“ Let us try to teach generosity and altruism , ” he advises , “ because we are born selfish . ”
Such learned behaviors — for instance , children are taught to share at a young age — must struggle against our supposedly self - serving nature .
As the evolutionary biologist Michael Ghiselin asserts , “ What passes for cooperation [ in nature ] turns out to be a mixture of opportunism and exploitation .
. .
Scratch an altruist , and watch a hypocrite bleed . ”
Programmed to Care ?
In recent years the tide has swung dramatically against such a bleak view of human nature , however .
Researchers are increasingly coming to understand that people are also “ programmed ” to care about others .
A recent contribution to this theme comes from neuroscientist Ernst Fehr at the University of Zurich and colleagues .
In a study , the researchers explored a particular type of unselfishness known as inequality aversion .
Suppose individual A has $ 10 , and individual B has a lesser amount , say $ 5 .
We say individual A is inequality averse if he shares some of his cash with individual B , thus reducing the inequality between them .
We say individual B is inequality averse if he is willing to sacrifice some part of his money , provided individual A ’s endowment is reduced to an even greater degree , so that , once again , the inequality between the two is reduced .
Fehr and colleagues show that , in a sample of 229 children between the ages of three and eight years , younger subjects overwhelmingly conform to selfish ( self - regarding ) preferences .
They do n’t like to share and are n’t interest in reducing inequality .
In contrast , the vast majority of the older subjects are inequality averse when put in either the advantageous ( individual A ) or inadvantageous ( individual B ) position .
Moreover , the researchers find that the older children are “ rational ” in the sense that they are more willing to share when the cost of doing so is low than when the cost is high .
Finally , the children tend to be more inequality averse in dealing with “ ingroup ” members , or children from their own school or day care .
This preference for sharing with ingroup members occurred even the sharing game was purely anonymous , so no child could determine the identity of the other players .
This experiment is not the first to indicate that children are inequality averse , and that this behavior increases with age .
I recall a beautiful video made by the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt , which showed two three - year - olds sitting side by side while their teacher sat in front of them , giving out highly valued gold star stickers .
For every gold star she handed to one child on the right , she handed two stars to the child on the left .
Both children were very happy with their prizes , smiling gleefully with each new addition .
When the same scenario was presented to two four - year - olds , however , the situation was completely different .
In this case , the child that only received one sticker became less and less happy over time , and eventually began throwing the gold stars back at the teacher .
Haidt also reports the following experiment he performed on his two sons .
Every morning he gave each a glass of orange juice .
On Monday , both glasses were full , on Tuesday , three quarters full , Wednesday half full , Thursday one quarter full , Friday half full , Saturday three quarters full , Sunday , full .
He repeated this orange juice sequence for a while , and the sons were very contented each day .
Then , one day , he gave one child a full glass , and the other a glass three quarters full .
As you might imagine , the “ deprived ” child bitterly protested his deplorable situation .
The primatologists Frans B. M. de Waal and Sarah Brosnan report a similar reaction of adult chimpanzees , where one receives a banana ( highly valued ) and the other receives a cucumber slice ( valued , but much less so than a banana ) .
In both cases , inequality aversion takes the form of sacrificing one ’s own reward , regardless of whether it ’s cucumber slices or gold stars , to show displeasure with the source of inequality .
Strategic Behaviors
Although it ’s now generally recognized that children are inequality averse , one experimental difficulty has been separating out strategic behavior , such as reputation building , from true preferences for sharing .
In other words , I may share with you because in the future , you may reciprocate , or I may punish you at personal cost because the next time , you will be more careful to give me my “ fair share . ”
These are purely strategic behaviors that can be attributed to perfectly selfish individuals .
The Fehr study differs from prior studies of inequality aversion in children by scrupulously preventing such an interpretation .
They made all behaviors anonymous so children could never identify their partners , and therefore could not sacrifice in hopes of gaining in the future .
This strategy contrasts with previous studies , which either watched children at play or analyzed teacher - pupil interactions .
Although these studies found consistent pro-social behavior — the children demonstrated a willingness to share — they could not ascertain whether it was calculated selfishness or true other - regarding behavior .
It is instructive to compare and contrast human behavior regarding others with that of our nearest biological relative , the chimpanzee .
My assessment of the literature is that female chimps , at least , reveal a high level of kin altruism ( fathers exhibit virtually none ) . ”
Chimps of both sexes also demonstrate a fair amount of reciprocal altruism , as in mutual grooming and coalition formation , and show considerable concern for the plight of other chimps .
On the other hand , chimpanzees show virtually no real inequality aversion , in the sense that they do not share with non -kin except as a means of not being pestered by beggars , and do not sacrifice to reduce their personal disadvantage .
In this sense , inequality aversion seems to be a rather human innovation .

THE baby is just one day old and has not yet left hospital .
She is quiet but alert .
Twenty centimetres from her face researchers have placed a white card with two black spots on it .
She stares at it intently .
A researcher removes the card and replaces it by another , this time with the spots differently spaced .
As the cards alternate , her gaze starts to wander — until a third , with three black spots , is presented .
Her gaze returns : she looks at it for twice as long as she did at the previous card .
Can she tell that the number two is different from three , just 24 hours after coming into the world ?
Or do newborns simply prefer more to fewer ?
The same experiment , but with three spots preceding two , shows the same revival of interest when the number of spots changes .
Perhaps it is just the newness ?
When slightly older babies were shown cards with pictures of household objects instead of dots ( a comb , a key , an orange and so on ) , changing the number of items had an effect separate from changing the items themselves .
Could it be the pattern that two things make , as opposed to three ?
No again .
Babies paid more attention to rectangles moving randomly on a screen when their number changed from two to three , or vice versa .
The effect even crosses between senses .
Babies who were repeatedly shown two spots perked up more when they then heard three drumbeats than when they heard just two ; likewise when the researchers started with drumbeats and moved to spots .
“ One great blooming , buzzing confusion ” was how William James , a 19th - century psychologist , described the way he thought the world looked to a newborn baby .
But these experiments , and many others like them over the past few decades , have convinced researchers that , on the contrary , babies are born with many ways of making sense of what they see and hear .
The trick is to use their love of novelty to work out what is happening inside their brains : when shown the same things repeatedly , babies ' eyes wander ; when the scene changes , their gaze returns .
That makes visible what to them constitutes a change in the world around them worthy of notice .
Dot and carry one
One of those ways of understanding the world is by number .
People are born with an innate sense of how many items there are in small collections .
Experiments in which older children and adults are shown randomly arranged dots and asked to say quickly how many there are show this sense is retained throughout life .
Up to three or four items , and the number is immediately visible without counting .
Within a limited range , humans are born arithmeticians , too .
When babies a few months old were shown dolls placed and removed from behind a screen they had correct expectations of the number of dolls they would see when the curtain was drawn aside , and were surprised when trickery meant those expectations were violated .
In fact , they were more surprised to see the wrong number of dolls than the right number , but different - looking ones .
Some animals also seem able to perceive and understand small numbers .
From the 1930s Otto Köhler , a German zoologist , trained ravens to open boxes with the same number of dots on the lid as a card held by a researcher .
One raven learnt to distinguish two , three , four , five and six dots .
Rats can learn to ignore a certain number of doors in a maze before choosing which one to enter .
Chimpanzees have been taught to match the numerals 1 to 6 to the number of objects in a display and to find oranges hidden in two different places and point to the numeral that indicates their total number .
Even more strikingly , some wild animals appear to understand and use numerical facts without training .
Karen McComb of the University of Sussex , in England , played a variety of recordings of lions roaring at night in the Serengeti National Park — different numbers of lions ; their roars in sequence and overlapping ; and so on .
She wanted to test the theory that , since fights between lions are very costly , when lions heard large numbers of intruders ' roars they would withdraw unless they were in superior numbers .
The best explanation of what she observed was that lions estimated the number of intruders from the number of different - sounding roars , compared that number to the number in their own group and then decided whether to attack or slink away .
That humans ( and perhaps other animals ) come ready - supplied with numbers contradicts two popular rival theories : the Platonic and the constructivist .
Plato thought numbers ( and geometric objects such as circles ) existed in some abstract , eternal and perfect realm , of which mortals were granted only an occasional glimpse .
Constructivists follow Jean Piaget , a Swiss child psychologist , in thinking that by moving things in the real world around and observing the results people “ construct ” an understanding of number in the first few years of their lives .
The distinction , though abstract , has practical relevance too .
Could “ maths - phobes ” be born , rather than made ?
Can they be cured ?
And could mathematics be taught better to all ?
Numbers on the brain
Brian Butterworth , a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London , has spent much of his career teasing out which bits of humans ' understanding of numbers are innate — and which learnt , and how .
He thinks people are born with brain circuits that are dedicated to recognising and understanding the number of items in small collections .
On this foundation an entire “ number sense ” is built , as children realise that bigger and bigger numbers can be reached by adding “ one more ” and learn by experience how these bigger numbers behave .
His most recent work has confirmed that to develop a better understanding of numbers than that of a newborn baby , it is not necessary to be able to count with words .
He collaborated with some Australian researchers to test aboriginal children in the country 's Northern Territory who were monolingual speakers of one of two languages , Warlpiri and Anindilyakwa , in which the only number words are one , two , few and many .
( Words for numbers have generally arisen when and where people grow crops or keep herds ; hunter - gatherer bands , who have no herds or other stores of wealth , need not keep track of surpluses , or balances of trade . )
Since the children were too old for the baby - staring trick , but unable to answer the question : “ How many ? ” , researchers laid out counters , then put them away and asked the children to “ do as I did ” .
To check that they were using the number of the counters , rather than mimicking their pattern , the researchers banged sticks together and asked them to “ make the counters like the noises ” .
The children performed about as well as English - speaking aboriginal children living in Melbourne .
Historically , one common method of counting has been to use body parts to keep track of a running total .
The base - ten system used in modern arithmetic originates with the fingers , and linguistic traces of that fact remain in the similarity of “ five ” , “ finger ” and “ fist ” , and the dual meaning of “ digit ” .
Some think that the original inhabitants of Europe were 20 - counters who used fingers and toes — the use of “ score ” for both 20 and keeping count may be a remnant .
And there remain tribal peoples who have elaborate methods using eyes , nostrils , elbows and so on .

Arithmetically , bases 12 , 24 and 60 have their appeal ( they have more factors than ten 's measly two ) .
All three are still employed when telling the time , and 4,000 years ago the Babylonians used base 60 to do some pretty advanced mathematics .
But fingers are particularly obvious and useful for keeping count .
In another recent piece of work , Dr Butterworth and Robert Reeve of the University of Melbourne watched ( English - speaking ) five - and six - year - olds counting and doing simple sums .
Most used their fingers , but around a quarter did not .
Slightly more than half of the non-finger - counters were good arithmeticians , who presumably had outgrown needing to use their fingers .
The others , who were decidedly weak , did not seem to have realised that their fingers could help .
More than 80 years ago Josef Gerstmann , an Austrian neurologist , described a set of problems that seem to arise simultaneously in people who have suffered damage to the left parietal lobe of the brain : finding writing difficult or impossible , being unable to understand arithmetic or tell right from left , and having difficulty in identifying one 's fingers .
There is still no agreement on whether these symptoms constitute a syndrome , but the bits of the brain used for storing facts about numbers and for representing the fingers are close to each other .
Mental representations of numbers and of fingers may therefore be functionally connected .
In 2005 Dr Butterworth and his colleagues asked people to perform tasks that required dexterity , and others that involved matching pairs of numbers , while the area of their parietal lobes known as the left angular gyrus was stimulated by a magnetic field .
Dexterity and recall of facts involving numbers were both impaired .
So the connection between numbers and fingers may be more profound than the handiness of fingers for keeping count .
Easy for some
If numbers had been invented by some prehistoric genius , then learning how to use them would be a matter of intelligence and practice .
But what comes naturally to most is lacking in a few .
Just as some people are born colour - blind , or lose colour vision after a brain injury , others are “ number - blind ” : unable to comprehend what everyone else sees effortlessly .
That deficit may leave other abilities — including other mathematical abilities — unimpaired .
Dr Butterworth tells the story of Charles , a young man with lifelong mathematical difficulties .
He could add two one - digit numbers only if he used his fingers .
Sums involving two - digit numbers or multiplication or subtraction were beyond him .
When shopping , he understood neither prices nor change .
Tests showed he was not merely maths - phobic .
Not only was he far slower than the average , but the pattern of his results was strange .
In one test Charles was shown a pair of digits and asked to name the larger number .
The bigger the gap , the faster most people can do this : they say “ nine ” faster when shown 9 and 2 than when shown 9 and 7 .
But with Charles , the reverse was the case — and the researchers could see why .
Rather than telling the answer directly , he was counting on from one number ( on his fingers ) until he got to the other , which meant he must have started at the smaller , or he got to ten , in which case he must have started at the bigger .
Most strikingly , he lacked the fundamental numerical ability possessed by most newborns : being able to tell the number of objects in a small group simply by looking .
When asked how many dots were on a sheet of paper , he counted on his fingers — even when there were only two .
Charles 's deficit , though severe , seemed to affect his numerical abilities alone .
Numerical deficits in people of otherwise normal abilities can be even more striking in cases of brain damage .
Lisa Cipolotti , a neuropsychologist , studied a Signora Gaddi , who used to run a hotel and keep its accounts .
After a stroke she could find the number of things in a small group only by counting — when asked how many arms a crucifix had , she got Dr Cipolotti to hold out her arms so she could count them .
Signora Gaddi's problems seemed to affect only numbers .
She could still read , speak and reason , remember historical and geographical facts , and order objects by their physical size .
In fact , Signora Gaddi 's difficulties went even deeper than Charles's .
The stroke which damaged her innate understanding of small numbers also robbed her of the entire numerical edifice built on that foundation .
For her , numbers stopped at four .
When asked to count up from one , she got to four and no further .
If there were more than four dots on a page she could not count them .
She could not say how old she was or how many days were in a week , or even tell the time .
“ I hated maths at school ”
From Barbie dolls programmed to say “ math class is tough ” to ministers of state who will parse and analyse a sentence but refuse to answer “ what 's half of three - quarters ? ” , maths - phobia is everywhere .
One reason is that mathematics builds on itself , so that one missed step can lead to a lifetime of failure .
Nor does it help that sums have unambiguously right and wrong answers , making it all too clear to schoolmates just what a child does and does n't know .
But amidst the stragglers are those whose problem runs deeper than fear and loathing : the “ dyscalculic ” , as researchers have taken to calling those whose number sense is impaired .
Numerical tests given to a representative sample of children in Havana suggest their proportion in the general population is 3 - 6 % .
Sceptics may feel this is a learning disability too far — another chance for middle - class parents to classify little Johnny as different , rather than thick .
And perhaps dyscalculia will collect a penumbra of dubious cases around it , as dyslexia has .
But perhaps not .
Dyslexia manifests itself as a difficulty with a highly unnatural activity : reading .
The best single predictor of dyscalculia , by contrast , is abnormal slowness in counting a few dots on a page , a task that most find trivially easy .
The researchers at University College have created a dyscalculia screener , which they think should be used to test all children early in life .
With luck , diagnosis will progress to treatment : they are working on a remedial programme too .
But even if dyscalculics never fully develop the sense of numbers they were born without , their mathematical careers need not be over before they have started .
There are entire fields of mathematics where numerical manipulation is peripheral : logic and geometry , for example .
Dr Butterworth recalls an eminent geometrician ( “ I wo n't say his name ; it would embarrass him ” ) who approached him after he had given a talk on his research .
“ He said : ‘ You know , I have always been dreadful at arithmetic . '
So I asked : ‘ What 's seven eights ? '
He just mumbled : ‘ Oh , that 's trivial , there 's an algorithm for that , ' and walked away . ”
When Google released their AJAX Language API last March , I had high hopes that a lot of cool new applications would be created that might allow me to experience parts of the web that were previously incomprehensible .
There is potential for a number of applications that go far beyond simple localization .
“ I ’m not sure how fast the API is , but how about on - the - fly translation for instant messaging ?
Certainly Google ’s machine translation is far from perfect , but imagine being able to have a conversation with someone in two languages where you ’re only exposed to your native tongue , ” I wrote at ReadWriteWeb .
Web developer Dave Trainer , who left a comment on my post about the Language API last March , has now released a really cool Greasemonkey script that adds ( almost ) instant translation to Firefox .
Once you install the script , called GMtranslator and which you can download via Trainer ’s blog , any site on the script ’s white list displays a small translation controls box in the lower right hand corner of the screen .
The script can translate between English , Portuguese , Spanish , German , French , Italian , and Swiss .
You simply click on the language you want to translate to , and then click on the text you want translated .
You do n’t have to tell the script which language you ’re translating from —
Google ’s API can generally figure it out from context — and the text selection is done via JavaScript using the jQuery framework .
The script does have a few downsides .
First , it ’s not really instant .
There is some lag while it pings the Google AJAX Language API and waits for a response , which means that my dream of instant , seamless translated chat is still not quite possible ( but certainly plausible ) .
Second , you can only select text to translate in blocks , rather than the whole page at once , which is sort of clunky .
It would be great if you could set the script to automatically translate pages into the preferred language without having to manually select the text to be translated at all .
The translations themselves are only as good as Google ’s machine translation , which means that they ’re serviceable , but far from perfect .
No professional translators are going to be put out of business .
Still , GMtranslator for Greasemonkey is going onto my list of must - have Firefox add - ons and will definitely come in handy translating news on blogs from other countries .
Update : Google announced today that it has added a similar feature to Google Reader .
The “ Translate into my language ” option will automatically translate blog posts into your native language .
The feature is a 20 % project and is presumably based on the same API that Trainer ’s Greasemonkey script uses .
Very cool .

Not satisfied with forcing a cancellation of the main TV broadcast of WWII parody anime Axis Powers Hetalia in Japan , or rather , perhaps emboldened by the ease with which the station was overcome , Koreans have redoubled their efforts and are taking action to see the rest of the online broadcasts , DVD sales , and presumably manga , cancelled .
A new petition ( below ) has already gathered 5,000 signatures , and extremists are advocating attacking Japanese websites connected with the anime to force a cessation of its distribution .
The previous petition with more signatures led in part to the cancellation of the TV broadcast …

Talk on the Korean major board relating to the issue falls into two major camps , with many advocating pressuring the Korean Foreign Ministry to demand Japan stop its “ criminal ” and “ discriminatory ” broadcasting .
Even more ominously , another group advocates directly attacking Japanese websites in acts of “ cyber- terrorism ” .
Such action would not be unprecedented ; only recently a sustained DoS attack emanating from Korea attempted rather optimistically to take down 2 ch , but failed miserably in the face of those ironclad servers .
As usual , it is not clear whether such statements are overheated froth or a genuine threat , but they certainly illustrate the strength of sentiment amongst the ever maddened Korean nationalists .
A Japanese fan response has seen some interest in establishing their own online petition , asking that broadcast be resumed with any offending portions cut , pointing out correctly no other countries voiced offence at their unflattering portrayals , but it looks unlikely to have any effect .
Probably the most effective response , and the one preferred by the apparently non-confrontational Japanese fanbase , is buying the DVDs and manga ; the manga appears to be enjoying a healthy response thanks to all the publicity .
Via Etnews ( Korean ) , you can see the article translated into Japanese here ( along with the 2ch response ) .
The issue should not be underestimated ; it has already reached the Korean National Assembly at least once :

PASSAU , Germany , Dec. 5 , 2008  --
State prosecutors have indicted 43 - year - old Swiss national Helg Sgarbi for allegedly blackmailing BMW heiress Susanne Klatten , Germany 's richest woman .
In August 2007 , Klatten , 46 , a married mother of three teenagers , fell for Sgarbi , whom she had met at the famous spa retreat Lanserhof , a hangout for the rich and famous in Tirol , Austria , Munich 's daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported today .
Little did she know that her lover reportedly had an Italian accomplice named Ernano Barretta , 63 , who was secretly filming their meetings from a hotel room next door and planning to use the footage to blackmail her .
The publicity - shy heiress filed charges against her former lover in January , according to Munich state prosecution spokesman Anton Winkler .
The incident , however , was revealed in November when the German media discovered the story .
Sgarbi is alleged to have not only blackmailed her but also other wealthy German , Austrian and Swiss women .
The affair between Klatten and Sgarbi reportedly lasted for about two months in the summer of 2007 , during which time Sgarbi persuaded Klatten to pay almost $ 10 million with a tale about having caused a tragic car accident that involved the child of a mafia boss , who was demanding a payoff , according to prosecutors .
But the suspect demanded millions more and threatened to publish some photos that were taken during their affair , if Klatten did not pay more , according to media reports .
The heiress instead abruptly ended the relationship .
She hired private detectives to monitor telephone calls in which the suspect allegedly threatened to publicly release some intimate videotapes unless she paid up .
In January Klatten led him to believe that she was going to hand over the money at an Autobahn parking lot near Innsbruck , Austria , but instead she sent the police .
They arrested Sgarbi , prosecutors said .
He 's been in Munich 's Stadelheim jail since January and is now awaiting trial .
Barretta , his reported accomplice , was arrested by police in Italy and is in jail in his hometown of Pescara .
He 's accused by Italian authorities of being the mastermind of the scheme to extort money from wealthy German women .
Sabatino Ciprietti , his lawyer , told ABC News there is no hard evidence against his client and insisted " the whole affair is a case of international gossip . "
Ciprietti said all the fuss and the Italian investigation were consequences of the prominence of the accuser .
Meanwhile the prosecutor in Pescara is moving forward and has requested that Barretta 's case go to trial .
The indictment hearing is expected to begin in the spring .
The BMW heiress is not the only rich woman alleged to have been blackmailed , but she is certainly the most prominent .
Germany 's Wealthiest Woman
She 's Germany 's wealthiest woman .
She ranks 55th on the 2008 Forbes Magazine list of world billionaires with a net worth of $ 13.2 billion that includes a 12.5 percent stake in BMW .
She is the daughter of industrial tycoon Herbert Quandt , who transformed a nearly bankrupt BMW into the automobile giant it is today .
Klatten 's family reportedly lives in Munich 's artsy Schwabing district .
Klatten used to be so media shy that some called her reclusive .
There is hardly any video of her and her family -- the media here have been using the same archive photos of her over and over again .
By filing charges Klatten revealed her identity and for the first time she gave an exclusive interview to The Financial Times Deutschland where she was quoted as saying , " You are a victim and you must protect yourself .
I am pressing charges on behalf of all women in my family and in the name of many more women . "
She has not talked to any other media and is not giving any interviews .
Joerg Appelhans , her spokesman , issued a statement to ABC News : " Once Ms. Klatten realized that the relationship with Mr. S. was based on the criminal intent to betray her and extort money , she was determined to take action .
She was fully aware that by pressing charges , she would face the unpleasant consequences of opening her private life to public scrutiny . "
Because the trial is imminent , Appelhans declined to comment on details about the affair that have emerged in press reports .
It is not clear whether Klatten or any of the women involved will have to appear in person once the trial begins .

Planning a trip to Germany and want some advice on what to see and do first ?
Here is a list of the top ten attractions and sights in Germany that no traveler should miss .
01 of 10 Neuschwanstein Castle Christopher Larson / TripSavvy View Map Address Neuschwansteinstraße 20 , 87645 Schwangau , Germany Get directions
Phone +49 8362 930830 Web Visit website
The world 's most famous castle , Neuschwanstein , is nestled in the Alps in Bavaria .
It seems to come straight out of a fairytale ; in fact , Walt Disney drew inspiration from it for " Sleeping Beauty . "
Neuschwanstein ( which translates to new - swan - stone ) is the most photographed building in all of Germany .
King Ludwig
II designed his dream castle in 1869 and instead of an architect , he hired a theatrical set designer to realize his vision .
Take a tour through the flamboyant castle 's interior .
Highlights include a gaudy artificial grotto , the Throne Room with its giant crown - shaped chandelier , and the lavish Minstrels ' Hall .
02 of 10 Europa - Park Michele Tantussi/ Getty Images View Map Address Europa - Park - Straße 2 , 77977 Rust , Germany Get directions
Phone +49 7822 776688 Web Visit website Europa - Park , Germany 's largest amusement park , recently unseated Neuschwanstein as the most visited site in Germany .
It may not have the romance of the castle , but it does have mind - blowing rides , lands modeled on the different countries of Europe , and a mouse mascot that may remind you of someone else .
03 of 10 Brandenburg Gate Taylor McIntyre / TripSavvy View Map Address Pariser Platz , 10117 Berlin , Germany Get directions Web Visit website Iconic Attractions 4.6
More than any other landmark , the Brandenburg Gate ( Brandenburger Tor ) is the national symbol for Germany .
Built in 1791 , it was simply meant to mark the end of the boulevard , Unter den Linden .
But the gate has had an eventful history .
The gate is crowned with the winged goddess of victory riding a four - horsed chariot — which was stolen by Napoleon ’s soldiers and taken back to France as a trophy in 1806 .
After Napoleon was defeated , Victory was returned to her throne in Berlin .
Brandenburg Gate has also had more controversial toppers like the Nazi and Soviet flag .
During the cold war , when Berlin was divided in two , the Brandenburg Gate stood between East and West Berlin .
It was the location of US President Ronald Reagan 's 1987 iconic speech , where he demanded , " Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall ! ”
After the wall fell in 1989 , the Brandenburg Gate became the symbol of Germany 's reunification .
04 of 10 Oktoberfest Johannes Simon / Getty Images View Map Address Schäfflerstraße 8 , 80333 München , Germany Get directions
Phone +49 89 24292930 Web Visit website
It might be a cliché , but it is an essential German experience of eating sausage and sauerkraut and drinking Oktoberfest beer .
Oktoberfest , the world 's largest fair , has over 6 million visitors annually .
Celebrate in 14 different beer tents and enjoy Bavarian “ Schuhplattler , " alphorn players , and yodelers .
If you are n't in town for the fest ( or one of the smaller , more local beer festivals ) , visit the Hofbräuhaus in Munich , the most famous beer hall in the world .
This Bavarian institution has defined gemütlich ( “ comfy ” ) since 1589 .
Wash down Bavarian specialties and giant pretzels with beer that is only served in a Mass ( one - liter glass ) .

05 of 10 Cologne 's Cathedral Christopher Larson / TripSavvy View Map Address Domkloster 4 , 50667 Köln , Germany Get directions
Phone +49 221 17940555 Web Visit website Cologne 's Cathedral ( Kölner Dom ) is one of Germany 's most important architectural monuments and the third tallest cathedral in the world .
It took over 600 years to construct this Gothic masterpiece .
When it was finally finished in 1880 , it was still true to the original plans from 1248 .
When Cologne was leveled by bombings in World War II , the Cathedral was the only building that survived .
Standing tall in an otherwise flattened city , some said it was divine intervention .
A more realistic explanation is that the cathedral was a point of orientation for the pilots .
In any case , the cathedral still stands next to the city 's train station and beckons visitors from around the globe .
06 of 10 City of Trier Westend61 / Getty Images View Map Address Trier , Germany Get directions Web Visit website
On the banks of the Moselle River lies Trier , Germany 's oldest city .
It was founded as a Roman colony in 16 B.C. and became the favored residence of several Roman emperors .
Nowhere else in Germany is the evidence of Roman times as vivid as it is in Trier .
Highlights of the city are the Porta Nigra , the largest Roman city gate north of the Alps , and the Cathedral of Trier , which houses a holy relic that draws many pilgrims : the Holy Robe , the garment said to be worn by Jesus when he was crucified .
07 of 10 Black Forest Gnther Bayerl / Getty Images View Map Address Black Forest , Germany Get directions
If you imagine Germany with rolling hills , small villages , and lush forests , visit the Schwarzwald ( Black Forest ) , where you can experience it all .
The vast expanse of hills , valleys , and forests stretches from the posh spa town Baden - Baden to the Swiss border , covering an area of 4,600 square miles .
Walking , biking , or driving — there are many scenic routes that will lead you to tiny villages , such as Freiburg with its long red sausage , wineries , and old - world monasteries .
Two of the most recommended tours are the Wine Road and the German Clock Road , which traces the history of the cuckoo clock .
For Christmas , visit Gengenbach which becomes the world 's largest advent calendar house .
But remember :
No visit to the Black Forest is complete without a piece of Black Forest Cake , with chocolate , cherries , cream , and a good dash of cherry schnapps .
08 of 10 Dresden Frauenkirche TripSavvy / Christopher Larson View Map Address Neumarkt , 01067 Dresden , Germany Get directions
Phone +49 351 65606100 Web Visit website
The Dresden Frauenkirche , the Church of Our Lady , has a moving history :
In World War II , when air - raids wiped out the city center of Dresden , the grand Frauenkirche collapsed into a 42 feet high pile of rubble .
The ruins were left untouched for over 40 years as a reminder of the destructive powers of war .
In 1994 , the painstaking reconstruction of the church began , almost completely financed by private donations .
In 2005 , the people of Dresden celebrated the resurrection of their Frauenkirche .

The renewable energy startup Ze - gen , Inc. , has put a new spin on an old technology .
Before the advent of the electric light bulb , many cities used coal gasification to provide fuel for their street lamps , and as the costs of oil and natural gas soar , many are reconsidering this old method in the hopes of providing cheaper sources of fuel .
But there is a downside .
Gasification works by using heat to convert solids into gas , and as we all know , burning coal tends to release large quantities of carbon dioxide , a major cause of global warming .
However , Ze-gen has come up with an alternative solution .
Instead of using coal , which has numerous detrimental environmental effects , they are using garbage — waste that would otherwise be destined for landfills .
For about two years now at a demonstration facility in New Bedford , Massachusetts , the company has been injecting what it terms biomass , organic waste from construction sites as well as municipal sources , into a vat of molten scrap metal .
Gasification using biomass produces a synthesis gas , or syngas in renewable energy parlance , composed mostly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen — which burn cleaner than the carbon dioxide produced from coal gasification .
Heavy metals from the waste sink to the bottom of the vat , and lighter contaminants rise to the top where they are trapped in a crust of silica .
These toxins and impurities can then be removed safely at a later time .
Ze-gen hopes to solve two problems at once : they will provide a cheaper , cleaner source of fuel while keeping tons of waste out of landfills — incidentally , also decreasing the amount of methane , a greenhouse gas just as bad as CO 2 , released by decomposing rubbish .
The test facility has been going through 1 ton of waste every hour for 5 hours a day .
Given that 300 million tons travel to landfills in the U.S. alone , the potential market is wide , and the positive impact on the environment staggering .
Now that Ze - gen ’s test facility has proven the technology commercially viable , the company is ready to begin commercial implementation .
On January 13 , 2009 , they announced that they have raised 20 million dollars to finance implementation .
Waroz Holding Company , a subsidiary of the Omzest Group of Oman , led the investors , which also include FlagshipVentures and Massachusetts Technology Development Corporation .
They plan to open full - scale commercial and industrial facilities by 2012 .

California ’s three - strikes sentencing law suffered a blow Tuesday when a federal appeals court struck down as unconstitutional a 28 - years - to - life sentence for a sex offender who failed to register with local police at the correct time of year .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case of Cecilio Gonzalez back to federal district court in Los Angeles for resentencing after finding his 2001 penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment , which is prohibited by the 8th Amendment .
Gonzalez ’s harsh sentence was grossly disproportionate to his “ entirely passive , harmless and technical violation of the registration law , ” the appeals court said .
The California Penal Code requires a sex offender to register whereabouts annually within five working days of an ex-convict ’s birthday .
Gonzalez had registered in Los Angeles County in May 2000 and confirmed his address a year later , meeting the yearly requirement but violating the deadline of his Feb. 24 birthday .
Advertisement
“ This is not a case where my client failed to register .
He failed to update his address information that was still good , ” said Gia Kim , the federal public defender who argued Gonzalez ’s case to the appeals court .
Registration infractions carry a maximum three - year sentence in California , and Gonzalez ’s oversight would n’t even qualify as a crime in at least 11 states , wrote Circuit Judge Jay S. Bybee , one of the court ’s more conservative judges .
Bybee also pointed out that Gonzalez , who has already been in prison for more than seven years for this third felony conviction , was facing substantially more severe punishment than that imposed in California for far more serious crimes , such as second - degree murder .
It was unclear how much significance Tuesday ’s ruling would have for others sentenced to long terms for minor third offenses .
Advertisement
“ It does show that the courts are willing to reject really outrageously long sentences for very technical offenses , ” Kim said .
“ The opinion focused on the fact that this was a crime of omission and a crime of very little moral culpability . ”
The state attorney general ’s office declined to comment on the ruling or say whether it would be appealed , said Christine Gasparac , press secretary for Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown .
Efforts to ease the three - strikes rule have largely failed .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in two challenges in March 2003 that it was a state legislature ’s right to determine how best to deter criminal recidivism .
“ It is enough that the state of California has a reasonable basis for believing that dramatically enhanced sentences for habitual felons advances the goals of its criminal justice system in any substantial way , ” former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote for the 5 - 4 majority in upholding 25 - years - to - life sentences for the two men whose respective third - strike offenses involved shoplifting golf clubs and video tapes .

California voters approved a 2000 ballot initiative that provides drug treatment instead of life imprisonment for most third strikes involving drug possession .
But voters spurned an initiative four years ago that would have required the third felony to be violent or serious to justify a harsh sentence .

Garrett 's Barber Shop , where – I was on the barber chair , at Garrets Barber Shop , as Garrett held his clippers in one hand , with a sparkle in his eyes he asked me " Would you like a number one , or number two on the sides ? "
Number one or number two ?
I was never good at making a decision between the Big Mac , or the two cheeseburgers , ( no condiments of course ! )
What a decision to make , what a step to take !
For the next two weeks it would could either be " wow Golf T's , that Big Mac looks great ! "
Or , " hey Golf T's why do n't you bring your two cheeseburger self over here , and sit next to me ? "
Of course no one would concentrate on the " fries and the shake , " but what can I say , some people have no appreciation for the fine arts on two feet .
As the Phantom of the Opera Movie Soundtrack began to play on the ov er head speakers I began to sing softly .
With out a moments notice I jumped out of the chair , began to glide ever so softly and quite dramatically across the smooth wooden floor , I spun like a ballerina and landed on the barber chair to continue the long life quest of having that one hair cut that would leave me looking delicious !
I begged Garrett to use his enchanting clippers like King Arthur used Excalibur , and take reign over the kingdom of hair that had conquered my skull .
After Garrett was done , I glanced to my left as I saw Robert Goulet sitting in his chair , in that breath taking record hanging on the wall , almost as to say " Golf T's - you are one Sex - C beast ! "
" Thank you Goulet , my you look yummy yourself ! "
As I proceeded to pay ( or so I thought ) my alarm clock went off , as the numbers blinked 6:00 am .
It had all been a dream I jumped out of bed , took a shower , threw my moo-moo on and went on my merry way , on over to Garretts Barber Shop , where dreams are not only made , they are reinvented .
Thank you Garrett , and thank you Goulet , the two of you , through the effective use of " Baby Sign , " have taught me that wether it 's a Big Mac or two Cheeseburgers on the sides , I will always look good !
On Monday , December 1 , a SWAT team with semi-automatic rifles entered the private home of the Stowers family in LaGrange , Ohio , herded the family onto the couches in the living room , and kept guns trained on grandparents , their daughter - in - law ( whose husband is currently serving as a U.S. Navy Seabee in Iraq ) , their children and grandchildren for four hours .
The team was aggressive and belligerent .
The children were quite traumatized .
At some point , the “ bad cop ” SWAT team was relieved by another team , a “ good cop ” team that tried to befriend the family .
The Stowers family has run a very large , well - known food cooperative called Manna Storehouse on the western side of the greater Cleveland area for many years .
[ See video : The Stowers tell their story ]
There were agents from the Department of Agriculture present , one of them identified as Bill Lesho .
The search warrant is reportedly suspicious - looking .
Agents began rifling through all of the family ’s possessions , a task that lasted hours and resulted in a complete upheaval of every private area in the home .
Many items were taken that were not listed on the search warrant .
The family was not permitted a phone call , and they were not told what crime they were being charged with .
They were not read their rights .
Over ten thousand dollars worth of food was taken , including the family ’s personal stock of food for the coming year .
All of their computers , and all of their cell phones were taken , as well as phone and contact records .
The food cooperative was virtually shut down .
There was no rational explanation , nor justification , for this extreme violation of Constitutional rights .
Presumably Manna Storehouse might eventually be charged with running a retail establishment without a license .
Why then the Gestapo - type interrogation for a 3rd degree misdemeanor charge ?
This incident has raised the ominous specter of a restrictive new era in State regulation and enforcement over the nation ’s private food supply .
For verification see this court filing showing that government exceeding its authority
This same type of abusive search and seizure was reported by those innocents who fell victim to oppressive federal drug laws passed in the 1990s .
The present circumstance raises the obvious question : is there some rabid new interpretation of an existing drug law that considers food a controlled substance worthy of a nasty SWAT operation ?
Or worse , is there a previously unrecognized provision (s ) pertaining to food in the Homeland Security measures ?
Some have suggested that it was merely an out - of - control , hot - to - trot ODA [ Ohio Department of Agriculture ] agent , and , if so , this would be a best - case scenario .
Anything else might spell the beginning of the end for the freedom to eat unregulated and unmonitored food .
One blogger familiar with the Ohio situation has reported that :
“ Interestingly , I believe they [ Manna Storehouse ] said a month or so ago , an undercover ODA official came to their little store and claimed to have a sick father wanting to join the co-op .
Both the owner and her daughter - in - law had a horrible feeling about the man , and decided not to allow him into the co-op and notified him by certified mail .
He came back to the co-op demanding to be part of it .
They refused and gave him names of other businesses and health food stores closer to his home .
Not coincidentally , this man was there yesterday as part of the raid . ”
The same blog also noted that the Ohio Department of Agriculture has been chastised by the courts in several previous instances for its aggression , including trying to entrap an Amish man in a raw milk “ sale , ” which backfired when it became known that the Amish believe in a literal interpretation of “ give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away ” ( Matthew 5:42 )
The issue appears to be the discovery of a bit of non-institutional beef in an Oberlin College food service freezer a year ago that was tracked down by a county sanitation official to Manna Storehouse .
Oberlin College ’s student food coop is widely known for its strident ideological stance about eating organic foods .
It seems that the Oberlin student food cooperative had joined the Manna Storehouse food cooperative in order to buy organic foods in bulk from the national organic food distributor United , which services buying clubs across the nation .
The sanitation official , James Boddy , evidently contacted the Ohio Department of Agriculture .
After the first contact by state ODA officials , Manna Storehouse reportedly wrote them a letter requesting assistance and guidelines for complying with the law .
This letter was never answered .
Rather , the ODA agent tried several times to infiltrate the coop , as described above .
When his attempts failed , the SWAT team showed up !
Food cooperatives and buying clubs have been an active part of the American landscape for over a generation .
In the 1970s , with the rise of the organic food industry ( a direct outgrowth of the hippie back - to - nature movement ) food coops started up all over the country .
These were groups of people who freely associated for the purpose of combining their buying power so that they could order organic food items in bulk and case lots .
Anyone who was part of these coops in the early era will remember the messy breakdown of 35 pounds of peanut butter and 5 gallon drums of honey !
These buying clubs have persisted and flourished over the years due to their ability to purchase high quality organic foods at reduced prices in bulk quantities .
Most cooperatives have participated greatly in the local agrarian economies , supporting neighborhood organic farmers with purchases of produce , eggs , chickens , etc .
The groups also purchase food from a number of different local , regional and national distributors , many of them family - based businesses who truck the food themselves .
Some of these food cooperatives have become large enough to set up mini-storefront operations where members can drop in and purchase items leftover from case lot sales .
Manna Storehouse had established itself in such a manner , using a small enclosed breezeway attached to their home .
It was a folksy place with old wooden floors where coop members stopped by to chat and snack on bags of organic corn chips .
The state of Ohio boasts the second largest Amish population in the country .
Many of the Amish live on acreages where they raise their own food , not unlike Manna Storehouse , and sell off the extras to neighbors and church members .
There is a sense of foreboding that this state crackdown on a longstanding , reputable food cooperative operation could adversely impact the peaceful agrarian way of life not only for the Amish , but homeschoolers and those families living off the land on rural acreages .
It raises the disturbing possibility that it could become a crime to raise your own food , buy eggs from the farmer down the road , or butcher your own chickens for family and friends – bustling activities that routinely take place in backwater America .
The freedom to purchase food directly form the source is increasingly under attack .
For those who have food allergies and chemical intolerances , or who are on special medical diets , this is becoming a serious health issue .
Will Americans retain the right to purchase food that is uncontaminated by pesticides , herbicides , allergens , additives , dyes , preservatives , MSG , GMOs , radiation , etc . ?
The melamine scare from China underscores the increasingly inferior and suspect quality of modern processed institutional foods .
One blog , commenting on the bizarre and troubling Manna Storehouse situation , observed that :
“ No one is saying exactly why .
At the same time the FDA says it is safe to eat the 40 % of tainted beef found in Costco 's and Sam 's all over the nation .
These farm raids are very common now .
Every farmer needs to fully equipped [ sic ] for the possibility of it happening to them .
The Farmer To Consumer Legal Defense Fund was created just for this purpose .
The USDA just released their plans to put a law into action that will put all small farmers out of business .
Animals for the sale of meat or milk will only be allowed in commercial farms , even the organic ones . ”

“ The Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ?
The Lord is the strength of my life ;
Of whom shall I be afraid ? ...

Demonstrators hold signs outside the vacation home of President - elect Barack Obama in Kailua , Hawaii Protests interrupt Obama 's paradise
HONOLULU —
It ’s not exactly anti-war mom Cindy Sheehan camped outside of George W. Bush ’s Crawford ranch .
But as President - elect Barack Obama lingered at his Kailua vacation home later than usual this morning , about 10 protesters gathered near the security checkpoint down the street .
It is the first time Obama has received anything but praise and cheers during his 12 - day Hawaiian vacation , which ends on Thursday .

Some of the demonstrators carried signs declaring “ War is Terror " and " Free Palestine . ”
Ann Wright , a retired Army colonel and member of Veterans for Peace , wore a T - shirt that read , " We will not be silent " and carried a sign that read , " Change U.S. foreign policy .
Yes we can . "
Wright , 62 , of Honolulu , said the protesters represented various groups , including her organization Veterans for Peace .
They even had a press release that said , “ We call on President - elect Obama to place the resolution of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict at the top of his list of priorities of his new administration . ”
Obama has drawn increasingly large gaggles of onlookers during his vacation outings over the past 10 days , and they have been friendly crowds .
The first seedlings of protest about the violence in Gaza came on Monday .
A couple of locals attempted to give Obama a box they said contained some golf balls , as well as informational DVDs about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and a letter urging the president - elect to sympathize with the Palestinians .
Secret Service turned them away .
Shortly after 9:30 this morning as Obama headed to his high school alma mater to play basketball , the small group of demonstrators near his vacation home waved signs that said , " No U.S. support for Israel ” and " Gazans need food , medicine , not war . "
But Obama was sitting in the rear on the passenger side of his black sport utility vehicle , and was not visible to the protesters , according to a pool report , which said the president - elect sipped from a bottle of water and looked straight ahead as his vehicle passed the demonstrators .
Obama ’s transition has said the president - elect receives an intelligence briefing every day and is monitoring the situation in the Middle East .
Information visualization , besides being a science field , can be fun .
The ever challenging problem of converting text and numbers into something viewable that is self explanatory makes information visualization an interesting toy to play with .
Some time ago I saw an applet that displays the hierarchical structure of HTML files called HtmlGraph .
I really liked the idea : you do n’t have to ramble through the woods of html trees in order to figure out its structural pattern .
I wondered how aiSee will display html graphs and created a simple application for this purpose .
But the never ending search for perfection impels to continually improve and evolve .
Finally , I ended up with a fairly nice tool that might be useful for the community .
I ’ve called it HTML2GDL .
Here is how http://www.aisee.com/gallery/ is displayed by HtmlGraph and HTML2GDL :
The GDL source : aisee_gallery.gdl
The forcedir layout algorithm was used .
I do n’t know well how force directed layout schemes works , so I ’ve tried different configuration options to obtain a nice graph .
I found that the graph can be improved by setting the minimum temperature ( tempmin attribute ) to a higher value .
You can play with attraction and repulsion graph attributes to control the length of the edges .
The edge ’s length can be dynamically adjusted by specifying the –priority - factor ( the default is 0 ) .
The higher the priority of an edge , the smaller its length will be .
( edge.priority = priority - factor * node. level ) .
Refer to priority edge attribute .
Notice : HTML2GDL now supports GraphViz package , : HTML2GDL now supports GraphViz package , read more …
The documentation ( the complete list of html2gdl.pl command line options with explanations ) is located at the beginning of the script .
html2gdl.pl can process a local file or fetch an URL directly :
> perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://yahoo.com/ --graph=yahoo.gdl
> perl html2gdl.pl --file=localfile.html --graph=yahoo.gdl
The graph definition will be written to -- graph file ( note : existing files will be overwritten ) .
and tag statistics displayed ( Top 10 most used tags ) .
The script is using two standard perl modules : LWP :: Simple and HTML :: TreeBuilder .
If you do n’t have these modules installed ( the script refuses to work : ) ) , the procedure is very straightforward , run the following commands :
> cpan install HTML :: TreeBuilder
> cpan install LWP :: Simple
I ’ll briefly outline the main html2gdl.pl features and then provide a case study .
HTML2GDL features
The configuration options of the application can be divided in two groups : 1 ) HTML processing 2 ) Visual effects .
1. HTML Processing : specifying how tags are processed during graph construction :
remove - tags : tags and their descendants will not be displayed ;
: tags and their descendants will not be displayed ; ignore - tags : these and descendant tags will be white colored , it is useful when you want to blur a list of unimportant tags ;
: these and descendant tags will be white colored , it is useful when you want to blur a list of unimportant tags ; fold - tags : descendant tags will not be displayed , although the tag itself will be visible .
You may fold entire tables or just tr‘s
: descendant tags will not be displayed , although the tag itself will be visible .
You may fold entire tables or just tr ‘s flatten - tags : tags are removed but descendants will be linked to the ancestors of the deleted tags .
You can specify a starting level for above options , i.e. : only tags that are at a specified level and below will be affected .
2. Visual Effects : different node coloring methods , controling the size ( big or small ) of the nodes .
There are three approaches to node coloring : by tag , size and level :
tag : a colorMap is provided that specifies colors for tag groups .
The color legend is provided below .
: a colorMap is provided that specifies colors for tag groups .
The color legend is provided below .
size : the size of a node is the content length of its descendants ( i.e. the length of the inner text without html tags ) .
The color of the node will be in the [ ColorStart , ColorEnd ] interval : ‘ fat ’ nodes will have colors close to ColorStart , thin nodes will have a color near ColorEnd .
: the size of a node is the content length of its descendants ( i.e. the length of the inner text without html tags ) .
The color of the node will be in the [ ColorStart , ColorEnd ] interval : ‘ fat ’ nodes will have colors close to ColorStart , thin nodes will have a color near ColorEnd .
level : similar to size , but the level of the node in the hierarchy is used instead of the size .
Color Legend ( for tag coloring ) :
blue : A
: A green : DIV
: DIV magenta : IMG
: IMG darkgrey : P , BR , I , S , U , BLOCKQUOTE , STRONG , … ( text tags )
: P , BR , I , S , U , BLOCKQUOTE , STRONG , … ( text tags ) yellowgreen : UL , OL , LI , DL , DT , DD , DIR , MENU
: UL , OL , LI , DL , DT , DD , DIR , MENU cyan : H1 , H2 , … H6
: H1 , H2 , … H6 orange : TABLE , TR , TD …. ( table tags )
: TABLE , TR , TD …. ( table tags ) yellow : FORM , INPUT , SELECT , … ( form tags )
: FORM , INPUT , SELECT , … ( form tags ) red : APPLET , SCRIPT , OBJECT , … ( external resources )
: APPLET , SCRIPT , OBJECT , … ( external resources ) lightgrey : all other tags
By default , the nodes are represented as circles , the radius can be fixed or dynamically computed according to node size or level .
Refer to html2gdl.pl for the full list of configuration options .
Html2GDL Usage
Displaying all html tags might be overwhelming , especially for large pages .
Instead of a nice colored graph , my intention was to create a simplified version of HTML files .
At the same time , the graph should be more informative .
For this purposes the node attributes were used : color and size .
At first , let ’s create the full graph ( all html tags are shown ) of http://yahoo.com/ but with varying node radius : the more content ( pure text with html tags stripped off ) a node has , the bigger the radius ( -- node - radius=size ) .
The edges at lower levels are smaller ( this is controlled by -- priority - factor ) .
> perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://yahoo.com/ --priority - factor=0.5 --node-radius=size --attraction=50 --repulsion=35 --graph=yahoo.gdl
GDL source
The resulted graph is displayed in the middle image .
On the left is the HtmlGraph image provided for comparison purposes .
The right image is the same graph shown at the center but using the minbackward layout algorithm :
> perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://yahoo.com/ --layout=minbackward --priority - factor=0.5 --node-radius=size --attraction=50 --repulsion=35 --graph=yahoo.gdl
GDL source
IMHO , the last graph provides a better insight into the html structure .
It clearly depicts where most of the content is located in the HTML document , under which tags and at which levels .
Notice : the html of the yahoo.com webpage is different when accessed through a browser .
If you ’ll do a wget http://yahoo.com you ’ll get the same page as html2gdl.pl gets .
I found this issue when I wondered why yahoo has designed its homepage using TABLE elements instead of DIV ‘s .
Although useful , the graphs are cluttered with tags that add a lot of noise : the B , FONT , BR tags for example .
To generate a lighter graph , we ’ll remove the HEAD , SPACER , BR tags and flatten B , FONT , TR , CENTER tags .
TR ‘s are flattened in order to reduce the deepness of the tree .
The CENTER is the child of the BODY tag and does n’t carry any structural information .
( Flattening means : tags are removed but descendants will be linked to the ancestors of the removed tags ) .
In the end , let ’s give a new look to our graph : --node-radius=level -- node - color=size .
( The node radius is decreasing for lower levels .
The darker the node , the more content ( text without html tags ) it has inside , white nodes are empty ) .
> perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://yahoo.com/ --graph=yahoo.gdl --layout=minbackward --node-radius=level --node-color=size --remove-tags='HEAD , SPACER , BR ' -- flatten - tags='B , FONT , TR , CENTER '
GDL source
The middle graph uses -- node - radius=size only ( GDL source ) .
The right graph is a manual modification of the middle graph : I removed the first two nodes and their corresponding edges .
The result is quite interesting , it highlights the main sections of the HTML page and their structure .
Let ’s examine another webpage : http://www.ibm.com/
> perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://ibm.com --graph=ibm.gdl
GDL source ( The image on the left ) .
The same graph but with a -- layout =minbackward is displayed in the middle .
While working with the graph in aiSee , you can pan , zoom in / out the graph .
Each node has a label : the tag and class / id attributes .
This label can be seen when zooming in , or as a tooltip when moving the mouse over the node .
The middle graph indicates that there are a lot of UL , LI tags in the HTML .
Let ’s fold UL tags , but starting from the 7th level downward ( because we want to keep the upper UL that has a FORM inside ) .
The HEAD tag will be removed .
perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://ibm.com --graph=ibm.gdl --layout=minbackward --fold-tags='UL ' -- fold-tags-sl=7 -- remove-tags='HEAD '
GDL source ( The image on the right ) .
Let ’s add the final touch to the picture .
The BODY tag will be flattened , and -- node - radius=level -- node - color=size options added .
Notice that the flattening operation changes the level numbering for descendant tags , that is why -- fold - tags - sl=6 was specified .
perl html2gdl.pl --url=http://ibm.com -- graph=ibm.gdl --fold-tags='UL ' --fold-tags-sl=6 --remove-tags='HEAD , SCRIPT ' -- flatten-tags=' BODY ' --node-radius=level --node-color=size
GDL source
This article does n’t cover all the features , I ’ve outlined the most important ones .
Refer to html2gdl.pl script for available options and documentation .
Nevertheless , I ’ll mention the -- debug=1 parameter .
Besides the Top 10 tags list , the whole HTML skeleton will be printed .
ID and class attributes are also provided , ex : li#ibm - country.ibm - first .
Note that unknown HTML tags are ignored .
( Now I think that it might be useful to highlight deprecated HTML tags ) .
Conclusion
My intention was to create a tool that will reduce the time spent for evaluating HTML structures .
Now I realize that it can be rewritten to be even more flexible 🙂
For ex. replacing the - - remove - tags , -- fold - tags etc parameters with an XPath counterpart : probably you do n’t want all div’s to be folded , just those with a specific class .
Furthermore , I think that it would be useful to specify the root tag to start from : html > body > div#sidebar > table [ 3 ] i.e. show me the graph of the 3rd table underneath the DIV with id=#sidebar .
But , after having looked at the problem from another point of view , I do n’t think that someone will want to use this tool as magnifying glass to inspect HTML sources .
The aim is to provide a good overview .
I should learn more about the forcedir layout algorithm .
Maybe the graph attributes can be further adjusted .
I ’ll say more : at the beginning I could n’t understand why the graphs were so ugly ( compared to HtmlGraph ) .
I was thinking about nesting each level into a separate subgraph and adjust attraction / repulsion accordingly .
Hopefully , I had inadvertently discovered that increasing the tempmin attribute yields better results .
I hope that this application will be helpful for those who use the “ view source ” button quite often 🙂
From the " it 's not Linux , but it 's got the same apps " files :
Sun has rolled opensolaris 2008.11 , loaded with open source applications that are well known to Linux distribution users .
The ' What 's New ' page for opensolaris 2008.11 , lists the new features which include GNOME 2.24 , Firefox 3 , Songbird and OpenOffice.org 3 .
On the apps that are more opensolaris specific the Image Packaging System , IPS gets an update but to my naked eye it looks surprisingly like GNOME 's Synaptic package manager .
Fast boot times ( something that Linux distros are working on too ) is also a key new feature for the opensolaris release .
Where opensolaris 2008.11 may well differ most is with its Project COMSTAR ( Common Multiprotocol SCSI Target ) implementation for an open storage system .
The first phase of Project COMSTAR has
been included in OpenSolaris 2008.11 , allowing you to turn any OpenSolaris host into a SCSI storage device
or target , accessible by any initiator hosts .
Only Fibre Channel is supported at this time , however the iSCSI
port provider will be provided in the developer repository soon .
So , sure there are alot of open source applications in opensolaris 2008.11 that are common to other open source operating systems , but Sun has also made sure that it has several differentiators as well .
Reader Neil has just told us a DIY solution to revive Zune 30s killed by the Zunepocalypse until Microsoft gets back with an official fix .
Update :
The easy official fix here .
Advertisement
Follow Rapid Repair 's guide to taking your Zune apart to step 4 , so you have access to the hard drive and the battery .
Disconnect BOTH the battery and hard drive , and then plug 'em back in .
This apparently resets the Zune 's internal clock , which brings it back to life .
Put it back together , and it should be 100 percent again .
( Assuming you do n't screw it up . )

The risk here is that we 're not sure how attempting this DIY fix will play into what Microsoft 's solution is .
Like , if for some reason you 've gotta send it in to Microsoft , this might screw up your warranty situation .
But , at least you 'll have a working Zune sooner , rather than later .
If you have the patience of a gnat , we 'd recommend you waiting for an official fix .
Thanks Neil !
If holidays were tech companies , Halloween would be fun and sexy Apple , Microsoft ( or arguably Google ) would be the mega , omni-holiday Christmas , and Thanksgiving would be Yahoo .
Both Yahoo and Thanksgiving are big and well - known , but each of them has outlived their prime years -- Yahoo in the 90's , Thanksgiving in the Norman Rockwell 50's -- and are currently on the decline .
In the tech world , Yahoo and Microsoft are courting a merger .
I say we do the same with Thanksgiving and Christmas .
First of all , the timing of Thanksgiving could n't be worse .
In October , you work hard on your costume and attend several parties .
In December , you need to buy lots of presents and get the whole family together .
You'd think we'd have a nice rest in between , but no .
We 've got to get the whole family together a month in advance of Christmas , and put together another giant meal .
Fuck you , Thanksgiving !
In our shitty economy , you should n't be expected to create more than one giant family dinner in a span of 6 months , let alone buy $ 800 plane tickets home for two months in a row .
Christmas and Thanksgiving need each other .
People love Christmas for the presents , cookies and the poisonous new Vince Vaughn movie .
But we ’re often reminded that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost .
It ’s all tinsel , no heart .
On the other hand , Thanksgiving is all heart with its " what are we thankful for , " blah blah blah .
Thanksgiving is extremely boring , but has kept its integrity in tact .
Put them together and you ’ve got heart and a new XBOX under the tree .
How would it work ?
Pretty simple .
Christmas
Eve dinner becomes Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving / Christmas Eve or simply " Christgiving . "
( TM ) ( C ) During December , the holiday pageants are broken into two acts : the story of Thanksgiving , where the kids are cute little Indians or Pilgrims — AWWWW !!!!!— and then the ever popular manger scene is the main event .
The radio continues to play just Christmas songs , since they start after Halloween anyway , and maybe being part of Christmas will give Thanksgiving some much needed splash - over publicity .
We should make Thanksgiving work for us , not the other way around .
I agree it ’s important to honor the Europeans who colonized here and slaughtered the natives , but why waste time and money on a holiday that many people just consider a rehearsal for Christmas anyway ?
Let ’s put these two together and make Thanksgiving relevant again .
Oh , and in regards to getting off work , I say we replace Thanksgiving ’s paltry day or two with " November Rest Week . "
You ’re not even allowed to see family — only hang out with your chillest friends and order a fucking pizza .

In the past week , the idea that America should “ get rid of the ‘ War on Terror ’ mindset ” has enjoyed a resurgence .
With Barack Obama ’s rolling back some of the blunders of the Bush administration ’s ill - fated War on Terror , liberals who have been bludgeoned with the term , ‘ War on Terror ’ in election after election want it retired .
Surprisingly few voices have called for the Democrats to appropriate the term as a partisan weapon against the Republicans as it was used against them – which indicates the seriousness with which these liberals take retiring the term .
For them , ‘ War on Terror ’ has become associated not only with political attacks on any criticism of the Bush administration but with the bevy of emergency measures taken by the administration in the panicked aftermath of September 11 – and then institutionalized as policy afterward .
Many of these measures were ill - considered and counterproductive – and the fight over them has distracted the country from reevaluating our defense posture in light of the threat of strategic terrorism .
From when Sir Michael Howard first made the case to treat terrorism as a law enforcement matter and ditch the war posturing in 2002 in an article for Foreign Affairs magazine to Matt Yglesias ’s short sketch in The American Prospect last week , the argument has been substantially the same .
It is certainly not weakened by the fact that the main critiques it makes cannot be reasonably disputed .
In summary , the critics of the term ‘ War on Terror ’ make the point that this war does not fit our traditional definition of war ; that because it does not , it makes it seem like the metaphorical wars on drugs or poverty ; that it ennobles terrorists as warriors instead of mere murderers and criminals ; that declaring war on terror leads us to conflate our enemies and even confuse them – when in fact they have separate and competing agendas ; that by using the term war without the prospect of victory , we are setting ourselves up for a failure ; that as this war is without a foreseeable end , we risk permanently giving up those liberties that are traditionally infringed upon during war .
Already , this War on Terror has lasted longer than any war in American history – and yet victory is nowhere in sight .
In related points , critics of the term point out that terrorists have launched attacks on numerous societies in the past – and these societies have been more successful when they responded with law enforcement than with military force , for , as Lawrence Wright explains in The Looming Tower :
The usual object of terror is to draw one ’s opponent into repressive blunders …
In the past seven years , we have not avoided the pitfalls that have historically accompanied a state response to terrorism .
We have not learned from the history and experience of other nations that informs the views of the liberal critics of the terms .
Yet it should be admitted that the term has been accepted by the greatest majority of Americans – and in the aftermath of September 11 , it seemed clear to me – as well as to many others – that this was somehow different .
It was n’t just the scale of the damage that was shocking ; it was the deliberation involved in planning the attack .
As more information became public – as it became clear that this attack was in development for years , that it had required hundreds of thousands of dollars to organize ; that it ’s goals were not the mundane extortion of 20th century terrorism ( Free this prisoner !
Give us our own state ! ) – but a long - term strategic plan to reorganize the world – as all this became clear , we knew it was something different .
Worse – our society is more vulnerable to attack today then it was even a decade ago .
Biological technology is advancing rapidly – and soon , if not already , biological weapons will be acquired by terrorists .
There is a black market is weapons of mass destruction – including nuclear weaponry thanks to Pakistan ’s A. Q. Khan .
Large numbers of people travel the world and international borders have become porous .
At the same time , our society is becoming more and more concentrated as people pack into already denseley populated cities .
The markets that control an ever expanding portion of our society are especially vulnerable to the effects of terrorism – both the fear that it elicits and the government intrusion that comes in reaction .
These vulnerabilities coupled with the opportunities to create havoc which are more democratically available than ever mean that the threat of terrorism truly is a threat to our way of life .
At the same time , these terrorists are no mere criminals – whose activities while damaging to society are manageable and who can be deterred with punitive measures .
Suicide terrorists seek death – and even are willing to be given capital punishment , considering it martyrdom , as the Khalid Sheikh Muhammad has said .
For the past seven years , we avoided the needed - re - thinking of our approach to terrorism , as under Karl Rove ’s guidance , our response to terrorism became yet another front in the culture wars ; as under Dick Cheney ’s influence with his poisonous One Percent Doctrine , he ensured that our nation stayed the course set in the panic of September 2001 , justifying every misstep as an essential part of a ‘ strategy ’ to combat terrorism that never materialized .
‘ We will fight them over there so we do not need to fight them over here , ’ it was said – as if our enemy were a fixed group which we could eliminate like our enemies in conflicts past .
The Bush administration could never bring itself to acknowledge that Al Qaeda was a stateless organization – and Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Bush were certain that Iraq must be somehow behind it all .
But the threat of September 11 did not emanate from a state although it did have a temporary home in Afghanistan .
We conflated and confused our enemies – presuming they formed a united front when in fact they consisted of squabbling groups , or in other cases , mortal enemies – and we did our best to unite them , treating them as one entity .
Although it is not fashionable today to say anything in praise of Donald Rumsfeld given his mismanagement of the Defense Department , by October 2003 , he was asking the tough but necessary questions :
Today , we lack metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror .
Are we capturing , killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting , training and deploying against us ?
Does the US need to fashion a broad , integrated plan to stop the next generation of terrorists ?
The US is putting relatively little effort into a long - range plan , but we are putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop terrorists .
The cost - benefit ratio is against us !
Our cost is billions against the terrorists ’ costs of millions .
Five years later , and we still do not have answers to these questions or a long - range plan for what the military has come to call the Long War .
It is left to Obama then to forge a new legal and strategic framework to deal with this threat to our way of life .
( Which should be easy as he must also attempt to patch together a new financial and economic world order at the same time . )
In the past seven years , liberals have tended to think of terrorism as an ever - receding threat .
Certainly , the fear in the days and months after September 11 have proved to be inflated .
And it is clear that Al Qaeda does not pose a threat to our nation in the way that Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union did .
But Al Qaeda in particular – and strategic terrorism generally – does pose an existential threat to our way of life .
By disrupting our markets , by prompting government repression .
Our way of life is based on transparency , the rule of law , the free flow of goods , information , and people around the world , and technological advances – all of which are undermined both by terrorism and ordinary counterterrorism and war measures .
Which is why as liberals , we must – both out of political necessity and good sense – embrace some version of a war against terrorism and come to terms with the threat from strategic terrorism , especially when coupled with weapons of mass destruction , to our way of life .
We must build a society and a structure of laws that will withstand another attack .
Or we will lose .
A law enforcement approach is not sufficient to combat this threat .
Nor is the hodge - podge of measures taken by the Bush administration .
Nor would a traditional war .
What is required is a serious look at who our enemy is and who we are .
Without this knowledge , we will lose this war , whether we call it one or not .

Highly useful Linux commands & configurations
Updated : May 23 , 2008 ; August 31 , 2010
Oh , you 're gonna love this article !
Even though there are many websites hawking similar content , with varying degree of clarity and quality , I want to offer a short , easy - to - use guide to some of the most common yet highly useful commands that could help make your Linux experience more joyful .
Now that you have read some of my installation guides , you have probably setup your system and configured the basic settings .
However , I 'm positive that some of you must have encountered certain difficulties - a missing package , a missing driver .
The initial effort required of a Linux novice can appear daunting , especially after many years of Windows discipline .
Therefore , this article was born , in order to offer simple solutions to some of the more widespread problems that one might face during and immediately after a Linux installation .
It is intended for the beginner and intermediate users , who still feel slightly uncomfortable with meddling in command line , scripts or configuration files .
This article will refer to Ubuntu Linux distribution as the demonstration platform .
However , all of these commands will work well with many other Linux distributions , with only small changes in syntax , at most .
I have personally tested and used all of the commands and configurations in both Debian - based and RedHat - based distributions with success .
What am I going to write about ?
Basic tips - avoiding classic mistakes .
Commands - an introduction to the command line .
Installation of software - including extraction of archives and compilation of sources .
Installation of drivers - including compilation , loading , configuration , and addition of drivers to the bootup chain , writing of scripts and addition to the bootup chain .
Mounting of drives - including NTFS and FAT32 filesystems and read / write permissions .
Installation of graphic card drivers - including troubleshooting of stubborn common problems .
Network sharing - how to access shared folders in Windows and Linux from one another .
Printer sharing - how to share printers in Windows and Linux from one another .
Some other useful commands .
Table of contents
Basic tips
Here are the topics .
If you want to skip through some of the paragraphs , you can use the table of contents further below , but I recommend you read everything .
There are some things you need to know before heading into the deep waters of the Command Line :
Linux commands are cAse - sensitive ( dedoimedo and Dedoimedo are two different files ) .
( dedoimedo and Dedoimedo are two different files ) .
It is best to create folders and files in Linux WITHOUT spaces .
For example : Red Gemini.doc is a valid Windows filename , but you might have problems accessing it from the command line in Linux ; you should rename the file to RedGemini.doc .
Users of the DOS command line are also familiar with this problem - commands will fail on folders and files with more than a single word , unless explicitly declared with double quotation marks ( " like this " ) .
spaces .
For example : is a valid Windows filename , but you might have problems accessing it from the command line in Linux ; you should rename the file to .
Users of the DOS command line are also familiar with this problem - commands will fail on folders and files with more than a single word , unless explicitly declared with double quotation marks ( ) .
Pressing TAB when typing a command will auto - complete the command .
For example : if you have a single file in a certain folder that begins with the letter p , typing p then TAB will automatically complete the name regardless of its length ; if you have more than one file , the command will complete the maximum available part of the string that matches all relevant filenames ( s + TAB for smirk and smile will auto - complete to smi ) .
when typing a command will auto - complete the command .
For example : if you have a single file in a certain folder that begins with the letter p , typing p then TAB will automatically complete the name regardless of its length ; if you have more than one file , the command will complete the maximum available part of the string that matches all relevant filenames ( + for smirk and smile will auto - complete to ) .
Before copying , moving , deleting , or tweaking any file , especially scripts and configuration files , it is best to back them up first .
Do NOT stop the commands while they are running ( by pressing Ctrl + C ) .
Even though you may not see the HDD light blinking and the execution takes a very long time , do not assume the system is frozen .
Unlike Windows , Linux almost never gets stuck .
Let the command complete , be it 5 seconds or 5 hours .
Just for reference , compilation of certain programs can take a few days to complete .
Commands
To be able to use the command line , you need to be familiar with some rudimentary Linux commands .
Former users of DOS will find the transition very simple .
Below you can find links to some of the basic Linux commands :

Some Useful Linux Commands
Asking for help
First , anything and everything you could ever probably think of has already been answered at least once in a Linux forum ; use the forums to find solutions to ... everything .
Copy & paste your error code / message into a search engine of your choosing ( e.g. Google ) and you will find links to answers in 99.9996532 % of cases .
Locally , help is one of the most useful features available to the command line user .
If , for some reason , you cannot figure out the syntax required to use the file , you can ask for help .
There are two ways of doing it :
man some_command
The above usage will display a full help file for the command in question in Vi text editor .
You can learn more about Vi from An Extremely Quick and Simple Introduction to the Vi Text Editor .
some_command -- help
The above usage will display a summary of available options for the command in question , inside the command line terminal .
You will most likely prefer to use this second way .
Installation of software
Although most Linux distributions offer a wealth of useful programs , you will probably be compelled to try new products .
Some programs will be available for download via package managers , like Synaptic .
Others will only be found on the developer 's site , most likely packaged inside an archive .
You probably ask yourself :
What now ?
The answer is very simple .
There are three versions to your downloads , from the easiest to hardest :
Compiled packages , usually with .rpm or .deb extension .
These packages are identical to Windows .exe installers and will unpack and install automatically .
The upside of the packages is the relative use of their deployment ; the downside is that the user has no control over the installation script .
Compiled archives , called tarballs , with .tar extension .
These archives will contain all of the necessary files required to make a program run , but the user will have to install them manually , from the command line , after unpacking the archive .
These archives will also most likely be compressed and bear a double extension like tar .gz or tar .
bz2 .
This option offers more control during the installation .
Sources , usually archived .
The user will have to unpack the archives and then compile the sources before being able to actually install the program .
In addition to better control of the installation , the user will also benefit from software optimized to his hardware configuration .
What should you choose ?
The logical choice for the novice user should be 1 > 2 > 3 . Intermediate users will probably try 2 >
3 .
Geeks will most likely ever only compile from sources .
Discipline
This may sound harsh or strict , but certain unspoken rules are followed , which simplifies the use of software downloads .
The program itself will almost always be accompanied with a how - to , usually in a form of a text file that explains what a user should do , prior , during and after the installation .
The how - tos are most often found on the site you download the software from , either as a standalone file , an explanatory text on the download page or bundled with the download .
You should read this how - to FIRST before downloading / manipulating the software .
A secondary how - to will most often be packed with the program , explaining the installation process itself .
You should read this how - to FIRST before installing the software .
Unpacking an archive
The exact syntax will differ from one package to another .
But the general idea is the same for all .
The only difference will be in the arguments used for unpacking .
Here are a few common examples :
tar zxf some_software .
tar.gz
tar - xjf some_software.tar.bz2
You can read in detail about the handling of tarballs on the Wikipedia site .
Zipped archives
Some archives will be zipped rather than tarred .
This might put you off .
But the problem is easily solvable .
If you recall , we have the ability to " ask " for help for each unknown command .
In our case , we need to know how to unzip an archive .
unzip -- help
Here 's a screenshot I took , depicting the very dilemma we are facing - and its solution :
A possible usage will then be :
unzip some_software.zip -d /tmp
Reading from the help screen above , we want to unpack our archive into a folder .
The argument -d tells us that the contents of the archive will be extracted into a destination directory ( folder ) , in our case a temporary folder called / tmp .
Installation
After unpacking the archive , you will now have to install the software .
Usually , the installation is invoked by using a script .
The exact name of the script will vary from one program to another , as well as its extension , depending on the language used to write it .
For example , the following command will invoke the script named install.pl ( written in Perl ) .
Dot and trailing slash indicate that the script will be executed within the current directory .
./install.pl
Compilation ( from sources )
Sometimes , the programs will not be compiled and ready to install .
The archives will contain lots of files with curious extensions like .c , .h and .o.
If you are not a programmer , you should not bother understanding what they are and what they do .
Likewise , you need not understand how the compilation of sources is made .
You just need to remember three simple commands :
This first command will generates files required to build the software and setup system - wide parameters .
./ configure
This second command will build the libraries and applications .
make
This third command will install the libraries and applications .
make install
For homework , you could use some reading :
Compiling and installing software from source in Linux
There is no guarantee that the compilation will succeed .
Some sources are broken !
In that case , you should make note of the errors and post them in relevant forums , where you are most likely to find an answer rather quickly .
Summary of installation procedures
To make things easier to understand , below are two examples showing the list of necessary commands required to run to successfully install a downloaded application ( please note these are ONLY examples ! ) .
Most likely , you will need root privileges ( su or sudo ) to be able to install software .
An archive containing compiled program :
tar zxf some_software .
tar.gz
OR
tar - xjf some_software.tar.bz2
cd some_software_directory
./install_script
An archive containing sources :
tar zxf some_software .
tar.gz
OR
tar - xjf some_software.tar.bz2
cd some_software_directory
./ configure
make
make install
Installation of drivers
Drivers are programs , like any software .
The only difference is - you do not actively use them .
They serve the purpose of making your hardware components understand each other .
As simple as that .
You need them to enhance your usage of the operating system .
Most often , the necessary drivers will be included with the distribution and installed during the setup .
Sometimes , you might not be so lucky and will reach a newly installed desktop without sound , network or video drivers .
I will not go into details explaining how specific drivers are installed .
You should contact your vendors for that information .
I will explain how to install the drivers , how to load them , and then how to add them to startup , so they will load automatically every time your machine starts .
Installation
Just like any software , drivers may be compiled or not .
Most often , they will not be .
Drivers will usually be distributed as sources , in order to achieve maximal possible compatibility with the hardware on the installation platform .
This means you will have to compile from sources .
Piece of cake .
We already know how to do that .
If the vendor is benevolent , it is possible that the driver will be accompanied with a self - installation script .
In other words , you will need to run only one command , which will in turn extract the archive , compile , install , and load it .
But this might not be the case - or might not even work .
I have personally witnessed a driver self - installation script go wrong .
Therefore , for all practical purposes , you should probably manually install the driver .
After successfully extracting the archive and compiling the sources (./ configure , make , make install ) , you will most likely be faced with three choices :
The driver will be fully configured and copied to default directories and the system paths updated .
You will not need do anything special to use the driver .
The driver will be auto - configured and the system paths updated .
This means you will only have to add the driver name to the list of drivers loaded during the boot to enable it every time the machine starts .
The driver will be ready to use , but will not be configured nor system paths updated .
You will have to manually load the driver and then update the list of drivers loaded during the boot to enable it every time the machine starts .
The second option will make the installation process probably look like this :
tar zxf some_driver.tar.gz
OR
tar - xjf some_driver.tar.bz2
cd some_driver_directory
./ configure
make
make install
Optional
./setup_driver_script
All that remains is to add this driver to the list of drivers loaded at bootup .
In Linux , the drivers are often referred to as modules .
You need to open the configuration file containing the list of modules .
You should refer to your specific distribution for exact name and location of this file .
In Ubuntu , the file is called modules .conf and is found in /etc directory ( /etc/modules.conf ) .
We will update this file , but first we will back it up !
Please remember that you need root privileges to meddle with the configuration files .
This is what our procedure would look like :
cp /etc/modules.conf /etc/modules.conf.bak
gedit /etc/modules.conf
The above commands will open the file modules .
conf inside the gedit text editor .
Simply add your driver in an empty line below the existing drivers , save the file , exit the text editor , and reboot for the change to take effect .
That 's all !
Here 's an example of a modules .conf file for a Kubuntu Linux , installed as a virtual machine .
To add a new driver , we would simply write its name below the existing entries .
Of course , you need to know the EXACT name of the driver in question .
The third option is a bit more complex .
Loading drivers
You have successfully compiled the driver , but nothing has happened yet .
This is because the driver is not yet enabled .
Looking inside the directory , you will notice a file with . ko extension .
This is your driver and you need to manually load it .
We need to install the driver into the kernel .
This can be done using the insmod command .
cd driver_directory
insmod driver .ko
After the driver is loaded , it can be configured .
To verify that the driver is indeed present , you can list all the available modules :
lsmod
If by some chance you have made a terrible mistake and you wish to remove the driver , you can use the rmmod command :
rmmod
Configuration of drivers
Configuring the driver requires a bit of knowledge into its functionality .
Most often , instructions will be included in the how - to text files .
Below , the example demonstrates how the network card is configured after the network driver is loaded .
The network card is assigned an identifier and an IP address .
In this particular case , eth0 was the selected device name , although it could be also eth1 , eth2 or any the name .
The assigned IP address tells us the machine will be part of a LAN network .
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.9
After a reboot , you will realize that you no longer enjoy a network connection .
This is because your driver has not been created in a common default directory and the system does not know where to look for it .
You will have to repeat the entire procedure again :
cd driver_directory
insmod driver .ko
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.9
You now realize that an automated script would be an excellent idea for solving this problem .
This is exactly what we 're going to do - write a script and add it to bootup .
Scripts
Like in DOS and Windows , scripts can be written in any text editor .
However , special changes are needed to separate between text files and scripts .
In the Windows department , simply renaming the .txt extension to . bat will convert the file to a script .
In Linux , things are a bit different .
Linux command line lives inside a shell - or more precisely Shell .
There are several Shells , each with a unique set of commands .
The most common ( and default ) Linux Shell is the BASH .
We need to add this information to our script , if we wish to make it communicate with our Shell .
Therefore , the above commands +
Shell addition will make the following script :
#!/bin/bash
cd driver_directory
insmod driver .ko
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.9
We can also make it shorter :
#!/bin/bash
insmod /home / roger/driver_directory/driver.ko
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.9
Now , we have a script .
Or rather a text file that contains the relevant commands .
We need to make it into an executable file .
First , we need to save the file .
Let 's call it network_script .
To make the script executable :
chmod +x network_script
Now we have a real script .
We need to place it in the /etc / init.d directory so that it will be run during bootup .
cp network_script
/etc/init.d/
And finally , we need to update the system , so it will take our script into consideration .
update - rc.d network_script defaults
After you reboot , you will realize that your driver loads automatically and that your network card is configured !
Alternatively , it is possible that the make install of the driver will place in the default directory :
/lib/modules /<KERNEL
VERSION>/kernel/drivers/net/driver.ko
Or you could place the driver in this directory by yourself .
This way , you will be able to avoid the step of writing the script .
However , my method , even if not the most elegant one , has one advantage : Drivers that you have manually compiled and placed into the default directories will be lost every time you update the kernel .
This means you will have to reinstall them again after every such update .
My method un-elegantly escapes this problem .
Mounting a drive
If you run a dual - boot system , it is entirely possible that you have installed your Linux before you have formatted all the Windows drives .
This means that some of these drives might not be mounted - or accessible - when you 're booted in Linux .
Alternatively , you might have formatted the drives , but you have resized and relettered and renamed the partitions and they are no longer recognized by Linux .
Furthermore , you just might be unlucky and your Linux refuses to see the drives despite your best efforts .
Finally , you might be able to see them , but you cannot write to the NTFS drives and this irks you so .
Compared to the above tasks , mounting drives is a simple job .
To be able to do this correctly , you need to know how your drives are ordered and what they are called , both in Windows and Linux .
This requires that you be able to correlate between Windows partitions ( E:\ , G:\ , K : \ etc. ) and Linux partitions ( hda1 , hda4 , hdb2 etc. ) .
First , make sure you know the order of your partitions in Windows .
Then , when booted in Linux , list the Partition Tables :
fdisk -l
The above command will display all the available partitions on your system .
In this example , you see only the Linux partitions present , but there might be other ( Windows ) partitions .
For the sake of this exercise , let 's assume that Linux partitions are hda4 - 6 , while Windows partitions are hda1 - 3 .
Namely :
hda1 will be Windows C:\ drive .
will be drive .
hda2 will be Windows F:\ drive - also called Data .
will be drive - also called .
hda3 will be Windows G:\ drive - also called Games .
will be drive - also called .
hda4 will be Linux swap / Solaris .
will be .
hda5 will be Linux ( your / root ) .
will be ( your ) . hda6 will be Linux ( your / home ) .
Now , before you mount a drive , you need to create a mount point .
This is most conveniently done by assigned a directory within the / media directory .
For example :
mkdir / media/ data
The name data is arbitrary , but it can help relate the mounted drive to its Windows designation .
Now , we need to mount the drive that corresponds to data .
In our case , this is hda2 .
There are several ways of mounting the drive .
By default , NTFS partitions are mounted as read - only , although write access can also be enabled .
FAT32 partitions are writable by default .
Like before , mounting the drive only once will hold valid for the current session .
After reboot , the changes will be lost .
Therefore , we need to add the mounting of the relevant partitions to the boot chain .
The configuration file that holds this crucial information is called fstab and is located under /etc ( / etc/fstab ) .
Therefore , in order to mount the NTFS drive ( Windows F :\ drive called data ) as read - only we need to :
Create a directory called data within / media .
within .
Backup fstab .
.
Add a new line to the fstab file - that will mount the NTFS drive hda2 ( Windows F:\ - data ) as read - only .
mkdir / media/ data
cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
gedit /etc/fstab
After opening the file in the text editor , we need to add the mount command .
NTFS read - only :
/ dev/hda2 /media/data ntfs nls=utf8, umask=0222 0 0
The necessary commands , as well as procedures are well - documented in the Unofficial Ubuntu 6.10 ( Edgy Eft ) Starter Guide .
Here , you can see the sample fstab file inside Kate text editor , for Kubuntu Linux .
Other options
Alternatively , if you have partitions formatted with FAT32 file system or you wish to be able to write to NTFS partitions from within Linux , you can use the following commands :
FAT32 read / write :
/ dev/hda2 /media/data vfat iocharset=utf8 , umask=000 0 0
NTFS read / write - requires installation of software that can write to NTFS drives .
apt - get install ntfs - 3g
/ dev/hda1 /media/data ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0
An exercise : Let 's assume we wish to be able to write to NTFS partition C , read - only NTFS partition F and use FAT32 partition G .
In that case , the list of commands that we need to execute is :
apt - get install ntfs - 3g
mkdir / media / windows
mkdir / media/data
mkdir / media / games
cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
gedit /etc/fstab
ADD FOLLOWING LINES TO FSTAB
/ dev/hda1 /media/windows ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0
/ dev/hda2 /media/data ntfs nls=utf8, umask=0222 0 0
/ dev/hda3 /media/games vfat iocharset=utf8 , umask=000 0 0
Installation of graphic card drivers
Please note that commands used in this subsection are for Nvidia drivers ONLY - I have several computers , ALL of which have Nvidia graphic cards - but some of the solutions presented work for both Nvidia and ATI cards .
Although I have already discussed the installation of graphic card drivers in my Installing SUSE Linux and Installing Kubuntu Linux articles , I think a bit of extra guidance will not hurt anyone .
Basically , you can install the graphic card drivers using a Package Manager or via the command line .
For most people , the first method should work flawlessly .
The first method is embodied in these two commands - the download of the required package and the installation of the driver :
apt - get install nvidia-glx
nvidia - glx - config enable
Some people might prefer to install the drivers manually , with the X Windows stopped .
To do this , you literally need to stop the desktop from running .
/etc/init.d/gdm stop
OR
/etc/init.d/kdm stop
OR
/etc/init.d/xdm stop
The desktop should vanish and be replaced with a command line .
You will probably need to login .
It is possible that you will only see a black screen and no command prompt .
Do not be alarmed !
Linux operating system usually has 7 virtual consoles .
The first six consoles provide a text terminal with a login prompt to a UNIX shell .
The 7th virtual console is used to start the X Windows .
In other words , it may occur that by stopping the X Windows you will have simply switched off the graphics AND remain in the 7th virtual console , therefore having no command line to work with .
All you need to do is switch to one of the text consoles by pressing Alt + F1 - 6 on the keyboard .
Now , you need to install your driver :
sh NVIDIA -< DRIVER VERSION>.run
After the installation is complete , you should simply restart the X Windows .
/etc/init.d/gdm start
OR
/etc/init.d/kdm start
OR
/etc/init.d/xdm start
If you see an Nvidia splash logo , it means the driver has been successfully installed .
Reboot your machine just to make sure .
This is where you might encounter a problem .
Instead of the Nvidia logo , you will see an error message indicating that the X Server has been disabled and that you need to manually edit the settings in the xorg .
conf file before being able to proceed to the desktop .
Now , there are many possible reasons for such an error and trying to provide a general solution is impossible .
However , I have found the following argument to hold true for many cases :
If you have setup your Linux distribution using the GUI installer , you will have probably used the default configurations and the generic kernel will have been installed .
I this case , sometimes , the built - in Nvidia driver ( nv ) might interrupt with the installation .
There are two methods for solving this problem .
Method 1 : Alberto Milone 's envy package
Envy is a command - line application that will download the latest drivers for your card , clean up old drivers and install the new ones .
Instructions for the usage can be found below the download links .
Method 2 : Do it yourself
First , download the required driver .
Then , execute the following commands :
The offending built - in driver needs to be disabled .
gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
Change the last line to DISABLED_MODULES = " nv " .
This will prevent the built - in driver from loading and interrupting with your own installed driver .
Now , you should remove all conflicting files from your system :
apt - get install linux - headers - `uname - r` build - essential gcc gcc-3.4 xserver - xorg - dev
apt - get -- purge remove nvidia - glx nvidia - settings nvidia - kernel - common
rm /etc/init.d/nvidia-*
After the offenders are removed , you should install the drivers from the command line :
/etc/init.d/gdm stop
sh NVIDIA -< DRIVER VERSION>.run
nvidia - xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals
/etc/init.d/gdm start
Again , you should see the Nvidia splash logo .
Reboot just to make sure there are no more surprises .
This should get you up and running with the latest graphic card driver .
Network sharing
If you have more than one computer , you are probably sharing resources among them .
There is no reason why you should not continue doing this if one of the machines is running a Linux distribution .
Sharing can be accomplished in many ways .
Perhaps the simplest is using Samba server .
First , install Samba :
apt - get install samba
After the Samba server is installed , you will need to edit a few options in the configuration file to allow sharing privileges .
cp /etc/samba/smb.conf
/etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf
In the configuration file , you will need to setup a number of parameters :
workgroup = workgroup_name - the name of the Workgroup for your LAN ( e.g. HOME )
= workgroup_name - the name of the Workgroup for your LAN ( e.g. HOME ) netbios name = netbios_name - without spaces ; computer alias by which you will be able to call it across the network
= netbios_name - without spaces ; computer alias by which you will be able to call it across the network security = user
After saving the configuration file , you will have to restart the Samba server :
/etc/init.d/samba restart
Now , select a folder that you wish to share .
If you have ticked the option Writable , you will be able to modify the contents of this folder .
Finally , to be able to connect to this share from Windows , you will have to create a Samba user :
smbpasswd - a ' name '
Under ' name ' you should specify an existing UNIX user ( e.g. roger ) .
Do not forget the apostrophes !
You will be asked to create a password .
And finally , restart the Samba server again , for the changes to take effect .
Now , the sharing itself .
Very simple .
Windows >
Linux
Start > Run > \\xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
OR \
etbios_name
When asked for username and password , provide the Samba user name , e.g. roger and the relevant password .
And that 's it .
Browse to the shared folder .
If the shared folder is writable , you will be able to modify the contents .
Linux >
Windows
Press Alt + F2 .
This will bring up the Run Command window .
In the Command line , specify the IP address or the name of the computer that you wish to connect .
You can see an example below :
And that 's it .
Easy peasy lemon squeasy !
Printer sharing
Well now , folder and file sharing is really easy .
What about the printers ?
Again , it is very simple .
If you have a printer installed on a Windows machine , accessing it from a Linux machine will be easy .
The rougher side of the coin is accessing a printer installed on a Linux machine from a Windows machine .
First , you will have to allow your printer to be shared .
Backup and then edit the Common UNIX Printer System configuration file .
cp /etc/cups/cupds.conf
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf.bak
gedit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
In the file , search for the entry # Listen 127.0.0. 1:631 and add or change as follows :
# Listen 127.0.0.1:631 OR localhost :631
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:631 OR *:631
Listen / var/run/cups/cups.sock
CUPS listens on the port 631 .
If you use a static IP address for the Linux machine , you can specify only that IP .
Otherwise , you might need to use a wildcard .
Of course , you should be aware that an open port means a wee less security than before , so keep that in mind .
After saving the changes , you will have to restart CUPS :
/etc/init.d/ cupsys restart
Now that the printer is available , you will have to add it for the Windows machine .
Start > Settings > Printers and Faxes
File >
Add Printer
... A network printer , or a printer attached to another computer ...
... Connect to a printer on the Internet or on a home or office network ...
http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:631/printers/printer_name
OR
http://netbios_name:631/printers/printer_name
When prompted for the driver , either select from a list or install it from a disk ( like CD ) .
And that 's it !
You can now print from a Windows machine on a printer connected to a Linux machine .
Tip :
If you are using a Lexmark printer , you will probably not be able to find the right Linux drivers for your printer .
Worry not !
Using generic drivers for Hewlett Packard printers will work remarkably well .
Other useful commands
Here 's a tiny sampling of some other useful tools that you might want to know .
Be aware that the commands are presented in a generic way only .
A variety of options ( switches ) can be used in conjunction with many of the commands to make their usage far more complex and effective .
Switching between runlevels
init 0 - 6
OR
telinit 0 - 6
Backing up the X Windows configuration file
cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
Sometimes , you may need or want to configure the X Windows manually :
dpkg - reconfigure xserver-xorg
Display system environment information
cat / proc / cpuinfo
You can use the cat ( concatenate ) command , which will print the contents of the files into the terminal .
To display the CPU parameters :
To display the memory parameters :
cat / proc / meminfo
To find the version of your kernel and the GCC compiler :
cat / proc/version
Furthermore , to find out the version of your kernel :
uname -r
Listing information about files and folders
This command is the equivalent of the DOS dir command .
ls
To display hidden files as well ( starting with dot ) .
ls -a
Kill a process
Sometimes , you may start an application ... only it does not really start .
So you try again .
But this time , your distro informs you that the process is already running .
This can also happen in Windows .
Sometimes , processes remain open and need to be killed .
Before you can kill a process , you need to know its ID .
The command below will list all running processes :
ps -elf
Then , kill the offending process by its ID .
kill PID
Alternatively , you can kill a process by its name .
The below command will terminate all processes with the corresponding name ( or names ) .
killall process_name
Conclusion
Well , that 's it , for now .
Hopefully you have learned something .
If you have had problems with your software installations , compilation from sources , drivers , partitions , and sharing , this article may have helped you overcome some of the problems .
Personally , the above tips cover about 90 % of tasks that a normal user would have to confront as a part of his / her daily usage .
Is n't Linux so much fun ?
Well , have fun tweaking .

The new io library needs some serious profiling and optimization work .
I 've already fixed a severe slowdown in _fileio .
FileIO 's read buffer allocation algorithm ( #4533 ) .
More profiling tests have shown a speed problem in write ( ) files opened in text mode .
For example three str.count ( ) calls are taking up 20 % of the time .
The str.count calls can be replaced with an optimized C function that returns the count of ( \r
,
, \r ) in one pass instead of three passes .
msg77117 - ( view ) Author : David M. Beazley ( beazley ) Date : 2008-12-06 12:30
I 've done some profiling and the performance of reading line - by - line is considerably worse in Python 3 than in Python 2 .
For example , this code : for line in open ( " somefile.txt " ) : pass Ran 35 times slower in Python 3.0 than Python 2.6 when I tested it on a big text file ( 100 Megabytes ) .
If you disable Unicode by opening the file in binary mode , it runs even slower .
This slowdown is really unacceptable for anyone who uses Python for parsing big non-Unicode text files ( and I would claim that there are many such people ) .

Here is a patch againt the py3 k branch that reduces the time for the line ending detection from 0.55s to 0.22s for a 50 MB file on my test system .
msg77124 - ( view ) Author : David M. Beazley ( beazley ) Date : 2008-12-06 13:42
Tried this using projects / python / branches / release30 - maint and using the patch that was just attached .
With a 66MB input file , here are the results of this code fragment : for line in open ( " BIGFILE ) : pass Python 2.6 : 0.67s Python 3.0 : 32.687s ( 48 times slower )
This is running on a MacBook with a warm disk cache .
For what it 's worth , I did n't see any improvement with that patch .
msg77125 - ( view ) Author : David M. Beazley ( beazley ) Date : 2008-12-06 13:45
Just as one other followup , if you change the code in the last example to use binary mode like this : for line in open ( " BIG " , " rb " ) : pass
You get the following results : Python 2.6 : 0.64s Python 3.0 : 42.26s ( 66 times slower )

I 'm getting caught - up with the IO changes in 3.0 and am a bit confused .
The PEP says , " programmers who do n't want to muck about in the new I /O world can expect that the open ( ) factory method will produce an object backwards - compatible with old - style file objects . "
So , I would have expected that the old implementation could have remained in - place and the resultant object registered as matching the appropriate IO ABC .
If that had been done , the performance would be unchanged .
Does anyone know why the entire old implementation had to be thrown - out in cases where the API was unchanged ?
Is there anything about New IO that is fundamentally different so that the old implementation had to be tossed in all cases ?
msg77896 - ( view ) Author : Amaury Forgeot d'Arc ( amaury.forgeotdarc ) * Date : 2008-12-16 08:55
The previous implementation only returns bytes and does not translate newlines .
For this particular case , indeed , the plain old FILE * based object is faster .
msg77900 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-12-16 13:19
I seem to recall one of the design principles of the new IO stack was to avoid relying on the C stdlib 's buffered API , which has too many platform - dependant behaviours .
In any case , binary reading has acceptable performance in py3 k ( although 3 x - 4 x slower than in 2.x ) , it 's text I / O which is truely horrendous .
msg77901 - ( view ) Author : Raymond Hettinger ( rhettinger ) * Date : 2008-12-16 13:26
I do n't agree that that was a worthy design goal .
Tons of code ( incl the old CPython successfully used the stdlib functions ) .
IMO , a 3 x or 4 x falloff for binary reads / writes is a significant disincentive for adopting Py3.0 .
For binary reads / writes , I would like to see the open ( ) factory function return the old , fast object instead to trying to slowly simulate it without adding any benefits noticeable to an end -user .
IMO , it 's a case of practicality beating purity .
msg77903 - ( view ) Author : David M. Beazley ( beazley ) Date : 2008-12-16 13:47
I agree with Raymond .
For binary reads , I 'll go farther and say that even a 10 % slowdown in performance would be surprising if not unacceptable to some people .
I know that as hard as it might be for everyone to believe , there are a lot of people who crank lots of non- Unicode data with Python .
In fact , Python 2.X is pretty good at it .
It 's fine that text mode now uses Unicode , but if I do n't want that , I would certainly expect the binary file modes to run at virtually the same speed as Python 2 ( e.g. , okay , they work with bytes instead of strings , but is the bytes type really all that different from the old Python 2 str type ? ) .
msg77904 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-12-16 13:50
> I do n't agree that that was a worthy design goal .
I do n't necessarily agree either , but it 's probably too late now .
The py3 k buffered IO object has additional methods ( e.g. peek ( ) , read1 ( ) ) which can be used by upper layers ( text IO ) and so can't be replaced with the old 2.x file object .
In any case , Amaury has started rewriting the IO lib in C ( * ) and getting good binary IO performance should n't be too difficult . (*)

But " cranking data " implies you 'll do something useful with it , and therefore spend CPU time doing those useful things ( likely much more CPU time than you spent read ( ) ing the data in the first place ) .
In any case , you can try to open your file in unbuffered mode : open ( " foobar " , " rb " , buffering=0 ) it will bypass the Python buffering layer and will go directly to the raw C unbuffered object .

No .
It 's a bit more limited , does n't support autoconversion to / from unicode , but that 's all .

Good luck with that .
Most people who get bright ideas such as " gee , maybe I 'll write my own version of X " where " X " is some part of the standard C library pertaining to I/O , end up fighting a losing battle .
Of course , I 'd love to be proven wrong , but I do n't think I will in this case .
As for cranking data , that does not necessarily imply heavy - duty CPU processing .
Someone might be reading large datafiles simply to perform some kind of data extraction , filtering , minor translation , or other operation that is easily carried out in Python , but where the programs are still I /O bound .
For example , the kinds of processing one might otherwise do using awk , sed , perl , etc .

David : Amaury 's work is going to be a part of the standard library as soon as his work is done .
I 'm confident that we can reach the old speed of the 2.x file type by carefully moving code to C modules .

I wish I shared your optimism about this , but I do n't .
Here 's a short explanation why .
The problem of I/O and the associated interface between hardware , the operating system kernel , and user applications is one of the most fundamental and carefully studied problems in all of computer systems .
The C library and its associated I/O functionality provide the user - space implementation of this interface .
However , if you peel the covers off of the C library , you 're going to find a lot of really hairy stuff in there .
Examples might include : 1 . Low - level optimization related to the system hardware ( processor architecture , caching , I / O bus , etc. ) .
2 . Hand - written finely tuned assembly code .
3 . Low - level platform - specific system calls such as ioctl( ) .
4 . System calls related to shared memory regions , kernel buffers , etc. ( i.e. , optimizations that try to eliminate buffer copies ) .
5 . Undocumented vendor - specific " proprietary " system calls ( i.e. , unknown " magic " ) .
So , you 'll have to forgive me for being skeptical , but I just do n't think any programmer is going to sit down and bang out a new implementation of buffered I / O that is going to match the performance of what 's provided by the C library .
Again , I would love to be proven wrong .

[...]
Although I agree all this is important , I 'd challenge the assumption it has its place in the buffered IO library rather than in lower - level layers ( i.e. kernel & userspace unbuffered IO ) .
In any case , it will be difficult to undo the current design decisions ( however misguided they may or may not be ) of the py3 k IO library and we 'll have to make the best out of them !

In 1966 , a toy company in Newark , New Jersey released a children ’s record called Batman and Robin to cash in on the popular TV series .
The music on the LP was credited to “ The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale , ” but in fact the band was one of the greatest uncredited session combos of all time , including the core of Sun Ra ’s Arkestra and Al Kooper ’s Blues Project .
‘ Dan and Dale ’ were actually blues guitarist Danny Kalb and Steve Katz ( later of Blood , Sweat & Tears ) on dueling guitars , while Sun Ra and Al Kooper take over organ duties ( a Hammond B - 3 ) and members of Ra ’s Arkestra play sax .
To keep the music licensing fees to a minimum , all the tracks were based on public domain items like Chopin ’s Polonaise Op. 53 , the horn theme from Tchaikovsky ’s Fifth Symphony and the love theme from Romeo and Juliet , and generic rock riffs .
It ’s all instrumental , with the exception of the very funky Robin ’s
Theme , featuring an uncredited vocalist .
Other titles include : ‘ The Batman Theme Song ’ , ‘ The Penguin Chase ’ , and ‘ The Batcave ’. ( via WMFU.com )

Bernanke and Company , who are running the U.S. central bank , the Federal Reserve ( Fed ) , have been very busy in the past year or so .
The size of the bank has more than doubled since August of 2007 .
Their assets , mainly loans and credits they extend , have exploded from $ 902.4 billion to $ 2.17 trillion as of December 3 , 2008 .
The main idea behind all this lending is to prevent some large banks ( and other financial institutions ) from failing , shrinking , or restructuring .
Behind this is the goal of maintaining the existing structure of banking and central banking .
And behind that is the goal of maintaining government power and the existing political structure intact .
Preventing economic collapse and maintaining the bank lending to the public are not the central goals of those who understand these matters .
These are important to the knowledgeable authorities only insofar as they support the goal of maintaining the existing power structure .
There are , of course , ignorant economists who think that without government intervention , the economic and financial system cannot survive and we will all be wandering around in bearskins with spears .
However , if the financial and economic system were to collapse and if the government and Fed did not interfere , a free market revival would occur with amazing rapidity .
After all , the people , the labor , the land , and the capital goods are still here , not bombed out .
If Tokyo , Hiroshima , Nagasaki , Berlin , and Dresden could rapidly recover after World War II , so can a freed - up U.S. economy .
From this perspective , keeping the economy going is not per se what is important to those in power , because the economy will always keep itself going without these authorities and do a better job of it at that without them .
What is important to them is keeping the existing economy going in that it is tied in to the existing power structure .
The alternative course of events is anathema to the Fed and the government .
That course is to change the financial system at its roots and let alternative means of finance and financial intermediation arise spontaneously in a free market .
That would spell the end of the Fed ’s monopoly over the forced currency in the U.S.
If this were to happen , every country in the entire world would have to follow suit if their economies were to survive and prosper , and that would mean a large diminution in government power and a fundamentally changed role for governments everywhere .
The public has given a vote of no confidence in many of these banks ( and other firms ) by shifting its assets out of loans to them and instead going into Treasury bills .
The Fed is thwarting the public ( and any semblance of a free market ) by making the loans that the public refuses to make .
The Treasury is helping the Fed do this .
After selling Treasury bills to the public to meet the increased demand , it is depositing huge amounts ( $ 440 — $ 500 billion ) at the Fed .
The Fed is using that money to make the loans that the public is refusing to make .
The battle here is between the public and the government .
The battle is economic for the public , but for the government the battle is political ; and it does not admit defeat in these battles .
The government instituted and maintained the New Deal , despite its baleful economic effects .
Although the New Deal measures never resolved the Great Depression and , in fact , extended its life , there was a countervailing and far more important political consideration for the government , which was that the depression was a golden opportunity to put in place measures and gain powers and controls over the economy that it wanted to .
The kinds of loans the Fed has made as compared with a year ago include the following .
The Fed has exchanged $ 406.5 billion of Treasury securities for troubled bank loans ( called the TAF or Term Auction Facility . )
It has swapped $ 542.5 billion for foreign currencies .
The AIG loan is about $ 56 billion .
Another $ 52 billion is for asset - backed commercial paper associated with money market mutual funds and $ 57 billion has gone to primary government bond dealers .
Then there is $ 297.8 for commercial paper loans .
The Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( $ 700 — 800 billion ) or TARP for short is a separate deal .
New kinds of loans , not yet on the books , but slated to appear include the following .
On November 25 , 2008 the Fed announced $ 200 billion in loans for student loans , auto loans , credit card loans , and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ( called TALF for Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility . )
On the same date , it announced that it will lend $ 100 billion directly to the government ’s mortgage lending companies ( Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the Federal Home Loan Banks . )
It will also be buying $ 500 million of the mortgage - backed securities that they package up from the mortgage loans that they buy from banks and other institutions who originate mortgage loans .
The idea is to keep these government operations going .
Without this support and the other support the Treasury already has given , they ’d fail .
As a reminder , the government took over some $ 5 trillion of debts and guarantees of these government - sponsored enterprises .
The Fed announced on November 23 , 2008 that it ( along with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC ) will support $ 306 billion of loans that Citibank holds " against the possibility of unusually large losses . "
The Fed announced that it " stands ready to backstop residual risk " in this $ 306 billion pool of bad loans through a non-recourse loan .
The idea is to keep Citibank in operation and prevent its failure .
On October 7 , 2008 the Fed stepped up its Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) from $ 150 billion to $ 900 billion .
And even more is to follow .
The press reports that the Fed is considering still more " unconventional steps . "
The Wall Street Journal writes of efforts to bring down interest rates on mortgages , consumer loans , and Treasury bonds .
In other words , the Fed is preparing to monetize debts directly , something that is clearly inflationary and that it has been trying to avoid , despite its exploding balance sheet that has hyped up bank reserves enormously and already carries a huge inflation risk .
The Treasury announced that it is considering a plan to subsidize mortgage interest rates at 4.5 percent .
Every new loan is a sign that the powers - that - be will not let up in their efforts to revive the economy on their terms .
In order for them to keep and hold power within this system , which is their perspective , they see no other choice .
The Federal government is preparing to spend far greater sums than now , in the process expanding its deficits to unimaginable heights .
The Fed seems unworried by that and / or prepared dutifully to monetize a goodly share of those debts .
The public is attempting to reduce debt and save , but the government is thwarting that by planning to increase its debt .
High debt is the hallmark of the political economy of a strong national government .
In 2007 and 2008 , the Fed is doing what the Reichsbank did in 1931 .
We can understand what is happening and what is going to happen by examining the Reichsbank case .
A 1934 article by Dr. Heinrich Rittershausen , available here , describes the actions of the German Reichsbank
They provide a striking parallel to the actions of the Fed .
All quotes are from his article .
Unlike our Fed , which has very broad and far - reaching powers , the Reichsbank was restricted by law to discount only good commercial bills .
It could not legally discount other credits , called " financial " bills .
" Contrary to these provisions , the Reichsbank , since the credit crisis of 1931 , discounted financial bills to the amount of 2,000 million marks …
These financial bills were accepted in order to maintain the solvency of the illiquid credit banks which had gone too far with the deposit system .
In this case the Reichsbank did not grant advances on the proceeds of sales , but took over the illiquid assets of the leading banks and of the savings banks , assets which do not liquidate themselves but require continuous prolongation …
In addition , the Bank granted long - term credits to the amount of 1,300 million marks to municipalities and their savings banks …
Moreover , the Bank neglected everything necessary for ensuring the disappearance of the illegal and dangerous financial bill money and re-establishing legal conditions . "
The Fed has far greater legal powers than the Reichsbank had to accept the troubled assets of any company or financial institution .
The point here is not the legality of the matter .
It is the action of both banks in taking in large amounts of long - term illiquid paper of questionable value and providing good assets and / or central bank credits in return .
The Fed ’s TAF ( $ 406 billions worth and slated to rise to $ 900 billion ) is the name for the Fed ’s counterpart of what the Reichsbank did .
As in 1931 , there is no plan in place to wind down these assets .
They require " continuous prolongation . "
Rittershausen writes : " The Reichsbank , temporarily the largest mortgage bank , for lack of a sound banking system , prevents the re-employment of the workless . "
The Fed ’s $ 600 billion program to support the mortgage market probably makes it into the largest mortgage banker in the U.S .
The main point , again , is that the Fed is doing what the Reichsbank did .
For Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and other insolvent banks with mortgage loans that have fallen from a price of 100 to a price of 80 or 70 or 50 or 30 , the solution spurned has been bankruptcy and re-organization of the companies .
Bankruptcy brings the actual market value of these mortgages to light .
It allows re-organization , which then allows the market to resuscitate .
The existing uncertainties fade away .
A fair solution is to allow mortgagees to repurchase their mortgage at the ( reduced ) market prices .
That requires that they re-finance their loans from new lenders .
New and free market channels of financial intermediation are precisely what are needed .
The Fed and the government do not want this , and with very little prodding they induce weak banks to join their relief programs .
The managements of insolvent banks prefer to remain in place .
They do not want to recognize losses and go out of business .
They welcome the succor of the U.S. government and the Fed .
Now joined by automakers , the parade will soon lengthen to include many other firms and municipalities .
" The Reichsbank thus came to the rescue of tottering banks , and this suggested that the State was behind them .
This " quasi - State guarantee " led the population , when the crisis was at its height , to withdraw their balances from the sound banks … "
The withdrawal of the population ’s balances from sound banks finds its parallel today in the withdrawal of money from money market funds , certificates of deposit , commercial paper , and municipal securities .
Interbank lending declines .
Much of this money then seeks the safe haven of U.S.
Treasury securities , whose yields then fall even as the yields on debts with default risk rise .
According to Rittershausen , the Reichsbank and the Government " aided the unsound banks with approximately 2,000 million marks in subventions and tax money .
In this way they offered a masked State guarantee to the unsound banks and indirectly deprived the sound banks of their customers .
They declared that u2018 Germany ’s ’ credit was at stake ; that u2018 Germany ’ had contracted the debts ; that a u2018run on Germany ’ had broken out ; whilst actually only the credit of a few ill - managed banks with bank debts abroad had been shaken …
Thus thousands of banks and bank branches were sacrificed to save a few who were in the good books of the State …
In fact , the three unsound banks were identified with the u2018 German banking system . ’ "
The parallel actions today are that the Fed and the Government cry " systemic risk . "
They feed the public with exaggerated scenarios about credit default swaps bringing down the financial system .
( A rational account of credit default swaps appears here . )
They cry " too big to fail , " and they argue that the health of the entire American system rests upon the failure of a few favored banks and insurance companies like AIG .
They completely ignore freeing up the financial system to mobilize new methods of creating money and credit .
The government has thrown about $ 6 trillion into the stew .
The Fed has thrown over $ 1 trillion into it .
Instead of a short and sharp recession followed by a recovery , our central bank and deficit - spending political economy is giving us a prolonged and deep depression .
Business is thrown into confusion and uncertainty .
Investors run for safety .
The bad loans remain hidden and submerged within banks and other institutions .
This paralyzes lending .
The weak companies and poor managements that should be quickly cleaned out instead are given taxpayer money .
With public debt rising , the interest costs of the national debt rise .
Capital that should be going to healthy enterprises is diverted to government and to zombie enterprises .
Inefficient enterprises are subsidized .
Serious inflation looms larger and larger as a long - term problem .
The capital markets become dependent on Fed loans , and it is not clear how that dependence can be ended .
The government takes ownership interests in the most major banks , inducing further inefficiency in these semi-nationalized firms and threatening control of the allocation of capital .
In this regard , the government policies have already fostered an undue concentration of assets in large banks .
The three largest banks in the U.S. now have 38 % of all large bank assets as compared with 27 % in 2003 .
Banks with over $ 300 million in assets grew by 64 % in the last 5 years , which is a very high per annum number , but the three largest banks grew by a still higher 130 % .
In short , the actions of the government and the Fed are throwing a giant monkey wrench into the operations of banks and capital markets in intermediating capital from savers to businesses .
The likely result is a prolonged slowdown in economic growth and more government control over the economy .
What needs to be done ?
The main thing is to end the reign of forced currency such as the Fed’s .
This will ensure that inflation and deflation cannot ever occur because these are both results of a forced currency .
With competition in money , any issuer that issues too much currency will suffer a loss in value of the currency .
That will , however , be a local matter and not affect the entire economy as a forced currency does .
Without central bank — engineered inflations and deflations , the large - scale and widespread business cycles will be greatly mitigated and may even disappear , although business fluctuations and failures will no doubt still occur .
If there is too little currency , competition will ensure that more will be produced .
We need not worry about the supply of money anymore than we worry about the supply of corn flakes .
Money supply and credit are only problems when monopoly central banks attempt to control them , for they have no known ways of measuring what they are , how much is needed , where it is needed , or who should get it .
These kinds of questions are always ideally solved by free markets .
There will always be a need for standards of value in which to express prices .
Let the free market decide the matter by competition .
Persons have a right to try out any standard of value they wish to .
It is highly likely that gold will become a medium of account ( a standard of value ) , which would mean that media of exchange would be quoted in terms of fixed amounts of gold .
For example , the " dollar " might come to be standardized at 1.5 grains of gold .
( The Constitution empowers the government to set such a standard of value . )
With an end to a single Fed forced currency , there can be any number of media of exchange .
Any person or persons has the right to issue currency .
In a free market , every person has a right to conclude contracts with any medium of exchange that is agreeable to the parties to the contract .
No one should be obligated to pay in gold involuntarily .
Legal tender laws that force acceptance of payment in any medium should be repealed .
The harmful policies and actions of the central banks and the government in response to recessions , such as occurred in the 1930s and are occurring now , are , in a deep sense , not " policy errors " or " policy mistakes . "
That language suggests that there exists a set of correct policies under the existing political structure that will resolve economic problems .
That is a misleading way to think about the issue .
The policies that central banks and governments choose are nearly always what these institutions do by law , under the generally - held expectation that they will alleviate economic problems .
Occasionally a wise and beneficent ruler comes along who , within the system , mitigates its evil actions .
Usually , the really important and fundamental policy errors lie buried elsewhere .
The deepest policy errors are lodged in the public ’s expectation and belief that central banks and governments can alleviate recessions and in the public ’s giving these organizations the legal power to do what they do ( or tolerating their power grabs ) .
Further errors lie in listening to mistaken experts who continue to justify these counterproductive methods and laws , and in failing to learn from experience that the policies that central banks and governments use to fight recessions make them worse and turn them into deeper recessions and depressions .
Within the current political setup , central bankers would have to stop being central bankers and legislators would have to stop being legislators in order to play a constructive role in recessions .
( While this can happen and sometimes does happen for short periods , it is not the equilibrium outcome . )
The public would have to stop believing in the magical powers of central bankers and legislators to get economies going , using their usual nostrums of borrowing , spending , subsidizing , taxing , and printing money .
The public and government officials would have to stop listening to the many economic experts who are selling Keynesianism .
Subsidizing mortgage rates at 4.5 percent so that more people can go into more debt to buy homes and hold up home prices would have to be laughed off the stage as the kind of bankrupt economic manipulation that got us into this mess in the first place .
The public would have to stop running to government for its favors , and the politicians would have to lose the power to sell these favors .
But if all of this is to change , it means that the basic political arrangement has to change .
To change matters fundamentally , various leopards have to change their spots .
A revolution in ideas needs to occur .
Government power has to be seen as inherently inimical to society , for it is the very existence of that power that ensures its attraction to the public and its use .
The public has to stop looking for free lunches where there are none .
It has to stop believing in government as the tooth fairy .
The public has to stop believing in a government that , again and again , augments its own position and power while pretending to fight recessions with methods that make matters worse and lay the groundwork for more booms and busts .
The public has to understand that its welfare is best assured by building upon the liberty - promoting ideas that circulated at the time of the American Revolution .
That revolution was won on the battlefields and lost in the State House in Philadelphia in 1787 and thereafter .
The public needs to understand what its rights are and that they are being immensely abridged by government .
It needs to know that restoration and augmentation of these rights is the only proper course to take and the only course that promises a lasting and bountiful prosperity .
This is a tall order .
The problem is educational in part .
The problem is also a social coordination problem .
If we all reject big government together , we all generally benefit while some interest groups lose their goodies ; but no one knows how to coordinate this transition .
It sometimes occurs , however , as when the U.S.S.R. fell .
And sooner or later , American politics will come in for a radical restructuring .
The outcomes of that will be better if we now converse and educate each other continually in these matters .
We need to entertain concepts that seem radical today but were not radical to those who fought for and articulated the ideals of American independence .
Better to consider these matters now than when the system is collapsing around our ears .

AquaDOM - King size fishtank
by yogesh
This tank is n’t for the everyday hallway , or living room centre piece .
What your looking at is 6 storey high , has water enough for a whale to live in maybe two even .
This is n’t a science experiment , it ’s a breathtaking centre piece for The Radisson SAS Hotel in Berlin .
Its 25 meters ( 80 feet ) high 11 metres in diameter , contains 1 million liters ( 260,000 gallons ) of salt water , and is home to 2,500 fish ( 56 species in all ) .
There ’s also a glass elevator that goes up the middle if you want to swim with the fishes without getting wet .
Two full time divers are tasked with keeping the residents healthy and happy , which might sound like a fun job , but I bet they have to keep the glass clean as well .
In addition to being the largest cylindrical fish tank , the Aqua Dom is also the largest acrylic glass cylinder in the world , with a diameter of 11 meters .
The whole thing cost nearly 13 million euros back in 2003 , but you can book a fishtank - view room in the hotel for considerably less than that ( about 260 euros on a weekend ) .

General Motors has once again approached the federal government with its hand out .
It should not be forgotten that in September of 2008 , Congress gave the " big three " automakers a loan totaling $ 25 billion .
Now they are back .
This time they say that with a mere $ 50 billion they can turn things around and become profitable in the future .
The management of GM and Ford as well as the UAW have been meeting with Nancy Pelosi to arrange a deal .
GM claims that if the government does not give them the money they demand it will spell doom for the company and thus the entire US economy .
Let 's consider the impact of GM ceasing to exist — highly unlikely even if they declare bankruptcy .
Hypothetically , GM would close its doors and all 266,000 workers would be unemployed , never to find work again , or so GM would have the public believe .
GM maintains that it is really in the best interest of the country and economy to continue to support their failing business model .
After all , in what kind of a world would the government allow a company that employs 266,000 workers to fail ?
Descending into an abstract economics lesson about shifting resources to marginally more productive activities may be ineffective ; therefore , I will approach this issue from a more philosophical angle .
The basis of GM 's claim is essentially that they are too big or too important to fail due to their massive labor force .
But how massive is their labor force relative to other American companies ?
It may be surprising that the following companies employ a larger number of workers than GM : Target , AT&T , GE , IBM , McDonalds , Citigroup , Kroger , Sears , and Wal - Mart .
It is also worth noting that Home Depot , United Technologies , and Verizon all employ nearly as many workers as GM .
The question must be posed : Should the government bail out all 12 of these companies and , if so , at what cost ?
I doubt that if Wal - Mart , with their 2.1 million employees , went to the government or the American people and demanded a bailout that they would receive much sympathy , let alone money .
But if we are going to base worthiness of bailout on number of employees alone , then Wal - Mart is almost 7 times more worthy than GM .
( I have largely neglected Ford , whose executives are also demanding a bailout .
I believe that it is enough to simply state that Abercrombie & Fitch employs almost 7,000 more workers than does Ford .
Would the failure of Abercrombie & Fitch 's threaten the economy ?
I think not . )
It is unethical to force taxpayers to pay billions of dollars in order to bail out a company with a failing business model .
After all , they cannot even claim , as banks did , that it is an industry - wide problem .
Because if it were industry - wide , Toyota , Hyundai , Honda , Volkswagen , etc. would all be joining their American counterparts on Capitol Hill with their collective hands out .
For years GM and Ford have produced a product that consumers do not value as much as the product provided by their competitors .
Rather than changing their products or business model , they instead spent small fortunes on lobbyists .
If the government does bail out GM , rest assured that this will not be the last time .
But even if the government gives GM a check every week , there will come a time when no amount of government money will be enough to save them .
What is the best solution ?
In a word , bankruptcy .
By filing for bankruptcy protection , GM can escape the death grip the UAW has on the business .
Bankruptcy would allow for restructuring on an unprecedented scale .
There is a good chance that a highly competitive company could rise from the ashes of what we today call GM .
Even if GM itself was unable to survive bankruptcy , the resources freed from its grasp could be hugely beneficial to other automotive companies that make products that American consumers value more .
As taxpayers , we have a right to object to this misuse of our money .
Coming soon to U.S. , 1 million jobs lost every month : Report Stephen C. Webster
Published : Sunday December 7 , 2008
Print This Email This London - based GFC Economics is making a frightening prediction :
By spring 2009 , the United States could be facing more than 1 million layoffs every successive month .
Expenses related to corporate debt , and muddy credit markets consumed by fear , are driving a fast - approaching " hard landing , " claims a Sunday report in UK's Guardian .
" Corporate bond yields have rocketed since the credit crisis began as investors flee risky assets in search of safe havens such as US Treasuries .
That effectively means many firms are being forced to pay eye - watering interest rates to borrow funds , " the paper reported .
" November 's jobs figures were so much worse than analysts had expected that the Dow Jones share index actually rallied by 259 points , more than 3 per cent , as investors bet that Washington would have to launch a major new rescue package for the economy even before President - elect Barack Obama takes over the White House in January . "
Sunday morning , during an appearance on Meet the Press , President - elect Obama cautioned Americans that the crisis would only get worse before it begins to ease .
He also outlined a new stimulus package some senior Democrats have said could cost as much as $ 1 trillion .
" Mr. Obama refused to put a cost on the plan , but senior Democrats are talking about $ 700 billion , with others urging up to $ 1 trillion , " reported the Times Online .
" When he met the nations governors last week he was told that on the state level there was $ 136 billion worth of building projects ready to go if federal money was made available . "
David Frost , director - general of the British Chamber of Commerce , paints a grim deadline .
" The worry is that next year the job losses will be just horrendous , " he said .
" All sectors are taking the hit .
In the middle of the year it was construction and estate agencies .
Now it is services , the automotive industry , retailers .
Firms are waiting for Christmas and if they can't see any improvement they will cut their payrolls . "
A former guard at the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has spoken in his first television interview about the brutality he witnessed to inmates .

The Indian counterpart of the CIA , the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) , intercepted a cell phone call on November 18 to a number in Lahore , Pakistan , known to be that of a Lashkar - i Tayiba handler , saying that the caller was heading to Mumbai .
They later found the phone itself on a hijacked Indian fishing boat , which the attackers had taken over to camouflage their approach to the port .
The sole captured LeT operative , Kamal , is said by the Indian press to be from Faridkot village near Dipalpur Tahsil in Okara District of Pakistani Punjab , southwest of Lahore [ I saw one article , which I can no longer retrieve , in which the Indian press mispelled the tahsil or county as Gipalpur ] ) .
This is such a remote and little - known place that even Pakistani newspapers were having difficulty tracking it down ) .
Kamal is said to be telling Indian security that he and the others trained in camps in Pakistani Kashmir .
( The original princely state of Kashmir , largely Muslim , is divided , with one third in Pakistani hands and two - thirds in Indian ; India joined its portion to largely Hindu Jammu to create the province of Jammu and Kashmir . )
The Kashmir police have gotten good enough at counter - terrorism measures that elements of the LeT may have decided to go after a soft target such as Mumbai instead .
The story begins with the 1977 coup of Gen. Zia ul - Haqq , a Muslim fundamentalist who hanged his boss , PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , after overthrowing him .
Zia favored Sunni fundamentalists and introduced discriminatory policies against Pakistani Shiites , secularists , etc .
Then in 1979 the Soviet Red Army came into Afghanistan to prop up a shaky Communist junta .
Gen . Zia was suddenly America ’s man at the front lines of fighting the Soviets , and his Inter - Services Intelligence helped organize Afghan refugees in Pakistan to fight the Soviets .
The ISI favored the most radical fundamentalists among the Mujahideen , such as Gulbadin Hikmatyar , who led the Hizb - i Islami .
This model , of using private armies funded by black money ( generated by illegal arms or drug sales ) to “ roll back ” leftists , was being applied by Reagan in Nicaragua at the same time .
The military dictatorship was taking a lion ’s share of the Pakistani budget , and to whip up popular passions and make itself popular , it promoted the liberation of the rest of Muslim Kashmir from Hindu India as another major project alongside getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan .
( This is the language of the military ; actually India is a secular multicultural state , not a formally Hindu one ; and in opinion polls Kashmiris do not say they want to join Pakistan , though they would like independence ) .
A lot of Pakistanis probably did not care so much about Kashmir , having other problems in life ( and already worried about having to adopt 3 million Afghan refugees ) .
But the military in Pakistan constantly played on the public ’s emotions on the issue , as a way of justifying military perquisites .
( When British India was partitioned into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India in 1947 , Kashmir was the only Muslim - majority province to be successfully grabbed by India ; Pakistan insisted it should have gone to the Muslim state ; the UN insisted on a referendum , which was never held . )
The model that the Reagan administration pressed on the Pakistani military , of funding rightwing “ Islamic ” militias to kill Soviets , gradually became standard operating procedure .
But then the Pakistani Religious Right began adopting the model for themselves .
If it is all right to mobilize death squads in one righteous cause , why not in others ?
Emboldened , lower middle class Sunni hate groups grew up in rural areas such as Jhang Siyal , where Shiite Sufi leaders had been given big estates by premodern rulers and so were big landlords .
The Sipah-e Sahaba Pakistan ( SSP ) , formed in 1985 , was one such organization .
It turned to violence , killing Shiites .
Revivalist Deobandi clergy were important in its leadership .
I do n’t think Zia much cared if they killed Shiites .
Others , including elements in the Pakistani military began wondering why they should not apply the Reagan Jihad model to Kashmir .
And they did .
In the late 1980s , Hafiz Muhammad Said ( once a professor of engineering at Punjab University ) set up the Center for Mission and Guidance ( Markaz al - Da’wa wa al - Irshad ) in a huge compound at Muridke outside Lahore .
The Center soon established the Lashkar-e Tayiba as its paramilitary .
With the behind the scenes encouragement of elements in the Pakistani military , the LeT sent guerrillas into Indian Kashmir to attack Indian troops and facilities .
The Lashkar prided itself on not killing civilians , on not targeting Shiites , and on keeping its focus on what they thought of as the Indian occupation forces .
But they fought alongside Sipah-e Sahaba elements that also took off time from murdering Shiites to infiltrate into Indian Kashmir and stage attacks .
I saw this militarization of Pakistani civil society with my own eyes .
I first went to the country in 1981 before you could just buy a Kalashnikov in the bazaar .
When I was doing research there in 1988 and then again in 1990 , the situation was completely different .
Pakistan had never had a drug problem but now there were a million addicts ( the US encouraged the Afghan mujahidin to grow poppies for heroin to finance the anti-Soviet struggle , and the drugs spilled into Pakistan ) .
Weapons were freely available .
Karachi was having a kind of civil war .
I remember that fanatics from the religious right attacked an art exhibition in Lahore , a city of the arts ( graven images not allowed & etc. )
Political figures were accused of cynically creating Islamic movements for personal and political gain .
This deterioration of Pakistan was , in some important part , a direct result of Reagan - Bush policies .
They used Pakistan , corrupted it with all those drugs , arms , and radical Muslim militias that they called ‘ freedom fighters , ’ and then threw it away when they did not need it any more .
Reagan and the Saudis funneled billions to the Pakistani military .
What did ordinary Pakistanis have to show for it ?
When the Soviets withdrew in 1988 - 1989 from Afghanistan and the Mujahideen took over , the Pakistani military lost control of its northern neighbor .
It therefore funded and promoted the Taliban ( expatriate Afghan young men who had been through Deobandi seminaries in northern Pakistan ) from 1994 , enabling them to take over Afghanistan .
The Taliban ran terrorist training camps , at which the Sipah-e Sahaba and the Lashkar-e Tayiba trained for missions in Kashmir .
Afghanistan in essence was the boot camp for Pakistani Reaganism .
The SSP and the Lashkar-e Tayiba was joined by other Sunni militias , including the Movement of the Holy Warriors ( Harakat ul Mujahidin ) .
In 2000 , Mawlana Massoud Azhar broke off from the latter to form the Jaish-e Muhammad or Army of Muhammad , a particularly violent group focusing on Kashmir .
All these Pakistani organizations trained their fighters in the Taliban camps , some of which were actually run by al - Qaeda once Bin Laden allied with the latter in 1996 .
( It is said that the Inter - Services Intelligence made the introduction ) .
High Dudgeon of Americans directed at the Pakistani military for this activity is the height of hypocrisy .
The Reagan administration actively encouraged Islamabad to mount precisely such activities against the leftist government of Afghanistan ( which , while dictatorial and brutally oppressive , was busily educating girls , admitting women to professions , spreading literacy , working against the vestiges of landlord feudalism , etc. )
From a Pakistani point of view , Soviet - occupied Afghanistan and Indian - occupied Kashmir were morally equivalent .
In 2002 , under pressure from Washington , military dictator Pervez Musharraf dissolved the Lashkar-e Tayiba and other similar groups and initially arrested many members .
They were later released by the Pakistani courts on the grounds that they had n’t broken any Pakistani laws .
The dissolution was a bit of a farce , since the groups just took other names .
Someone who now has a prominent official position in the Pakistani government once wryly observed to me that the Musharraf government could n’t seem to find the Lashkar-e Tayib headquarters at Muridke just outside Lahore , even though it was huge and a well known landmark at which thousands gathered .
And , Lashkar went on raising money , supposedly for civilian relief works in Kashmir .
The Pakistani military is itself now suffering blowback for its past policies .
Its name is mud in Pakistan .
A Pakistani Taliban has emerged that often declines to be its puppet , and which has killed hundreds of Pakistani troops .
The Marriott in Islamabad was blown up by the Pakistani Taliban .
The cell that hit Mumbai was probably a rogue splinter group .
They completely disregarded the old Lashkar-e Tayiba concentration on hitting only Indian troops in Kashmir , targeting civilians instead .
It is very unlikely that anyone in the Pakistani military put them up specifically to this Mumbai operation .
This attack was much more likely to be blowback , when a covert operation produces unexpected consequences or agents that were previously reliable go rogue .
The Mumbai attacks were not the first of this scale on an Indian target by the LeT .
If the Pakistani government does not give up this covert terrorist campaign in Kashmir and does not stop coddling the radical vigilantes who go off to fight there , South Asian terrorism will grow as a problem and very possibly provoke the world ’s first nuclear war ( possible death toll : 20 million ) .
The civilian government that has recently taken over Pakistan is weak .
If it puts too much pressure on the military too quickly , it risks another coup and destabilization .
But the training camps in Azad Kashmir must be closed .
India , Pakistan , and the Obama administration need to do some serious diplomacy on Kashmir , and try to settle this major global fault line before the 10.0 earthquake finally hits .
Twelve times more than those that put their names to the IPCC report
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Dec 10 , 2008
Over 650 scientists have put their names to a US Senate Minority report that challenges the contention of the UN ’s International Panel on Climate Change that there is a scientific “ consensus ” on the causes of global warming .
Set to be released within the next 24 hours , the report features contributions from hundreds of prominent researchers , including current and former IPCC scientists , who are now speaking out in opposition of the UN ’s stance on climate change .
The Senate report is an updated version of a 2007 release , with over 250 more names added , highlighting how widespread dissent continues to grow in the scientific community to the alleged “ consensus ” that the modern warming is primarily man-made and is a crisis .
In comparison , twelve times fewer – just 52 scientists – participated in the much touted IPCC Summary for Policymakers meeting in April 2007 .
Climate scientists allied with the IPCC were recently caught citing fake data to make the case that global warming is accelerating .
The new Senate report will feature new peer - reviewed scientific studies and analyses refuting man-made warming fears .
Of course the fact that the establishment likes to engage in regular mass public deception by claiming the debate about global warming is over and any dissent is tantamount to holocaust denial does n’t bode well for potential media coverage of the report , unlike the ongoing UN climate conference in Poznan which is being lavished with endless media attention about the need for a global carbon tax to save the planet from the evils of plant food ( CO2 ) .
The self - proclaimed “ consensus ” behind man-made global warming is one enforced by threats , intimidation and ignorance , as highlighted by media coverage of last year ’s UN meeting in Bali , where skeptical climate scientists were shunned and ignored for daring to express an opposing viewpoint .
Following the Bali resolution to impose a global carbon tax , over one hundred prominent scientists signed a letter dismissing the move as a futile bureaucratic scheme which would diminish prosperity and increase human suffering .
Hundreds more skeptical scientists met in Manhattan last February at the first International Conference on Climate Change to discuss the side of the climate change debate that the establishment media prefers to pretend does not exist .
Did the mainstream media even acknowledge these events ?
Not at all , because they challenge the sacred cow that scientists uniformly agree on man-made global warming .
As we have previously reported , less than half of all published scientists endorse what has been dubbed the “ consensus view ” .
However , President - elect Barack Obama yesterday vowed to end global warming “ denial ” .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The following quotes , listed on the website of the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , provide a taster of what will be contained in the upcoming Senate report :
“ I am a skeptic … Global warming has become a new religion . ” – Nobel Prize Winner for Physics , Ivar Giaever .
“ Since I am no longer affiliated with any organization nor receiving any funding , I can speak quite frankly … .
As a scientist I remain skeptical . ” – Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson , the first woman in the world to receive a PhD in meteorology and formerly of NASA who has authored more than 190 studies and has been called “ among the most preeminent scientists of the last 100 years . ”
Warming fears are the “ worst scientific scandal in the history …
When people come to know what the truth is , they will feel deceived by science and scientists . ”
– UN IPCC Japanese Scientist Dr. Kiminori Itoh , an award - winning PhD environmental physical chemist .
“ The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit ; it does n’t listen to others .
It does n’t have open minds …
I am really amazed that the Nobel Peace Prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists , ” – Indian geologist Dr. Arun D. Ahluwalia at Punjab University and a board member of the UN - supported International Year of the Planet .
“ The models and forecasts of the UN IPCC “ are incorrect because they only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include , for example , solar activity . ” – Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera , a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the National Autonomous University of Mexico “ It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who do n’t buy into anthropogenic global warming . ” – U.S Government Atmospheric Scientist Stanley B. Goldenberg of the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA .
“ Even doubling or tripling the amount of carbon dioxide will virtually have little impact , as water vapour and water condensed on particles as clouds dominate the worldwide scene and always will . ” – .
Geoffrey G. Duffy , a professor in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering of the University of Auckland , NZ .
“ After reading [ UN IPCC chairman ]
Pachauri ’s asinine comment [ comparing skeptics to ] Flat Earthers , it ’s hard to remain quiet . ” – Climate statistician Dr. William M. Briggs , who specializes in the statistics of forecast evaluation , serves on the American Meteorological Society ’s Probability and Statistics Committee and is an Associate Editor of Monthly Weather Review .
“ For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming ?
For how many years must cooling go on ? ” – Geologist Dr. David
Gee the chairman of the science committee of the 2008 International Geological Congress who has authored 130 plus peer reviewed papers , and is currently at Uppsala University in Sweden .
“ Gore prompted me to start delving into the science again and I quickly found myself solidly in the skeptic camp … Climate models can at best be useful for explaining climate changes after the fact . ” – Meteorologist Hajo Smit of Holland , who reversed his belief in man-made warming to become a skeptic , is a former member of the Dutch UN IPCC committee .
“ Many [ scientists ] are now searching for a way to back out quietly ( from promoting warming fears ) , without having their professional careers ruined . ” – Atmospheric physicist James A. Peden , formerly of the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh .
“ Creating an ideology pegged to carbon dioxide is a dangerous nonsense …
The present alarm on climate change is an instrument of social control , a pretext for major businesses and political battle .
It became an ideology , which is concerning . ” – Environmental Scientist Professor Delgado Domingos of Portugal , the founder of the Numerical Weather Forecast group , has more than 150 published articles .
“ CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or another … .
Every scientist knows this , but it does n’t pay to say so …Global warming , as a political vehicle , keeps Europeans in the driver ’s seat and developing nations walking barefoot . ” – Dr. Takeda Kunihiko , vice - chancellor of the Institute of Science and Technology Research at Chubu University in Japan .
“ The [ global warming ] scaremongering has its justification in the fact that it is something that generates funds . ” – Award - winning Paleontologist Dr. Eduardo Tonni , of the Committee for Scientific Research in Buenos Aires and head of the Paleontology Department at the University of La Plata .

Dell Inc. is trying to sell its computer factories around the world , a move to sharply overhaul a production model that was long a hallmark of the PC giant 's strategy but is no longer competitive .
In recent months , according to people familiar with the matter , Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell the plants .
One person briefed on the plan said he expects the company to sell most -- and possibly all -- of its factories " within the next 18 months . "
Other factories could close , this person said ....
( CNN ) -- Adventurer and TV show host Bear Grylls injured his shoulder in Antarctica during an expedition to raise money for an international charity , the Discovery Channel said Sunday .
Bear Grylls , host of " Man vs. Wild , " was injured in Antarctica during an expedition to raise money for charity .
Grylls was injured Friday night after falling during the expedition , which was not for the Discovery Channel , according to the network 's statement .
The statement said that Grylls is returning to the UK to receive medical attention .
" Once he sees a doctor , we will have a better sense of the level of seriousness of his shoulder injury and the recovery time needed to get him back to his full physical activity , " according to the statement .
Grylls , 34 , is the host of Discovery 's " Man vs. Wild " in which he demonstrates extreme measures -- including eating snakes and insects -- used to survive in harsh environmental conditions .
In his blog , Grylls said the aim of his expedition in Antarctica -- sponsored by Ethanol Venture -- is " to promote alternative energies and their potential . "
" We will be using lots of different forms of alternative power , including wind - powered kite - skiing , part bio-ethanol powered jetskis and inflatable boats , electric - powered paragliders , solar - and wind - powered base camps -- and good old foot work , " Grylls wrote in a November 14 entry .
Grylls is a former member of the British Special Forces and has broken his back in several places during his service .
In his blog , he said he and his wife Shara are expecting their third child in January .

I just knocked up a quick Ruby script to automate some of the steps I always do when starting work on a Rails project , namely :
open an iTerm tab running script / server
open an iTerm tab running script / console
open an iTerm tab running autotest
open an iTerm tab running a shell window
launch Safari on localhost :3000 for testing .
Customise this little script to suit your own needs .
You 'll need to install the rb-appscript gem to start with , and obviously this only applies to OS X users .
require ' rubygems ' require ' appscript ' RAILS_PROJECT_PATH
= " ~/path_to_your_rails_project " # Customise this def create_iterm_tab ( command = " " ) @iterm ||= Appscript ::app( 'i Term ' ) session = @iterm .current_terminal.sessions.end.make ( :new => : session ) session.exec ( : command => ' bash - l ' ) session .
write ( : text => " cd #{RAILS_PROJECT_PATH} " ) session .
write ( : text => command ) unless command.nil ?
end def launch_browser ( url = " http://localhost:3000 " ) @safari ||= Appscript ::app( ' Safari ' ) @safari .open_location ( url ) end create_iterm_tab ( " ./script/server " ) create_iterm_tab ( " ./script/console " ) create_iterm_tab( " autotest " ) create_iterm_tab( ) sleep ( 5 ) launch_browser ( )
The sleep ( 5 ) is in there to give time for the server to spin up before launching the browser .
Now put all this in a file called " launch project .command " on the Desktop , and chmod +x it to allow it to allow it to execute when double - clicked .
I got some tips from Dribblings of a Deranged Hermit .
Happy New Year !
Good news , boys .
Moderate drinking may actually protect against impotence ( Image : Image Source / Rex )
Men might want to remember a new rhyme : a drink a day keeps erectile dysfunction away .
Despite traditional views about the effects of booze on male performance , new research suggests that moderate drinking actually protects against impotence in the long term – perhaps for the same reason a glass or two of wine a day cuts the odds of suffering from heart disease .
There is good evidence that excessive drinking can hinder sexual performance after a night out – a phenomenon sometimes called “ brewer ’s droop ” .
The effect has been noted for many years : “ [ Drink ] provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance , ” Shakespeare reminds us in Macbeth .

But over longer periods , moderate drinking does n’t seem to be linked to erectile dysfunction , says Kew - Kim Chew , an epidemiologist at the University of West Australia in Nedlands , whose team conducted an anonymous postal survey of 1770 West Australian men .
After accounting for differences due to age , smoking and heart disease – all risk factors for ED – Chew and colleagues found that drinkers experienced rates of impotence 25 % to 30 % below those of teetotallers .
Heart link
The study did not examine how alcohol seems to protect against ED , but he thinks antioxidants in some kinds of alcohol play a role .
Other studies suggest that both red and white wine protect against heart disease via a similar mechanism .
One theory holds that ED and heart disease are both manifestations of the same disease .
Indeed , Chew found that men who suffer from ED are more likely to go onto develop heart disease .
Chew calls for further research on the connection between alcohol , impotence and heart disease .
And he says his team ’s study should not give men a new reason to hit the bottle .
“ It would be socially irresponsible to say that even a binge drinker can get some benefits . ”

When the phrase " Lotus Notes " is mentioned in the halls of your IT department , you probably hear a range of responses , from " That 's still around ? " to " Notes is a critical part of our application portfolio , and we could n't deliver value without it . "
For a significant enterprise collaboration application that 's been around for more than two decades , it 's surprising that so many IT professionals still have a difficult time explaining just what Notes and Domino is , what it does and how it fits into the IT infrastructure .
Lotus Notes is the " Ginsu knife " of application development .
It slices , it dices , it cuts both leather and tomatoes .
This extreme flexibility means that Notes does n't fit neatly into a single software category in either its definition and functionality .
But it also means that your investment in Notes and Domino can deliver more than " just e-mail " to your organization .
Are you taking advantage of what it can do ?
1. Notes is more than " just e-mail . "
With near - universal use of e-mail as a corporate communication tool , Notes users spend much of their time in their mail file .
This tends to lead to the never - ending debate of which is better : Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange .
In reality , that 's an unreasonable comparison .
If you 're using Lotus Notes as " just " an e-mail application , you could do much better ( and save a lot of money ) .
Download an open - source mail transfer agent ( MTA ) like Sendmail and an open - source mail client like Thunderbird , and you have e-mail .
Historically , the Notes mail client has not been " best - in - class " ( to put it nicely ) , and as such has suffered in comparisons to Microsoft 's Outlook mail client .
But it 's what Lotus Notes offers beyond the mail client that makes it so valuable to the enterprise .
In addition to its e-mail capabilities , Lotus Notes is also a full - featured rapid application development platform .
Notes uses a semi- structured data store that allows for the creation and processing of " documents " ( which are similar to records in relational database systems ) .
Documents are displayed to the user as " forms , " which reveal the application 's pertinent fields .
This means that you can use Notes to build electronic workflow applications that can create requests , notify approvers via e-mail and process the requests once the approval is granted .
For instance , an expense reporting application built on the Notes platform could allow users to enter their expenses , route the document to their supervisors for approval ( perhaps with an additional level of approval if the amount is over a certain limit ) , and then generate a notice to the Accounting department to reimburse the user .
Another example might be an information request form on your corporate website .
Once the form is completed and the " submit " button is clicked , Notes could route the request to the correct department and track its fulfillment .
2. Notes and Domino is a powerful ( and open ) application development platform .
A goal of many organizations want to avoid getting too closely tied to any single vendor or technology .
If not careful , the proprietary nature of the technology can limit the future choices of the company when it comes to upgrading or integration with other platforms .
Applications built for Notes incorporate a wide variety of open standard technologies , such as JavaScript , HTML , Java and LotusScript ( a close relative of Visual Basic ) .
Developers who already know some of these technologies can quickly come up to speed in Notes application development , producing complex workflow applications very little time .
To build Notes applications , developers use the Designer client to create and modify all the different parts of a Notes application , such as forms , views and agents .
It can be viewed and tested in the Notes client or in a web browser for instant feedback .
In terms of productivity , developers get a lot done with very little effort .
But useful Notes applications do n't always require attention from the IT department .
It 's common in Notes for power users to develop applications that meet a tactical need , with little assistance from IT .
On the other hand , Designer 's easy - to - use interface historically can be a frustration at times to high - end developers .
The latest version of Notes / Domino ( version 8 ) has an Eclipse - based IDE , making it easy for some of those developers — for whom Eclipse is their native environment — can easily grasp the environment and produce high - quality applications .
3. Notes is the client , Domino is the server .
Notes , Domino , Notes / Domino ...
What is this software really called , anyway ?
The full name of IBM 's software offering is IBM Lotus Notes and Domino .
Lotus Notes refers to the Notes client , which is installed on the user 's personal computer , and is used to access both mail files and Notes applications .
Domino is the server component of the Notes / Domino team , and it runs on a variety of operating systems .
When a user connects to the server replica of their mail database using the Notes client , it 's the Domino server that is serving up the content from the user 's mail database .
The Domino server is also responsible for controlling access and security to mail files and application databases .
The Domino server has a robust security model that can control access in Notes documents down to the field level .
This includes both user access based on the user 's Notes ID , as well as database and network traffic encryption .
Notes and Domino run on a number of operating systems : from an Intel Pentium 2 desktop machine to the " big iron " of IBM mainframes .
The Domino server is available for Windows Server 2003 , IBM AIX , Novell SUSE and RedHat Linux distributions , Sun Solaris , IBM System i , IBM System z and IBM z/OS .
This attention to multi-platform support means that IT departments can use existing servers and data center architecture to consolidate hardware and keep a tight rein on costs .
The Notes client is supported on Windows XP , Windows Vista , Mac OS , and SUSE and RedHat Linux desktop distributions .
4. Notes has a long history of backward compatibility .
One of the most impressive features of Notes is its level of backwards compatibility between versions .
It 's possible to take a Notes application built in version 1 back in 1989 , and run it in the current Notes 8 release without any need to convert or rewrite the application .
We 're not talking about showcase " proof point " applications , but real - world legacy applications which are still giving good value to the organization and do not need any feature enhancements .
Few software applications can boast about compatibility across versions like Notes can .
This means your application development investment continues to return value long into the future .
Often , a Domino server migration consists of running the install utility for the latest version .
In as little as 15 minutes , the server is upgraded .
All the applications built in prior versions of Notes still continue to run with no conversions necessary .
5. Replication lets you work both online and offline .
Today 's knowledge workers do n't come to the office at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 pm .
They are " always on , " and they need to access their data whether or not a network connection is available .
The Notes client accommodates this requirement by replicating data between server and local versions of your mail files and applications .
It 's among Notes oldest and most cherished features — for good reason .
When a network connection exists , Notes synchronizes data between the server and client .
The replication occurs at the field level , so two people can update different fields in the same document ( such as an invoice or travel request ) ; the server merges the updates so that the document shows both sets of changes .
Frankly , this is slick .
Nobody else has ever achieved this level of WayCool synchronization sophistication , particularly because it's so trouble free that the feature is usually invisible .
Notes e-mail users replicate their mail files to local versions on their laptops , so they can be productive offline .
When they once again connect to the network , all the changes are replicated with the server and messages are sent to the appropriate people .
That applies to Notes databases and applications , not just e-mail .
6. Notes applications can be built for both the Notes client and for Web browsers .
Part of the flexibility of Notes is that you can build both Notes client applications and applications that are accessed through a Web browser .
Domino has a built - in HTTP server that renders content based on normal HTTP requests .
Domino takes the application 's design and data and renders it into HTML " on the fly " for the browser .
That 's one quick way to migrate an in - house legacy application to an intranet or extranet .
Because you can deliver both Notes client and browser content from the same source , your application development investment can pay off with greater flexibility for the end users .
7. Notes is " not dead . "
Notes has been declared dead multiple times .
When the Web came along , some opined Notes would be replaced by web browsers .
When Java became the hot new development platform , many felt that Notes would be replaced by a full - fledged Java Enterprise architecture .
And now that Microsoft has a popular collaboration offering in SharePoint , some are again predicting the demise of Notes .
Excuse me if I do n't hold my breath waiting for that to happen ....
Not only has Notes survived — it has adapted and thrived .
IBM added Web capabilities to the Domino server long ago , when intranet applications became a business requirement .
Java became another language supported in the Notes programming environment .
Notes Domino version 8 added the ability to build composite applications .
That is , these applications allow developers to blend data and functionality from both Notes and non-Notes applications so that the end of Notes and the start of a different application becomes seamless .
For instance , an SAP application can interact with a Notes application , sharing and updating data between the two platforms .

Jim Martin for US Senate 2008
In 2008 Jim Martin , a Georgia State Representative , was the Democratic challenger who forced Senator Saxby Chambliss , the Republican incumbent , into a Dec. 2 runoff .
The runoff was necessary as neither Chambliss nor Martin , the two major party candidates , had won a majority of the vote in the general election which was held on November 4 , 2008 .
Jim Martin had defeated Vernon Jones in the August 5 run -off between the top two Democratic contenders .
This was the official website for Jim Martin for his Senate run .
Content is from the site 's 2008 archived pages .
Supporter Abe Roth : I have been a supporter for as long as I can remember .
I volunteered along with some friends to do whatever it took to get Jim into office - any office .
We need people like him who are genuinely concerned about our common welfare .
Long before it became a popular topic , Jim was wary of the large tech companies , especially Google and Amazon .
Having seen the harm Google has done via their unregulated search , I want to support those who will look out for us .
For example , the search for your name should not be a place where private information is revealed .
A search for your company should not display bogus bad reviews put up by your competitors and nay sayers .
We clearly need a way to remove Google results that are harmful .
Currently , there are very few who advocate for regulation of big tech , but we are growing and the real injustice done to citizens by an unregulated monopoly must come to an end .
Fact Check : Jim Martin , The Only Candidate For Middle Class Georgians
More vicious attacks from the politician who perfected the smear campaign Saxby Chambliss today unleashed a new vicious attack ad in the same misleading and dishonorable vein that made Chambliss a national political celebrity .
The truth ?
Jim Martin will help President - elect Obama cut taxes for the middle class and get our economy working for Georgia again while Saxby Chambliss is committed to helping CEOs and lobbyists at the expense of average Georgians .
“ Georgians want a leader like Jim Martin who knows how to cut middle class taxes , not a politician like Saxby Chambliss who only knows how to cut a slick attack ad , ” Martin spokesperson Kate Hansen said .
“ Saxby Chambliss is running more vicious attack ads because he can’t run on his record of standing up for the special interests .
Jim Martin has a history of fighting to lower middle class taxes and will go to Washington to work with Barack Obama to get our economy working for average Georgians again . ”

In 1996 , Jim Martin voted to remove groceries from the statewide sales tax .
Former Governor Zell Miller called it the " largest tax cut in Georgia history " and predicted that the savings would amount to $ 500 million over the final three years of his term as governor ( 1996 - 1998 ) .

In April of 2007 , Sen. Saxby Chambliss introduced the Fair Tax Act of 2007 .
Fact - check organizations and editorials placed such a national sales tax at no less than 30 % and closer to 50 % after state sales taxes are incorporated .
The so - called " fair tax " would also " negatively impact people who 've saved , especially senior citizens . "
All retirees , who have paid taxes on a lifetime of earnings , would be double - taxed at that rate for all future purchases made from their savings .
Also , according to the Washington Post , an advisory panel to President Bush 's rejected the so - called " fair tax " because it would " create the largest entitlement program in history " or shift the overall tax burden from the rich to the poor .

About
Jim Martin
I grew up in a family of six boys - Joe , Jim , Jack , Jere , Julian , and Jeffrey .
My mother taught her six sons that we define ourselves by our deeds , not by our words - by living the values that come from our faith .
My father , who was as proud of this state as he was of his family , instilled in each of us the sense that Georgia is a special place .
On Sundays , he would drive us around the state , telling us stories about the landmarks along the way , like the building where our grandfather operated the Linotype machine for Joel Chandler Harris , the editor of The Atlanta Constitution .
My brothers have always been my best friends .
When I was eight years old , I contracted polio .
My parents had to isolate me from my brothers and take me out of school for fear that I would infect others .
For months , I was confined to my bedroom , visited only by my parents and my doctors .
I recovered , but some things in life you never forget .
I will never forget what it feels like to need a little help .
A government founded on solid principles does not turn its back on children , seniors , or people with disabilities .
After attending the Atlanta Public Schools , I enrolled at the University of Georgia .
On December 4 , 1963 , I was elected freshman class president .
That same day , Vince Dooley was named head football coach .
I spent the better part of a decade in Athens , earning three degrees ( a bachelor 's degree and two law degrees ) .
Interrupted only by my two years of service in the U.S. Army , including a tour of duty in Vietnam , I have spent my entire life in Georgia .
I will never forget the lessons I learned serving in Vietnam .
I came away from my tour of duty understanding the importance of personal responsibility as well as the importance of working together towards a common objective .
I have been married to Joan for 38 years , and we have four children and three grandchildren .
Joan and I had our first child , our daughter Morgan , while I was stationed at Fort Meade in Maryland .
Two months later , I was called to serve in Vietnam .
The kind of sacrifice that Joan made in caring for our daughter alone is the kind that many Georgia families are experiencing right now .
The Bush administration 's failure to provide adequate care for our returning soldiers and their families is nothing short of disgraceful .
As a young legal aid lawyer a few years out of the Army , I saw first - hand how the deck is stacked against working people under the Gold Dome in Atlanta .
Most of the folks in the halls of the Capitol had powerful clients with deep pockets .
My clients were like most Georgians , folks who work hard and just want a fair shake .
I believe we need to stand up for what is right even when it is not easy .
In 1983 , after years on the outside , I was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives .
During my 18 years in the legislature , I became a leader on health care issues and helped to create PeachCare , which provides quality and affordable health care to thousands of Georgia 's children .
I served as chairman of a number of committees in the House , including the Judiciary Committee , the Ethics Committee , and a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee overseeing state health care programs .
I also served as an active member of the Industrial Relations , Special Judiciary , and Children and Youth Committees .
When the state faced tough economic times in the early 1990s , state leaders turned to me to preserve critical services for seniors , children , and people with disabilities , while making necessary cuts in the budget .
Ultimately we cut millions of dollars , but we never turned our backs on the least among us - I made sure of it .
Over the years , I have learned how to get things done for Georgians .
That is why two governors , one a Democrat and the other a Republican , entrusted me to lead the Georgia Department of Human Resources .
I took over the department two weeks after 9/11 , when the state was facing the most difficult economic times in recent memory .
Many of my friends and colleagues told me not to do it , not to take the job .
They said , " Jim , this is political suicide .
The problems are too big and the resources are too limited . "
I took the job anyway , because I wanted to make a difference .
I successfully cut spending while preserving important programs .
In 2006 , I ran as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor .
In a tough environment for Democrats , I won more votes than any other non-incumbent Democrat on the ticket .
I was one of the few candidates anywhere in the country to address the looming foreclosure crisis , which has shaken our nation 's economy and which threatens homeowners across Georgia today .
I 'm running for U.S. Senate because I understand the toll the failed policies of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have taken on Georgia families , and I can help to put our country back on track .
As an elder in my church , as a proud father and grandfather , and as a Vietnam War veteran , I have tried to live the values of faith , family , and patriotism .
No one is going to take those values away from me , and no one in the race for U.S. Senate shares your values more than I do .
Joan Martin
I am my husband 's biggest fan .
I have known Jimmy Martin for over 39 years .
I have watched as he listened to and helped people find solutions to difficult issues ; as he successfully passed legislation ; and , most importantly , as he treated colleagues , advocates , adversaries , and others with unending respect .
Why do I call him Jimmy ?
It is the name his family has called him his whole life , a name that reminds me that his strength , compassion , and concern for others was formed many years ago in his childhood .
I met Jimmy in 1968 through my Hollins College roommate .
We were married in January of 1970 , as Jimmy moved from Fort Knox , Kentucky to Fort Bliss , Texas before serving in Vietnam .
While Jimmy was in Vietnam , I lived in California with our daughter Morgan .
When Jimmy returned , we moved back to Georgia where Becky , Jay , and Frank were born .
As a mother , I believe in keeping family first .
I have juggled family , career , and community service by searching for and creating career opportunities that were flexible .
I have two master 's degrees from Georgia State University , one in accounting and one in community counseling .
I worked as an accounting instructor at DeKalb College ( now Perimeter College ) ; as Director of Finance for the National Faculty , a national teacher training organization ; then as a counselor at the Fayette and Henry County Community Counseling Centers until I became Executive Director of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers in 1989 .
I retired from the Association in 2003 .
My community service includes active involvement in Christians Against Hunger , the Fulton County Court Appointed Special Advocates , and the Genesis Community Congregation .
Additionally , I was the first Executive Director of the Henry W. Grady High School Foundation and served as Co-Chair with Jimmy of the Atlanta Fulton Family Connection .
Issues
Growing Together with a Strong Economy / images
We should lower taxes on middle class Americans while maintaining fiscal discipline .
We need strong consumer protection laws to protect hard - working Americans from politically powerful special interests like credit card companies , insurance companies , banks , and oil companies .
Economic policy must encourage research and innovation , including " green - collar " job initiatives , in order to fuel future economic growth .
We have to rein in the federal budget and put an end to corporate welfare .
A Long Term Strategy for Iraq / images Image used under a Creative Commons license from Soldiers Media Center
We cannot continue the Bush Administration 's failed Iraq policy , which has us spending $ 10 billion each month while there are serious needs here at home .
It 's time for the Iraqi government to start taking responsibility for its own country .
It 's time to start bringing our troops home .
The tactical decisions about how to do so and on what timetable have to be made by our military commanders on the ground .
Once that happens , we can begin to redeploy our forces in a way that effectively addresses the threat of international terrorism .
We must have a military presence in the Middle East that is sustainable and that protects our national security interests .
And our military strategy must include a robust diplomatic component and have meaningful support from our allies abroad .
We have to do a better job of taking care of our troops when they return home .
Health Care for Every American / images
Image used under a Creative Commons license from Paul Keleher Accessible and affordable health care for all Americans is an achievable goal .
Solving the national health care crisis will also spur economic growth .
Health care for all children should be our first priority .
Education : Transforming Our Workforce / images
We need an education system that helps to prepare Georgians for the kinds of high - paying jobs that will be available in the 21st Century 's global economy .
Control of public education rests with state governments and local school boards , but there is a role for the federal government in helping states and local school systems to address the problems they face .
The federal government can help the most by providing early childhood education for children who need help , by helping school systems achieve excellence , by assisting children with special needs , and by supporting struggling school systems .
No Child Left Behind focuses too much on micromanaging teachers and students - we need to assist parents and teachers and provide the funding needed for excellence .
The federal government should expand loan and grant programs that allow students - especially first generation prospective students - to attend college and technical schools .
Safeguarding Our Environment with a Green Economy / images
We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and lead the effort to address global climate change .
The pursuit of new " green " technologies is good for the economy and good for the environment .
The energy policies of the past are not sustainable and are keeping us from developing new and better energy resources .
We must insist on rational sustainable growth in the development of our communities .
The federal government has an important role in easing Georgia 's water crisis .
Protecting Seniors and Retirement Programs / images Image used under a Creative Commons license from kthypryn / images
We must stop using the Social Security trust fund to pay for Washington 's pork - barrel spending .
The federal government has an important role to play in negotiating with drug companies to lower prescription drug costs for seniors .
We must safeguard workers ' retirement savings and also protect seniors from consumer fraud .
We must increase funding to fight degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
We must support families who are caring for older family members .
Immigration Reform That Will Make the System Work and Protect Our Nation / images Image used under a Creative Commons license from Omar Omar
There are two things we need to do immediately : first , we must secure our borders , and second , we have to crack down on employers who hire undocumented workers .
Once we do these two things , we can then move to address the need for real and comprehensive immigration reform .
We need immigration reform that is practical and fair , and that reflects the realities of our economic needs .
Hard - working immigrants with no criminal records and basic English skills should be allowed to get in line for the opportunity to gain legalized status after paying a fine and back taxes .
We can curb immigration by supporting other countries in their efforts to become more stable and economically sound .
Honoring Our Country 's Soldiers and Veterans / images Image used under a Creative Commons license from Tom Adamson / images
We should support our troops by using them more effectively and taking care of them when they come home .
The Department of Veterans Affairs must be adequately funded in order to provide proper care for our veterans .
We need to make it easier for veterans to understand and receive the benefits to which they are entitled .
We must address the mental health needs of returning soldiers and their families .
Returning soldiers must receive the support they require in order to transition back to civilian life and find meaningful employment .
Congress was right to pass the 21st Century GI Bill , which seeks to provide today 's veterans with the same opportunities soldiers returning from World War II had .
Our country should expand benefits to reserve and National Guard personnel in order to reflect the expansion of their role in our military operations .
Your Thoughts on the Issues / images
We also want to hear from you .
Folks are fed up with Washington in part because politicians spend more time talking than listening .
In his more than 35 years in public service , Jim has built a reputation for listening first , doing his homework , and working with everyone in order to get things done for Georgians .
He would like nothing more than to hear from you .
Please feel free to send Jim an e-mail - info@martinforsenate.com - or drop us a comment on this thread .

Chambliss Allies Continue Desperate , False Attacks
Martin has come face - to - face with violent crime , spent career protecting children
ATLANTA – In a new ad released today , Saxby Chambliss ’ allies attack with more of the same smears already disproven by nonpartisan FactCheck.org .
The truth is that Jim Martin has always fought to protect children and families , because he knows what it ’s like to have a child come face - to - face with violent crime .
That ’s why the International Brotherhood of Police Officers is endorsing Jim Martin today – because he is the only candidate in the race with a proven history of proving law enforcement with the tools to keep our families safe .
“ Another day , another smear from Saxby Chambliss and his allies , ” Martin for Senate spokesperson Kate Hansen said .
“ If Saxby Chambliss had spent more time fighting for Georgia families and less time fighting for corporate interests , maybe he would n’t be forced to resort to these desperate attacks .
Georgians know that Jim Martin always stands up to protect Georgia families because he knows what it ’s like to come face - to - face with violent crime . ”
Martin ’s daughter Becky was kidnapped when she was eight years old .
Fortunately she was let go , but Martin never forgot the way Becky trembled when she came face - to - face with her kidnapper in court .
Over his 18 - year tenure in the state legislature and during his service as Commissioner of Georgia ’s Department of Human Resources , Martin built a reputation as a leading advocate for children .

It 's Time for the Truth , Saxby
Saxby Chambliss has returned to his tried and true tactics - the politics of division and personal destruction - in order to change the subject from who will work best with President - elect Obama to get our economy moving again for the middle class .
Chambliss 's attacks on Jim , which are being waged on television and through the press and which distort or simply do n't tell the truth about Jim 's record , are nothing but the tired old political tactics of every Chambliss campaign .
Here are the facts .
* * * Jim's Record on Taxes and Protecting the Public Purse A RECORD OF LOWERING TAXES Jim supported middle class tax cuts and the largest tax cut in Georgia history .
Jim has always fought for targeted tax cuts for middle class families and senior citizens .
In Jim 's 18 years in the state House , he supported some of the largest tax cuts in the history of the state - including the $ 500 million tax cut eliminating the sales tax on groceries .
[ HB 265 , 1996 ]
He also authored a bill to increase the homestead exemption .
[ HB 1542 , 1992 ] Saxby Chambliss and Freedom 's Watch are not telling the truth - Jim voted FOR Zell Miller 's $ 100 million tax cut in 1994 .
Contrary to the claims in ads by Freedom 's Watch - the shadowy front group for a Las Vegas billionaire - and the Chambliss campaign , Jim voted for Zell Miller 's $ 100 million tax cut in 1994 .
The ads cite an article from the Atlanta Journal - Constitution that concerns funding for services for Georgia seniors .
[ Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 2/13/94 ]
The truth is that Jim did NOT oppose the tax cut - he voted for it .
[ Georgia House Journal , p. 1166 , HB 596 ]
The " largest tax increase in Georgia history " was a penny sales tax to fund schools that was supported by Zell Miller .
The vote that Saxby Chambliss and his allies call the " largest tax increase " in Georgia history was a vote for a penny sales tax to fund our schools .
That 's right - it raised the state sales tax by one cent in order to put badly needed money into education .
The vote took place 19 years ago and was followed by the elimination of the sales tax on groceries , which Jim supported .
The 1989 penny sales tax for education passed the Georgia House with 129 votes from Democrats and Republicans .
[ Georgia House Journal , pp. 2143-2150 , HB 474 , 3/8/1989 ; Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 10/20/08 ]
Saxby Chambliss and the NRSC are not telling the truth - Jim did NOT push to increase property taxes .
Ads by Saxby Chambliss and the NRSC charge that Jim tried to raise property taxes by 150 % .
This is n't the truth .
The ads cite a bill from 1995 that sought to clarify the assessment process and make it more transparent for taxpayers .
The proposal would have in no way increased property taxes - the bill went to great lengths to ensure this .
Ultimately , the legislature took no action on the bill .
[ HB 831 , 1995 ]
In fact , Jim saved Georgia families $ 3.3 billion by supporting an increase in the homestead exemption .
In 1999 , Jim voted to increase the homestead exemption to $ 50,000 .
Since 1999 , Georgia families have saved more than $ 3.3 billion in property taxes .
[ HB 553 , 1999 , Associated Press , 5/27/02 ]
Jim supported a bipartisan plan to reduce property taxes in Fulton County and fix crumbling infrastructure .
An ad by Freedom 's Watch claims that Jim " supported a 17 % Fulton County tax hike . "
The truth is the opposite - Jim supported a bipartisan proposal for a voter referendum on a one - percent local - option sales tax in order to reduce property taxes and repair crumbling infrastructure ahead of the 1996 Olympics .
The plan was also supported by the Republican Chairman of the Fulton County Commission at the time , Mitch Skandalakis .
The proposal never came up for a vote .
[ Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 2/2/94 , 2/12/94 , 2/15/94 ]
And in 2001 , Jim helped pass $ 249 million in property tax relief .
On March 19 , 2001 , Jim voted for and the Georgia House adopted a state budget bill that included $ 249 million in property tax relief for homeowners , giving the average homeowner in the state a reduction of about $ 200 on a $ 1,600 tax bill that summer .

Saxby Chambliss and his allies continue to distort Jim 's record - during Jim's 18 years in the legislature , he voted once to increase the official per diem for legislators by $ 16 to cover inflation , and Johnny Isakson and Sonny Perdue voted the same way .
Jim also voted to cap what legislators could spend on official duties at $ 4,800 a year .
In addition to the Republicans in the legislature who supported the plan , the bill was signed into law by then - Gov. Zell Miller .
[ Georgia Senate Journal , pp. 1186-1189 , HB 62 , 3/8/95 ; pp. 2299-2301 , HB 62 , 3/17/95 ]
In fact , during his 18 years as a state representative , Jim returned over 20 % of the money - $ 18,081 total - that was budgeted for his expense allowance .
During Jim's tenure in the legislature , the yearly allocation to each member 's expense account was $ 4,800 .
Jim consistently did not spend all of the money he was allocated and returned it to the taxpayers .

By comparison , Chambliss 's own salary has increased by over $ 10,000 since he 's been in the Senate .
[ United States Senate ]
In addition , Chambliss runs a political action committee that has a budget of more than half - a- million dollars .
[ Center for Responsive Politics ]
During his years in the legislature , Jim developed a reputation for being a staunch fiscal conservative and a trusted guardian of taxpayer dollars .
When the state faced tough economic times in the early 1990s , state leaders turned to Jim to preserve critical services for seniors , children , and people with disabilities , while making necessary cuts in the budget .
Ultimately , he cut millions of dollars , but he never turned our backs on the least among us .
Every budget Jim voted for in the state legislature was balanced - but Chambliss has voted for higher deficits time and again while he has been in Washington .

Chambliss voted six times against restoring pay - as - you - go rules to Congressional spending .

The national debt has increased by almost $ 4 trillion in the six years Chambliss has been in the Senate , and it now exceeds $ 10 trillion .
[ U.S. Treasury , 10/23/08 ]
Jim turned down a pay raise as Commissioner of Human Resources .
Jim cut government spending as Commissioner of Human Resources .
Jim took over DHR two weeks after 9/11 , when the state was facing some of the most difficult economic times in recent memory .
He successfully cut spending while preserving important programs .
* * * Jim's Leadership of the
Department of Human Resources
Jim believes that every child 's life is precious and that it is wrong for Chambliss to attempt to score political points over the death of children .
Jim has been the recipient of numerous awards for his work on behalf of children .
These awards include the 1994 Georgians for Children " Children 's Champion Award , " the 1997 Parent to Parent of Georgia " Legislative Service Award , " and a recognition of outstanding service in 2002 from the Adoptive and Foster Parents Association of Georgia .
As Commissioner of Human Resources , Jim took immediate action to hold the persons responsible for the deaths accountable , including firing the individuals who were at fault .
He ordered all caseworkers to check on every child in the state 's custody within a 48 - hour period .
Jim continued his efforts to implement policies aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in order to improve care for all children .
Jim served as Commissioner under both Democratic Governor Roy Barnes and Republican Governor Sonny Perdue .
Perdue asked Jim and all other political appointees to tender their resignations upon his inauguration , but Perdue chose not to accept Jim 's resignation for almost a year .
When Jim left DHR , Perdue praised Jim 's service to the Department .
Perdue said that " [ Jim ] could not have been a more gracious , more cooperative commissioner ....
He 's managed a tough department in tough economic times .
His service has been a service of sacrifice . "
[ Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 9/18/03 ]
Perdue spokesman Dan McLagan said at the time , " The governor knows that Mr. Martin has a heart for children . "
[ Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 9/2/03 ]
In 2006 , Jeffrey Bramlett , the attorney for the children 's advocacy group that sued the state regarding care for foster children , praised Jim 's leadership at DHR : " The record shows that , as DHR Commissioner , Jim Martin fought heroically to protect these children and improve their life chances in a larger political context where Georgia 's elected leaders over an extended period of time simply lacked the political will necessary to devote the resources required to do an adequate job of caring for these children . "
[ Letter of Jeffrey O. Bramlett , 7/13/06 ]
As Commissioner , Jim's job was to look out for the well - being of every one of the 17,000 children under the department 's care , many of whom were at risk , sick , or in trouble .
Jim built a reputation as a leading advocate for children over his 18 - year tenure in the state legislature .
Jim 's achievements in the legislature include : helping create the PeachCare system which has provided thousands of children with quality , affordable healthcare ; writing the law that provided for a juvenile court system in every county of the state ; leading the way to close sub- standard Fulton County emergency foster care shelters and replacing them with child - friendly " First Placement , Best Placement " facilities ; helping obtain funding for the Columbus Evaluation Center for local children in foster care ; drafting legislation that created mental health services for Georgia 's children ; and authoring legislation to ensure vulnerable children actually received child support payments .
* * * Jim's Long Record of Fighting to Get
Tough on Crime and to Protect Children A LIFELONG RECORD OF STANDING UP FOR CHILDREN AND PROTECTING GEORGIANS FROM CRIME
Jim voted to make child solicitation a felony - Saxby Chambliss and his friends in Washington are lying about Jim 's record .
Jim was working toward the passage of an alternative bill which dealt specifically with solicitation of minors ( versus the bill that Chambliss and his friends cite , which had other provisions in it ) .
The version Jim supported ultimately passed - unanimously - two weeks later , and it made solicitation of a minor a felony .
It is patently false to say that Jim did not support making child solicitation a felony .
Chambliss and his friends in Washington are just deliberately misleading people .
[ Georgia House Journal , pp. 1,165 , 1,166-67 , HB 1221 , 2/17/88 ]
In 1995 , Jim supported an even tougher measure to combat exploitation of children .
[ HB 377 , 1995 ] Jim has always fought to protect children from crime - because he knows what it feels like to have a child come face - to - face with violent crime .
Jim 's daughter Becky was kidnapped when she was 8 years old .
The Martin family was blessed that she got away safely , but the experience left its mark .
Jim has said : " I never forgot the way Becky trembled when she faced her kidnapper in court .
That 's why I fought so hard to crack down on violent crime and lock up violent criminals . "
Jim voted for Zell Miller 's " Two Strikes and You 're Out " law - one of the toughest anti-crime laws in the country .
Jim also co-authored the law requiring criminals to pay restitution to their victims , and he passed the law that allows law enforcement agencies to use the money they seize from drug dealers to fight crime .
And Jim voted for Zell Miller 's Teenage & Adult Driver Responsibility
Act , imposing tougher penalties on drunk drivers .
[ HB 681 , 3/25/97 ; Atlanta Journal Constitution ,
1/26/97 ; 4/15/97 ]
Zell Miller praised Jim and others for the stiffer DUI law .
Zell Miller praised top House Democrats and Republicans for putting aside " partisan affiliations and political differences " to draft the bill . "
[ Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 2/21/97 ]
Jim has always worked to protect families from domestic abuse .
Throughout his 35 years in public service , Jim has worked diligently to prevent violence against women and children .
[ SB 441 , 1994 ; HB 273 , 1985 ; HB 614 , 1985 ] Jim 's commitment to eliminating violence against women has been recognized by the National Organization for Women ( 1993 NOW Certificate of Appreciation ) .
Jim also received the Max Cleland Public Service Award from the Network to End Sexual Assault in 2002 .
CHAMBLISS PUTS WASHINGTON INTERESTS OVER THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN Chambliss voted against protecting children from sexual predators .
Saxby Chambliss voted against a package of 35 non-controversial bills on July 28 , 2008 , some of which he cosponsored , because his party leaders instructed Republicans to block all bills in the Senate .
The bills Chambliss voted against , all but one of which already passed the House by huge bipartisan margins , had all been blocked by Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , who was single - handedly obstructing nearly 80 bills - the most of any senator .
The bills in the package covered a huge range of subjects , from protecting children from sexual predators to improving stroke prevention to expanding access to broadband internet services to helping victims of Lou Gehrig 's disease and paralysis .
Some of the bills that Chambliss voted to block that would have protected children include : Drug Endangered Kids ( HR 1199 / S. 1210 ) ; Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act ( S. 2982 / HR 5524 ) ; Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act ( HR 4120 ) ; Enhancing the Effective Prosecution of Child Pornography ( S. 2869 / HR 4136 ) ; PROTECTOur Children Act ( HR 3845 / S 1738 ) .
Chambliss opposed the expansion of PeachCare .
" In this 68 to 31 vote , the Senate passed an expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program . "
In Georgia the program is known as PeachCare .
[ Chambliss voted NO , 8/2/07 , Vote 307 : H R 976 , Washington Post Key Votes ]
Chambliss believed covering more children with health care was too expensive .
" I wound up voting against it [ SCHIP ] because of three reasons .
One , they spent way too much money .
They 're going from capping the program at 250 percent of the poverty level to 300 percent and allowing waivers for up to 400 percent .
[ Columbus Ledger Enquirer , 2/16/07 ]
Chambliss voted against an amendment that would have provided funding for children exploited in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
Voting 41 for and 56 against , Senators refused to add $ 1 billion nationwide in fiscal year 2006 to the COPS program , which helps local police departments add personnel and equipment .
The amendment also proposed $ 10 million to care for Gulf Coast children exploited in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and $ 8 million to assist victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse in areas struck by Katrina .
[ Chattanooga Times Free Press , 9/18/05 ]
Chambliss voted against expanding early childhood education .
Voting 47 for and 52 against , Senators refused to increase Head Start funding by $ 153 million , or nearly 3 percent , in fiscal year 2006 .
The underlying bill ( HR 3010 ) provides more than $ 6 billion for Head Start , which conducts pre-kindergarten schooling for about 900,000 disadvantaged children .
The amendment was designed to keep the Head Start budget abreast of inflation , with the additional funding added to the 2006 deficit .

Thank You Georgia
I can't thank you enough for your support .
Georgians turned out in record numbers on Election Day , and a majority of them voted to reject Saxby Chambliss and the failures of Washington to stand up for the middle class .
We could n't have done it without you .
Now we 're headed to a runoff , and we need you to redouble your efforts if we 're going to win on December 2nd , because this race is going to be about helping President - elect Barack Obama get our economy back on track and making the economy work for the middle class again .
America has elected Barack Obama President , and now is the time for us to help him succeed .
Saxby Chambliss has promised to do everything he can to stop Barack Obama from succeeding .
We face the biggest challenges of the past 60 years - let 's work together to solve them .
In the Senate I 'll do what 's best for Georgia , what 's best for this country , and what 's best for the middle class who 've been ignored the past eight years .
I hope that you 'll join me today .
Jim Martin was defeated by the Republican incumbent in the December 2 run off 42.6 % to 57.4 % of the vote .

For a lot of people , the term “ Web 2.0 , ” ceased to mean anything real a long a time ago .
For some , it never really meant anything to begin with .
As someone who writes about the so - called second version of the web for a living , I think I ’ve held onto the Web 2.0 term as long as I could .
But today , “ Web 2.0 ” has officially jumped the shark for me .
That does n’t mean I ’ll stop using it — as a blanket term to describe the industry that I write about it can be helpful — but I have to admit that it has now become somewhat of a parody .
Defining Web 2.0 has been something like a fun parlor game for a few years now .
There ’s a long history of people trying to come up with a unified definition of Web 2.0 .
But like the elusive theory of everything in physics , a single , agreed - upon definition of what Web 2.0 really means has been hard to come by .
Probably the most widely accepted definition is Tim O’Reilly ’s compact definition : “ Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform , and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform . ”
But even O’Reilly ’s definition has changed and evolved to get to that point .
So what caused me to finally admit that Web 2.0 has jumped the shark ?
It was waking up today , and finding a link to this story at PC World , a very mainstream computer publication : Web 2.0 Tactics for Successful Job-Hunting .
Among the “ Web 2.0 tactics ” that PC World recommends : letters of recommendation , staying current with your skills , and networking .
Is n’t that how people have been searching for jobs nearly forever ?
What the heck is “ Web 2.0 ” about that ?
The only item on the list that could be even mildly considered to have some sort of tie in with what we generally like to think of as Web 2.0 was “ Upgrade your online image , ” in which the authors recommend joining relevant online social communities like LinkedIn , and Twitter , blogging , and making sure your profiles at other social sites are clean of college party photos .
In other words : Web 2.0 is now a mainstream marketing term .
In reality , Web 2.0 has always been a marketing term .
O’Reilly ’s company , which owns the trademark on the term , uses it to promote their hugely successful web - focused conference series , for example .
But until today , I had n’t actually seen it applied in a way that so blatantly targets a mainstream audience in an effort to make something rather dull appear more hip ( I ’m sure it ’s happened before , this was just the first time I ’ve seen it ) .
All that said , the confusion over Web 2.0 — whatever it means and however it is now being used — has been helpful .
Last April , I wrote that there really is no such thing as Web 2.0 , or Web 3.0 for that matter , there is just the web .
“ Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 — they do n’t really exist .
They ’re just arbitrary numbers assigned to something that does n’t really have versions , ” I said .
“ But the discussion that those terms have prompted have been helpful , I think , in figuring out where the web is going and how we ’re going to get there ; and that ’s what is important . ”
I think that ’s still true , and as long as we continue to have that discussion and attempt to define these nebulous ideas , we ’ll continue to get value from the discussion .
I wrote in April that instead of telling people I write about Web 2.0 , I ’d tell them that I “ write about the web , what you can do with it now , and what you ’ll be able to do with it in the future . ”
I have n’t done a very good job in keeping with that promise , but I still like the idea .
Emergency crews evacuated dozens of skiers and snowboarders who were left stranded aboard sagging gondola cars when a support tower collapsed Tuesday .
The passengers were stuck for several hours in subzero temperatures when the tower caved in around 2:30 p.m .
By 6:15 p.m. , all of the passengers had been evacuated , CTV B.C. reported .
The RCMP reported that 10 people were injured in the incident , but none of the injuries were serious enough to be considered life - threatening .
Fifty - three people were stuck in subzero temperatures for several hours .
By Tuesday evening , the lower line of the two - part gondola was leaning quite heavily to one side .
The gondolas did not fall during the crash , but remained on the wire cable with passengers inside .
At least six people were trapped inside the gondola car closest to the base of the mountain .
That car was hovering a few feet above the ground , and came to rest on top of a bus shelter in the resort town 's village .
A second gondola with several people inside was left hovering dangerously close to Fitzsimmons Creek , a fast - moving mountain stream .
A terrifying ordeal
Passenger Cynthia Jennings , who was in a car halfway up the mountain when the pole snapped , said the ordeal was frightening .
" All we saw were other cars swinging sideways and we thought we were going to crash to the ground , " she told CTV News by cell phone .
" I thought the whole cable system was going to come down .
I could n't even breathe . "
The fire department used a long ladder to reach some of the passengers .
The cause of the accident is still unknown .
Earlier in the day , police said there did n't appear to be any danger of a further collapse and a truck with a support arm was used to prevent the tower from moving .
Witness Dave Komadowski , who was standing at the base of the mountain when the tower collapsed , said some of the nearby houses may have been damaged during the incident .
He added that one house was damaged when the cable dropped onto its roof .
A lift legacy
The cable - led Excalibur gondola is more than two kilometres longs and climbs more than 350 vertical metres up Blackcomb Mountain .
Each cabin holds eight people .
Since the Excalibur is a two - stage gondola system , only the lower section of the gondola was stopped , said Doug Forseth , a spokesperson from the Whistler - Blackcomb ski resort .
" The upper stage on Blackcomb has been separated from the lower stage , and we are able to run those people off the line .
And they are off the mountain now so that 's not an issue . "
Forseth added that before evacuations could start , emergency crews had to ensure that other sections of the gondola remained stable .
This is not the first accident to happen on a ski lift at Whistler - Blackcomb , which will host alpine events at the 2010 Winter Games .
In 1993 , an accident on Whistler 's Quicksilver lift killed two men , and injured nine others .
The high - speed lift was ferrying skiers to the top of the mountain when a chair slipped on a cable and slammed into another , sending four chairs crashing into the rocks three storeys below .

Security has been stepped up at India 's airport after attack warnings
There has been a major security alert at Delhi 's main international airport .
The BBC initially quoted an incorrect claim from an airport worker that six people had been shot and killed at Indira Gandhi International Airport .
But the Indian authorities have since denied that there was any shooting incident at the airport .
Airline passengers are said to have panicked and mistakenly reported that shots were being fired after two loud noises were heard .
Tensions have been high in India since last week 's shooting spree in Mumbai left nearly 200 people dead .
Indian airports have been on heightened alert after a threat of more attacks by the Deccan Mujahideen , the previously unknown militant group which claimed responsibility for the Mumbai attacks .

Modern culture is destroying faith , pope warns Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This ROME ( AFP ) â Pope Benedict XVI attacked the Godless character of modern culture as he celebrated mass Sunday in a Roman basilica to mark the opening of a synod of Catholic bishops .
In a sombre homily in which he suggested that Christianity in Europe could become extinct like some Christian communities in history , the pope told more than 250 bishops from around the world that societies which rebelled against God in the past had faced His " punishment " .
" If we look at history we are forced to notice the frequent coldness and rebellion of incoherent Christians .
Because of this , God , while never shirking in his promise of salvation , often had to turn towards punishment , " he said .
Benedict warned that " nations once rich in faith and vocations are losing their own identity under the harmful and destructive influence of a certain modern culture .
" There are those that , having decided that ' God is dead , ' declare themselves ' god , ' believing themselves to be the only creator of their own fate , the absolute owner of the world , " the German - born pope said .
" When men proclaim themselves absolute owners of themselves and the only masters of creation , are they really going to be able to construct a society where freedom , justice and peace reign ?
" Is it not more likely -- as demonstrated by news headlines every day -- that the arbitrary rule of power , selfish interests , injustice and exploitation , and violence in all its forms , will extend their grip ? "
The pontiff was celebrating mass in the Basilica of St Paul outside the Walls in central Rome , which houses the tomb of the Apostle Paul .
Benedict however tempered his speech by saying " if in certain regions , faith weakens to the point of fading away , there will always be other people ready to receive it , " adding " evil and death never have the final word . "
The synod , a three - week gathering of more than 250 bishops from around the world , will discuss Christian fundamentalism and the relationship between religion and science as well as Judaism .
The second such gathering to be presided over by Benedict since his election in 2005 will have the theme " The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church . "
For the first time , the event will include a speech on October 18 by Bartholomew I , the head of the Greek Orthodox Church , and Protestant and Anglican prelates are to attend as observers .
Israeli Rabbi Shear - Yashuv
Cohen will also become the first Jewish representative to address a Roman Catholic synod when he talks about themes of the Bible on Monday .
The synod is a consultative body created in 1965 to facilitate contacts among bishops , who represent 1.1 billion Catholics around the world , and to help the pope set policies for running the Church .
Of the 253 archbishops , bishops and cardinals summoned to the synod , 51 are from Africa , 62 from the Americas , 41 from Asia , 90 from Europe and nine from the Pacific .
Another 41 experts including six women and 37 observers are to take part in the gathering in which three former Italian presidents and Oscar - winning actor Roberto Benigni have also agreed to read from the Bible .
" Synchronizing " is a tough word to spell , even if you are n't high from the ton of marijuana you 're trying to smuggle .
But you 'd think after going to all the trouble of creating this UPS lookalike , the smugglers would invest some of their profit in a dictionary .
The truck , which was carrying 2,118 pounds of marijuana , had a homemade license plate that caught the attention of the state trooper who pulled it over last month in southern Arizona .
When the trooper walked around to the side and saw this sign , he knew he'd " better get the canine , " says Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart Graves .

A long time coming
A redesign of the MacBook Pro—Apple 's professional level notebook — has been a long time coming .
The machine 's physical design has not changed at all since the MacBook Pro was originally introduced in early 2006 ( which , in itself , was barely different than the PowerBook G4 before it ) , and its internals have only evolved over time .
But as of last week 's special launch event , Apple has finally answered the call for an updated MacBook Pro , giving its flagship mobile an overhaul on both the outside and the inside .
And boy , are there a lot of changes .
A single unibody enclosure .
An expanded , button - free trackpad .
Multiple GPU units .
Oh my !
In this two - part review , we 'll take a look at the new MacBook Pro in usage scenarios that range from professional to casual to entertainment .
Part I of the review focuses on the new features of Apple 's latest and greatest , while Part II will focus entirely on benchmarks and performance .
( Look for Part II . )
Out of the box
Consistent with Apple 's latest efforts to reduce the amount of waste it blasts into the environment , Apple has shrunken the MacBook Pro 's packaging to be more compact and similar to that of the MacBook .
That 's fine , because the unboxing experience is just as streamlined as it has ever been .
Smaller packaging = happy environment Smaller packaging = happy environment
Contained within the retail box is the MacBook Pro , a power brick , a power brick extension cord , and a packet of restore discs .
Pretty sparse , but also pretty standard .
Do you really need much else anyway ?
Tech specs
With the new MacBook Pro , you get the option of choosing between a 2.4GHz and 2.53GHz model ( the two standard offerings ) if you 're going for the 15 " model .
As of this writing , the 17 " MacBook Pro has only been " refreshed " and has not received the same updates as the 15 " MacBook Pro .

4GB is the max amount of RAM that either machine can support .
The hard drives in both can be upgraded to faster and higher - capacity drives , or to a 128 GB solid - state drive .
Apple has completely eliminated 4200 RPM drives across the MacBook Pro line , and all drive sizes are available in up to 7200 RPM .
The higher - end model 's processor can also be upgraded to a 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo for an extra $ 300 .
The MacBook Pro that we 're reviewing is the stock $ 2,499 model .
Now , on to what makes this new MacBook Pro so special .
This week , Microsoft unveiled one of Windows 7 ’s new features , which will allow games and other DirectX 10 and 10.1 - based applications to run fully accelerated on obsolete graphics hardware , and even on systems with no graphics acceleration at all .
Dubbed Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform or WARP , the new graphics layer for Windows 7 will utilize the system CPU as the graphics engine to assist old graphics cards , and take over completely in some cases .
Microsoft indicates that WARP will be fully dependent on how powerful the CPU is in a system , but will require one that supports at least SSE2 extensions .
According to Microsoft , even the lowest - end discrete graphics solutions these days are typically 4 to 5X faster than a CPU - only WARP system .
Although the performance differences between CPU - only WARP and discrete GPU accelerated graphics is large , WARP offers several advantages : users will still be able to run their 3D applications fully - accelerated when a video card driver is corrupted , missing , or improperly installed / configured .
Systems built to take advantage of WARP from a hardware standpoint will be able to display graphics even when the video card is missing — or toasted .
So if you ’ve nuked your graphics card from a bad BIOS flash , fear not on a WARP - capable system .
At least you will be able to boot back up until the video card is replaced .
WARP documentation indicates that the technology will take full advantage of multi-core CPUs and , given today ’s technology , Intel ’s Core i7 CPU tops the charts .
The following are benchmarks from Microsoft ’s own test of Crysis , running at 800x600 with the lowest quality settings :

Notice that Intel ’s Core i7 quad - core solution with Hyper - Threading , running at 3.0 GHz , outperforms Intel ’s best integrated graphics solution .
According to Microsoft ’s WARP documentation :
When WARP10 is running on the CPU , we are limited compared to a graphics card in a number of ways .
The front side bus speed of a CPU is typically around or under 10 GB / s whereas a graphics card often has dedicated memory that is able to take advantage of 20 - 100 GB /s or more of graphics bandwidth .
Graphics hardware also has fixed function units that can perform complex and expensive tasks like texture filtering , format decompression or conversions asynchronously with very little overhead or power cost .
Performing these operations on a typical CPU is expensive in terms of both power consumption and performance cost in cycles .
WARP Capabilities :
* Fully supports all Direct3D 10 and 10.1 feature
o Fully supports all the precision requirements of the Direct3D 10 and 10.1 specification
o Supports Direct3D 11 when used with FeatureLevel 9_1 , 9_2 , 9_3 , 10_0 and 10_1
o Supports all optional texture formats , such as multi-sample render targets and sampling from float surfaces .
o Supports anti-aliased , high quality rendering up to 8x MSAA .
o Supports anisotropic filtering
o Supports 32 and 64 bit applications as well as large address aware 32 bit applications .
* The minimum specification for WARP10 is the same as Windows Vista , specifically :
o Minimum 800MHz CPU .
o MMX , SSE or SSE2 is * not* required
o Minimum 512MB of RAM .
Clearly WARP wo n’t be the ideal way to run the latest games .
Nor do we expect enthusiasts with Core i7s to also be replacing integrated graphics .
Thus , it ’ll be interesting to see where Microsoft goes with this feature .
WARP will be compatible on both x86 and x64 systems .
WHEN General David Petraeus , now America 's most celebrated military commander , arrived in Iraq in 2003 at the head of an airborne division , he asked a journalist : “ Tell me how this ends ? ”
For years nobody had a good answer .
But now , thanks to a military pact between America and Iraq , a conclusion is in sight : America 's war in Iraq will end in three years ' time , with American troops being shown the door and Iraqi politicians competing to claim credit for getting rid of the foreigners .
A “ withdrawal agreement ” approved by the Iraqi cabinet on November 16th requires American troops to pull out of Iraqi towns and cities by the end of June next year , and to leave Iraq altogether by December 31st 2011 .
Those deadlines , said Iraq 's prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , in a televised address , would not be extended .
The deal was not perfect , but marked “ a solid start for Iraq to regain its full sovereignty in three years . ”
There were no secret articles , he said , and there would be no permanent American bases .
Iraq could not be used to attack others ( ie , Syria or Iran ) .
There would be , he promised , “ no detainees any more , no detention centres any more , no searches or raids of buildings or houses , until there is an Iraqi judicial warrant and it is fully co-ordinated with the Iraqi government . ”
This is a big moment for America and Iraq , yet the Iraqi government was more regretful than jubilant , calling the deal the best it could achieve after more than a year of negotiations .
The Bush administration , now in its last weeks in power , made several concessions .
It had long opposed any notion of a fixed timetable for withdrawal , saying any troop pull - out had to be based on security conditions on the ground .
The White House said the new deadlines were “ aspirational ” , but the text leaves less wiggle - room ; clauses allowing for a review of the deadline , and the possibility that some American troops would stay on to train and support Iraqi forces , have been deleted .
Security has improved markedly .
But the political context has also shifted against the Bush administration — and the Iraqis have got their timetable .
In America , Ike Skelton , chairman of the House armed services committee , a Democrat , said he was worried by provisions that could result in American troops facing prosecution in Iraqi courts .
But the text suggests that this is a remote possibility .
Iraq has legal jurisdiction over American troops only in cases of “ major and intentional crimes ” , and even then only when they are outside their bases and off - duty .
The agreement should make life easier for Barack Obama , although there is some dispute as to whether it will have to be ratified by the American Congress .
The deal supports the president - elect 's principle of a firm timetable for leaving Iraq , but allows him to draw out the process beyond the 16 - month withdrawal he promised in his campaign .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said America had so much equipment that it would take two or three years to withdraw completely — security conditions permitting .
The agreement was strongly endorsed by the Iraqi cabinet but its passage through the Iraqi parliament , which could vote on it as early as November 24th , is less assured .
There were brawls among the lawmakers when it was discussed on November 19th .
In a country with a history of intense opposition to military pacts with an invading power , the deal could polarise opinion .
Followers of Muqtada al - Sadr , the radical Shia cleric who heads a powerful ( though now dormant ) private army , oppose the treaty and demand an immediate withdrawal of foreign troops .
Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , Iraq 's most senior Shia cleric , says any agreement had to restore Iraqi sovereignty and win “ national consensus ” .
But he did not oppose it , which supporters take as tacit assent .
Some Sunnis want the agreement to be put to a referendum .
Another contentious issue is the status of some 17,000 ( mostly Sunni ) prisoners in American hands .
The Iraqi government is due to take responsibility for them , but some Sunni leaders want them all released .
Iran is equivocal .
The speaker of its parliament , Ali Larijani , said America was seeking to turn Iraq into a vassal .
But the leader of Iran 's judiciary , Ayatollah Mahmud Hashemi Shahrudi , said the Iraqi government “ has done very well ” .
Some interpret this as Iranian endorsement .
But like so much else in Iran , it is hard to pick out a genuine signal from the political noise .

05 . The Business of Paganism : Modern Paganism fuels a multi-million - dollar market .
Books , trinkets , festivals , music , and conventions maintain a small ( though lucrative for some ) cottage industry .
2008 was a mixed bag for that industry , one that was rocked by corporate greed , businesses shutting down , and contraction .
If all this sounds familiar , it just proves that “ as above , so below ” relates to economic matters too .
The “ New Age ” market , which sees quite a lot of overlap with our own , rushed to embrace a post - Oprah reality though it was n’t enough to avoid a major trade show cancellation for 2009 .
Meanwhile the Internet book - selling giant Amazon sent ripples through the Pagan publishing world when they threatened to remove the “ buy ” button for non-Amazon print - on - demand books ( a case that has resulted in an antitrust lawsuit ) .
“ So why not just switch over to [ Amazon ’s ]
Booksurge , you may ask ?
Two reasons …
They ’re more expensive – they want a significantly larger cut of the profits than many others …
Their distribution is n’t as good …
So why not just have accounts at both Lightning Source and Booksurge ?
Because the cost to upload books would double …
So why not just use offset and other traditional forms of printing ?
Because you need thousands of dollars up front , even for a small run , plus warehousing space–and you have to hope that they all sell or else you ’re out a good deal of money .
Given that the big box stores are already biased against small presses , big losses are a major possibility … ” – Lupa , author and employee of Immanion Press .
In addition to all that , two Pagan - friendly music labels shuttered , niche magazines find themselves hanging on by a thread , and journalists are looking into just how recession - proof psychic and occult services really are .
All this could add up to some belt - tightening for the Pagan world in the years to come .
04 . Salem Becomes the Epicenter of Halloween in America :
While the economy may be bad all over , the town of Salem , at least this year , seemed immune .
Famous for putting women to death for being “ witches ” in generations past , this sea-side New England town has morphed into a haven for Pagans and Witches ( who purportedly make up 10 % of the local population ) and a tourist draw of Mardi Gras proportions .
“ For better or worse , this change from cheesy wax - works and trial re-enactments into a massive cultural ( and money - making ) multi- week event is partially due to the emergence of Witches and modern Pagans injecting a sense of the sacred ( and the psychic ) into the proceedings .
It may never be officially called a Samhain festival , but for all intents and purposes this is America ’s tribute to Summer ’s End . ”
Given these factors it is little wonder that Salem continues to make the news on a regular basis , from game shows to pop- documentaries , everyone wants in on the action .
Like it or not ( and some very much do n’t like it ) , this town casts a long shadow on our communities and on the public perception concerning modern Pagans .
03 . Witch - Hunts , Witch - Killings , and How it Affects Us : While there is still much debate over how modern Pagans and Witches should feel concerning the persecution of “ witches ” in Africa , India , and the Middle East , 2008 saw the issue affect our communities more than ever before .
The most notable case of this phenomenon were efforts by lawyer , author , and activist Phyllis Curott to bring attention to the plight of Fawza Falih , an illiterate Saudi woman sentenced to death for crimes of “ witchcraft ” .
“ I get articles about killings from the African and Indian press almost every day .
People – so often women – are singled out and murdered just because of an accusation of Witchcraft .
We know what that means .
That is part of our history .
I think we need to respond to that dangerous persecution wherever it arises .
It has to be stopped before it spreads .
But it may be years before our community is large enough , has enough resources and enough presence in the global community to affect these situations .
Working to save Fawza can teach us how to be effective the next time something like this happens — we ’ll have better skills , better organization , better contacts , more wisdom . ”
This was hardly the only instance – intentional or not – of modern Pagans getting involved in the issue of international witch persecutions .
India continues to religiously cross-pollinate with Western esotericism and Paganism and Indian Pagans there see witch persecutions as “ their ” issue , while Pagans in South Africa continue to fight vaguely - worded anti-witch laws .
Meanwhile some have warned that witch - persecutions are being exported to the West , and the controversies over Thomas Muthee ( and his connection to fringe Christian movements in America ) seem to at least partially verify this concern .
So while there may be no theological or cultural connection between us the “ witches ” persecuted across the world , our communities may find that we have no choice but to get involved .
02 . The Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church Shootings : On Sunday morning , July 28th , Jim Adkisson , who defined himself to neighbors as a “ Confederate ” and a “ believer in the old South ” , walked into the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church and opened fire with a shotgun .
Seven people were inured by gunfire , two died .
He later told police that he targeted the church for its liberal beliefs , and that if he could n’t kill liberal leaders he would instead kill those who voted them into office .
While I suppose this is n’t necessarily a “ Pagan ” story , it is one that has a deep resonance for all Pagans who have found sanctuary or a spiritual home within a Unitarian - Universalist Church , a place of welcoming in areas of the country not so friendly to modern Pagans .
“ Friends of mine were in the church at the time of the shooting .
I am feeling so fortunate that they were not injured , but I have heard so much about the sad loss of Greg McKendry , who evidently put himself between the gunman and members of the congregation .
There ’s no ifs here , there are pagans and members of CUUPS in that congregation .
When I first heard the news , even before anything about the gunman ’s motives were known , I could n’t help but guess that it was because the UU * is* the sort of church it is – welcoming , and accepting of pagans , of religious diversity , of glbt , and human diversity . ”
– Sangrail
Over the years some have found it easy to mock Unitarian - Universalists for their “ wishy - washy ” faith or their over - earnest attempts at inclusion , but few realized what a target their theological openness and political bravery had made them .
I ’m proud of the time and energy I ’ve spent within the UUA , and the Pagan community should never forget what an ally and asset they have been to us .
This attack was on a UU Church , but it was also an attack on those who would stand with us , and we should n’t forget that .
01 . Pagans and Politics :
By far the biggest story of 2008 involving Pagans was our political interactions .
I ’ve never seen so much news related to , involving , or dealing with modern Pagans in a political context .
Things started early as influential figures in the Women ’s Spirituality movement split over who to support in the Democratic primaries , while pundits on the right started to see Paganism as an illness that could be “ cured ” ( like homosexuality ) .
Barack Obama seemed almost magical to some Pagans , and was dubbed a “ lightworker ” by Mark Morford .
Pagans ran for mayor of Sacramento and South Carolina ’s Great Falls Town Council ( neither won ) , while the Democratic Party saw two openly Pagan delegates go to their national convention .
“ We ’ve got a great opportunity here , a chance to make our mark on a campaign for change , a chance to be a constant reminder that we expect “ Change We Can Believe In ” means an America that treats Pagans fairly and equally …. from an ensured right to worship for military Pagans ( including Pagan chaplains ) , to true enforcement of the separation of Church ( Grove ? ) and State . ” – Rita Moran , Change Who Can Believe in ?
Democratic Pagans seemed to really like Obama , and some tried to use that affection against him ( they liked that strategy so much they used it in other elections as well ) .
Meanwhile Bob Barr kinda - sorta recanted of his anti-Pagan past in an attempt to gain the votes of disaffected Pagan libertarians while McCain doubled down on Christian nuttery by picking a VP candidate with ties to a rabidly anti-Pagan fringe sect ( meanwhile , outside , Pagans protested ) .
The press realized that Oregon had quite a few Pagan voters , a Republican in Paganistan won reelection despite ties to anti-Pagan groups , and an Witch Doctor correctly predicted Obama ’s win .
Oh ?
Did I mention that that Obama won , and that an overwhelmingly large number of Pagans voted for him ( and we even influenced the people who like us to vote for him too ) ?
Well he did ( though Pagans are n’t too happy about the guy they picked to give the invocation at his inauguration ) .
Like it or not , politics and Paganism are enmeshed and will most likely stay that way for some time to come .
That wraps up my top ten news stories about or affecting modern Paganism in 2008 .
Thanks for reading , and I hope you ’ll join me for another year of sifting through the news and views of interest to our communities .
See you in 2009 !

Pop quizzes are frequent for students in Robert Proctor ’s history of science classes .
“ How old is the earth ? ” “ How many millions in a billion ? ” “ Are you convinced that humans share a common ancestry with apes ? ”
Proctor ’s passion is figuring out not only what his students know , but also what they do n’t know .
His drive is to explore aspects of science that most do n’t see .
A professor of the history of science at Stanford University , Proctor has taught courses as varied as “ The Changing Concept of Race , ” “ Tobacco and Health in World History , ” and “ Human Origins : Evidence , Ideology , and Controversy . ”
His ever - roving eye tends to focus on bad science made during good times , good science made in bad times , and the mass of ignorance lodged in our collective minds as a result of both .
Proctor is living what he calls “ the ultimate dabbler ’s fantasy , ” taking on subjects that appeal to his questioning spirit .
But the motivation behind that dabbling is often principled outrage and a drive to right wrongs .
Some of those wrongs are big ones — he has been the scourge of the tobacco industry , testifying against it in many cases and writing books and articles about what those in the industry knew , when they knew it , and how they campaigned to hide certain facts .
Other wrongs are seemingly small : Proctor notes that the agates he collects and polishes , although unique and rare , are considered cheap , while diamonds , plentiful and homogeneous , somehow have great value .
Last May saw the release of Proctor ’s latest book , Agnotology : The Making & Unmaking of Ignorance , coedited with Londa Schiebinger .
DISCOVER caught up with him at his Stanford office .
Just what is agnotology ?
It ’s the study of the politics of ignorance .
I ’m looking at how ignorance is actively created through things like military secrecy in science or through deliberate policies like the tobacco industry ’s effort to manufacture doubt through their “ doubt is our product ” strategy [ spelled out in a 1969 tobacco company memo [ pdf ] ] .
So it ’s not that science inherently always grows .
It can actually be destroyed in certain ways , or ignorance can actually be created .
How common is the active creation of ignorance ?
It ’s pretty common .
I mean , in terms of sowing doubt , certainly global warming is a famous one .
You know , the global warming denialists who for years have managed to say , “ Well , the case is not proven .
We need more research . ”
And what ’s interesting is that a lot of the people working on that were also the people working for Big Tobacco .
Really ?
Yeah .
The techniques of manufacturing doubt were created largely within the tobacco industry , and then they were franchised out to other industries .
I have a chapter in my book Cancer Wars called “ Doubt Is Our Product , ” which is about the hundreds and hundreds of different industries that use these techniques of sowing doubt in order to minimize hazard , as do various trade associations .
One of their goals is the idea of sowing doubt or questioning statistics .
And they ’re very powerful .
You know the old saying : For every Ph.D. there ’s an equal and opposite Ph.D .
You have a unique take on the relationship between ideology and science .
Bad ideologies can produce good science , and good ideologies can produce bad science .
In my book The Nazi War on Cancer , I showed that a horrific ideology can produce world - class science , and in my human origins work I showed that liberal antiracism can produce bad science .
One of the things I teach in my class is that the history of science is the history of confusion , and there are many , many confusions .
In a lot of my work I look at how even crazy prejudices can sometimes create good science .
For instance , we all think the Nazis were crazy , but in fact , you know , they did some amazing science — not just in spite of their ideology , but actually because of their ideology .
And that ’s the same with all strong ideologies .
The Piltdown hoax [ the 1912 discovery of a supposed skull of early man , which 40 years later was determined to be a human cranium and ape jaw fraudulently joined together ] was actually perceived [ as a hoax ] fairly early on by creationists because they refused to believe that this could have been a real skull .
What are other examples of good science coming from bad ideologies ?
We tend to forget that the first manned space flight was produced at the height of the Soviet empire .
I think the example of Mayan archaeoastronomy is an interesting one .
There you have very competent elites who are involved in sort of blending calendrical astronomy with human sacrifice .
That gets pretty hairy .
How did you develop this line of interest ?
Well , I have a lot of curiosity about the world .
I ’m very interested in combining science with politics and ethics .
And I like to do what I call activist history of science — a history of science that is relevant to present - day policy and present - day suffering and also to historical suffering .
So I like to use history to inform the present , but I also like to use the present to inform history .
It seems you have endless curiosity .
I ’m amazed by people who do n’t ask questions constantly .
I was raised to think that the good life is asking questions and then always realizing that there are infinitely many more questions and that basically what we know is an infinitesimal part of what we might know .
I ’m interested in human suffering .
I ’m interested in the big , unanswered questions — in the massive infinity of ignorance that we swim in .
Have you continued your focus on tobacco ?
I recently collaborated on an exhibit of the most outrageous tobacco ads called “ Not a Cough in a Carload . ”
It ’s centered on medical - themed tobacco ads : that tobacco ’s good for your T - zone , that it calms your nerves .
Scientific tests prove that brand A is better than B , or , you know , 20,000 physicians recommend Camels , and so forth .
The use of athletes and models , and the artwork is just beautiful .
How did this kind of marketing come about ?
It was pioneered by the tobacco industry .
They set out to have a massive public relations campaign to defend tobacco at all costs against science .
They wanted science that was good PR .
I think it ’s mainly a post–World War II phenomenon , although there are a couple of exceptions if you go back earlier for specific industries .
In the 1920s , lead was almost banned from both paint and gasoline , and the lead industry set out to have a campaign that softened the critiques .
And then in the 1930s , you get Big Tobacco manufacturing consumer drive and convincing people this is a cool , natural thing to do , so it ’s part of the history of marketing .
It ’s the applying of marketing techniques to science , which is rather diabolical in a lot of ways .
You ’ve been very involved in tobacco litigation .
What is the history of that industry ’s response to challenges ?
The tobacco industry started responding particularly in the 1950s with propaganda .
That ’s when they started their doubt campaign — the manufacturing of doubt , the manufacturing of ignorance .
It was really rather new , certainly on the scale at which they pursued it .
It was a new way of using science as an instrument of deception .
And that ’s become important recently .
Franchised down into the global warming issue are the same techniques .
Demanding ever - greater precision , invoking doubt , questioning the physical methods .
Raising alternate possibilities .
The whole realm of smoke screens and distractions .
How do you maintain the perspective essential to your kind of research ?
Well , I have three emotional principles in all my work .
One is wonder , another is sympathy , and the third is critique .
These are virtues of different disciplines that are generally not combined .
Wonder we think of as a traditional scientific discipline or motive .
It ’s great to wonder at the grandeur and glory of the universe , the childlike wonder , the Stephen Jay Gould wonder , the Einsteinian wonder .
But there ’s also the traditional historical virtue of sympathy , which is to realize that the world we live in really is kind of a moment in time when we have the entire history of the universe behind us that we can explore as well .
And when it comes to human interpretation , it ’s important to see the past the way the people saw it .
So I ’ve written two books on Nazi medicine , and the goal there was not just to condemn them , but to see how in the world they came up with those ideas and those movements and how they justified them to themselves .
So we see them as full humans and not just scarecrows , so we can actually understand the depth of the depravity or whatever .
But at least we see it honestly , and that ’s a traditional historical virtue .
The third principle is critique , which is to realize that we ’re humans first .
If we ’re cosmologists or historians , we ’re at least humans first and then cosmologists and historians .
We need to critique and show that there ’s a lot of garbage out there , and we do n’t want to be apologists for some horrific status quo where people are dying by the millions .
And so we do n’t just want to see things through other people ’s eyes and we do n’t want to just wonder at the glory of nature .
We want to realize that there ’s horrific suffering in the world and that we , as humans and as scholars , have a duty to do something about it .
Should other scientists be driven by the same motives ?
I think they ’re good principles , certainly .
We need to see the big picture .
Scientists are often involved in work that ’s just a small fraction of the picture .
There are going to be specific motives for the research we do .
Geology is centered on exploration for new fuels and things like that .
But anytime we decide to fund one type of research rather than another , that ’s a kind of political decision .
It ’s a social decision .
It ’s a collective decision about what we want to view as important .
You work in such widely different fields .
Why did n’t you choose a specialty ?
Something is lost when people specialize .
I like to see things like an amateur .
The word amateur is literally “ lover , ” it ’s from amore .
Professionalism is often the death of intellectual inquiry .
So I think there ’s a kind of virtue of systematic amateurism that really needs to be rekindled .
If you do n’t love and hate and play and joke with your objects of study , then you ’re really not treating them properly .
I tell my students if you ’re not angry and excited and enthralled by your topic , you should choose a different one .
How difficult is it to always be sorting out truth from lies — and to spend so much time thinking about ignorance ?
I ’m not a skeptic ; I ’m a pragmatist .
I think we have to live in the world and ca n’t be skeptical of everything .
Trust is a fundamental part of being human .
You have to evaluate the source , but you ca n’t be hypercritical or you ’d drive yourself crazy .
I believe in the common sense of most people .
There ’s a great deal of common sense in the world .
There ’s also a lot of common ignorance .
It ’s nearly boundless .

Seriously , it gets personal .
PHOENIX --
It 's a chilly , wet December afternoon in the alleged Valley of the Sun and a mud-covered Kurt Warner is lost .
He 's just finished helping build an elementary school playground and is driving home to stuff Christmas stockings for more than 100 foster kids when his cell phone rings .
It 's Arizona Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt , congratulating the 37 - year - old quarterback for making his third Pro Bowl , his first as a Cardinal .
Warner asks which of his teammates made the team , then reacts to his own good fortune with the enthusiasm of someone who is yawning .
" That 's great thanks Coach I could n't have done it without the opportunity see you tomorrow . "
And just like that , the conversation is over , the career renaissance complete .
Eight years since Warner came out of an Iowa supermarket to lead the St. Louis Rams to a Super Bowl title , he is once again one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL .
Despite his struggles the past two weeks , Warner 's on - the - field success has shined an even stronger spotlight on his off - the - field deeds , which , depending on your perspective , are either saintly or too good to be true .
It 's the reason his wife , Brenda , refers to him as " Pollyanna , " and his teammates ' wives kiddingly call him " Jesus . "
But as the Warners will tell you , for every blessing there is a burden .
Because for every person in the NFL who loves Kurt Warner , who puts him on a pedestal and believes we need more faith - driven athletes who spend their time and money helping others , there are those -- current and former teammates included -- who roll their eyes , keep their distance or simply feel uncomfortable around the quarterback .
On this day , at least Kurt Warner is lost .
At least in the middle of all this selflessness , humility and utter lack of ego , the man is texting while driving , paying little attention to the road and can't remember if the path home follows I - 10 East or I - 10 West .
Because otherwise , ugggh .
Otherwise , this story might need to come with its very own barf bag .
And Warner knows it .
" Kurt is a terrible driver .
He thinks he has to pass every car he can see .
He got away with it in St. Louis .
He 'd sign an autograph and be on his way .
But here , with those speed cameras , let 's just put it this way :
He 's had to revisit traffic school . "
- Brenda Warner
The Arizona Cardinals have just lost to the Minnesota Vikings 35 - 14 and Kurt Warner is limping .
His throwing hand is wrapped in so much ice that it looks as if the quarterback has a massive club screwed into the end of his right elbow .
His body is bruised .
His ego is battered .
He wants nothing more than to get home to his seven kids , who range in age from 3 to 19 .
They do n't like football , they wo n't know the score .
But Warner can't leave University of Phoenix Stadium until he visits 30 guests from the Sunshine Acres Foster Home waiting for him in a stale white room across the hall from the Cardinals ' locker room .
A half hour after the game ends , the quarterback walks into the room , sits down and apologizes that he wo n't be able to sign autographs because of his hand .
" I 've been better , " he says .
" But it is what it is .
How are you guys ? "
Nobody responds to Warner , so he tries again .
" So who 's ready for Christmas ? "
Silence .
And that 's when it becomes clear .
Nobody knows what to say .
Not after that game .
Not after watching Warner underthrow some receivers , overthrow others and get treated by the Vikings as if he were their own personal tackling dummy .
Sure , these kids are his guests , sure it's his foundation that gave them tickets and brought them to this room , to meet No. 13 , but they 're nervous , insecure and uneasy .
They do n't want to say the wrong thing .
So Warner tries again .
" What 's the problem here ? " he asks .
" You all look like you just lost a football game .
You guys tired ?
Beaten up ?
You look like I feel .
Why is everyone so quiet ?
Loosen up .
Tell me about yourselves . "
One boy asks Warner how old he is , a little girl asks what it feels like to get hit .
And one of the chaperones , knowing Warner is without a contract for the 2009 seasons , asks how long he plans to play .
Brenda interjects , asking for a show of hands as to who thinks her husband should retire .
Two hands in the room go up .
Brenda's .
And Kurt's .
" If he wants to walk away , that 's fine with me , " Brenda says .
" I love watching him do what he was born to do , but at the same time , it 's hard watching a bunch of grown men try to hurt your husband almost every day . "
Warner later insists he has n't made a decision about retirement and that it is n't exactly the right time of year to be reading into his future .
Everyone wants to retire in December , he says .
But one has to look no further than a hallway in the Warners ' house to understand where football ranks .
There , atop a massive black safe in which the home 's previous owners used to store valuables , the Pete Rozelle Super Bowl MVP trophy sits tarnished , dusty and covered in fingerprints .
A replica of the Vince Lombardi Trophy looks much the same .
A bunch of other trophies , commemorating everything from playing in the Pro Bowl to winning NFL Player of the Year honors , are tossed into the glorified box , with the door left open , less on display than just out of the way .
Warner 's Super Bowl ring is there , too .
For now .
It 's an ongoing joke in the Warner family -- all the unique places the ring has popped up over the years .
Like under the couch , in the pool .
Do n't be mistaken .
The man likes to win .
Perhaps no one has been more irritated by the Cardinals ' disappointing losses to Minnesota and New England in the past two weeks than Warner , who appeared visibly frustrated on the sideline during both games .
Yet , his eyes are set on a bigger picture .
" People think that whatever happens on the football field should define me way one or the other , " Warner says .
" A lot of people say I can't believe you do n't think more highly of yourself , two - time MVP , Super Bowl MVP , but it 's like whatever
It just happens to be what I do .
I want to be defined by what I believe in , by who I am . "
It explains how Warner can at least temporarily set aside the loss to Minnesota and be " on " for the kids from Sunny Acres .
It explains why , before Warner leaves , he will rip the bandage off his right hand , push the bags of ice to the side , grab a marker and do exactly what he said he could n't do : sign autographs .
There will be smiles .
There will be laughter .
There will be pictures .
And of course , there will be prayer .
" People think he 's perfect , but as a dad , he 's completely ignorant to everything a teenage girl is going through .
He does n't know how to deal with my fights with my boyfriend or any of my teenage issues or anything like that .
Then he tells me I 'm just a 16 - year - old girl and I do n't understand .
He just demeans me as a stereotypical teenager .
I ca n't stand that . "
- Jesse Warner , 16
Nine - year - old Isaiah Acosta wants nothing more than to speak , nothing more than to put into words what Kurt Warner means to him .
But he can't .
Isaiah is one of a handful of children in the United States who was born without a mandible .
His chin is deformed , he breathes through a tracheotomy tube and spends much of his time attached to his mom , using her as human security blanket .
Kurt Warner visits with guests from the Sunshine Acres Foster Home and signs autographs .
He seemingly never turns down an autograph request .
Mark Rebilas for ESPN.com
Yet a couple years ago , when Isaiah joined Warner and his family on a trip to Disney World , he left his mom behind .
For the first time , he let go of her hand and ran off , spending sunrise to sunset with the man he knew as Kurt .
Together , they rode the rides , watched the shows , and when Isaiah had an accident , there was Warner , picking up the boy , whisking him to a souvenir store , slapping down his credit card and buying a pair of Mickey Mouse underwear so fast the kid barely knew what happened .
A few months later , back in Arizona , Warner surprised Isaiah by showing up at Chuck E. Cheese 's for his eighth birthday .
If you press Isaiah to talk about Warner , ask about the autographed jerseys , the overstuffed photo albums or the fact he makes his mom snap a picture of Warner every time they see the quarterback on television , the boy pulls out his computerized voice box and sums it up : " I like Kurt Warner .
He is my hero . "
Isaiah is just one child .
His story is just one of thousands out there from people whom Warner and his First Things First Foundation have touched .
Maybe it was through a trip to Disney World , maybe it was a newly furnished home , a special - needs football clinic or a scholarship for a mission trip .
Maybe it was a fresh start in what was once a flood - ravaged section of Cedar Rapids , Iowa , Warner 's hometown , or new winter coats for a struggling single mother and her three children in St. Louis .
There are thousands of Isaiahs out there , people convinced that when Warner smiles , he 's smiling at them .
People who ask Warner for an autograph , expecting he 'll always say yes .
" We have a rule that he does n't sign autographs when we 're out for dinner with the kids , " Brenda said .
" But sometimes , it 's easier just to sign and smile than to say no 100 times .
It 's a blessing that God has put us in a position where someone wants a signature from us , but it 's a burden that we constantly have to share our time with everyone else . "
Just walk into Isaiah 's home , see the boy look for Warner and then stomp his feet when he realizes the quarterback is n't coming and you get it .
Being Kurt Warner comes with expectations .
And every time he says yes or helps another family , the bar is raised .
" Sure , there are times where there 's pressure that comes with all of this , " Warner said .
" But if there 's any kind of pressure you want to be under , it 's people expecting you to be a person of character .
" The missing piece in this whole thing of me serving and giving back is that the reward is so much greater for me than it is for any of the people I 've impacted .
The perspective it gives me , the feeling it gives me inside when I know I 'm doing what God called me here to do that 's when I feel most alive . "
" Kurt has absolutely no skills as a handyman .
He tried to build a desk at the foundation once and we ended up with a crooked desk and a bag full of leftover pieces .
And you know what he said ?
He told us they always give you extra parts .
Umm , no Kurt .
They do n't . "
- Marci Pritts , Executive Director , First Things First Foundation
Warner has one hand on the steering wheel and the other buried in a carton of french fries when the conversation turns to how he 's perceived .
He knows what some people think -- that he 's a do - no - wrong perfectionist who does n't curse , does n't drink and lives this straight - laced , holier - than - thou life .
Isaiah Acosta 's life was forever changed when he met Warner .
Mark Rebilas for ESPN.com
And in a way , he understands .
That 's what happens when you talk about Jesus , mention God or explain your selfless ways by professing your faith .
That 's what happens when you pass out football cards that in bold , red letters proclaim : " Read The Bible -- Attend Church -- Pray to God -- Tell Others About Jesus . "
And that 's what happens when , after winning the Super Bowl MVP award , you stand on the biggest stage of your life and begin a postgame interview by saying , " First things first , I 've got to thank my Lord and Savior above . "
June 20 , 1996 .
That 's the day the football cards that Warner hands out say he was " born again . "
Warner grew up in a religious family , but not until he met Brenda in college at the University of Northern Iowa , not until a couple of his Iowa Barnstormers teammates and she started pressing Warner on his beliefs , did he truly dig into the Bible searching for answers .
What he discovered was a whole new life .
" Now he 's reading that we should n't have premarital sex , we should n't drink in excess or be drunk , " Brenda Warner said .
" He 's finding all these things and calling me on it .
So we had to make changes .
He wanted to get our lives right .
He decided no sex for the year until we were married .
Who does that ?
Who goes back ?
But he found that in the Bible and wanted to live that way .
" He made the decision that if he was going to do this , it would be all the way , it would n't be pick and choose like I was doing . "
Since then , Kurt Warner has never wavered , building a reputation as arguably the most high - profile Christian in professional football .
Sure there are others who share his beliefs and his desire to help others , but few with the platform of a two - time NFL MVP .
" I do n't think anyone has a bad perception of me , " Warner said .
" Just a limited one .
Everyone thinks I pretty much sit around and talk about Jesus all the time .
But I 'm normal .
I 'm just a guy .
Yeah , I love Jesus and do things a bit different , but I have the same conversations and the share the same thoughts as anyone else . "
Former Arizona teammate Josh McCown , now a quarterback with the Carolina Panthers , believes NFL players are split almost down the middle when it comes to Warner .
There are players like McCown and Cardinals receiver and close friend Larry Fitzgerald who look up to Warner and are amazed by his faith - driven selfless ways .
And there are others who simply are n't comfortable around the quarterback .
" I 've heard it all , " McCown said .
" Holy Roller , Bible thumper .
And then there are the guys who do n't want to be around him because they feel like he 's judging them , which is hilarious because people will say that and Kurt 's never said a word to them .
There are even fellow Christians who roll their eyes because it bothers them . "
Said Warner : " I think a lot of times where people see they 're insufficient or lacking in certain areas they feel they 're being judged even when they 're not .
And they condemn themselves more than anyone else does .
But that 's part of it .
That 's part of this stigma , this preconceived idea of who I am . "
This past summer , Warner invited his Cardinals teammates and their families to his home for a day of swimming and eating .
Barely anyone showed up .
Warner believes the perception , still after all these years , was partly to blame .
" When I asked Larry [ Fitzgerald ] what happened , he told me that everyone is afraid to come over because they do n't know if I 'm going to stand up on a podium and preach to them , " Warner said .
" They just think I 'm going to jump up and down and introduce them to Jesus .
But that 's crazy .
And the people who know me realize that 's not who I am . "
The poor turnout disappointed Warner , Brenda said .
" We try to keep it normal so that people do n't think we 're a bunch of weirdos , but that perception is out there , " she added .
" We fight it every day . "
He fights it in the locker room , where some teammates do n't feel comfortable around Warner and giggle like little kids on rare occasions when he curses .
They fight it in the marketing world , where Warner 's agent struggles to find endorsement opportunities for a potential Hall of Fame quarterback with a pristine off - the - field résumé .
And they fight it in the media , where Warner tries to walk the line of getting his message out to the public without alienating fans .
During a visit to the " Oprah Winfrey Show " to honor Masters champion and fellow Iowan Zach Johnson a couple of years ago , Warner purposely mentioned Johnson 's faith in the second of three sentences , believing the show 's editors would n't be able to cut the sentence and eliminate the religious reference .
But when the show ran , the second sentence was gone .
Warner was n't content just to go through the motions while helping Riverbend Prep with its new playground .
Mark Rebilas for ESPN.com
" Anytime you mention Jesus or faith , people are turned off , " Warner said .
" I think it scares a lot of people . "
McCown and Fitzgerald insist that Warner is a normal guy who talks about normal things , like sex .
During an intense game or practice , it is n't unusual , they said , for Warner to unleash a " God damn " or a " Jesus Christ . "
And they said they 've never seen the quarterback openly preach to a teammate in the locker room .
" He 's a devout Christian , but it is n't like he forces it on anybody , " Fitzgerald said .
McCown believes Warner has changed since St. Louis .
" He 's learning to share his faith without having to talk about it as much , " McCown said .
" Instead , he leads by example . "
Warner said he leads by carrying his Bible with him to every news conference .
He leads by being one of the hardest workers on the team .
And he leads by treating every single person -- a first - round quarterback or Brenda 's ex-husband -- with respect .
" Who does that ? " Brenda said .
" Who 's friendly to their wife 's ex-husband He is . "
To Warner , that 's his way of preaching .
" By understanding what my priorities are and never wavering , that 's how you influence people , " Warner said .
" It is n't standing on my chair with a Bible and yelling out scripture or condemning people for being sinners .
It 's about living your life with a certain sense of excellence .
And when people start to scratch their heads and wonder what it is that makes me different , that 's when I tell them the answer is Jesus .
And then I let him do the hard work . "
" When Kurt 's upset with you , he 's not somebody you want to be around .
I try to get as far from him as I can .
And he 'll still find me on the practice field and absolutely chew me out .
He 's not going to mince words .
He 's going to be brutally honest , whether it 's something you want to hear or not . "
- Larry Fitzgerald
Warner takes his faith with him everywhere he goes , including on the football field .
Mark Rebilas for ESPN.com
Rain is pelting the windows of Riverbend Prepatory Academy in Phoenix as a representative from Home Depot briefs Kurt Warner on what he needs to do to help finish the school 's new playground .
The answer : not much .
Just go outside , pitch in for a few minutes and then you can get out of the rain , sign a few autographs and shake a few hands , the woman tells him .
But Warner is n't having it .
" Look , " he says .
" I 'm here to work . "
The woman apologizes .
" Most guys , you know , on a day like today , would n't want to get their hair wet . "
Warner , of course , is n't like most guys .
He , his wife , his family , his teammates , they 've spent the past four days insisting he 's normal .
They helped compile a list of all the things that make Warner flawed and human , like everyone else .
Warner himself points out that he sings " American Idol " on the Wii with his kids .
He listens to hip - hop in the locker room .
One Thanksgiving a few years ago , he says , a group of teammates taught him how to dance to the hip - hop song , " Walk It Out . "
And he can never escape the everyday roller coaster of being a father of seven .
There 's the fourth - grader who has n't turned in his past three book reports , the 16 - year - old who just found out she got accepted into NYU and the 3 - year - old who is tugging on his pants begging for money to stuff into her change purse .
Yet every time the Warners go out to eat , they ask their kids to select one family in the restaurant to anonymously buy dinner for .
They ask their kids to tell them the eye color of any guests to their home , making sure that they 've made eye contact when introducing themselves .
There are 38 pictures of the Warner kids that cover the walls of the family home gym .
Warner wo n't go on an extended vacation with Brenda because he can't stand to leave his kids for more than a couple of days .
And then there are those 106 overstuffed Christmas stockings lining the entryway to the Warners ' home , filled with socks , toothbrushes , lotions , Tic Tacs , chewing gum and $ 150 gift cards .
No matter how much people argue , Warner is not your usual guy .
Not in the era of me - first , fan - last athletes .
Not with guys like Adam " Pacman " Jones , Terrell Owens and Plaxico Burress roaming around .
So why do some people shake their heads when they hear about the good things Warner does for others ?
Why does the hair on their necks stand up ?
Moments of rest are few and far between in the chaotic Warner household .
Mark Rebilas for ESPN.com
" I think a lot of people relate to athletes who make bad choices because it brings the athlete down to their level , " McCown said .
" It helps them feel good about who they are and what they 're doing .
" On the other side , when you hear the stories about Kurt , here is someone squeezing the most they can out of their life .
And at the end of the day , that causes all of us to look in the mirror .
And I think sometimes we do n't like what that mirror looks like .
So it 's easier to rip on the things Kurt does than change yourself . "
Whatever the explanation , someday soon , Warner will retire .
You 'll hear about the touchdown passes , completion percentages and questions about whether he will be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
But for Warner , this fairy - tale story of grocery boy to Arena League quarterback to NFL star has always been about so much more -- whether you 've ever realized it or not .
" It 's so hard for people to grasp and understand that it 's not about going to the Pro Bowl or winning an MVP , " Warner said .
" It 's about trying to do something that impacts the people around you .
And that 's what I try to do every single day is have an impact on everyone around me .
" So if and when I 'm done and you ask someone about Kurt Warner and the first thing they mention is the kind of person I was , that 's when I 'll be happy . "

Leapin ' Lizards : openSUSE Jumps to 11.1 Tomorrow
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 17 , 2008
Related Blog Posts OpenSolaris Coming to Toshiba Laptops -- Continuing a Trend
On Thursday , the openSUSE project will make available its stable 11.1 release .
I was fortunate enough to take a sneak peek at the new release this week , and while the changes are n't quite as dizzying as those between 10.3 and 11.0 ( understandably ) , they work nicely to make this new release both eye - catching and functional .
Though the final releases will be offered in a variety of architectures with DVD , network install , and liveCD images , I used one of the DVD install images .
openSUSE offered an installer with the 11.0 liveCD , and in its 11.1 beta versions , and I imagine this has not changed .
The DVD install process is slightly different than liveCD installers , but is just as straightforward and offers more from the get - go .
Though I have a 64 - bit system , I used the 32 - bit openSUSE .
Much of this was due to internal compatibility of software ( though I 've found openSUSE to be one of the better Linux distributions when it comes to handling 64 - bit applications -- and Linux is far ahead of other systems here in general ) and the quirkiness some 32 - bit distributions have when booting on 64 - bit systems .
Some 32 - bit distributions require the - noapic argument be added to the kernel commands at boot .
openSUSE has in the past -- this time , it did n't .
A few aspects of YaST , the openSUSE installation utility , have gotten make overs for 11.1 .
I looked at the early changes in the new partitioning module in November , and recently openSUSE stopped using a click - through EULA in favor of an open license agreement and changes in the way optional non-free code is delivered .
Most of the installation is generic -- configuring timezones , keyboard and language localization and default desktop environments .
The GNOME 2.24.1 desktop is available .
For KDE fans , it seems using KDE4 is encouraged , though openSUSE still offers KDE 3.5.10 as a desktop option .
Xfce 4.4.2 and various window managers can be chosen here , as well .
I opted for KDE4 , primarily because it had been some time since I 'd used it , and I 've found traditionally openSUSE has felt more polished on the GNOME front , so changes would likely be more noticeable from the KDE4 desktop .
The previously mentioned license text caused a bit of a stir , with some being concerned that it would be harder to add any desired non-free software ( such as Adobe Flash ) .
openSUSE could n't have found a more elegant way of handling this concern -- as well as the concerns of those who would like a free system .
After the license agreement text displays , there is a checkbox asking if you 'd like the non -free repositories added to your installation .
After you 've made the decision , the non-OSS repositories are added to YaST -- or simply ignored .
The partitioning module , though revamped from 11.0 , is not terribly different from when I took a look at it in beta .
If an operating system exists on your hard disk already , openSUSE will try to repartition , squeezing itself around the existing system and suggest that as the partitioning scheme .
If this is n't what you want ( I tend to reformat / and preserve / home ) , the appropriate choice is to " Create New Partition Setup . "
Editing the partitions you see on the suggested pane will allow some changes , but editing options are limited , and it 's better to leave this alone unless you are planning to run co-existing systems .
One of the areas that openSUSE improved greatly moving from 10.3 to 11.0 , and again from 11.0 to 11.1 is speed .
I expected the DVD media to take some time , as I installed core / suggested packages and selected a few additional package groups .
My live image installs were quite speedy ( and are a relatively new feature to openSUSE ) , but this DVD installation has officially retired the era of the " hour and a half install . "
The actual installation from DVD took a bit longer than a live media install , but live media , of course , offers less initially .
The installation process in its entirety is longer than a liveCD install , mainly due to the fact that with live media some choices are already made for you ( desktop environment , package selection ) .
The real test starts after installation .
My hardware was recognized -- all of it , almost perfectly .
The traditional sticking points with any distribution on my machine tend to be my video card ( which usually gets the NVIDIA generic driver , and graphics acceleration is n't -- can't -- be enabled ) my monitor ( an off - brand LCD ) , and oddly , just in the RPM based distributions , my printer .
My video card was identified correctly , the proper driver was installed ( probably due to the inclusion of the non-OSS repositories ) , and acceleration was enabled on first boot .
My monitor was identified as a VESA monitor , and not a generic LCD , but this happens regardless of distribution .
For the first time in months , I had an RPM - based distribution work with my printer , an Epson Stylus CX7400 .
The drivers selected previously were always correct ( and worked with Debian - based systems ) but never successfully printed anything .
openSUSE 11.1 , with KDE4 , is stable , responsive and feels -- above all -- well thought - out and polished .
I have always preferred GNOME 's rendering of YaST , but there seems to have been some streamlining of YaST 's appearance that makes switching from the GNOME - centric version to the one in KDE feel very natural .
The beauty for me , right now , is that I installed openSUSE , and I have n't had to think about doing much else to make it work , aside from adjusting the monitor settings .
At this time , the safest way to upgrade openSUSE to 11.1 from previous versions is to grab an .iso ( the DVD image installer asks if this is an upgrade , repair , or new install ) .
Joe " Zonker " Brockmeier , openSUSE 's community manager , says that work is being done to make distribution upgrades possible through Zypper in a similar manner to apt - get dist - upgrade , but there 's a little more testing to be done on that front .
openSUSE 11.1 may be an incremental release , and the changes may not particularly call attention to themselves , but sometimes that 's the whole point .
This release builds on the previous version that introduced so many new features -- and was still quite stable and solid -- by smoothing out the rough edges , streamlining both look and behavior , and making something that was initially very nicely done really shine .

Full Magnum Schlieren
“ This full - scale schlieren image shows the discharge of a . 44 Magnum revolver .
Two spherical shock waves are seen , one centered about the gun ’s muzzle ( the muzzle blast ) and a second centered on the cylinder .
The supersonic bullet is visible at the far left .
This weapon produces a bright muzzle flash and a cloud of products of gunpowder combustion that envelops the hands of the shooter .
Such high - speed images help forensics experts understand the transfer of gunpowder traces to the hands when firing a gun . ”
How To Make High - Speed Photos ?
The choice of shutter speed has a profound effect on the way moving subjects are recorded .
For average everyday shooting with standard zooms , a speed over 1 ⁄ 20 to 1 ⁄ 125 second will prevent motion blur ( camera shake ) .
However , as the shutter speed goes past 1 ⁄ 500 second , you can then start to take advantage of the faster shutter speed ’s ability to freeze action .
For high - speed photography ( especially sports photography ) , it is really necessary to get good motion blur - free shots .
But making these speeds possible also requires either wide apertures , bright lighting conditions or an adjustment to the camera ’s ISO speed — or a combination of all three .
Sometime the task of catching the most expressive instant , which can last for only hundredths of a second , becomes very difficult .
In such cases , most photographers use the sequence mode , so that the camera fires several shots as it is panned .
Cameras with a sequence mode let you fire a sequence and then throw out all of the non-sharp or useless images .
If you need to shoot a photo of a girl ’s hair flying about or freeze the splash of a pouring drink , strobe is the way to do it .
Most photographers use electronic flash as the lighting source in studios to freeze motion .
Since electronic flash ( strobe ) stays lit between 1/800th and 1/2000th of a second , and because you will usually be shooting at f - stops above f - 8 , everything in the image will be razor sharp .

Royal Philips Electronics NV said Thursday it has developed a handheld device that uses nanotechnology to detect marijuana , cocaine , Speed and other drugs in saliva within 2 minutes .
The Dutch company has struck a deal with Britain 's Concateno PLC , Europe 's largest drug testing company , to market the product to police , spokesman Steve Klink said .
He would not give an estimate for how much the product will cost , or the company 's sales target .
He said the potential market was as large as that for roadside alcohol tests .
" The car is stopped , a swab is taken and put in the device , and in 90 seconds you have a result , " he said .
" An officer could do it while standing next to the car 's window . "
Laws vary by country , but Klink said he expected the test would be used mostly for screening , to detect drivers probably under the influence of illicit drugs .
Philips said the device is faster and easier to use than roadside drug testing devices marketed so far using chromatography — the same technology used in pregnancy tests .
Nanotechnology allows scientists to manipulate materials at the atomic or molecular level .
The Philips device uses tiny particles that bind with drug molecules in saliva .
The device then sweeps the drug - bearing molecules to a detection pad using magnetic fields , the company said .
The company expects the first deliveries to customers in the second half of 2009 , starting with Britain .
Klink said the underlying technology is flexible and will be used in the future for medical tests .
One use Philips is testing is to have the device detect a protein generated by damaged heart muscle .
That could be used to tell whether someone suffering chest pains is having a heart attack , Klink said .
I am still very surprised at this :
“ George W. Bush remains popular among conservative Republicans ( 72 % approve of him ) despite his low overall approval rating .
Meanwhile , moderate and liberal Republicans are as likely to disapprove as to approve of the job he is doing , and Democrats of all political orientations hold Bush in low regard . ”
It raises the question : Short of being caught in bed with a live boy or a dead girl , what does President Bush need to do for this group to disapprove of his performance ?
Is there anything ?
Blind obsequiousness appears to be this group ’s motto .
72 % is a very strong rating —
I ’d like to ask what he would need to do to get this cohort ’s approval rating even higher than 72 % .
Asked another way , where does his record need improving ?

Scientists found that people who show psychopathic behavior are more likely to bully most vulnerable colleagues at work instead of picking out those who might represent greatest value for their career .
It is worth mentioning that because psychopathy has been formally associated with business success , researchers considered that people with psychopathic traits were more likely to bully successful people in their workplace .
However , the new study overturns the popular believe .
Researchers say that most psychopaths do not behave like Jack the Ripper ; quite often they do not have a history of violent crimes .
The study and its results were published in the Journal of Research in Personality .
Statistics show that 1 in 100 people show antisocial behaviors considered psychopathic .
The most popular among them is a coldhearted ability to manipulate people with the goal of accomplishing personal desires .
Together with his colleagues , Kevin Wilson of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Canada , decided to investigate such behavior .
They divided 44 male college students into two groups based on results they registered after passing a test that estimated their psychopathic characteristics .
According to Wilson , none of the participants qualified as psychopath , but a number of students were found to have behavior associated with psychopaths .
Researchers showed to the students faces of unknown people .
Each picture included the name , job and interests of a certain person .
Afterwards , participants were interviewed .
They were asked to provide details about people seen on the photographs .
The results of the interview showed that participants with more psychopathic - like behaviors memorized more details about unsuccessful women and women with sad faces than the normal group on students .
" Psychopaths seem to be better at picking out the most vulnerable victims , " concluded Wilson .

so far has been focused on the banks and the insurance industry , and
that none of this will help unless ordinary people start getting some
relief , but still , there ’s something completely twisted and out of
whack when the best we can come up with is that we need to get
Americans back into the malls .
In fact , that is a good part of what ’s wrong with the US economy : Fully 75 percent of GDP in America is consumer spending .
The problem facing America , and to a great extent the broader world economy , is that we ’ve pretty much met basic human needs long ago , and now it ’s about creating human wants and then convincing people that they need to buy more stuff and more services .
This is wrong in so many ways and on so many levels .
First of all , we do n’t need all this stuff .
Is my life any better
if I go from a 18 - inch TV screen to a 60 - inch TV screen ?
Is it , for
that matter , any better if I go from an old cathode - ray tube to a flat
screen digital display , or from no TV to a TV ?
Is my life any better if I buy a high - performance $ 50,000 BMW than
if I drive a $ 20,000 Honda Civic , or even a $ 5000 used Toyota Corolla
with extended warranty ?
Is my life any better if I live with my wife and my teenage son in
a 4000 - square - foot house than if I live in a 1800 - square - foot or a
1200 - square - foot house ?
The answer is no .
The benefits , if there are any at all , are minuscule , and usually short - lived .
The costs of these trying to satisfy these wants , however , are
enormous .
When I buy the large flat screen TV , I am contributing to the
production of gases , used in the flat screen , that are hundreds of
times more potent greenhouse factors than carbon dioxide , and of
course , from a balance - of - trade perspective , I ’m sending dollars
overseas to wherever the product is made ( none are made in America ) .
If
I buy the $ 50,000 BMW , I contribute to massive waste of resources in
building the vehicle and having it shipped from Germany , as well as
driving it , not to mention to balance - of - trade issue again .
If I buy
the Honda , it may at least be made in America , but again there is all
the energy waste and pollution that goes into its construction .
The
used car , on the other hand , gets good mileage and already exists .
As
for the house , no family , except perhaps one that eschews family
planning and has a baby every year and a half , needs a 4000 - square - foot
house , and any family with 12 kids that might occupy such a palace
would never be able to afford one .
So all this buying does n’t make us happier .
In fact , by saddling us
with massive amounts of debt , it simply enslaves us to jobs that polls
tell us most people are simply desperate to get away from .
Why ,
otherwise , do polls show that so many people want to retire early in an
era when life expectancies are extending , and when people are staying
healthy much longer into old age ?
Why , otherwise , do polls consistently
show that over 60 percent of Americans say they would like to have a
labor union represent them at work if they could get one ?
The reality
is that most jobs , where we spend the majority of our waking hours five
or six days a week , simply suck , and in many ways they suck because
people are so desperate to hang on to them so they can pay their bills
that they do n’t dare speak up or , god forbid , sign a union card .
Secondly , these artificial wants which so dominate our daily lives
and that are instilled in us via slick marketing campaigns , are a
disaster for the environment and for the chances of human survival .
The
earth is a finite resource , while humanity , growing at a prodigious
rate , is gobbling up those resources — water , oil , trees , the oceans , and
the very atmosphere itself - - much faster than even the renewable
resources can replace themselves .
This situation cannot go on , and yet
we ’re told that the goal is to get us back on that rapacious and
self - destructive path as quickly as possible .
Economic growth , we are
always told , is an unambiguous good and is the primary goal of economic
policy , though clearly it can not go on .
Finally , thinking of ourselves as consumers , instead of as citizens
and as people , is destructive of our social nature .
Instead of learning
to build community , and to relate to one another as neighbors and
fellow citizens and human beings , as mere “ consumers , ” we compete to
have more or better stuff , compete to get the best deals on the things
we buy , and compete to get jobs that will help us buy those things .
The
one thing we do not do in a consumer - based model of society is
cooperate .
This is not condition we need to go back to .
Nor can we .

In a year worthy of your rage , metal delivered in spades .
What with the economy circling the drain and Sarah Palin coming down from the tundra and then refusing to go back , 2008 's been the kind of year that really makes you want to smash your head into walls or punch random strangers in the face .
Good thing there were so many awesome records available to serve as a soundtrack for exactly that kind of behavior .
The ten discs below are just the tip of a very big , very heavy iceberg .
Metal seems to grow stronger each year ; 2009 will bring new albums by Mastodon , Deftones , Lamb of God and more .
In the meantime , check these out .
Opeth
Watershed
( Roadrunner )
Opeth 's last album , Ghost Reveries , took its progressive black / death - metal sound to its logical endpoint .
So the band took a sharp left turn , incorporating a new guitarist and drummer , psychedelic studio trickery , odd rhythms and even a female vocalist on the folky , emotionally affecting opening track , " Coil . "
Of course , none of this means that Opeth has forgotten how to bring the heavy : " Heir Apparent " is one of the most assaultive songs of its career , including a drum solo that announces its evolution quite capably .
The Gates Of Slumber
Conqueror
( Profound Lore )
These guys play a classicist , fantasy - minded blend of doom metal and biker rock ; their album cover depicts Conan holding a sword in one hand and a severed head in the other , and looks like it could have come straight off the side of a custom Chevy van .
The riffs are thunderous , the vocals raw - throated and powerful , and the songs epic .
Do n't sleep on this obscure but deserving album .-- Phil Freeman

Tuesday ’s action by the Federal Reserve has placed us into the history books .
The Fed cut the federal funds rate to an unprecedented 0.25 % and gave a rather firm statement that they are prepared to keep the rate at this low level as long as the markets deem it necessary .
When asked why they did n’t cut rates down to 0 a Fed official replied that it would help the credit markets run more smoothly .
The markets do n’t believe that .
In fact , the markets have been trading near the zero percent mark for some time now .
As the market volatility has increased causing 2008 to be one of the most volatile years on record , we are seeing some historical action occur .
First , let us look at 3 key economic indicators :
* Click for sharper image
Let me try to walk you through a few things here .
First , the federal funds rate is now sitting at a historic low .
We are now seeing a zero interest rate policy regardless of what the Fed is saying .
The fact the rate was left at 0.25 is merely symbolic .
What the move signals is the Fed is basically done with monetary measures .
It has no choice .
It has reached the bottom of the barrel .
What led it to the bottom of the barrel is how quickly the red line on the chart above is shooting lower , consumer inflation .
Some are trying to call it “ dis-inflation ” but let us be honest , this is deflation .
This is scaring the Fed into doing unprecedented things .
So why is this deflation ?
Let us count the ways :
( a) Housing market is imploding taking prices down
( b) Employment is skyrocketing keeping wages stagnant for many and wiping out income for others
( c) Stock markets are tanking across the globe .
With nearly $ 50 trillion in global wealth lost in one year .
There is nothing remotely close to calling this inflation .
In fact , the CPI released fell the most on a monthly basis in 61 years .
In fact , this was off the charts since the BLS started keeping track of this data point in 1947 .
It dropped 1.7 percent in November .
Compound that with the 1 percent drop in October and you can quickly see that we are quickly approaching a year over year percent drop on the CPI .
The last time the CPI dropped on a year over year basis was in the early 1950s as you can see from the chart above .
The other point on the chart is the reserve bank credit which is over $ 2.2 trillion .
Now some may argue that this is inflationary .
It is only inflationary if it makes its way into the hands of Joe and Susie public and that is not happening .
How can we tell ?
Because when we look at reserve bank credit which includes much of the bailout funds , banks are pouring them into treasuries and sitting tight :
This is unprecedented .
Banks are scared witless to lend because of the grim reality of all the losses they will face in subsequent quarters .
In fact , most banks are simply gearing up for a long economic winter and bailout funds are being used as a cushion .
The blame does fall with banks but what did one expect with the Treasury lending banks money and at the same time expecting banks to lend with stricter standards ?
It was a losing proposition from day one .
Why ?
First , the massive credit boom of the last 30 years was dependent on a healthy employment base and lax credit .
Now , we have the exact opposite .
We have a quickly deteriorating employment picture and banks are expected to be more strict in lending money .
The only way credit will flow again as it once did is for someone to become the large non-prime lender .
Wall Street and foreign banks took up that role gladly during this decade .
Now , the only entity with enough power to fill that role is the government .
The Federal Reserve in conjunction with the U.S. Treasury are attempting to become the biggest non-prime lender of all time .
Consider that 0.25 a teaser rate for a future of economic trouble .
It sometimes helps to see what is being sacrificed here .
The first major casualty is the U.S. Dollar which got pummeled by the Fed rate cut :
The U.S. Dollar has been in a steady decline .
That is , until early summer of this year when it started a ferocious rally .
What occurred near this time ?
A few things .
Global decoupling was laid to rest and the oil bubble burst .
Massive deleveraging led investors to a common resting spot .
The U.S. Dollar .
Keep in mind the one thing we are not hearing anyone talk about is a strong dollar policy .
Why ?
Because it would n’t sound too good to the American public if the Fed stated that they were systematically trying to destroy the value of the U.S. Dollar on the global exchange markets .
Why ?
Well , unfortunately the massive amount of debt which amounts to approximately $ 49 trillion in the U.S. is simply back breaking .
The Fed is desperately going to do anything it can to bring back inflation even if it means an all out war on the U.S. Dollar .
You need only look at the chart above to see what is happening .
Anyone that has traveled abroad realizes the destruction of the U.S. Dollar .
Let us take a longer view of this and you will understand why :
In the last 7 years the U.S. dollar has fallen a stunning 33 percent .
In global terms we are steadily getting poorer and poorer and the Fed and U.S. Treasury are happy to oblige .
You need to remember that it would be very easy for the Fed to strengthen the dollar .
All they need to do is increase the fed funds rate to encourage saving .
Yet the only people that are saving right now are foreigners and many are happy to invest at 0 percent rates of return :
Is this even good for our country ?
It depends if you enjoy a weak dollar that is systematically being attacked .
The Fed is desperately trying to engineer inflation to get us out of our massive debt .
Remember that in deflation debt is the worst possible thing to have .
The reason for this is asset values are declining while the face value of the note remains the same .
Housing is a perfect example .
Say you bought a home for $ 500,000 and took out a $ 450,000 mortgage .
The home is now worth $ 300,000 .
A current buyer purchase a similar home for $ 300,000 today and takes out a $ 250,000 note .
You have a $ 450,000 mortgage still and the new buyer has a mortgage $ 200,000 cheaper than the one you have .
Now multiply that over thousands of times .
Deflation is to be avoided at all cost because it renders the Fed a wizard behind the curtain ( at least that is what they hope to avoid ) .
It may be worthwhile to take a look at Japan since they went down a similar path :
They followed a zero interest rate policy and injected billions into their banks after their real estate market bubble collapsed and their stock market burst .
If you take a look at the chart above , the Bank of Japan systematically started cutting rates in the early 1990s and has held them low ever since .
Nearly 2 decades after .
How did this help their stock market and real estate market ?
I remember when this argument was made in the initial days how quickly it was brushed off .
We are not Japan echoed the argument .
That is true .
We are different in many ways .
Yet we have similar circumstances especially in our financial markets .
Let us outline at least the similarities and you judge for yourself :
( a) Massive unsustainable real estate bubble
( b) Lax lending standards
( c) Over building
(d) Massive stock market bubble
(e) Stock market and real estate bubbles burst together
( f) Japanese government injects liquidity into banks
(g) Bank of Japan cuts official discount rate to near zero
(h) Start of deflation
We ’re playing out the same scenario above .
Sure , Japan is different culturally and in many other ways but a through h above are essentially what we are living .
That is simply a fact .
We had a real estate bubble and stock market bubble burst together .
We had horrifically bad lending standards .
There was massive over building in real estate .
Our government is now injecting capital into banks .
Our Federal Reserve is approaching the zero interest rate policy .
We are now seeing a taste of deflation .
The only ace in the hole is that the Fed is trying all these other creative instruments to get credit going again .
You know what is the only thing that will work ?
The only way this will work is if the Fed and U.S. Treasury nationalize all banks and enforce lax lending standards and bring back the bubble days .
That way , they can directly oversee how the funds are being disbursed .
Otherwise , banks privy enough to get a cut of the bailout funds will sit comfortably looking for deals as banks not on the bailout list implode .
Next year we know that we will be seeing massive fiscal stimulus and it is hard to say how the market is going to react to an aggressive Fed while the government becomes the number spender .
We ’ve never been down this road before .
Yet the major losers here are those who are prudent and savers .
If you look at savings rates at your local banks , you are looking at another zero interest rate policy .
The notion of dollar cost averaging into the stock market has gone out the window for probably a generation .
If we were to go back to historical rates of 5 to 6 percent many savers would start storing money especially given the current economic shock .
Yet we are doing the opposite .
The Fed now is trying to make rates so low that banks will be forced to lend .
Yet here is the kicker .
A bank would rather have a 0 percent rate of return than a certain loss to a bad borrower .
I mourn for the U.S. Dollar primarily .
It is a very tough time to be a saver with our current Fed and U.S. Treasury destined to annihilate our once mighty greenback .

Elephants in captivity in Europe have a far shorter median lifespan than those living in protected areas in Africa and Asia , a new study has found .
In a study published this week in the journal Science , zoologist Georgia Mason , of the University of Guelph in Canada , and colleagues drew on 45 years of data on more than 4,500 African and Asian elephants worldwide .
The elephants studied lived in European zoos , a wildlife preserve in Kenya , and a Burmese enterprise that uses elephants to harvest timber .
Most of the elephants were female .
The results were shocking .
Ms. Mason and her colleagues found that , excluding premature and still births , zoo - born African elephants had a median life span of 16.9 years , compared with 56 years for animals in the park .
Asian elephants , which are more endangered than their African counterparts , lived for 18.9 years in captivity and 41.7 years in the Burmese timber trade .
The study further noted that Asian elephants had far higher infant mortality rates in zoos , a problem that the authors say had " not significantly improved over time . "
Overweight and stress
The likely causes of these shortened lifespans should be familiar to Americans : obesity and stress .
Overweight pachyderms are found to be prone to cardiovascular disease .
As for stress , the researches found that being moved among zoos and being separated from their mothers put the animals at greater risk .
Time magazine notes another tragic contributor to elephant mortality :
Infanticide is almost unheard of among wild elephants .
Mothers invest two years in their pregnancies , they live in stable matriarchal groups , and females collectively care for the young .
In captivity , mothers are often held in relative solitude , undergo stressful and painful births , and then simply kill the source of all that suffering .
Some mothers , Mason says , may even turn to infanticide because they just do n't know what the small , squirmy creature that suddenly appeared in front of them is .
" Many females in zoos have never seen a calf , " she says , " so they may not recognize it . "
The authors do not advocate an outright ban on elephant captivity ; rather they recommend screening the animals for obesity and signs of stress .
A press release from the University of Guelph notes :
Until these animals ’ problems can be solved , the researchers also call for an end to the importation of elephants from their native countries , the minimizing of inter - zoo transfers , and suggest that breeding elephants should be restricted to those zoos that exhibit no harmful effects in their captive - born animals .
Report charged with bias
The study is not without its detractors .
The New York Times quotes Peter Boyle , the senior vice president for conservation and education at the Association of Zoos and Aquariums , who calls the report “ terribly flawed ” and driven by an antizoo agenda .
Mr. Boyle , an environmental biologist , took issue with the authors ' use of data going back to 1960 , saying that zoo conditions have improved dramatically .
“ If you were looking at the success of heart transplants and you reached back 48 years , you would be obviously biasing the success rate , ” he told the Times .
The Los Angeles Times also quotes Boyle , noting that the study would add to the controversy over whether the Los Angeles zoo should continue with plans to breed Asian elephants .
" This is about elephants in Europe , ” he told the LA Times .
“ There are wonderful zoos in Europe and there are zoos that are not so wonderful . ”

Brenton Johnson , who hosted a recent local - foodÂ gourmet dinnerÂ on his organic farm , Â Johnson 's Backyard Garden , just east of Austin , Texas , represents a new breed of young , organic farmer whose philosophy is to live in harmony with the land and bring back the sustainable ways .
Naturally ( no pun intended ) , he advocates buying local food .
In between tending his turnips and perusing the potatoes , Brenton penned this wise , authoritativeÂ list , which he agreed to share with us .
( We could n't write it any better . )
This is n't just about helping the local farmer , it 's about preserving our planet ( and eatin ' better , too ! ) .
Why Buy Local ?
1. Locally grown food tastes better .
Food grown in your own community is usually picked within the past day or two .
It 's crisp , sweet , and loaded with flavor .
Produce flown or trucked in from Florida , Chile , Mexico , or Holland is , quite understandably , much older .
Several studies have shown that the average distance food travels from farm to plate is 1,500 miles .
In a weeklong delay from harvest to dinner plate , sugars turn to starches , plant cells shrink , and produce loses its vitality
2. Local produce is better for you .
Studies showed that fresh produce loses nutrients quickly .
Locally grown food , purchased soon after harvest , retains its nutrients .
3. Local food preserves genetic diversity .
In the modern industrial agricultural system , varieties are chosen for their ability to ripen simultaneously and withstand harvesting equipment ; for a tough skin that can survive packing and shipping ; and for an ability to have a long shelf life in the store .
Only a handful of hybrid varieties of each fruit and vegetable meet those rigorous demands , so there is little genetic diversity in the plants grown .
Local farms , in contrast , grow a huge number of varieties to provide a long season of harvest , an array of eye - catching colors , and the best flavors .
Many varieties are heirlooms , passed down from generation to generation , because they taste good .
These old varieties contain genetic material from hundreds or even thousands of years of human selection ; they may someday provide the genes needed to create varieties that will thrive in a changing climate .
Local food preserves genetic diversity .
4. Local food is GMO - free .
Although biotechnology companies have been trying to commercialize genetically modified fruits and vegetables , they are currently licensing them only to large factory - style farms .
Local farmers do n't have access to genetically modified seed , and most of them would n't use it even if they could .
A June 2001 survey by ABC News showed that 93 % of Americans want labels on genetically modified food - most so that they can avoid it .
If you are opposed to eating bio - engineered food , you can rest assured that locally grown produce was bred the old - fashioned way , as nature intended .
5. Local food supports local farm families .
With fewer than 1 million Americans now listing farming as their primary occupation , farmers are a vanishing breed .
Local farmers who sell direct to consumers cut out the middle man and get full retail price for their crops - which means farm families can afford to stay on the farm , doing what they love .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
6. Local food builds a stronger community .
When you buy direct from the farmer , you are re-establishing a time - honored connection between the eater and the grower .
Knowing the farmers gives you insight into the seasons , the weather , and the miracle of raising food .
In many cases , it gives you access to a farm where your children and grandchildren can go to learn about nature and agriculture .
Relationships built on understanding and trust can thrive .
7. Local food preserves open space .
As the value of direct - marketed fruits and vegetables increases , selling farmland for development becomes less likely .
You have probably enjoyed driving out into the country and appreciated the lush fields of crops , the meadows full of wildflowers , the picturesque red barns .
That landscape will survive only as long as farms are financially viable .
When you buy locally grown food , you are doing something proactive about preserving the agricultural landscape .
8. Local food helps to keep your taxes in check .
Farms contribute more in taxes than they require in services , whereas suburban development costs more than it generates in taxes , according to several studies .
9. Local food supports a clean environment and benefits wildlife . Â
A well - managed family farm is a place where the resources of fertile soil and clean water are valued .
Good stewards of the land grow cover crops to prevent erosion and replace nutrients used by their crops .
Cover crops also capture carbon emissions and help combat global warming .
According to some estimates , farmers who practice conservation tillage could sequester 12 - 14 % of the carbon emitted by vehicles and industry .
In addition , the habitat of a farm - the patchwork of fields , meadows , woods , ponds , and buildings - is the perfect environment for the many species of wildlife including owls , hawks , blue herons , bats , and rabbits , and foxes .
10 . Local food is about the future .
By supporting local farmers today , you can help ensure that there will be farms in your community tomorrow so that future generations will have access to nourishing , flavorful , and abundant food .

Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Hilary Rosen on Anderson Cooper 360 rose to our defense last night , succinctly and passionately describing the outrage of many in the LGBT community over Obama ’s choice of Rick Warren to give the invocation for the inauguration .
Hillary Rosen : “ First the glibness , that , well it ’s just a bunch of gays being unhappy that people do n’t agree with them , is wrong .
You know , ( at ) one time the Bible was used to justify slavery .
If this was a preacher , out there , using more weapons against African - Americans we would n’t even be having this conversation , so second of all , the fact that we ’re even having a conversation , means that this is a mistake in choice .
This is a day when people are to be brought together .
There are hundreds of preachers across the country with stature and thoughtfulness and other ways to bring this country together on an inauguration day for the new president .
That ’s the choice he should have made . ”
Watch the clip .
As expected , here is the defense circulated by the Obama campaign this morning :
“ This will be the most open , accessible , and inclusive Inauguration in American history .
In keeping with the spirit of unity and common purpose this Inauguration will reflect , the President - elect and Vice President - elect have chosen some of the world ’s most gifted artists and people with broad appeal to participate in the inaugural ceremonies .
Pastor Rick Warren has a long history of activism on behalf of the disadvantaged and the downtrodden .
He ’s devoted his life to performing good works for the poor and leads the evangelical movement in addressing the global HIV / AIDS crisis .
In fact , the President - elect recently addressed Rick Warren ’s Saddleback Civil Forum on Global Health to salute Warren ’s leadership in the struggle against HIV / AIDS and pledge his support to the effort in the years ahead .
The President - elect disagrees with Pastor Warren on issues that affect the LGBT community .
They disagree on other issues as well .
But what ’s important is that they agree on many issues vital to the pursuit of social justice , including poverty relief and moving toward a sustainable planet ; and they share a commitment to renewing America ’s promise by expanding opportunity at home and restoring our moral leadership abroad .
As he ’s said again and again , the President - elect is committed to bringing together all sides of the faith discussion in search of common ground .
That ’s the only way we ’ll be able to unite this country with the resolve and common purpose necessary to solve the challenges we face .
The Inauguration will also involve Reverend Joseph Lowery , who will be delivering the official benediction at the Inauguration .
Reverend Lowery is a giant of the civil rights movement who boasts a proudly progressive record on LGBT issues .
He has been a leader in the struggle for civil rights for all Americans , gay or straight .
And for the very first time , there will be a group representing the interests of LGBT Americans participating in the Inaugural Parade . ”
And Obama ’s response to the controversy this morning .
I suppose we should be thankful the inclusiveness does n’t extend to Fred Phelps .
Or David Duke .

We may take it for granted , but the fictional beers of TV and movies are some of the best loved brands in existence .
Some of these beers have achieved the brand recognition and affection that major commercial beers can only dream of .
Some TV shows and movies will feature beers are a convenient plot device , but others take the time and effort to cultivate a bona fide beer brand , with tag lines , brewery scenes / episodes and a detailed history .
It ’s always fun to see characters drinking fictitious beers on screen .
As there is no real product or company to protect , the scope for biting satire , commentary or simply plain inventiveness , is unlimited .
We searched long and hard and found 15 of the most prominent , well - loved and interesting fictional beers from TV and film .
See how many you recognize !
1. Duff Beer – The Simpsons
Possibly the most famous fictional beer of them all , Duff is Homer ’s drink of choice and features in countless episodes .
As a cheap , mainstream beer , Duff is a parody of the popular Budweiser , Coors and Miller brands .
In fact , there are several close parallels to Budweiser in particular ( similarities include sponsoring stadiums : Duff Bowl / Bud Bowl ; doggy mascots : Suds McDuff / Spuds MacKenzie ) .
During one episode , Homer and Barney tour the Duff brewery , where it is revealed that Duff , Duff Light and Duff Dry are , in fact , the exact same beer .
While Simpsons creator , Matt Groening , has never licensed the name for a real beer , that has n’t stopped canny brewers trying to cash in on the recognition value , with a number of Duff beer scams .
There are , of course , a variety of Duff - branded novelty merchandise for sale , including a Duff energy drink in a beer - like can .
2. Leopard Lager – Red Dwarf
This excellent comedy sci-fi series from the BBC is set 3,000,000 years in the future and features Lister , a 20th century lager - swilling Liverpudlian , as the last survivor of the Red Dwarf mining ship .
Through many ingenious plot devices , Lister manages to obtain sufficient quantities of his favorite lager on a regular basis – both to accompany his favorite beef vindaloo and to simply help him retain his sanity .
The beer is always depicted in cans and is brewed by the Jupiter Mining Company .
3. Buzz Beer – The Drew Carey Show
A long - running storyline in The Drew Carey Show involved this beer / coffee mixture .
Initially brewed in Drew ’s garage , it was sold at the Warsaw Tavern , the bar frequented by Drew and his friends .
According to Lewis in the show , “ the combination of caffeine and alcohol should be more addictive than heroin , but so far sales have n’t borne that out ” .
This is a good example of life imitating art .
Since the show aired , there have been several actual caffeinated beer products released for consumption .
The highest profile product was ‘ BE ’ from Budweiser .
In recent times , the trend for these products is reversing due to bad press and concern over its appeal to young people .
4. Girlie Girl Beer – Married With Children
This was Al Bundy ’s favorite beer from the long - running TV show .
The beer was the staple beverage of the “ NO MA’AM ” ( National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood ) club that met in Al ’s garage to discuss beer , women and other such matters .
In one particular episode of Married With Children , the Girlie Girl Beer ’s mascot is replaced with a picture of Yoko Ono , much to the distaste of the NO MA’AM club .
5. Panther Pilsner Beer – The Three Stooges
The slapstick comedy trio worked at the fictitious Panther Pilsner Beer company in their famous Three Little Beers short movie .
Interestingly , this beer inspired a real - life imitation for some time .
Packaged in retro-styling , the beer was sold as The Three Stooges Beer , from the Panther Brewing Company .
It does n’t seem like the brewery is still in operation , unfortunately .
The excellent short movie featuring Panther Pilsner Beer is available for online viewing :

Part 2 :
6. Alamo Beer – King of the Hill
Alamo Beer is the beer swilled by Hank Hill and his buddies in King of the Hill and comes with the tagline “ From the lukewarm headwaters of the mighty Brazos River ” .
According to Hank , it even won the Munich Beer Festival of 1849 .
It has featured prominently in various storylines in the show , including one where the beer sponsored the Super Bowl .
Another involved an investigation into tainted supplies of Alamo Beer in Mexico ( perhaps inspired by the myth of the tainted Corona beer ) .
7. Romulan Ale – Star Trek
Star Trek – through its various incarnations – has featured many types of alcoholic beverage ( Klingon Blood Wine and Andorian Ale are two exotic varieties ) .
However , perhaps the most famous of them all is Romulan Ale .
Throughout the Star Trek series , the potent blue liquid is referred to in mythical terms .
The beverage is hard to procure , illegal in many parts of the Star Trek galaxy and guaranteed to deliver a raging hangover to anyone who imbibes !
Although Romulan
Ale has formally crossed over into the real world , there have been attempts to recreate it – the usual recipe consists of Blue Curaçao , Creme de Banana and cream soda / ginger ale .
Another popular Star Trek beverage , Synthale , is shown in several episodes ( mostly in Deep Space Nine ) .
Unfortunately , we never learn much about it , other than the fact that it closely resembles usual beer / lager in appearance .
8. Shotz Beer – Laverne & Shirley
This successful American sit-com – a spin - off from Happy Days – ran from 1976 until 1983 .
The lead characters worked as bottlecappers for a Milwaukee brewery , with Shotz Beer being the main brand .
In the real world , of course , Milwaukee is home to Miller Beer , a rather popular brand itself .
To help jog your memory , here ’s the opening title sequence from the show :
9. Butterbeer – Harry Potter
Butterbeer is a low - alcohol drink popular among the youger wizards in the ‘ target=_blank >’ target=_blank >’ target=_blank >’ target=_blank >
Harry Potter series of books and movies .
According to the Harry Potter lore , it can be served cold or hot , but has a warming effect either way .
The price of a Butterbeer is two sickles , at the Hog ’s Head inn .
Described by author J.K. Rowling as “ a little bit less - sickly butterscotch ” , it certainly sounds like a unique brew .
For any adventurous types out there , you might like to attempt some of the inventive butterbeer recipes that have been devised .
10 . Bendërbrau Cold - Fusion Steam Beer – Futurama
There are lots of interesting and unusual beers in the Futurama universe .
One of the most memorable is Bendërbrau , a beer brewed inside of Bender .
It ’s closely modeled on the steam beers of San Francisco ( such as Anchor Steam ) .
While this beer was never officially released publicly , the Futurama writers are keen amateur brewers and made a real version for themselves .
Other fans of the sci fan animated show created an interesting brewing project based on Bender !
Some of the other beers featured on Futurama include Pabst Blue Robot , Sam Adams ’ Head Boston Lager , St. Pauli Exclusion Principle Girl Beer and Löbrau Beer .
11 . Newton & Ridley – Coronation Street
Coronation street is the UK ’s longest running TV soap opera .
Set in a fictional town in Manchester , the characters regular socialize in their local pub , the Rovers Retrun .
The most popular drink was an ale , brewed by Newton & Ridley .
Interestingly , the Coronation Street producers are set to capitalize on the brand value of their creation by launching Newton & Ridley beer to mark the show ’s 50th anniversary in 2010 .
It remains to be seen how successful the beer will sell outside of tourist shops .
12 . Elsinore Beer – Strange Brew
This cult 1983 movie revolves around the Elsinore Brewery , where the two lead characters gain employment inspecting beer bottles for mice .
The movie ’s plot involves a nefarious brewer with a secret plan to take over the world by putting a drug in Elsinore beer which , while otherwise rendering the consumer docile , makes him or her attack others when stimulated by musical cues .
Made in Canada , this movie is a lot of fun and worth watching for the silliness and stupid humor value !
13 . Jenkins – Eastenders
For those not in the know , Eastenders is a long - running , gritty urban soap opera on the BBC , set in the East End of London .
Much of the action centers around the local pub – the Queen Victoria ( usually referred to as ‘ the old Vic’ ) .
The pub has played host to countless fights , disasters , reunions and other lowlights in the characters ’ drudge - filled lives .
With so much focus on the pub , the producers needed some fictional beverages to serve .
Jenkins is one of the most prominent brands on display behind the bar , although several others have been observed ( see if you can guess their inspiration ) : Stolenberg 1940 , Fordham ’s Ale , Devlins , North Export and Thames Bitter .
14 . Tenku Beer – Kill Bill
Director Quentin Tarantino likes to fill him movies with a completely realistic world .
As part of that , he included a number of fictional brands in Kill Bill .
It helps to build the artificial world in which his characters inhabit , and is a level of detail that many filmmakers simply ignore .
Tenku Beer can be seen advertised on billboards in Kill Bill .
Some of the other fake products to be observed include Go Juice and Red Apple Cigarettes .
15 . Pawtucket Patriot Ale – Family Guy
Finally , we finish the list with another legendary beer from an animated TV show , Family Guy .
Pawtucket Patriot
Ale is the local Quohog , Rhode Island beer and is Peter Griffin ’s favorite ale .
The Pawtucket brewery is featured in one episode and appears to be akin to the Willy Wonka ’s Chocolate Factory , with an eccentric brewer – Pawtucket Pat and his band of Chumbawumbas .

Motorcycles are by definition efficient machines , but their Prius - like fuel economy often is accompanied by emissions that make a Hummer look clean .
As regulators get wise to that fact and go after two - wheelers , the motorcycle industry is embracing alternatives ranging from battery power to hydrogen fuel cells .
The pace of development in recent years is remarkable considering motorcycle design has n't changed much since the first Hildebrand & Wolfmuller appeared in a showroom 114 years ago .
Materials have advanced alongside technology , but motorcycles are still an internal combustion engine between two wheels .
Motorcycles may deliver 70 mpg or more , but they can be 10 times more polluting per mile than passenger cars .
That has the United States and European Union pushing motorcycles to run cleaner and greener .
" As we look at the country 's air - quality challenges , including greenhouse gas pollutants and criteria pollutants , what we 've found is that every sector of the transportation area is going to be required to play their part in reaching our overall goals , " says Karl Simon of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality at the Environmental Protection Agency .
" So even though motorcycles and scooters may represent a smaller percentage of the pie when it comes to emissions inventory , it does n't mean their makers should n't have proper incentive to be using new , greener technologies . "
Startups like Zero Motorcycles and Brammo are leading the way , offering electric motorcycles you can buy today , but many major manufacturers are developing hybrid and e-motorcycles and looking ahead with hydrogen - fuel - cell bikes .
Most of the focus is on electric power because motorcycles lend themselves to electrification readily .
They 're smaller and lighter , so they do n't need as much power , and range is n't as big an issue because they 're often used around town , says Brammo founder Craig Bramsher .
" Motorcycles are the perfect solution , " he tells us .
" Based on where the technology is today for 100 percent electrification , it lends itself to a motorcycle . "
These bikes are more than mountain bikes with motors , though .
Electric step - through scooters from Vectrix and Electric Vehicle Company will do 60 mph or more , while battery - powered dirt bikes from the likes of Zero Motorcycles and Quantya are winning kudos from experienced motocrossers .
But battery bikes remain limited by range — even with lithium - ion batteries you 're still looking at 75 miles , tops — and price tags that hover around five figures .
Advocates say costs will come down as the technology improves and bigger companies like Honda , Yamaha and KTM , all off which promise electric motorcycles within two to three years , get in the game .
That is n't to say gasoline engines are n't going to be around for a long , long time .
Batteries can't offer the range for long - distance riding or hardcore canyon carving , and they 're still pretty freakin ' heavy .
But even gas - burning bikes could see the benefit of batteries .
Italian scooter - maker Piaggio has unveiled a gas- electric hybrid scooter that gets 141 mpg and could be on the road next year , and Honda says it is working on a hybrid motorcycle that draws on its automotive hybrid tech to cut costs .
Honda says the technology could be offered in displacements ranging from 50 to 1,000 cc and offer a 50 percent improvement in fuel efficiency .
Diesel technology is n't something you hear a lot about when it comes to motorcycles , but Hayes Diversified Technologies offers a diesel - burning version of the Kawasaki KLR that the Marines have been using for years , and companies like Gray Eagles are working on diesel cruisers capable of 80 mpg and 100 mph .
Looking further ahead , some manufacturers are developing hydrogen - fuel - cell motorcycles .
Suzuki is out in front with the Crosscage hydrogen concept it developed with help from Intelligent Energy , a British firm that pioneered hydrogen bikes with the ENV urban commuter .
The two firms are working together to develop a commercially viable fuel - cell motorcycle that could be in showrooms within a few years .
Competitions like the TTxGP , a " green grand prix " slated for the Isle of Man , will surely help advance the technology , but commercial appeal remains the big barrier to getting alt - fuel bikes on the road in big numbers .
Ty van Hooydonk of the Motorcycle Industry Council says there is n't much incentive to develop the bikes until there 's a demand for them , given the investment manufacturers must make in R&D , tooling and the like .
" If Americans want really green bikes then they 'll have to vote with their wallets , and the big manufacturers will then respond , " he says .

According to new research from UC San Diego , areas of the brain responsible for vision respond more strongly to objects of value .
Led by John Serences , assistant professor of psychology and head of the Perception and Cognition Lab at UC San Diego , the study is published in the Dec. 26 issue of the Cell Press journal Neuron .
Past rewards influence how humans ( and other animals ) make decisions .
We 've known about that for a long time , said Serences - through day - to - day experience as well as the numerous experiments of economists and cognitive psychologists .
Though more and more research is looking into it , little is known about how rewards affect the way the brain processes incoming sensory information , specifically as it relates to vision .
Could it be that we see things differently if they have paid off before ?
Serences examined how value affects visual processing with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , a brain - scanning technique that indirectly measures neural activity .
The brain activity of subjects was recorded as they chose between red and green targets that varied in value across the experiment .
Selecting a target might yield 10 cents or nothing , potentially earning subjects making the " right " choices 10 dollars .
The fMRI scans were conducted at UC Irvine .
Analysis revealed that rewards altered neural activation in many areas of the human visual system , including the very first visually responsive region of the brain , the area of the cortex known as " V1 , " which is associated with representing basic features such as edge orientations and color .
" When a target had been valuable in the past - if selecting it had had paid off with money - the visual system represented it more strongly , " Serences said .
" Rewards affected information processing not just at a high level of cognitive function but right from the get - go . "
" Though it is too early to say how this relates to perception , " said Serences , " it raises the intriguing possibility that we see things we value more clearly - much like the way the brain responds to a bright object versus a dimly lit one . "
Interestingly , changes in neural activity were better associated with the reward history of the red / green targets than with self - reported estimates of value : " It 's as if the visual system is telling you how valuable something has been to you in the past , " Serences said , " and telling it to you like it is , even though you can't consciously identify it . "
The study also found activation in the frontal and parietal regions of the brain previously implicated in anticipating and tracking rewards .
These areas were very active when one choice was much more valuable than the other , suggesting , Serences said , that these regions may provide signals to bias visual processing and so have a greater impact on decision - making and behavior .
Further research on how the brain represents the value of different objects , Serences said , could someday help us better understand how addictions influence information processing in the brain .
The mere sight of drugs or particular foods , for example , may have a larger impact on the psyches of some people .
Their eyes may be on the wrong prize .

Caroline Kennedy , the woman who would be New York ’s next senator , is sure of one thing .
Among all the hopefuls seeking to succeed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , she said on Saturday , there is no better choice .
“ I would n’t be here if I did n’t think I would be the best , ” Ms. Kennedy said , sitting in the back room of an Upper East Side diner around the corner from her home .
After weeks of criticism that she had not opened up to the public or the press , Ms. Kennedy has embarked on a series of interviews .
But in an extensive sit - down discussion Saturday morning with The New York Times , she still seemed less like a candidate than an idea of one : forceful but vague , largely undefined and seemingly determined to remain that way .
Facing a somewhat delicate task , where she is not running for office but seeking an appointment to an impending vacancy , Ms. Kennedy avoided questions about the other possible contenders , saying she did not want to criticize them .
She praised Mrs. Clinton , but said it was too soon to say how she could improve on Mrs. Clinton ’s performance as a senator .
She said she had been personally affected by the economic crisis but sidestepped questions about her wealth , declining to say how much money she lived on each year .
It was late one Friday night in the late spring .
My friend Richard and I had been out shooting pool and drinking overpriced low - quality pisswater , and we decided to head home .
He had drunk less than I had , so he got in his car and departed .
Me , I felt the need to walk around a bit before I got behind the wheel - not that I was drunk per se , but just to clear out the cobwebs .
This is how I found myself sitting in the Farmer 's Market at one in the morning , letting the warm breeze waft over me as I dozed a little and ignored the group of happy clappers off to my left who were dancing and singing with guitars and tambourines .
It was a relaxing sound , really - a load of untrained young voices singing from about fifty feet away .
The air was full of the odd scents of downtown Richmond - not all of them pleasant , I might add - but it was nice to sit back and watch the parade of drunken humanity streaming past as I sat on a wooden produce stand .
" Excuse me , do you have a moment ?
" She was probably about nineteen , I would guess , with straight blond hair and blue eyes and an open innocent face .
Slender , wearing snug jeans and a clingy knit shirt , a shy smile on her face ... yeah , she got my attention .
" Sure , what 's up ? " " I just wanted to know if you 've heard the news . " " News ? "
What the hell was she talking about ?
Was there another attack from al Quaeda or something ?
" Yes , the news of our Lord . " Feck .
" Ummm , yes , I have .
I 'm afraid that I 'm following a different path , though . " " Yes , but have you really heard what He had to say ? "
She looked so earnest that I actually hesitated for a moment - but no , the glove had been thrown down .
Dismissing someone else 's faith because you know yours to be the One True Way is something that I can't let go unchallenged .
" Yes , I have .
And frankly , I do n't think that most of what 's attributed to him in the bible is accurate - I tend to doubt that he was anywhere near as arrogant as he 's been made out to be .
" She looked utterly stunned by this .
" Arrogant ? " " Yes , arrogant .
Consider : he supposedly said that the only way to Heaven was through him , right ?
In other words , that the people of the world who had n't happened to have heard of him would be cast into damnation , even though they had led blameless lives .
I would say that that was pretty damned arrogant , would n't you ?
" She was blinking by this point .
" Ummm ... I 'll be back in a moment . "
And she whirled and retreated .
I sat back and took a few more deep breaths of the fragrant Richmond night , letting my mind race for a few moments before she returned with a boy in his twenties .
" Hi , you had some questions about Jesus ? " " Not exactly .
I was telling your friend here that I do n't really buy into what 's in the bible , because I do n't think it 's an accurate depiction of what Jesus said .
Not too surprising , really - how many times has it been translated ?
From Aramaic to Greek to Latin to English that I know of off the top of my head .
There have to be translation errors that pop up .
Not to mention that there have been a lot of rather disreputable popes in the early days - did you know that there are entire books of the Bible that have been chopped out because someone found them objectionable ?
" They both looked like they were drowning at this point .
I noticed that a few more of their group had appeared nearby , drawn to the discussion .
" And then there 's the fact that the New Testament was passed orally for over a hundred years before it was ever recorded onto paper .
Have you ever played Telephone ?
You get a line of people together , you whisper a phrase to the first one , who whispers it to the next one , who tells it to the next one , and so on .
Then the person at the end of the line tells what the message was that they were passed , and the person at the start announces what the original phrase was .
They 're never the same .
Now imagine that being done across generations .
How accurate do you think those words attributed to Jesus are ?
Do you think he 'd even recognize his own words ?
" I was at the center of a school of fish , it appeared .
Mouths opened and closed but few words came forth , and no complete sentences .
Then I noticed a rather stern looking man about my own age pressing toward the front .
" But the bible is God 's Living Word . " " Okay then .
Let 's set aside any question of inaccuracies for now and just look at what it says .
Eternal damnation if you do n't follow
His rules , right ?
Sounds pretty harsh to me .
According to Genesis we were created in God 's image , right ?
Only we 're flawed humans , a pallid imitation of perfection .
" According to the New Testament , God is infinitely patient and forgiving , right ?
Consider this : if my son does something that he knows that he should n't - say , throwing a baseball in the house - and I catch him breaking my rules , maybe because he broke a window or something , what do I do ?
I ground him , I yell at him a bit , I take a way his privileges , but after a few days he 's learned his lesson and on he goes .
Do I chain him in a basement and starve him and beat him daily and pour boiling water over him ?
Of course not .
So if I 'm a flawed imitation of God , why is it that I 'm more forgiving and patient than He is ?
The whole concept of Hell makes absolutely no sense .
" Silence .
" Look , I 'm glad you have a faith that works for you .
Really I am .
Keep with it .
Just recognize that for some of us , it just does n't work .
And that 's why I 've chosen to follow a different path .
You can follow yours , but I need to follow mine . "
I looked at my cell phone .
" It 's getting very late and I really need to get to bed .
But thanks for the conversation , and good luck to you .
" And I left them standing there , mouths agape , whispering to one another with their silent guitars and tambourines clutched in their hands as I walked away .
I think I may have destroyed that guy 's flock that night and turned a few minds to doubt .
Tired , drunk , up far past my bedtime , and they could n't touch my logic or refute me .
Maybe I really am Satan ... EDIT : I must be , as this is now my most popular answer to date . ( , Thu 11 Dec 2008 , 15:25 , 28 replies
The brother of an Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at George Bush claimed today that the television reporter was too badly beaten to appear in court , as the speaker of Iraq 's parliament reportedly announced his resignation over the issue .
Dargham al - Zaidi said he was told a judge had been to see his younger brother , Muntazer , at the jail where he has been held since throwing his shoes at the US president during a press conference in Baghdad on Sunday .
The television reporter – whose actions have made him a star in the Arab world – called Bush a " dog " and said he was angry at the US occupation of his country .
The family went to Baghdad 's central criminal court expecting a hearing , Dhargham said , but were told the investigative judge had been to the prison and they should return in eight days .
" That means my brother was severely beaten and they fear that his appearance could trigger anger at the court , " he said .
Iraqi officials have denied that Muntazar , a 29 - year - old reporter for the private Al - Baghdadia TV station , has been injured .
Under Iraq 's legal system a judge investigates an allegation before recommending whether to order a trial .
Initial hearings are often conducted informally rather than in court .
According to Dargham , his brother suffered a broken arm and ribs , as well as injuries to an eye and a leg after being beaten by security officials , and was treated at the Ibn Sina hospital , in Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone .
Dargham said he did not know whether the injuries happened when Muntazer was being overpowered at the press conference or later .
The journalist faces possible trial under a clause in the Iraqi penal code outlawing " aggression against a president " .
If convicted , he could be imprisoned for seven to 15 years .
Dargham said he was told by the investigating judge that his brother " had co-operated well " , but had no other details .
During a press conference marking Bush 's farewell visit to Iraq as US president , Muntazer jumped up and shouted : " It is the farewell kiss , you dog " .
He threw both his shoes at the US leader – a severe insult in the Arab world .
Iraq 's parliament erupted into chaos today as MPs debated Muntazer 's continued detention .
An official in the office of the speaker , Mahmoud al - Mashhadani , said he had resigned after the row , although it was not clear why this had happened .
The US state department said yesterday it would condemn " unnecessary force " used against Muntazer , but it did not know whether any had occurred .
Bush 's press secretary , Dana Perino – who was sporting a bruise under her eye after being struck by a microphone stand during the melee – said the president held " no hard feelings " about the incident and accepted it was up to Iraq to decide on any punishment .

Thirty years ago , my grandmother lived in Veneta , a small town in Oregon .
There was a proposal on the ballot that year to pass a bond issue to build this or that public facility .
My parents recommended to her that she vote against it in order to help reduce her future taxes .
She argued that her vote would not count .
They persisted .
She went to the polls and voted against it .
The proposal produced a tie vote .
The bond issue therefore did not pass .
On that day , my grandmother did not throw away her vote .
That outcome has stuck in my memory for a long time .
I see it as my patriotic duty to vote no on all bond issues .
To paraphrase Will Rogers , I never met a bond issue I did n’t hate .
Whenever there is a bond issue on the ballot , I ’ll be at the polls to vote against it .
Not only is this my patriotic duty in my lifetime battle against bloated civil government , it is in my own self - interest .
A failed bond issue is a blow against future taxes .
My vote might just produce a tie .
Think of the frustration that this would produce for local bureaucrats .
“ We were so close .
If only we had . . . . ”
There is nothing like “ if only ” to make bureaucrats suffer .
When it comes to bureaucrats , I can do no better than to quote Bobby Fisher , age 15 , on why he enjoyed playing chess so much .
“ I love to see ’em squirm . ”
Oh , yes : I almost forgot .
There are people running for office .
I might as well vote for someone while I ’m in the booth .
But which candidate deserves my vote ?
BILL PATRICK LIVES !
In 1966 , Ronald Reagan was running against liberal San Francisco mayor ( but I repeat myself ) George Christopher for the Republican nomination .
The outcome of that election would re-shape the twentieth century .
I did not know this at the time .
Reagan vs. Christopher .
Who deserved my vote ?
William Penn Patrick , that ’s who !
Bill Patrick owned Holiday Magic , a multi - level marketing company that sold cosmetics .
He was rich .
He was vocally conservative .
He was an unknown .
He did n’t have a chance .
I voted for him .
I was convinced that Reagan ’s conservatism in 1966 was mostly rhetorical .
I did not trust him to stay the course .
For example , I did not believe him when he said he would never sign a bill that would impose quarterly withholding on California ’s taxpayers .
Tax withholding had been Milton Friedman ’s recommendation back in 1943 , when he was working as a bureaucrat for the Treasury Department .
I thought withholding would make paying taxes easier for people — a bad policy .
( “ When the cost of something falls , more of it will be produced . ” )
As I expected , Reagan reneged on this promise in his first year as governor .
( The story of Reagan ’s non-conservative first year as governor can be found in the rare paperback book by Kent Steffgen , Here ’s the Rest of Him [ 1968 ] , a book that deserves to be posted on the Web as an historical document . )
Bill Patrick received approximately 1 % of the vote .
Anyone who can get on a statewide ballot can get 1 % if he is the only independent listed .
Obviously , Patrick had wasted his money .
But that was his affair .
Had I wasted my vote ?
It is good to discover how many voters are disaffected from the existing political system .
How can we discover this statistic ?
By allowing independents , write - ins , and third parties .
Fourth parties are fine , too .
Has any candidate won a major election as a write - in ?
Yes .
Strom Thurmond won the Senate seat in South Carolina in 1954 .
He received 63 % of the vote .
Of course , South Carolinians regarded that seat as belonging to him by some statewide moral authority .
So , this was not a representative case .
But it surely did inflict lots of pain on the Democrats ’ honchos in South Carolina that year .
They were going to get even with old Strom , once and for all , they thought .
Ha !
Some people think every citizen has a moral obligation to vote .
They say , “ If everybody stayed home on election day , there would be no winner . ”
Good point !
The day that I sense that this outcome is likely , I ’ll go to the polls and write in “ Ron Paul . ”
The argument is bogus .
Not everyone will stay home .
The more people who are expected to stay home , the more likely that my vote — and yours — will count .
I will then go to the polls and vote .
This is my grandmother ’s political legacy to me .
There will be a loser that day .
Stick a big wad of “ if only ” into the ear of a politician .
It will bother him for years .
Back to Bill Patrick .
I had an opportunity to deny Reagan my support in 1966 .
That seemed like a good idea at the time .
I did not throw my vote away .
I registered my displeasure with the Reagan campaign .
Patrick ’s utter waste of his own money financed my ability , quoting Nancy Reagan , to “ just say no . ”
Was Patrick a fool ?
Yes .
That money could have published some conservative books or built some orphanages or lots of other far more useful things .
He was an egomaniac with more money than good sense .
He later died in a plane crash .
He had bought an old P - 51 and crashed it .
Easy come , easy go .
But he did me a favor .
He gave me an opportunity to say no to Reagan .
At the time , I thought that was a good idea .
I did in 1967 , too , when his legislative program unfolded .
THINK LOCALLY , VOTE LOCALLY
All politics is local .
So said Tip O’Neill , one of America ’s most powerful national politicians .
There are always propositions on a ballot that deserve to be scuttled .
I love to vote against them .
Most people go to the polls to vote for “ their man . ”
He is only rarely their man .
Instead , they are his career tools .
At first , he will tell them what they want to hear .
But the closer the election is expected to be , the more likely that he will tell the as - yet uncommitted voters what they want to hear , which is not what his true believers want to hear .
He will start spouting some version of “ I do n’t personally believe in genocide , but I do n’t oppose anyone ’s right to commit it . ”
Your vote counts locally , just as my grandmother ’s vote counted .
This is where activists should invest their time and money : where there is a possible positive payoff .
No one with a controversial worldview should give a dime to a major national party when his dime could go to a local candidate , or , better yet , a last - minute postcard mailing against some bond issue .
But , my critics may reply , “ local politics is not important compared to national politics . ”
This is another way of saying , “ the average voter has no effect on anything important politically , ” which is in fact the case .
National Presidential elections are rigged .
They invariably are a race between Council on Foreign Relations Team A vs. Council on Foreign Relations Team B. Susan
Huck pointed this out thirty years ago .
The only possible exception to this rule was Calvin Coolidge ’s defeat in 1924 of CFR founding member and Wall Street lawyer John W. Davis .
That was because the CFR was founded in 1921 , and Coolidge came in as President when Harding died in 1923 .
When you vote for a major party ’s Presidential candidate , you are voting for the CFR .
If this is what you mean by “ not throwing away my vote , ” then you have a strange definition of “ throwing away . ”
INFLICTING PAIN ON THOSE WHO DESERVE IT
Voting is a matter of imposing sanctions .
By voting for one candidate , you are inflicting your share of pain on another .
There will be a loser .
He will be discouraged .
His supporters will be discouraged .
You have done your share in making life unpleasant for a career politician .
This is a good thing .
For every benefit , there is a cost .
The cost is that in inflicting this pain , you bring joy to the winner .
You have done your part to bring joy into the life of another career politician .
But when you vote for a third - party candidate , you do your share to inflict pain on the loser , but you bring no joy to the winner .
( An exception was voting for Nader in New Hampshire in 2000 , which helped lose the crucial four electoral votes for Gore .
I regard this as the political equivalent of writing in Strom Thurmond ’s name in 1954 .
Rare . )
For every benefit , there is a cost .
The cost is low when you vote for a third - party candidate .
The winner has received no joy from you , and the loser has received discouragement from you .
The third - party candidate did not expect to win .
His idea of joy has nothing to do with winning elections .
He is not a career politician .
That ’s the kind of candidate I prefer to vote for .
Meanwhile , I will have voted against all the bond issues .
Do n’t tell me my vote does n’t count .
CONCLUSION
Every dime you send to a political race is a waste of your money unless there is a possibility that your money may conceivably affect the outcome of the race .
So , do n’t spend money on politics unless you think a win is better than a loss .
It rarely is .
Every dime you send could be used to further a worthy cause .
What cause is more worthy than politics ?
Most of them .
But if this is true of your money , is n’t it also true of your time ?
Every minute invested in voting could be used to do something more productive .
Is watching a videotape of an old “ Wheel of Fortune ” show more productive ?
Let me think about this .
OK , it is n’t .
Voting is more productive .
It ’s more productive for me , which is what matters to me as a self - interested seeker of benefits in a world of scarcity .
Here ’s why .
I love to do my share , no matter how small , to make some career politician unhappy .
Voting for a third - party candidate makes no politician happy , and it makes at least one politician unhappy : a major party ’s loser , who did not get my vote .
No politician is better off , and at least one politician is worse off .
This is my application of Pareto ’s famous law of optimality .
( On this law , see Rothbard , “ Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics . ” )
Furthermore , while I was inflicting my share of pain on a politician , I also got to vote against a bond issue .
This is better than watching a videotape of “ Wheel of Fortune . ” Marginally .
Sorry , Vanna , but that ’s the way it is at my house .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The final week of January began with a bloodbath for the job market , as over 65,400 more cuts were announced on Monday alone .
At least six companies from manufacturing and service industries announced cost - cutting initiatives that included slashing thousands of jobs .
About 200,000 job cuts have been announced so far this year , according to company reports .
Nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost over 2008 , the highest yearly job - loss total since 1945 .
" It 's all about the consumer , and the consumer 's been hit hard , " said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics .
" It 's a vicious circle as weakness begets layoffs , which beget more spending weakness . "
Construction machinery manufacturer Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) said Monday it will cut 20,000 jobs amid a " very challenging global business environment . "
The company had already planned to cut 15,000 workers since the fourth quarter of 2008 , but added another 5,000 , bringing the total to 20,000 .
Pfizer ( PFE , Fortune 500 ) said that it would cut about 20,000 jobs , before and after its merger with Wyeth ( WYE , Fortune 500 ) , which is to close later this year .
The company already cut 4,700 jobs in 2008 .
Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S , Fortune 500 ) will cut a total of about 8,000 jobs by March 31 , the company said in a release .
The telecommunications company 's plan is to reduce internal and external labor costs by about $ 1.2 billion on an annual basis .
Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) , the world 's largest home improvement retailer , announced Monday it will eliminate its EXPO design center business and cut 7,000 associates , or approximately 2 % of the company 's total workforce .
The company blamed a lack of demand for big ticket design and decor projects .
Texas Instruments ( TXN , Fortune 500 ) said it will slash its workforce by 3,400 employees to cope with weak demand and the slowing economy .
More than half of those cuts will be layoffs while " voluntary retirements and departures " will make up the rest .
Dutch financial group ING said Monday it will take a 2008 loss of $ 1.3 billion and cut 7,000 jobs .
The company could not comment on where the cuts would take place .
ING employs around 130,000 people across 50 countries .
Deere& Co. ( DE , Fortune 500 ) , the world 's top farm - equipment maker , said it would cut nearly 700 jobs between factories in Brazil and Iowa .
The job cuts across sectors did n't surprise Brusca , as nearly all are weak , he said .
" The services sector is shedding jobs at a horrific pace , because that 's where most of the jobs are , " Brusca said .
" When the consumer is in tough shape it 's hard for business to do well , because it all depends on consumption or investments . "
Continuing the scary trend
The cuts mark a horrific start to the week , and a brutal start to 2009 .
In the previous week , around 40,000 cuts were announced across multiple industries .
Wednesday , in particular , was littered with a slew of job cuts : BHP Billiton , Clear Channel Communications , Intel , Rohm and Haas Co. , UAL Corp. and Williams - Sonoma all announced job cuts totaling over 27,000 positions .
Schlumberger said Friday that it will cut 5,000 jobs worldwide , with 1,000 of the cuts taking place in North America .
Also last week , Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros .
Entertainment said it would cut about 800 jobs , or 10 % of its worldwide staff in the upcoming weeks , while Microsoft unveiled its plan to cut up to 5,000 jobs - 5.5 % of its global workforce .
Outlook : A recovery in sight ?
Brusca said he agreed with many economists ' predictions that the recession will end after the second quarter of 2009 .
Americans might feel the job market start to bounce back a bit sooner than expected , he said .
" These recessions are like geometry , " Brusca said .
" It looks like we 'll have a V - shaped cycle , in that we 're going into this with very sharp losses .
This intense - phase recession will probably recover fairly quickly , with the job market coming out it at the same angle it came in . "
In the short term , the economy and the job market are in trouble , Brusca said .
But " it does n't look like the bottom is falling out of the economy , " he said .
And there 's a silver lining to the gloomy clouds over America 's economy .
" The good news is it 's so bad right now that we will have a definite , noticeable recovery when it comes , " Brusca said .
" We 're getting a lot of adjustment out of the way early . "
Correction :
An earlier version of this story provided an inaccurate tally of Pfizer 's job cuts .
Simon Cowell & Terri Seymour Clear the Air ( Photos )
andrecently parted ways after a six year relationship .
Cowell has been telling anyone who will listen that the couple are still very close friends .
Apparently he decided that the story would be more believable if his ex-girlfriend backed him up .
The pair contacted Extra to set the record straight .
Extra Question :
Why did their relationship end ?
Simon : " Because Terry decided to dump me ... you sent me a text ! "
Terri : " I did n't dump you !
Just time -- we had a great six years and we 're the best of friends . "
Simon : " I do call Terri when I 've got an issue or I 'm moaning about something or I want to bounce an idea off . "
Terri : " We do speak more now on the phone all the time .
It 's true .
There you have it - no longer lovers but apparently fast friends .
In a walk down memory lane , we 've included a beach photo of the couple before the romance died .

Google will announce today ( Update : official announcement ) the launch of SearchWiki , a major addition to its user interface that allows users to edit search results .
When using SearchWiki , you can re-order , remove , or add web pages to the search results for any query .
You can also add notes to specific listings .
You have to be logged in to a Google account so that the changes you make will be saved and shown the next time you run the same search .
“ This is a way for search to adapt to a more interactive experience , ” says Google Product Manager Cedric Dupont .
“ We ran a bunch of experiments , and the response was overwhelmingly positive from our users .
They asked for this feature . ”
How SearchWiki Works
Two light - colored icons next to each listing let you reorder the search results .
An up arrow lets you move a result higher on the page ; an X will remove the result .
After you ’ve moved a result higher , a down arrow shows up so you can move it back down the page .
The icons turn bright green after an edit to remind you that you edited the result .
A fourth icon in the shape of a text bubble lets you leave comments on any listing ; anyone can see the comments you make on a separate page .
Here ’s what a typical search results page might look like :
There ’s an “ Add a result ” link at the bottom of the search results page that let ’s you add web pages to the search results .
There are also links at the bottom of the page to show and restore listings you ’ve removed , and to see all other SearchWiki changes ( in aggregate ) and comments made by other users .
Here ’s what that public notes page looks like :
SearchWiki is turned on by default for everyone logged in to a Google account .
If you do n’t like SearchWiki , you can ignore the icons or you can make them go away by logging out and then continuing to search .
How Smart Is SearchWiki ?
If you ’re logged in , SearchWiki will remember changes you make when you search again for the same exact word or phrase .
On occasion , it may also remember changes when you search for a very close match ; i.e. , if you re-order the search results for the word [ widget ] , SearchWiki will likely show you the re-ordered results again if you search for [ widgets ] .
But , if your next search is for [ interesting widget ] , it will probably not show the changes you already made for [ widget ] .
“ We ’re trying to be smart on this issue , ” Dupont says .
SEO Implications ?
Google emphasizes that changes made in the SearchWiki interface will have no impact on the traditional ranking of web pages .
If you put your own site in the 1st position for your primary keywords , you ’re the only Google user who ’ll see your site at the top of the rankings .
Your site will , however , be included when users click the “ See all notes for this SearchWiki ” link at the bottom of the page ; that link leads to another page that shows what results other users have re-ordered , removed , or added .
Still , Dupont did n’t completely rule out the possibility that user data from SearchWiki may someday impact regular search rankings .
I asked what would happen if 10,000 people all added “ Matt McGee ’s Widget Page ” to their own results for the phrase [ widget ] .
“ We ’re always looking at user data as a signal , ” Dupont says .
And in a situation like that ?
“ We ’re not closing any doors . ”
Future Development ?
The massive amount of user data that Google will collect from searchers that use SearchWiki should allow Google to further expand the service ’s functionality .
You can imagine Google suggesting pages to add when a user removes a result s/he does n’t like , for example .
“ Who knows what the future will hold , ” Dupont said , when asked about future development plans .
The service , which some users have been using on an experimental basis for about a year , will be rolled out today .
Google says it should be fully available to all users by the end of the day .

Imagine you ’re in a dark room , running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period .
How high do you think the dot must be for your finger pads to feel it ?
A hundredth of an inch above background ?
A thousandth ?
Well , take a tip from the economy and keep downsizing .
Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron high .
All our punctuation point need do , then , is poke above its glassy backdrop by 1/25,000th of an inch  the diameter of a bacterial cell  and our fastidious fingers can find it .
The human eye , by contrast , ca n’t resolve anything much smaller than 100 microns .
No wonder we rely on touch rather than vision when confronted by a new roll of toilet paper and its Abominable Invisible Seam .
Biologically , chronologically , allegorically and delusionally , touch is the mother of all sensory systems .
It is an ancient sense in evolution : even the simplest single - celled organisms can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by nudging closer or pulling away .
It is the first sense aroused during a baby ’s gestation and the last sense to fade at life ’s culmination .
Patients in a deep vegetative coma who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin responsiveness when touched by a nurse .
Like a mother , touch is always hovering somewhere in the perceptual background , often ignored , but indispensable to our sense of safety and sanity .
“ Touch is so central to what we are , to the feeling of being ourselves , that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it , ” said Chris Dijkerman , a neuropsychologist at the Helmholtz Institute of Utrecht University in the Netherlands .
“ It ’s not like vision , where you close your eyes and you do n’t see anything .
You ca n’t do that with touch .
It ’s always there . ”
We ’ve all experienced it : that surge of powerful motivation at the start of a project .
It ’s January 1st , and you ’ve started your new fitness regime .
You ’ve just started a novel , and you ’re pounding out a thousand words a day .
The launch of your new blog was a week ago , and you ’re telling everyone you know about it .
Yet somehow , after a few weeks , that motivation high has gone .
One in five gym members go to the gym once a month or less , and several consumer surveys indicate that 80 % of new gym members drop out within 8 weeks .
Among bloggers , Perseus News reported that of the 4.12 million blogs they surveyed , 66 % had not been updated in two months , and 1.09 million were abandoned after only their first post !
Their initial motivation was there , but it did n’t last .
The same happens to you , when you hit a slump , a dip , a low point : the project you were previously so excited about feels like a burden .
But if you push through that slump , you ’ll find a steady , lasting drive that can carry you onwards until you achieve the goal you ’ve set .
From the time we embark on a new project until we are deeply entrenched in following through with it long term , we go through a few different changes and emotional highs and lows : fluctuations that are n’t so different than what we experience elsewhere in our lives .
The “ Madly In Love ” Phase Of Motivation
“ When I start with a new exercise program , or any new goal really , I am rarin ’ to go .
I am full of excitement , and my enthusiasm knows no boundaries . ”
– Leo Babauta , The Ultimate Guide to Motivation – How to Achieve Any Goal
Let me pause here , and ask you to think about falling in love .
When you ’re in love , you :
Forget to eat or sleep because you ’re thinking about your loved one .
Spend every moment you can in their company .
Tell all your friends how wonderful they are – or alternatively , you keep it to yourself because you ’re afraid of spoiling your love by sharing it with the world .
Walk around with a goofy smile on your face whenever you think about them .
Does n’t that sound rather similar to what happens with a new project ?
When you come up with that wonderful idea for a new business venture or goal , you :
Forget to eat or sleep because you ’re thinking about your project .
Spend every moment you can coming up with schemes and plans , and working on your project .
Tell all all your friends about your amazing new venture – or alternatively , you keep it to yourself because you ’re afraid that talking about your ideas will somehow spoil them .
Walk around with a goofy smile on your face whenever you ’re thinking about how cool your project is .
Love and motivation do n’t remain at that high peak for long , but this initial surge of enthusiasm is a great time to enjoy throwing yourself wholeheartedly into a project .
While you ’re in this stage :
Draw or write a full , rich description of your ultimate goal – what are you ultimately hoping to achieve ?
( Writing down your goals leads to success . )
Write a letter to yourself in a month ’s time .
In the letter , put words of encouragement , and record how excited and keen you ’re feeling at the moment .
Seal the letter in an envelope , mark it with your name and the date , and put it somewhere safe .
Sadly , you ’ll be needing it soon …
The “ Panic Dip ” Phase Of Motivation
“ There have been plenty of high peaks in our marriage when loving each other was natural and easy .
There have also been some deep valleys when we thought we just could n’t get it together . ”
– Alex Blackwell , 23 Heartfelt Reasons I Will Always Be Faithful To My Wife
No - one stays passionately , madly in love for the entire duration of a relationship .
Maybe it lasts for a few weeks or months , but then reality sets in :
Your partner has annoying habits .
You have different interests , and enjoy some alone time .
The relationship means changes and extra demands that you did n’t expect .
If it ’s the first time you ’ve fallen in love , you might panic .
You might decide that this girl or guy just is n’t “ the one . ”
But as anyone who ’s been in love , and stayed in love , can tell you – it ’s normal for that incandescent fire to turn into a more bearable , steady flame .
Similarly , the burst of motivation when you first start a project does n’t last for long , either .
Maybe it blazes like that first fire of love to begin , but you may realize that :
Aspects of your venture are irritating , annoying or tedious .
You want to carry on with other hobbies , and sometimes you just want to kick back and relax .
The project has caused changes and extra demands on your life .
Like love , motivation has natural ups and downs – and it requires hard work .
There are times when feeling enthusiastic about your project is “ natural and easy ” , and times when you want to give up .
So , when that initial surge of motivation vanishes , do n’t abandon your project .
Accept the peaks and troughs , and start looking for that quiet , steady flame of motivation .
Some things which have helped me are :
Looking back on diary entries from the very early days of the project , when I was filled with enthusiasm and boundless optimism .
Writing down a list of things that motivate me to carry on with the project .
Talking to others who are working towards similar goals , and asking for their encouragement and support .
The “ Long - Term Commitment ” Phase Of Motivation
“ What is the best way to motivate yourself for your daily work ?
Obviously , enjoying your work and having a clear vision are very important , but I do n’t believe that they are the most important things for keeping going during the daily grint .
On the contrary , I believe that what gives us the most energy is the feeling of being totally on top of our work . ”
– Do It Tomorrow by Mark Forster , emphasis mine .
Committing Internally
When you ’re in a relationship , part of your responsibility is to help yourself to stay in love with the other person .
That does n’t mean being wildly romantic , pretending that your every thought revolves around them , or refusing to let yourself ever express any reservations about an aspect of their personality or behaviour .
But it does mean :
Giving them not just your time but your serious attention .
Thinking about the future of your relationship , not just the day - to - day .
Confronting and working through problems , rather than ignoring them .
It ’s the same with your any other serious project .
You need to help yourself to stay motivated about it .
This means doing the same things as you would in a relationship : devoting time and attention to your project , and being willing to accept that there will be some tricky patches along the way .
Committing Externally
When a couple decides to commit themselves for life , they often get married .
This is a commitment to one another , made in front of friends and family .
When difficulties arise , that commitment , both public and personal , can provide extra motivation to work through them .
“ None of us likes to look bad in front of others .
We will go the extra mile to do something we ’ve said publicly .
… you can do it with friends and family and co-workers , and you can do it on your blog if you have one .
And hold yourself accountable — do n’t just commit once , but commit to giving progress updates to everyone every week or so . ”
– Leo Babauta , The Ultimate Guide to Motivation – How to Achieve Any Goal
Making It Through the Dip
“ There are two great times of happiness – when you are haunted by a dream , and when you realize it .
Between the two there ’s a lot of uncertainty , a strong urge to let it all drop .
But you have to follow your dreams to the end .
There are abandoned bicycles in every garage because their owners ’ backsides got too sore the first time they rode them .
They did n’t understand that pain is a necessary part of learning .
I almost gave up a thousand times before reaching those moments of happiness when I forgot that I was cold .
You can accomplish this through painting or music , provided that you concede that , before you can play a Bach sonata , you must first learn to play scales .
It is only through perseverance that each of us can find himself .
It is up to each of us to find his own Pole . ”
– Dr. Jean -Louise Etienne , the man who walked alone to the North Pole
This is a hugely powerful quote , reminding us that there will be difficult , tedious , even painful moments on the route to any goal .
As with love being strengthened by marriage , you will find that your motivation is strengthened by making a firm commitment .
This means :
Writing down a promise to yourself .
For example , “ I will commit to working on this project for at least six months , regardless of whether I am seeing any results . ”
Ideally , making your commitment public .
Post it on your blog or a web forum .
Tell all your friends that you ’re going to lose 10 lbs before Christmas .
Let everyone know that you ’re writing a novel .
Focus on what you ’ve achieved and learnt so far , and celebrate how far you ’ve come .
Look back at all the ground you ’ve covered , before you turn your eyes towards what lies ahead : and look foward to the next stage of your journey .
If you ’re having trouble following through on your goals , and wish you had a partner to talk it over with – consider getting together with a friend and trying out Noomii , where you and a friend can track your goals , schedule coaching sessions and review progress in multiple areas of you life that you choose .
You can see their 2 minute intro below :
Are You Dipping or Soaring ?
[ reddit-me ]
If you ’ve been worried because your initial surge of motivation has worn off – stop being concerned , and realize that going through this dip is a normal phase in any long term endeavor .
Focus on finding that steady flame of lasting enthusiasm for your projects .
If you want to make , or remake , a public commitment , please feel free to add it in the comments .
I ’d also love to hear from anyone who ’s ridden out motivational dips and dry spells to finally achieve their dreams – whether in a business , personal or social venture .

NAPLES ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are appearing in Italian nativity scenes this year , alongside the baby Jesus and wise men , according to Naples craftsmen selling figurines in the run-up to Christmas .
The production of handmade figurines for nativity scenes is big business in this southern Italian city and has been for centuries .
But beyond the thousands of angel , sheep , Mary and Joseph figures filling market stalls before Christmas , craftsmen say Obama has become a top seller .
“ The ones we are selling the most of are those of Barack Obama , America ’s new president , along with his wife Michelle , ” said craftsman Genny Di Virgilio .
Tradition requires that the nativity scene be built up over time until Christmas Eve , when baby Jesus is put in the manger as the very last element of the display .
As always , figurine - makers provide a chance to choose a more light - hearted approach for the scene providing replicas of personalities who have made the news during the last year .
Beyond Obama , they are also selling figurines of French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni and even Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
While cherished by many , some people say the arrival of celebrity figurines spoils the traditional sense of Christmas .
One nun , Angelica , scoffed at what she called a “ cartoon version of a nativity scene . ”
Grandfather Pasquale Oliva , looking into a shop window in Naples agreed with her .
“ Something as beautiful as the traditional nativity scene should n’t be spoiled by these figurines of personalities and I do n’t think children like them . ”
However , his young grandson Francesco was quick to disagree , snapping “ yes ” when asked if he liked the modern twist on tradition .
Yesterday , two of the sustainable food movements great leaders , Wes Jackson , plant geneticist and president of the Land Institute , and farmer / writer Wendell Berry opined on their growing concern for the havoc we are wreaking on our soil .
They talked about the long term damage of even normal rainfall , “ by the little rills and sheets of erosion on incompletely covered or denuded cropland ” — should there not be practices in place to consciously rebuild the soil — and went on to state outright the other great threat , “ degradations resulting from industrial procedures and technologies alien to both agriculture and nature . ”
Those alien technologies and procedures ?
Our current industrial agriculture system , which promotes a one - crop - at - a - time policy , and ignores the lessons learned over 10,000 years of agricultural practices ( inter - cropping , small - scale farming using minimal oil inputs ) , instead promoting the discoveries from agribusiness - funded labs over the last half - century .
Most chillingly , Berry and Jackson reminded us that “ Civilizations have destroyed themselves by destroying their farmland . ”

But they did n’t stop there .
The authors throw the gantlet down on the theory and values behind our economy over the last 50 - 60 years , when “ we have let ourselves believe that as long as we have money we will have food . ”
They go on :
“ If we continue our offenses against the land and the labor by which we are fed , the food supply will decline , and we will have a problem far more complex than the failure of our paper economy .
The government will bring forth no food by providing hundreds of billons of dollars to the agribusiness corporations . ”
Their suggestions included increasing acreage in perennial plants and long term thinking in our next Farm Bill .
But will Obama stop taking the limp approach to food that he has so far ( see Vilsack ) and finally recognize the centrality that food has to all other issues ?
We shall see .
The authors credit the growing interest of producers and consumers for beginning to change our unhappy fate .
I for one do n’t know enough about soil , but I ’m learning .
I ’ve decided to begin composting in my basement — I ’ll be picking up my worm house from the Union Square farmer ’s market on Saturday .
And I ’m hoping to set up a composting station on the roof for myself and my neighbors in the springtime , hopefully to produce some good soil for our garden .
I know for most people , the word soil alone is enough to make your eyes grow heavy .
But it is time to wake up to the fact that our whole life is dependent on good topsoil , and we are slowly but surely sealing our own fate .
Invest in yourself : learn by doing .
Read on to learn how the NerdKits philosophy is implemented in our kits , and why other electronics kits will leave you intellectually unsatisfied .

What 's a NerdKit ?
A NerdKit is a combination of electronic parts and wisdom , which together will teach you about digital electronics , embedded systems , and how to bridge computers with the " real world " .
The electronics world has changed dramatically in the past few decades .
We want to make sure that it 's still easy to get involved with modern technology , and to experience a challenging and rewarding hobby !
A NerdKits microcontroller kit is appropriate for software hackers looking to branch out into electronics , and has educational material to allow even middle - schoolers and high - schoolers ( ages 12 + ) looking for a fun challenge to learn by doing , especially with the help of a techie parent !
A microcontroller is a small computer on a single chip , including processing , memory , and inputs and outputs -- see the Wikipedia page for more information .
What 's the point ?
We just graduated from MIT , and when we asked ourselves what we wished we had had before coming there , the answer was simple : more hands - on experience in electrical engineering and computer science ( EECS ) .
Looking around , we realized that we could provide these experiences to others in the form of NerdKits :
Kits for a digital generation .
Decades ago , amateur radio was the home of hobbyists .
Old school " 100 - in - one " kits are still around , but this is the digital age , and educational electronics kits have n't been updated .
Flexible to experiment .
For someone just getting started , not yet possessing the confidence in their design skills , it 's important that parts be cheap enough that breaking them is n't going to be a heartbreak .
Others sell starter kits for $ 150 or more -- too much for someone on a student budget to take the leap into a new field .
Our microcontroller boards have easily replaceable parts , instead of being stuck with one bad burnt - out component ruining an entire circuit board .
Additionally , NerdKits include powerful parts like an LCD display , which you wo n't find in other starter kits .
Guidance to get started , with intuition and wisdom .
While MIT may be known for bestowing its students with rigid mathematical analysis skills , it 's also true that a significant focus in our engineering classes was on learning the intuition crucial to being a successful designer .
Through our included documentation , we 'll walk you through the steps of getting started .
The real thing !
Our kits do n't give you a fixed , watered - down system like others do .
We give you a lean but powerful chip , supported by a powerful open - source C compiler to help you learn microcontroller programming .
And we help you design your circuit yourself , instead of constricting you to a fixed layout .
When your skills have advanced and you 're ready for more , there 's a large community of amateur and professional developers on the internet .
The educational opportunities here are amazing , and we 've taken this hobby , pursued it in college , and turned it into a career .
But we can only imagine if we had a kit like this one when we were in high school !
Most motivated middle - school students should be capable of making interesting projects with the NerdKit .
Lots of people these days have some understanding of computers and simple computer programming , but we 'd like to push you further .
With microcontrollers , you can touch the real world with inputs and outputs -- sensors and actuators -- some of which are included in the NerdKit , and many others which you can add yourself .
And we hope you 'll discover the same passion we have grown for this exciting hobby .
" Thanks guys , I think your kit is exactly what I need to get started poking about with hardware .
I 've wanted to do that for a while , but everything I could find was either too dumbed - down , too locked up ( step by step , and nothing else ) , or too over - my - head ( assuming I 'd majored in EE or something ) . "

Why should I get a NerdKit ?
You could go out and put this kit together yourself , and we expect that after you have your first NerdKit , you could build a second one after learning so much from the first .
There are a few reasons why a NerdKit makes sense as a way to start :
Step - by - step instructions are included .
The documentation we include walks you through the steps required to build a simple project .
And , in contrast to other kits which just give you a set of steps to follow , we try to give you the intuition behind why those steps exist .
No soldering !
Out of all the steps of the assembly process , newcomers to the field are most likely to cause damage to the sensitive integrated circuits when using a 700 °F tool to solder joints , and soldering can also be a source of burns if one 's not careful with the tool .
We use solderless breadboards so you can change your design more rapidly without waiting for your soldering iron to heat up .
A completed design ( with room to grow ) .
With our kit , you know you wo n't be missing any vital parts that will delay your development , since we 've already figured out what 's needed to build a working system .
" Got your kit and got everything working .
Love the kit -- exactly what I need to get started with microcontrollers .
Told all the folks at work about it . "
- Jim S .
San Leon , TX
I 'm scared to jump in .
If we can leave you with one message , it 's simple : do n't be afraid .
The purpose of NerdKits is to reduce the risks involved with getting started in the electronics field .
By doing so , we make digital electronics available to a much wider population , and additionally increase the chance that you 'll be successful in this endeavor .
I 'm excited .
How do I get started ?

When the design is finished and you ’re about to start the coding process , you have to prepare your graphics .
If you ’re working with a pattern background you need to export only the repeating fragment .
It can be a bit tricky to isolate a fragment to achieve a seamless pattern background .
For geometric patterns there is a method I always follow and that I want to share with you .
Take for example a perfect 45° diagonal line pattern .
How do you define this pattern fragment so it will be rendered seamlessly ?
Here is the method I usually follow to avoid a mismatch .
First , zoom in so you see enough detail and you can distinguish the pixels .
Select the Rectangular Marquee Selection tool and start your selection at the intersection of 2 different colors of a diagonal line .
Hold down the Shift key while dragging so you drag a perfect square .
Release the mouse when you reach the exact same intesection ( as your starting ) point at the top right .
Copy this fragment ( using Copy Merged : Cmd / Ctrl +
Shift + C ) and paste the fragment in a new layer .
Give this layer the name ‘ pattern ’ .
Now hold down the Command Key ( Control Key on Windows ) and click on the ‘ pattern ’ layer in the Layers Palette to select the fragment .
Now go to Edit > Define Pattern , enter a name for your pattern and click OK .
Test your pattern in a new document .
Create a new document of 600 px by 400 px , hit Cmd / Ctrl +
A and go to Edit > Fill … and choose your pattern .
If the result is OK , you have created a perfect pattern fragment .
Below you see this pattern enlarged .
The guides show the boundaries of the pattern fragment and the red pixels are the reference points .
The red pixels at the top right , bottom right and bottom left should match the red pixel at the top left .
This technique should work for every geometric pattern .
Some patterns are easier than others , but this , and the Photoshop pattern fill test , has always been my guideline .
Other geometric pattern examples
Example 1
Not all geometric pattern fragments are squares .
Some patterns look easy at first sight , because they look very repetitive , but they can be a bit tricky .
Zoomed in pattern fragment with point of reference shown :
Example 2
Some patterns have a clear repeating point that can guide you , such as the blue small circle of this pattern as you can see from this zoomed in screenshot :
Zoomed in pattern fragment with point of reference shown :
Example 3
The different diagonal colors makes a bit more tricky to extract the correct pattern fragment .
The orange dot , which is the starting point of the selection is captured a few times inside the fragment selection :
Life is short .
You realize that even more when you are old .
I have said before that in dog years I am already dead .
So each morning when I wake up there is a brief moment until I realize that I still need my glasses to see the clock before realizing I must still be in this old body of mine …
Then I turn and put a mirror under Harold ’s nose to determine if I still need to put on my make - up and do my hair .
As a parent you eventually come to accept that one day your children and family members will have to continue on without you .
And you spend much of your life thinking that you are preparing them for that moment only to realize that you are really just preparing yourself .
Have I left them with a brighter future and a better world ?
You certainly hope so and knowing so makes each day a little easier .
So imagine my shock when about 8 years ago the village idiot was suddenly running the show .
Panic set in .
My God what if I go tomorrow and that jackass screws things up and suddenly my children and grandchildren are left to clean up the mess .
Folks , I may not be here next time so I want you to remember this .
You really should strive for a Presidential nominee who is smarter than you … someone who understands you but does n’t necessarily need to have a beer with you .
Strive for a Renaisance man… someone who knows that Walt Whitman was n’t a guy who made chocolate candy .
And a good rule of thumb from this point forward : someone who fully understands that the Flintstones is n’t a documentary .
We are a large , diverse country but we live in an even larger , more diverse world .
No President ever has a mandate .
Even the least among us need to be heard , and if possible , helped .
Differences should be celebrated not feared .
I hope one day we all understand that love is not about the body ; it is about the heart .
Think about it .
Margaret and I really do enjoy your comments and all the excitement around our silly little blog .
It is keeping us young so thank you .
We have an idea for the blog that we think you will enjoy .
Stay tuned … and thanks for stopping by .
We mean it .
Really .

Campaigners accused the council of acting like a " jumped up version of the A - Team " by using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) to target the former postmistress Rashmi Solanki and her husband Dips , who run the local shop .
In my work as a psychologist , I have often dealt with men going through , or just out of , a divorce .
Many have been so devastated when the marriage was floundering or over that they gave their wife everything that they had or left her with the house , the kids , or , in this case , a kidney :
A New York doctor is demanding that his estranged wife pay him $ 1.5 million to compensate him for the kidney he gave her while they were still on good terms .
Dr. Richard Batista spoke Wednesday to reporters at his lawyer ’s office in Garden City , Long Island .
He said he gave his kidney to Dawnell Batista in June 2001 .
She filed for divorce in July 2005 .
Richard Batista wants his estranged wife to pay a heavy price for cheating on him and destroying their marriage , reports the Daily News .
“ She slapped me with divorce papers when I was in surgery trying to save another person ’s life , ” the doctor said , according to the newspaper .
The 49 - year - old Batista works for Nassau University Medical Center .
The couple have three children , ages , 8 , 11 and 14 .
It appears , according to one news source ( in video ) , that the Batistas ’ marriage was not going so well at the time Batista gave his wife a kidney .
In order to save her life and the marriage , he did what he thought was the right thing .
Maybe it was .
But perhaps he did it for the wrong reason .
Maybe he used his kidney as a tool to get his marriage back on track — just like many men who buy their wives a fur , jewelry , or a house try and “ save the marriage . ”
Guess what ?
It never works .
If you look around the blogosphere or media , you will see the kidney story treated naively as an ethical question or framed as simple revenge or even a publicity stunt .
For example , at Newsday.com , votes were taken asking , “ Is it fair for the husband to demand a donated kidney from his wife ? ”
Most people voted “ No , and it ’s unethical , Do n’t toy with human life ” or “ No , it ’s vindictive .
People fall out of love . ”
Legal analyst Lisa Bloom for CBS ’
The Early Show even goes as far to say that Batista did it as a publicity stunt :
It ’s a touching tale and one that has been met with ridicule from area divorce attorneys .
“ She ripped out his heart , but he does n’t get to rip out her kidney , ” says Lisa Bloom , a legal analyst for CBS ’ The Early Show .
Calling this a publicity stunt by the scorned husband , Dr. Richard Batista , Bloom says there is absolutely no chance his soon - to - be ex-wife , Dawnell , will have to give her new kidney back .
“ He wants his pound of flesh , ” Bloom said , but “ he ’s not going to get it by way of the kidney . ”
In my mind , these reasons are too simplistic .
I think the reason he wants his kidney back is psychological and emotionally complex — reasons that are rarely ascribed to men since our society does n’t think of them as emotionally complex as women .
Is it possible that some men give in too much in their marriage and try so hard to make it work ( much like the women of yesteryear ) that they are now angry and resentful and in need of assertiveness training ?
Kind of like a reverse Women Who Love Too Much ?
Maybe so — at least , it seemed that way when I took a look at the video of Batista talking about what happened .
I realized that much of his anguish was because he was trying to understand why he had let himself be taken advantage of by a woman and how ill - prepared he was to deal with the feelings of betrayal and rejection that followed as part of his gift .
His anger toward himself for doing so may be behind his need to receive payment or get something back , to make himself feel right again for having been naive enough to think that using a kidney to mend a marriage would work .
So , what can men learn from the kidney case ?
If your marriage is floundering , beware of using any kind of gift — even a kidney — to win her back .
If you want to be altruistic and donate something as precious as an organ to a spouse , do so freely .
But do n’t do it because you want her back .
Understand your motives .
And never , ever give gifts to someone who is thinking of leaving you , does n’t want you , or treats you like crap , as a way to make them change or stay — it will never work .
Have you ever given gifts or something precious to a girlfriend or wife in the hopes of winning her back or do you know someone who did ?
If so , drop a comment below and let us know what happened .
With Ubuntu , the devotees believe , things might finally be different .
“ I think Ubuntu has captured people ’s imaginations around the Linux desktop , ” said Chris DiBona , the program manager for open - source software at Google .
“ If there is a hope for the Linux desktop , it would be them . ”
Close to half of Google ’s 20,000 employees use a slightly modified version of Ubuntu , playfully called Goobuntu .
PEOPLE encountering Ubuntu for the first time will find it very similar to Windows .
The operating system has a slick graphical interface , familiar menus and all the common desktop software : a Web browser , an e-mail program , instant - messaging software and a free suite of programs for creating documents , spreadsheets and presentations .
While relatively easy to use for the technologically savvy , Ubuntu — and all other versions of Linux — can challenge the average user .
Linux cannot run many applications created for Windows , including some of the most popular games and tax software , for example .
And updates to Linux can send ripples of problems through the system , causing something as basic as a computer ’s display or sound system to malfunction .
Canonical has tried to smooth out many of the issues that have prevented Linux from reaching the mainstream .
This attention to detail with a desktop version of Linux contrasts with the focus of the largest sellers of the operating system , Red Hat and Novell .
While these companies make desktop versions , they have spent most of their time chasing the big money in data centers .
As a result , Ubuntu emerged as a sort of favored nation for those idealistic software developers who viewed themselves as part of a countercultural movement .
“ It is the same thing companies like Apple and Google have done well , which is build not just a community but a passionate community , ” said Ian Murdock , who created an earlier version of Linux called Debian , on which Ubuntu is based .
Mainstream technology companies have taken notice of the enthusiasm around Ubuntu .
Dell started to sell PCs and desktops with the software in 2007 , and I.B.M. more recently began making Ubuntu the basis of a software package that competes against Windows .
Color Red Makes Men Hot For Women
Hi puppets .
How are you all doing today ?
Geppetto says the color red makes men hot for women .
When the men see red they charge for the flag .
A groundbreaking study by two University of Rochester psychologists to be published online Oct. 28 by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology adds colorliterally and figuratively to the age - old question of what attracts men to women .
Through five psychological experiments , Andrew Elliot , professor of psychology , and Daniela Niesta , post - doctoral researcher , demonstrate that the color red makes men feel more amorous toward women .
And men are unaware of the role the color plays in their attraction .
The research provides the first empirical support for society 's enduring love affair with red .
From the red ochre used in ancient rituals to today 's red - light districts and red hearts on Valentine 's Day , the rosy hue has been tied to carnal passions and romantic love across cultures and millennia .
But this study , said Elliot , is the only work to scientifically document the effects of color on behavior in the context of relationships .
Did red hair get selected for because it made women look more hot to men ?
Men who think they respond to women in a thoughtful and sophisticated manner are deluding themselves .
Although this aphrodisiacal effect of red may be a product of societal conditioning alone , the authors argue that men's response to red more likely stems from deeper biological roots .
Research has shown that nonhuman male primates are particularly attracted to females displaying red .
Female baboons and chimpanzees , for example , redden conspicuously when nearing ovulation , sending a clear sexual signal designed to attract males .
" Our research demonstrates a parallel in the way that human and nonhuman male primates respond to red , " concluded the authors .
" In doing so , our findings confirm what many women have long suspected and claimed  that men act like animals in the sexual realm .
As much as men might like to think that they respond to women in a thoughtful , sophisticated manner , it appears that at least to some degree , their preferences and predilections are , in a word , primitive . "
We are just smart monkeys .
Women do n't get turned on by red in men .
Red did n't make women seem any more intelligent or kind .
In the final study , the shirt of the woman in the photograph , instead of the background , was digitally colored red or blue .
In this experiment , men were queried not only about their attraction to the woman , but their intentions regarding dating .
One question asked : " Imagine that you are going on a date with this person and have $ 100 in your wallet .
How much money would you be willing to spend on your date ? "
Under all of the conditions , the women shown framed by or wearing red were rated significantly more attractive and sexually desirable by men than the exact same women shown with other colors .
When wearing red , the woman was also more likely to score an invitation to the prom and to be treated to a more expensive outing .
The red effect extends only to males and only to perceptions of attractiveness .
Red did not increase attractiveness ratings for females rating other females and red did not change how men rated the women in the photographs in terms of likability , intelligence or kindness .
What color makes men more attractive ?

ED #108 : NVIDIA GeForce & Fallout 3
While testing Fallout 3 for use in our NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 review , it kept crashing over and over again .
We just could not complete a single test run properly .
Sometimes , Fallout 3 would crash on loading the game , or when we encounter a character .
Most often though , it would crash when V.A.T.S. mode is activated .
We tried a variety of " fixes " because Fallout 3 has been known to be a little buggy .
We also reinstalled DirectX 10 , in case it was killed by DirectX 9 .
Still no go .
Guess who was the real culprit ?
Finally , we decided to try an older NVIDIA driver and hey , it worked !
Arghhh ..
So many hours of wasted time .
The NVIDIA GeForce driver version 181.20 was obviously causing the crashes in Fallout 3 , even though it was a WHQL - certified driver , and the first and only one at that time to support the GeForce GTX 295 .
We wrote to NVIDIA about the problem and after testing on their end , they verified that the GeForce driver version 181.20 would indeed cause Fallout 3 to crash .
Fortunately , NVIDIA has new driver version 181.22 ( released on of Jan. 22 ) which addresses this very issue .
So , if you are using an NVIDIA graphics card and Fallout 3 keeps crashing on you , try upgrading to the new version 181.22 GeForce driver !
Remember , it does not only work for the new GeForce GTX 295 cards , but also all older NVIDIA graphics cards .
Bah !
It Did n't Work !
Recently , we found time to give Fallout 3 another try .
Okay , we just could n't resist playing it again !
We tried the new GeForce 181.20 driver ( Windows Vista 64 - bit ) , as advised by NVIDIA .
We found that it did indeed solve the V.A.T.S. mode crash issue .
However , we discovered that Fallout 3 would still crash pretty often , albeit randomly instead of being triggered by initiating V.A.T.S. mode .
Looks like NVIDIA did not really solve the Fallout 3 crash problem with their 181.20 WHQL driver .
Fed up , we looked for a newer driver , and found that NVIDIA just released a new beta driver - 182.05 Beta on Feb. 10 , 2009 .
It promised , amongst other things , to improve Fallout 3's performance at high resolution and AA levels by up to 8 % .
Well , that 's nice if the driver would actually run Fallout 3 without crashing !
Fortunately , the new GeForce 182.05 Beta driver did the trick .
It behaved much better with Fallout 3 , causing only a single crash during the last 4 - 5 hours of playtime .
So if you are experiencing problems getting Fallout 3 to run properly with an NVIDIA graphics card , skip the 181.20 WHQL driver .
Either use the new GeForce 182.05 beta driver or revert to the older GeForce 181.20 beta driver .

Norwegian lemming
Probably the most dreaded predator in northern Scandinavia .
The lemming can sit quietly like this in the snow for months , patiently waiting for a prey to come by .
A single reindeer or a grown man will secure him enough food for the whole winter .

Work on the replica was continuing just last week A life - size replica of the Taj Mahal , often described as the world 's most beautiful building , is due to open for visitors in Bangladesh .
The replica has been built by a Bangladeshi filmmaker .
Ahsanullah Moni said he wanted his countrymen to experience the beauty of the Indian monument even if they were too poor to travel to see the original .
The 17th Century Taj was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his beloved queen , Mumtaz Mahal .
The emperor is buried next to his queen in the monument in the northern Indian city of Agra , which is visited by millions every year .
The $ 58 m ( £ 39 m ) replica has been built in Sonargaon , a small town in the Bangladeshi countryside .
' Marble and diamonds '
Mr Moni , who is a successful director of Bangladeshi films , says he hopes his replica , which has been built an hour 's drive from the capital Dhaka , will also attract foreign visitors .
Millions of people flock to the Taj Mahal every year
It took 20 years and 20,000 workers to build the original Taj .
Thanks to modern technology , construction of Mr Moni's Taj has taken five years and fewer people .
But it has been neither easy nor cheap .
Mr Moni says he has imported marble and granite from Italy and diamonds from Belgium .
Architects were sent to India to copy the dimensions of the original .
Work on the surrounding grounds and ponds has still not been completed .
Only then will Bangladeshis be able to judge whether Mr Moni has truly copied the beauty and purity of the original Taj Mahal .

At the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference ( WinHEC ) 2008 , USB - IF President , Jeff Ravencraft revealed that the new specifications for USB 3.0 would be fully released on November 17 at the SuperSpeed USB Developers Conference in San Jose .
The USB 3.0 architecture is also named SuperSpeed USB due to its incredible 5 gigabit per second ( Gbps ) data transfer speed .
SuperSpeed USB 3.0
Standard - A internal pins
The USB 3.0 specification guarantees an increased performance of 10 times compared to the capabilities of the current USB 2.0 , providing a bandwidth of 600 MB/s second .
Devices employing USB 3.0 specifications are planned to be available to consumers in 2009 or 2010 and would be backwards compatible with USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 .
“ Delays have held USB 3.0 back , ” said Lars Giusti of Microsoft .
However , he predicts that the fully signed - off USB 3.0 specifications would only be presented to the implementers in the USB 3.0 Promoter Groups in 2009 .
Subsequently , it would take approximately another year until broad - scale product deployment of host controllers , devices , and systems utilizing USB 3.0 would be available in the market .
President and general manager of the chipset business unit at AMD , Phil Eisler , released a statement saying , “ The future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive .
Lifestyles filled with HD media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer .
USB 3.0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the PC platform . ”
SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Mini- B connector
Microsoft is currently in the planning stage of selecting which operating system to incorporate the USB 3.0 specifications into .
“ The Microsoft USB core team is currently evaluating which operating systems we should support USB 3.0 on .
It ’s a difficult decision and a difficult choice because there are all these moving parts , ” said Giusti .
“ Our early indications tell us that most partners think that we should support USB 3.0 on at least Windows Vista . ”
According to early information supplied by Microsoft the improvement in transferring large files using USB 3.0 based hardware will be considerable .
Performance comparison : Transfer of 25GB HD movie :
USB 1.1 : 9.3 hours
USB 2.0 : 13.9 minutes
USB 3.0 : 70 seconds
SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Standard - A connector
TFOT has previously looked at USB 3.0 in September 2007 , predicting USB 3.0 to arrive in 2008 .
We have also written on the MultiSwitch , the first USB sharing hub , which is a new extension to USB that will enable sharing of various USB peripherals between computers and allows the sharing of information and content from devices such as DVD players , cameras , printers , and scanners between laptops and desktops using a simple USB cable .
Other advanced data transfer technologies covered by TFOT include Georgia Electronic Design Center ’s wireless technology , which demonstrates transfer rates of 15 gigabits per second ( Gbps ) at a distance of 1 meter , 10 Gbps at 2 meters , and 5 Gbps at 5 meters .

The inconclusiveness of the Poznan talks last weekend signals once again that our leaders are prepared to drink in the last chance saloon - with last orders being called ( Global climate change decisions on hold for Obama , 15 December ) .
There is just a year left for our political leaders to put a post - 2012 deal in place at Copenhagen next year , if there is to be any hope of preventing global warming from reaching really dangerous levels .
But slow progress seems to signal a deal that will fall short of expectations .
Scientists have presented a barrage of evidence for global warming and I have seen with my own eyes the irrevocable changes taking place in the Arctic Ocean .
Each year more and more of the fragile multi- year sea ice melts and it could be less than a generation before the ice cap disappears completely .
The loss of this astonishingly beautiful place will be a tragedy in itself , but a still greater calamity for us all is its unbalancing of the Earth 's whole eco-system .
Next year , during the critical few months before Copenhagen , I will be leading a scientific expedition to the north pole to assess the status of the ice .
Using a specially designed ice - penetrating radar , the Catlin Arctic Survey team will take millions of readings of the thickness of the floating ice over a 1,200 - kilometre route .
The data will be analysed by the world 's leading scientists from organisations including Nasa .
I believe I owe it to my children and future generations to carry out this important , if hazardous , survey .
Putting our abilities as explorers at the disposal of climate scientists is our team 's small contribution to securing a solution .
It is to be hoped world leaders recognise early enough they have a still greater role to play in Copenhagen next year .

It might seem a bit early to start referencing Christmas songs , but I figure if the retailers can do it , so can I .
And I do sincerely apologize for anything that gets stuck in your head for the rest of the day .
1. White Christmas .
Irving Berlin knew he had just written a classic - when he asked his secretary to take down the song he had just written , he said , " I just wrote the best song I 've ever written .
Hell , I just wrote the best song anyone 's ever written ! "
Bing Crosby sang it on his radio show in 1941 and recorded it in 1942 .
It was the best - selling single in any music category until Elton John 's version of Candle in the Wind for Princess Diana took over in 1998 .
2. The Christmas Song .
The words in the song are so evocative of winter , you would assume that they were written over a mug of cocoa sitting by a fireplace or something .
But nope - it was written during a heat wave in California .
Mel Torme dropped by his friend Robert Wells ' house , where Wells was supposed to be writing songs for a couple of movies .
Instead , Mel walked in and Wells had written down " Chestnuts roasting ...
Jack Frost nipping ...
Yuletide carols ...
Folks dressed up like Eskimos , " because he was trying to think cold .
Mel thought it was a great idea for a Christmas song , so the two of them knocked the song out in 40 minutes .
3. Santa Claus is Coming to Town .
The earliest known public airing of this song was in November , 1934 on a radio show .
It was an instant hit - it sold 100,000 copies of sheet music the very next day , and more than 400,000 by Christmas .
4. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas first appeared in the Judy Garland musical Meet Me In St. Louis .
But the lyrics were kind of depressing : they included , " Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas , it may be your last , " " Faithful friends who were dear to us will be near to us no more , " and " Until then we 'll have to muddle through somehow . "
The lyrics have changed over the years - Dean Martin rewrote that last lyric for Frank Sinatra 's album A Jolly Christmas , and that 's the version we probably know best : " Hang a shining star upon the highest bough . "
5. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was created by a Montgomery Ward employee in 1939 , for the company .
Johnny Marks decided to adapt the character to a song , which pretty much made it an instant hit - he was responsible for other Christmas songs like I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day , Rockin ' Around the Christmas Tree and A Holly Jolly Christmas .
It was first sung by Harry Brannon , but the 1949 Gene Autry version is probably the one you know and love ( or loathe , depending ) .
6. Like Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas , Silver Bells was originally in a movie too - The Lemon Drop Kid .
It was sung by Bob Hope and Marilyn Maxwell .
The best part , though , is that the song started out being called Tinkle Bells ... until the songwriter was telling his wife about his great new song and she informed him that tinkle was what little kids did when they peed .
The song was inspired by Salvation Army workers ringing bells outside in the snow .
7. Frosty the Snowman was pretty much written to capitalize on the success of Gene Autry 's Rudolph rendition ( it was released just one season later ) .
I 'm partial to the versions Jimmy Durante recorded to go with the 1969 T.V. special , myself .
8. Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer .
Husband and wife duo Elmo and Patsy recorded the song in 1978 and it started circulating in the San Francisco area .
It only took a couple of years to become a cult hit .
However , Elmo and Patsy divorced , so in 1992 , Elmo recorded it solo .
He also released a sequel in 2002 : Grandpa 's Gonna Sue the Pants Offa Santa .
I feel like he tried to capitalize on that one about 20 years too late .
9 . The Chipmunk Song ( Christmas Don't Be Late ) .
Another earworm , I think .
I do n't even know all of the words but I can guarantee I 'm going to have the tune in my head for the rest of the day .
All I know is , " I still want a Hula - Hoop . "
Anyway .
Recorded in 1958 by David Seville himself , Ross Bagdasarian , the song sold 4.5 million copies .
Jason Lee recorded a version when he played David Seville in the 2007 movie Alvin and the Chipmunks .
10 . Santa Baby , the song about wanting lots of extravagant items for Christmas , was first recorded in 1953 by Eartha Kitt , AKA Catwoman .
Lots of people have covered the song - Madonna , famously , but also RuPaul , LeAnn Rimes , Natalie Merchant , Kylie Minogue and ( go figure ) The Pussycat Dolls .
I have no doubt Eartha Kitt 's is the best .
The song was co-written by Joan Javits , the niece of Jacob Javits , a New York Senator .
Minnesota wo n't know who won the contested U.S. Senate race until at least mid-December , but now the final arbiters for the recount have been named .
They include a cast of heavy - hitters topped by Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Magnuson , a former law partner of Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty , three other high - ranking judges and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , a DFLer , who made the selections Wednesday .
The freshly appointed state Canvassing Board will be charged with certifying vote totals Tuesday and , more important , settling differences over disputed ballots once local officials complete their recount .
The resolution of those disputed ballots may decide the winner of the closest Senate contest in the country , although a court challenge may still be in the offing .
For now , the grittiest , most challenging work will begin next Wednesday morning , when auditors , clerks , lawyers and volunteers gather in 120 locations across the state to methodically sort ballots , with lawyers from both campaigns at their elbows , in a process expected to last at least until Dec.
5 . Recount junkies will be able to view updates daily on a website the secretary of state 's office will construct , and all recounts will be conducted in public places .
By Dec. 16 , Ritchie said , the Canvassing Board -- which also includes Supreme Court Justice G. Barry Anderson , Ramsey County District Chief Judge Kathleen Gearin and Ramsey Assistant Chief Judge Edward Cleary -- will start ruling on challenged ballots one by one , in favor of either Republican Sen. Norm Coleman or Democratic challenger Al Franken .
Votes for other candidates will not be included in the recount , and ballots where no voter intent can be determined will be set aside .
Ritchie said that , however long it takes , the recount will not be rushed .
Whatever is produced , he said , has to be " absolutely , exactly correct . "
In a detailed news conference to discuss the recount process , Ritchie also was forced to defend himself against GOP accusations that he is too partisan to oversee such a politically delicate task .
Coleman campaign manager Cullen Sheehan accused Ritchie on Wednesday of taking sides in the recount dispute by going on television and talking about the campaign's " win-at - all - costs " mentality .
Ritchie said his remarks were not aimed specifically at the Coleman campaign .
" I feel like campaigns ... have a winner - take - all , win - at - any - price point of view , " Ritchie said .
" That 's the opposite of election administrators . "
The recount process , he said , " happens to have a lot of emotion to it , but it does n't change our job , which is determining the intent of citizens who chose to participate in this election . "
Ritchie has been the target of GOP fire ever since Coleman 's lead began dwindling last week .
What started as a 725 - vote lead over Franken on the morning after the election shriveled in ensuing days and now stands at 206 votes out of 2.9 million cast .
Boosting public confidence Ritchie is not the only secretary of state to feel heat in a close race .
Ever since Florida 's Katherine Harris found her career nearly buried by the hanging chads of that state 's infamous 2000 presidential recount , secretaries of state have come under increased scrutiny .
The secretary of state is the chief election official in 37 of the 50 states , said Kay Stimson , a spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State in Washington , D.C.
All are affiliated with political parties , but there are various wrinkles .
In Florida , Pennsylvania and Texas , secretaries of state are political appointees , Stimson said .
In Maine and New Hampshire , they 're elected by legislators .
In Alaska , Hawaii and Utah , the lieutenant governor oversees elections .
And in Wisconsin , a nonpartisan chief election official oversees elections .
While the Fourth Amendment guarantees  the right of the people to be secure in their persons ... and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures ,  the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ( WMATA ) made it clear earlier this week that the Constitution does not apply in D.C. According to Metro Transit Police Chief Michael Taborn ,  Inspections could take place at any Metrorail station or Metrobus stop .
They will be random , unannounced and focused on explosive detection . 
While the justification supplied for ignoring the Constitution was one of deterring terrorists , the unfortunate reality is that this gross violation of rights is likely to be completely ineffective .
Comprising 86 Metrorail stations ( many with more than one entrance ) and over 12,000 bus stops , the WMATA operates the second - largest rail transit system and fifth - largest bus network in the United States .
Given that there arent enough officers ( WMATA or D.C. police ) to conduct searches at all those stations and stops , a would - be terrorist only has to find a location without a checkpoint .
Also , searches arent likely to be conducted 24 hours a day , which creates another easy way to exploit the program .
Moreover , because the searches will be random , the odds of catching anyone are low .
Lets assume that 700,000 people ride Metrorail on any given day and that ridership is evenly distributed between all 86 stations .
Lets also assume that searches are being conducted at half the stations .
That means 350,000 people would be subject to search .
If 1 in 10 persons are searched , only 35,000 out of 700,000 total riders ( about 5 percent ) will be searched .
If there are 10 possible terrorists amongst 700,000 riders ( an almost infinitesimally small percentage of the population ) , the probability of catching even a single terrorist as a result of a random search is near zero .
In other words , it amounts to a finding - a - needle - in - the - haystack operation with odds that are only slightly better than winning a million dollars in D.C.s Powerball lottery .
And its worth pointing out that by planning to conduct thousands of random bag searches , the WMATA assumes that terrorists would be too dim to adapt by , say , strapping bombs to their bodies .
Yet adaptive behavior is almost second nature to a terrorist .
If bombs are the threat the WMATA is worried about , a better idea is to have bomb - sniffing dogs at Metrorail stations and bus stops but even then they cant be everywhere at once .
Random searches reflect the post - 9/11 preoccupation with trying to prevent the unpreventable .
We would do well to remember what the IRA once said after a failed attempt on the life of then - Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher :  Today we were unlucky , but remember , we only have to be lucky once you will have to be lucky always .
And its telling that British authorities chose not to institute random searches on the London tube system after the July 2005 bombings , recognizing that doing so would be ineffective and cripple their transportation system .
Instead of trying to be lucky always , we would be better off adopting an approach based on resiliency  the ability to recover readily from misfortune which accepts the cruel reality that terrorist attacks can happen .
So rather than playing the lottery with random searches with dubious effectiveness in preventing terrorist attacks , we would be better off ensuring that we have the capability to quickly recover from an attack while keeping the Metrorail and buses running ( rather than having to shut down the entire system , which was the response on 9/11 ) .
This is exactly the approach the Israeli government has taken in response to the threat of suicide bombers on buses .
Benjamin Franklin once wrote ,  They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . 
The WMATAs random searches will guarantee that we have neither .
COLORADO SPRINGS , Colorado ( CNN ) --
A megachurch paid a 20 - year - old man to keep silent about a sexual relationship he had with disgraced evangelical pastor Ted Haggard , a senior church pastor said .
Rev. Ted Haggard was fired from New Life Church after allegations about a prostitute and drug use arose in 2006 .
Haggard , who was fired amid allegations that he used drugs and patronized a male prostitute in 2006 , had a sexual relationship with a second man -- a 20 - year - old volunteer at his megachurch , the Rev. Brady Boyd , a senior pastor at the church , said Monday .
The church agreed to pay the man in exchange for his pledges not to talk publicly about the relationship , Boyd said , referring to a settlement reached by the man 's lawyer and the church 's insurance company .
Under the settlement , the church provided the man money to pay his college tuition , moving expenses and counseling , Boyd said .
" This was compassionate assistance .
It was to help him move forward , not a settlement to keep him quiet , " said Boyd , senior pastor at New Life Church in Colorado Springs , Colorado .
Watch Haggard in the HBO documentary »
Haggard founded New Life in his basement in 1984 and oversaw its growth to an influential megachurch with roughly 15,000 members .
Haggard is the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals , a group that says it represents millions of people in 45,000 church congregations nationwide .
He and other evangelical leaders participated in weekly conference calls with senior White House aides during the Bush administration .
In November 2006 , allegations surfaced that Haggard had a three - year relationship with Mike Jones , a male escort , involving drugs and sex for money .
After those allegations became public , New Life fired Haggard and he resigned as president of the national organization .
On Friday , New Life Church announced Haggard 's relationship with the volunteer in a letter to the congregation .
In the last three weeks , Boyd said , the young man told him that he was considering going public with his story because Haggard was portraying himself as a victim in an upcoming HBO documentary called " The Trial of Ted Haggard , " which is scheduled to air Thursday .
" I counseled him it was n't going to help him or the church 's healing .
Plus it was in violation of the agreement we signed with them , " Boyd said .
An interview with the former volunteer is scheduled to air Monday evening on KRDO - TV of Colorado Springs , Colorado .
Haggard is scheduled to appear on CNN's " Larry King Live " on Thursday night .
The 2006 controversy involving Haggard erupted when Jones , the former prostitute , said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence .
Haggard said in interviews that he received a massage from Jones , but denied having sex with him .
He also said he bought methamphetamine , but threw it away instead of using it .
The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy , particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex in a documentary called " Friends of God . "
In a settlement with New Life , the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six - figure salary for a year , leave the Colorado Springs area , receive counseling , and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year , according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement who was not authorized to speak on the record .
Jones said Monday that he has spoken with the former church volunteer whom Boyd said had a relationship with Haggard .
" My anger is so much at the church , " Jones said .
" They tried to keep this quiet when all along I 've taken a beating feeling like I was the only one , when clearly there were others . "
Despite the fresh scandal , Boyd said he is hopeful for the future .
" We 've added 1,500 people in the last 18 months , " he said .
" We 're trying to adopt 100 orphans into families in the church .
" We had a leader with flawed character and we 're trying to clean up from the residue of the past .
This will not always define us .
I can promise you that in the days ahead , we wo n't be identified with scandal , but helping the widows and orphans . "

Internet websites could be given cinema - style age - ratings under plans by the Government to limit access to " unacceptable " material , Culture Secretary Andy Burnham has warned .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In an interview with today 's Daily Telegraph , Mr Burnham said " clearer standards " were needed as to what could be displayed online .
He said it was his " absolutely categorical " view that there was material on the web - including beheadings - which should not be available to anyone .
He confirmed one of the proposals being considered by ministers to protect children from harmful material was the introduction of age - ratings for websites .
" That would be an option .
This is an area that is really now coming into full focus , " he said .
Another option said to be under consideration was a requirement on internet service providers to offer a service which would give access only to websites which are suitable for children .
Mr Burnham insisted his proposals were not intended as an attack on freedom of speech , but that some material on the web had gone too far .
" If you look back at the people who created the internet they talked very deliberately about creating a space that governments could n't reach .
I think we are having to revisit that stuff seriously now , " he said .
" I think there is definitely a case for clearer standards online .
You can still view content on the internet which I would say is unacceptable .
You can view a beheading .
" There is content that should just not be available to be viewed .
That is my view .
Absolutely categorical .
This is not a campaign against free speech , far from it ; it is simply there is a wider public interest at stake when it involves harm to other people . "
Digital photo frames are a hot gift item these days , but anyone buying a Samsung SPF - 85H 8 - inch digital photo frame through Amazon.com this year may have given their loved ones a little something extra : A computer virus .
Amazon reached out to its purchasers with
a note
just before the holiday .
Here 's a snippet of their warning to customers :
The alert concerns discovery of the W32. Sality .
AE worm on the installation disc SAMSUNG FRAME MANAGER XP VERSION 1.08 , which is needed for using the SPF - 85H as a USB monitor .
If you are using Vista or a different version of Frame Manager , this issue does not affect you .
It goes on with step - by - step instructions on what to do if you are affected .
Basically , users of Windows XP seem to be most at risk .
This is n't the first time digital frames have been found with viruses .
Last year ,
according to SFGate.com
, a really insidious Trojan Horse virus called Mocmex found on a variety of digital frames that recognizes and over 100 different security programs , was sold at stores that included Sam's Club , Best Buy , Target and Costco .
That virus collected passwords for online games , though experts supposed if that proved successful , there would have been more lucrative targets in their future .
It appears this year 's W32. Sality .
AE virus , however , is already detectable if you have up - to - date virus protection on your computer .
Otherwise , it 'll drop malware onto your Win32 PE executable files , making them 50 kb longer as well as downloading malware from a variety of domains .

Harnessing Biden ’s considerable talents and containing his flaws will be an ongoing challenge for Obama .
Biden 's new role : Good cop
A few days before the election , a Democratic strategist privately worried that a Vice - President Joe Biden was destined for a White House career of dissatisfaction and idle - hands mischief .
“ You ca n’t just have a guy like him at loose ends , he ’d go crazy , ” said a Democratic consultant who knows the affable , bright and mercilessly quotable soon - to - be ex-chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee .
“ They need to keep him busy .
Nobody over there wants him getting into the Secretary of State ’s [ business ] . ”

Harnessing Biden ’s considerable talents and containing his flaws will be an ongoing challenge for Obama .
But Democratic insiders say the appointment of tough - guy Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff — and the administration ’s need to forge a governing coalition that includes some Republicans — has brought Biden ’s upcoming role more clearly into focus :
He 'll play the good cop .
The Democrats ’ apparent failure to win the 60 Senate seats necessary to halt a GOP filibuster has created the need for inter-party ambassadors like Biden who are practiced at the art of aisle crossing .
In his 36 - year Senate career , Biden was never considered a bomb - throwing ideologue , and he still has plenty of chits to cash in with Republicans on the Hill .
“ He ’s probably got more friends among Senate Republicans than John McCain does , and that ’s a huge plus for Barack Obama , who is committed to breaking the partisan roadblock of recent years , ” said Biden spokesman David Wade shortly before Election Day .
And while Emanuel ’s bad - cop reputation may be overstated , all those F - bombs and threats to pulverize GOP incumbents during his tenure of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee boss create an opening for Biden , who maxes out on the Mr. Nice Guy scale .
“ I really have genuine relationships with Republican leaders in the House and the Senate .
I mean , I — I hope this is not self serving , but I 've gained the respect , ” Biden told an Ohio campaign rally in late October .
“ I 've been able to literally work with the Republican leaders , of the committees as well as , as well as the Senate , ” he added .
“ And Barack knows that , Barack has served there and sees that …
I 'm confident that I 'll be spending a fair amount of time [ in Congress ] . ”
In an interview with the New Yorker last month , Biden selected a lofty , if somewhat dubious role model : Lyndon Johnson , who plunged into a deep depression when John F. Kennedy assigned him the role as emissary to a Senate he had bullied , cajoled and utterly dominated as majority leader in the 1950s .
Former Nebraska Sen . Bob Kerrey , a Democrat who ’s fond of Biden , painted a different picture : “ I can see Joe in his room [ just off the Senate chamber ] , smiling , slapping people on the back , making his points , working the members . ”
Indeed , Biden told the New Yorker that his style would be more honey than sting : “ I have never ever , ever screwed another senator , ” he said .
On top of that , Biden could not be more different than the outgoing vice president , who never visited the weekly Democratic caucus lunches in the Senate and had virtually no relationships with the other side of the aisle .
It ’s unlikely that Biden will ever be caught telling another senator to “ Go [ expletive ] yourself ” as Dick Cheney famously said to Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy .
Unless he 's kidding .
Biden ’s best Republican friends in the Senate are centrists , including retiring Nebraska Sen.
Chuck Hagel and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations committee , Indiana Sen .
Dick Lugar , with whom he ’s forged a close working partnership .
Biden is equally popular with some GOP staffers , drawing top - level Republican aides into free - ranging discussion on nettlesome policy problems , even setting up secure computer forums where aides can swap ideas without partisan recrimination , according to a person who participated in one of the chat groups .
The veep in waiting is not a favorite with Republicans hard - liners , though , who still hold grudges over his tough questioning of former Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
The conservative bloc in the Senate remains unified , and could still engineer a filibuster of Obama priorities .
“ Joe ’s really well liked — and he can be a real stand - up guy — but it ’s going to be tough for him , ” said an aide to a top Senate Republican , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ We ’re not in the mood to make deals .
People like him , sure , but people are going to change their votes on defense or health care or taxes just because Joe Biden ’s a great guy ? ”
Biden may find it even tougher with Democratic senators — thrilled to have one of their own in the White House again — who may want to simply bypass the vice president and forge a relationship directly with Obama .
“ He will carve out a role for himself , the problem is that he ’s going to have a lot of competition — and it ’s competition that wo n’t be willing to step aside for him , ” says Jennifer Duffy , who covers the Senate for the non-partisan Cook Political Report .
Obama has n’t served a full term in the Senate but he ’s got plenty of friends in the Democratic caucus : Illinois Sen .
Dick Durbin , the number two Democrat in the Senate , up - and - coming Missouri freshman Claire McCaskill and an ailing but still powerful Ted Kennedy .
Obama also has a unique relationship with one of the most conservative senators , Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , with whom he shares a passion for government reform .
Then there ’s former Majority Leader Tom Daschle — a well - connected kitchen - cabinet Obama adviser who is likely to play some kind of role in the administration .
But Biden ’s biggest competition may come from the president - elect himself .
“ Obama already has his own relationships in the Senate so , in a sense , he does n’t need an emissary , ” Duffy adds .
“ He ’s his own go - to guy . ”
Obama has gone to great lengths to establish personal relationships with legislators , creating direct lines of communication that will be handy even if he runs into problems with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
“ Barack ’s been seriously keeping touch with the [ fiscally conservative Democratic ]
Blue Dogs and all the other foot soldiers — he ’s intent on not making the same mistakes we did , ” said a former aide to Bill Clinton , who worked his congressional transition team in the early 1990s .
“ We thought all we had to do was to keep in touch with the leaders and we left the members and committee chairs alone .
That was a huge mistake and it killed us on the health care …
Barack ’s not making that mistake . ”

I 'm typing this article on Opening Day , 2007 .
That 's opening day for the Boston Red Sox , mind you , because none of the other teams matter !
I 've been a Sox fan for as long as I can remember .
I 'm pretty sure I dropped my first F - Bomb ( at age 5 ) when Bill Buckner got five - holed in the 1986 World Series .
And I certainly dropped some of my loudest ones during Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series thanks to Aaron Boone , Grady Little , and a merciless God .
Back in the spring of 2000 – my freshman year at Babson , a business school just outside of Boston – I bought a new Sox hat .
This morning , seven years and six opening days later , as I left the house to head in to train my first client at 7:30 AM , I tossed that same hat on .
Granted , I have n't worn it every day , but it has stuck with me through all the frustrations and successes of my professional career and personal life , not to mention the emotional roller coaster that is the life of a Red Sox fan .
Sure , I could have very easily purchased a new hat whenever I wanted one .
They 've introduced Red Sox hats in pink , green , and every color in between .
There have been Red Sox beanies and doo-rags .
You can even buy camouflage Sox hats ; apparently , it 's wise to cover up your team allegiance when in the jungle .
My point is , would buying into any , or worse , ALL of the bells and whistles have made me any better or more dedicated a Red Sox fan ?
In case you can't see where I 'm going with this , for the sake of time , I 'll be nice and blunt for you :
Most people are doing a lot of stupid stuff in the gym .
The Internet has been a tremendous resource for billions of people in a wide variety of realms , but as I 've come to realize , it 's allowed the " curse of knowledge " to rear its ugly head far too easily in the resistance - training world .
I 'm all for training smart , but the problem is that far too many people spend so much time on the " smart " part that they do n't actually remember how to train hard .
So they wind up unknowingly abandoning simple principles that pack major results .
In his book , Overachievement : The New Model for Exceptional Performance , Dr. John Eliot debunks ten myths of high - performance as examples .
Two of my favorites are " use your head " and " learn from your mistakes . "
With respect to these " myths , " Eliot writes ( respectively ) :
" Using your head is stupid .
In high - stakes performance , the real genius is someone like Yogi Berra .
On his way to ten World Series rings and a place in the baseball Hall of Fame , Yogi was thinking about nothing . "
" Legends never say they 're sorry .
Having a long or frequent memory for mistakes and a short or infrequent memory for successes is a guaranteed way to develop fear of failure .
High achievers dwell on what they do well and spend very little time evaluating themselves and their performances . "
With these two " myths " in mind , I want you to stop thinking , and start doing while following these five simple principles that have clearly been lost in many Internet warriors , thanks to the curse of knowledge .
1 – Compound Lifts
Compound Lifts should comprise at least 80 % of your exercise selection – regardless of your training age .
According to the 80/20 Rule , 20 % of what you do accounts for 80 % .
In the context of resistance training , that 20 % consists of squats , deadlifts , chin-ups , various presses , rows , and lunging variations .
Now , theoretically , if you were to quadruple your " 20 % activities , " you 'd get four times the results .
Instead , thanks to the " wisdom " imparted to us by traditional bodybuilding magazines , we opted for inefficiency and stuck to our leg extensions and concentration curls .
Unless these exercises are supersetted with glute injections , they are n't going to get the Average Joe any bigger .
But what about variety ?
Do n't bodybuilders need to hit muscles from a variety of different angles to succeed ?
My response is multi-faceted :
You are n't a bodybuilder unless you 've competed in a bodybuilding show .
Until you do , you 're just a guy ( or girl ) who lifts weights .
I lifted heavy stuff for years before I became a powerlifter .
I jumped over a puddle this morning , but that did n't make me a long - jumper .
Generally , the people asking these questions are the ones who need to heed the " Using your head is stupid " warning .
There is absolutely no reason for beginners to be following programs from advanced , drug - aided bodybuilders who are doing loads of isolation exercises .
You are n't as advanced as you think .
As Dave Tate has written , " You ca n't flex bone . "
Variety is certainly important , but inserting variety should not be synonymous with switching to isolation exercises .
As an example , here are just a few variations you have with a regular ol ' barbell bench press :
Barbell Bench Press
1 - Board Press
2-Board Press
3 -Board Press
4 -Board Press
5 - Board Press
Barbell Floor Press
Barbell Incline Press ( various angles )
Barbell Decline Press ( various angles )
Now , that 's just nine exercises you can rotate for an entire training career .
However , here 's what you can do to take it a step further :
a . Use a close - grip or ultra - wide grip
b. Modify the lowering portion or pause at the bottom .
c. Attach bands , chains , or weight - releasers to the bar .
d . Use the pins in a power rack or a softer object as your " pause " instead of boards .
e . Pick up two pairs of Lynx grips and automatically turn your barbell into a thick bar ( this is a personal favorite of mine ; we use these a ton in our facility , for everything from presses , to pull - ups , to grip - specific exercises ) .
Yep , having a thick bar has spoiled us a little ...
Now , the more advanced you are , the more you can incorporate some isolation exercises here and there .
Why ?
Well , squatting 600 pounds is a lot more taxing than squatting 200 pounds !
Beginners ' non-compound stuff should consist of prehab exercises ( scapular stability , " core " stability , hip abduction work , etc ) .
More advanced lifters can throw in some curls and pressdowns to keep their elbows healthy and get a little volume in without beating themselves up too much .
2 – Get Stronger
Somewhere along the line , people forgot that lifting weights can actually make you bigger and stronger .
All too often , lifters get so caught up in the pump and checking out their guns in the mirror that they overlook the fact that the dumbbell in their hand is pathetically light .
I 'm going to let you in on a little secret of mine : if you focus on getting stronger and just eat , you will get bigger .
Need an example ?
Pete was my college roommate during my freshman year of undergrad , and we 've kept in touch ever since .
That year , each time I left the room to go to the gym , I 'd jokingly ask if he was finally going to come with me to get a lift in .
He never came along – and that 's why he was still 6 - 1 , 160 pounds when I moved back to Boston last August ( 6.5 years later ) .
Last November , out of the blue one day , Pete asked me if he could come by the facility , as he was tired of getting pushed around on the soccer field ( he was offered a spot in the Major League Soccer Developmental League after a scout accidentally discovered him in a summer league game ) .
And , more importantly , his girlfriend had called him skinny .
Ouch !
On Pete 's first day , I simply told him to follow the program I outlined for him , lifting in good form and making sure to get stronger each week .
We made sure he was lifting around strong people , but at the same time attending to the less " intense " things like dynamic flexibility and foam rolling .
And , we placed an order for a bunch of Metabolic Drive , Surge , Flameout , and Metabolic Drive bars .
Simplicity at its finest .
Four months later , Pete is now 190 pounds .
His bench is up about 100 pounds , and his squat and deadlift even more than that .
His chronic quad pain is gone , and he actually looks like he lifts weights .
Perhaps most importantly , he 's absolutely addicted to the gym .
Correlation ?
Causation ?
Who cares ?
If you are n't getting stronger , you need to reevaluate your program .
If you are n't trying to get stronger , you need to get your head examined .
3 – Get a Frame of Reference
This is a feature that was " accidentally " included in Pete 's experience .
A word that gets thrown around quite a bit on Internet forums is " inspirational . "
Your lift inspired me !
Your progress is truly inspirational !
You 've been an inspiration to us all !
I 'm all for inspirational , but the problem is that most people have no frame of reference for what is mediocre at best , and what is truly inspirational .
I recently saw someone call a 315 deadlift " inspirational . "
Sorry , folks , but I 'm here to burst your bubble .
A 315 deadlift is not inspirational – at least not unless you 're a 110 - pound female .
315 is speed weight – or something you do for 87 reps on a whim after a dare from John Sullivan ( not that I 'd know anything about stupid challenges like that ) .
315 is less than 50 % of 635
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again : any healthy male under the age of 50 can deadlift 400 within two years of proper training – and most can do it even faster than that .
T - Nation is , for the most part , a male audience .
While women traditionally do better competing against themselves , males respond well to competition and comparisons to others .
Get around strong people , and you 'll get stronger .
It 's like osmosis or something .
It 's safe to assume that someone will reply to this article with : " Technically , osmosis only refers to the diffusion of water across a cell membrane ; you 're ALL wrong , Cressey . "
It 's best for us to ignore this individual , who clearly lives in his parents ' basement , does n't lift , and has never gotten laid .
He should reread this article several times over in order to fully appreciate how hopelessly useless he really is .
4 – Training Environemnt
Find a good training environment and lifting partners .
Last week , a very highly ranked high school basketball recruit I train had a weekend tournament , so we had to push one of his lifts back to a different day .
To accommodate his schedule , he jumped in to train with some older football guys and I .
Here 's one of the things he witnessed :
Consider this image , and combine it with some loud music and the fact that George ( the athlete pictured ) has a tendency to get " psycho eyes " during almost every exercise , and it should come as no surprise that my basketball kid was pretty much in awe of the experience .
He made a point of mentioning how " wild " this guy was .
Now , just a week later , he 's got more motivation to train – and train hard – than ever before .
Being around strong people motivated him to take his own training to the next level .
Now what happens when you take an athlete with a good coach and training program , and then add a solid lifting environment and training partners ?
You get 15 - year old , 188 - pound shortstops front squatting 300 pounds like air .
5 – Attitude Matters !
I 've got a beast on my hands right now .
Antwan Harris has got legs like tree trunks , a 655 deep free squat ( at right about 200 pounds ) , almost no body fat on him , and traps that practically touch his ears .
His bench is up from 290 to 390 in only 4.5 months of training – and he 's still getting better .
Sure , you can attribute a lot of Antwan 's feats to genetics , and more recently , proper training and a generous Biotest hook - up thanks to TC and Tim .
However , what you can't appreciate is the contribution of attitude to his success .
Here is a guy who can get an entire gym fired up ; he 's got more gym attitude than any athlete I 've ever coached – professional , Olympic , or collegiate .
People say that Larry Bird made players around him better ; it might be through different means , but Antwan does that to guys in the weight room – and he fires himself up in the process .
Perhaps the most impressive part about Antwan is that I 've never heard him curse .
He 's a great role model and motivator for all my high school athletes , and he can joke with any one of my adult personal training clients and chat on their level .
In short , he knows how to turn it on and turn it off ; you can't be " Go , go , go ! " all the time , as you 'll desensitize yourself and those around you to the attempted pick - me-ups .
The take - home lesson is to know when to take the intense attitude , and when to relax a bit .
We 'll joke around a bit in the warm - up and post - training when we 're doing flexibility work , but when the time comes to move some big weights and get after it , the music gets turned up and we 're all business .
Recap
I absolutely love the way by which the internet has facilitated information exchange in our industry , but the truth of the matter is that the curse of knowledge has become as serious a problem as ever .
Aim to get stronger on the compound lifts and surround yourself with strong people in a good environment with the right amount of attitude , and you 'll be more than happy with the results .
Now , stop overanalyzing this article and go lift some heavy stuff .
Dear Santa ,
Me again .
Merry Christmas and all that .
It 's certainly been another long year with its ups - and - downs and an ending on a fairly sour note .
The happy memories ( Pelfrey 's and Murphy 's emergence , the re-emergence of Delgado , my first foul ball ) are mixed with the sad ones ( Shea 's swan song , Mets ending the season a day late and game short , the Phillies not losing the World Series ) .
Despite the mix of experiences from 2008 , I 'm again left with that sour taste I experience after 2007 .
As such , I again write you with what I hope to find under the tree for the Mets this Christmas day :
1 ) Derek Lowe .
One of the things that Minaya has done well this offseason is make statement moves for the Mets that also make sense .
I liked the K - Rod signing , and liked even more that J.J. Putz is here to step in should K - Rod need a break .
And Lowe , at this point , feels like the one statement move left for the Mets to make .
He wo n't cost prospects ( though he 'll lose us a few draft picks ) , and he gives the Mets a perfect complement to Johan Santana : a workhorse to back up the ace .
It 's true that John Maine could step into that role with a solid bounceback season in 2009 .
But Lowe to the Mets makes that an easier transition and less of a gamble .
2 ) 18 Million Dollars .
That 's how much it will cost to eat Luis Castillo 's contract .
I 've already made my case for why Castillo can't return to the Mets in 2009 , but still he remains .
As with Lowe , trading Castillo is a statement move that makes sense .
It sends word that the Mets wo n't tolerate sub - par performance while ridding the team of a player whose best days are behind him .
It 's not like a Castillo revival would mimic Delgado 's in any way .
He would n't be a big loss , and coupling the move with bringing Orlando Hudson to Citi Field will help ease that transition .
3 ) The Ability to Ignore the Yankees ' Every Move .
I know I 've asked for some big ticket items at 1 and 2 on this list , but they 're baseball moves .
They upgrade the team from it 's current state .
That being said , I 'm not asking for those moves because of pressure by other teams .
Every time the Yankees shovel more money at another player ( like the $ 180 million they threw in Mark Teixeira 's direction ) , it ratchets up the pressure by the media and fans for the Mets to steal the headlines back .
For as much as Minaya needs to wheel and deal a bit more , those moves can't be reactionary in nature .
It 's mind boggling where the Yankees can find $ 420 million to throw at 3 players , but throwing money at ballplayers has n't worked in the last few years for them .
Just ask A - Rod .
4 ) A No-Hitter .
You did n't deliver last year , and so I 'm asking again .
A Met did n't throw one in the Polo Grounds era nor the Shea Stadium era .
Let 's put this one to rest with a Mets no -hitter in the inaugural season of Citi Field .
5 ) A Resolution in Left Field .
If plan A in left field for the Mets were Daniel Murphy , they would 've cleared up all the rumors long ago .
Instead , we hear that Manny Ramirez probably wo n't be a Met , Pat Burrell could be a good fit for the Mets , and Adam Dunn continues to draw no interest .
I 'm sure Xavier Nady will return to the rumor mill now that he 's clearly expendable in the Bronx .
But whatever will be , will be .
Just let it be sooner , OK ?
6 ) The Return of Banner Day .
Every time the words " Citi Field " are uttered , it 's followed by the phrase " The World Class Home of the Mets . "
It 's as if A ) Citi Field is now automatically the next Wrigley Field , and B ) the park is bigger than the team .
Early reports suggest Citi Field conjures up feelings of Citizens Bank Park in Philly , which in turn mimics Camden Yards in Baltimore .
The short version :
They all look alike .
The only differences nowadays in the modern - day mallparks are the traditions built within the park .
Hence , bringing proven
Mets traditions over to the new ballpark will help that transition , and make Citi Field more of a home and less of a " world class facility " that the Mets happen to play in .
Banner Day is one such tradition that was born in Shea and literally added local color all over the ballpark .
Bring it back .
7 ) A World Series trophy .
If you do n't ask , you 'll never get it .
Thanks , Santa .
I hope the weather does n't slow you down this Christmas Eve .
Give my regards to the Missus .
Merry Christmas ,
Matt
------
I 'll be spending the holidays up north , and most likely away for the latest rumors regarding all things Mets .
If you do n't hear from me sooner , may you and yours have a very Merry Christmas , Happy Hanukkah , Happy Kwanzaa , Happy Festivus , or whatever you might celebrate this holiday season .
Stay warm , and let 's go Mets !
In an election year when the presidential race between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain dominated much of the country ’s attention and media headlines , college and university campuses were certainly not immune to election fever .
University students and faculty across the nation joined in the multitude of voices advocating for , criticizing , protesting , and otherwise commenting on the candidates and the hot - button issues of the season .
With this came some regrettable consequences .
This year , we witnessed a number of colleges and universities prohibiting and punishing many forms of constitutionally protected political speech and activity .
While the rights of students and faculty were ultimately vindicated at several of these institutions , the trend is a troubling one and does not speak well of the climate on campus with respect to tolerance of healthy debate and differing viewpoints .
Indeed , in order to explain and clarify the rights enjoyed by students and faculty at both public and private universities , FIRE issued a Policy Statement on Political Activity on Campus , expanding upon a policy statement we had issued in 2004 , as well as a podcast summarizing our new policy statement .
The main thrust of our 2008 statement is that , while universities have an obligation under the law to maintain political neutrality either as tax - exempt institutions ( in the case of private colleges and universities ) or as government agencies ( in the case of public institutions ) , such an obligation concerns only a narrow range of conduct .
As our statement makes clear , the vast majority of students ’ and faculty members ’ political speech and activity does not endanger universities ’ obligations under the law .
The repression of political speech and activity on campus took several different forms in 2008 .
The University of Illinois ( UI ) system , for instance , prohibited all faculty and staff from engaging in a wide variety of political activity , ranging from wearing a pin or t- shirt in support of a political candidate or party , to conducting such research as “ an opinion poll related to anticipating an election outcome , ” to , perhaps most absurdly , sporting a political bumper sticker on one ’s vehicle .
The restrictions , quite fittingly , were widely criticized .
FIRE wrote University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign President B. Joseph
White to inform him that if the UI system intended simply to prevent faculty and staff from creating the appearance that the university system endorses a particular political candidate or party , it had severely overshot .
As FIRE argued , when a faculty member wears a political button around campus , any reasonable observer would assume that the content of the button , rather than representing the views of the institution , reflects solely the personal views of that individual .
Therefore , allowing faculty members to wear political buttons around campus or affix political bumper stickers to their vehicles would not endanger a public university ’s obligation to refrain from endorsing a particular candidate or party .
President
White subsequently wrote to the university community clarifying that university employees , including faculty , are free to attend political rallies on campus ( provided they are not on duty at the time ) , wear partisan political buttons ( again , provided they are not on duty at the time nor in the workplace of the university ) , and place partisan bumper stickers on their vehicles .
While this statement still left some ambiguity about the speech rights of students and faculty , the fact that the UI system backed off its initial stance represented a welcome change in policy .
Another memorable political speech case arose at the University of Oklahoma ( OU ) .
In September , an OU administrator sent a campus - wide e-mail to all students , faculty , and staff directing them not to use their university e-mail accounts to “ endorse or oppose a candidate , including the forwarding of political humor / commentary . ”
The e-mail alert stated that even personal use of one ’s university account “ may not include political issues outside of the educational context as it places the University at risk of losing its tax exempt status . ”
Similarly to what took place in the University of Illinois system , OU curtailed much protected expression and activity under the rationale of preventing students and employees from creating the appearance that the university endorsed a particular political candidate or party .
FIRE wrote OU President David L. Boren , pointing out that it was patently absurd to argue that any partisan political speech in which university employees or students engage using university e-mail accounts can be banned at a public university , and that by taking this approach , OU was in violation of its legal obligation to uphold the First Amendment on campus .
Ultimately , President Boren issued a clarification e-mail to the OU campus stating that the university ’s previous statement on political speech and activity was “ hereby rescinded and withdrawn ” and that “ [ a ] university should always be a free marketplace of ideas . ”
President Boren clarified that while “ no one should presume to speak on behalf of the university in a way that would imply that the university , as an institution , is supporting a political candidate , party or cause , ” such a limitation would no longer restrict OU students , faculty , and staff from expressing their individual views .
Thus , freedom of speech and common sense thankfully prevailed on the OU campus , allowing members of the university community to once again use their university e-mail accounts to engage in a wide variety of political discourse , partisan speech , political humor and commentary , and the like .
Lastly , the University of Texas at Austin ( UT ) added to the tumult on campus surrounding the election season when it threatened to punish two students for refusing to remove political signs from their dormitory windows .
The students , Connor and Blake Kincaid , were in violation of a UT policy prohibiting the posting of signs in dormitory windows and were told that failure to remove their signs would result in an administrative block against registration for spring classes — effectively , an expulsion from the university .
Though the policy in question was roundly criticized on campus , including by both the University Democrats and College Republicans , the university defended the policy as being necessary “ to prevent things plastered around campus willy - nilly . ”
As Will Creeley argued on The Torch , however , it was questionable whether that justification would be deemed sufficient by a court analyzing the policy under the standards applicable to a reasonable time , place , and manner restriction on the exercise of First Amendment rights .
This type of restriction must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest , and in this case , UT ’s asserted generalized interest in maintaining an aesthetic order on campus would not seem to qualify as a sufficiently significant government interest to justify the university ’s heavy - handed approach .
In any event , Will was right to label the UT regulation “ a silly , if not necessarily unconstitutional , ban on student expression . ”
In the face of public exposure of its policy , UT quickly rescinded its ban on signs in dormitory windows ; UT President William Powers , Jr. , informed students via e-mail that the offending policy and sanctions related to its enforcement would be suspended immediately and replaced with an interim regulation that “ expressly allows the display of signs and posters in students ’ residence hall room windows . ”
This brought a positive end to an unpleasant episode at UT .
While the cases at Illinois , Oklahoma , and Texas garnered widespread attention , and deservingly so , they were not the only political speech cases to crop up during the election season .
FIRE also received reports of political speech and activity being restricted at schools such as Fresno Pacific University , Louisiana State University , and Cuyamaca College in California — all this despite the fact that political speech has consistently and traditionally been accorded the utmost First Amendment protection by the courts .
As the Supreme Court declared many years ago , “ speech concerning public affairs is more than self - expression ; it is the essence of self - government .
The First and Fourteenth Amendments embody our profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited , robust , and wide - open . ” Garrison v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 64 , 74-75 ( 1964 ) ( emphasis added ) .
That such speech was under attack at so many institutions of higher education in the past year is troubling indeed .
So as FIRE and its followers and allies look ahead to 2009 and beyond , what should we take away from these and other instances of repression of political speech and activity on campus ?
I am inclined to think that there is more going on in these cases than the usual censorship of campus speech and association that FIRE sees all too often .
It seems that many university administrators genuinely lack a true understanding of the law regarding their institutions ’ obligations of political neutrality and its impact on the speech rights of students , faculty , and staff .
In that regard , I am hopeful that our Policy Statement on Political Activity on Campus promotes a better understanding of the law .
I would encourage our readers , if they have not already done so , to take a look at our policy statement as well .
It is my sincere hope that a better understanding of the legal issues covered therein will result in fewer instances of repression of campus political speech and activity in 2009 , in future election seasons , and beyond .

Yesterday , I received word about a very special lady , who is also my cousin , and who is fighting for her life .
Her name is Lisa and she is losing her battle with breast cancer .
What saddens me most is that there is an epidemic of breast cancer right now — even though we already possess an effective , nontoxic , and powerful anti-cancer drug that could save her and millions of other women .
Right now , we have the technology and peer - reviewed science to save millions of lives with a harmless extract from the cannabis plant called Cannabidiol , also known as CBD .
If you are interested in using a CBD product then you could easily check out a site like just cbd to help you find what you are looking for .
Cannabidiol is totally safe and non-psychoactive , and CBD based products like thought cloud are being used for therapeutic by many of its users .
It may be a good idea to have a look at hl comic ’s thought cloud page if you want to learn more about CBD based products .
Lives could be saved now , using CBD in cannabinoid lozenges , produced by a company I founded — except for the fact that CBD has been determined by Congress to be a Schedule 1 Drug .
CBD alone is not intoxicating , but it appears to relieve convulsion , inflammation , anxiety , and nausea , and to inhibit cancer cell growth .
Recent studies have shown cannabidiol to be as effective as atypical antipsychotics in treating schizophrenia .
In November 2007 , it was reported that CBD reduces growth of aggressive human breast cancer cells in vitro and reduces their invasiveness unlike vardenafil .
It thus represents the first non -toxic exogenous agent that can lead to down - regulation of tumor aggressiveness .
It is also a neuroprotective antioxidant that provides powerful protection from paralysis in spinal injuries .
You can learn more here about CBD , it ’s effects , and some of the products that have been made from it .
CBD works by blocking the activity of a gene called Id - 1 which is believed to be responsible for the aggressive spread of cancer cells away from the original tumour site – a process called metastasis .
Past work has shown CBD can block aggressive human brain cancers .
The latest work found CBD appeared to have a similar effect on breast cancer cells in the lab .
CBD is totally safe and completely non-psychoactive .
The US government not only knows about CBD , it even hold a patent on the use of cannabinoid medicines .
So why does our own government continue to make CBD a Schedule 1 Drug and thereby sentence my cousin Lisa to death ?
It ’s a tragic situation and , in light of the emerging new science supporting CBD , it is criminal for the US government to continue its destructive and misinformed war on the medical use of cannabis .
Seriously , if you looked like this dude–as if Doctor J’s afro wig was taped backwards on top of your receding hairline for heightened comic effect–would n’t you want to wipe someone ’s smile off of their face ?

Wagn : A Revolutionary Open Source Wiki on Rails
Everyone knows how wikis work by now - but when was the last time you saw a wiki that struck you as advancing the state of the art ?
Despite scores of implementations , most wikis are similar to the original .
But the Wagn project is trying to change this - and using Rails as its infrastructure .
The basic innovation with Wagn is that instead of the editable units being pages , they 're cards - and cards come in many different types , each with their own properties .
So there are basic cards with a rich - text editor , HTML cards , plain text cards , image cards , executable Ruby cards , user account cards , and more .
In addition , it supports " plus cards " - linkages between other cards that let you assign tags or attributes or indicate how other cards combine into tuples .
The effect is a sort of cross between a wiki and a database .
Other features include the ability to nest cards within other cards , dynamic form building , a permissions model , and WQL - the wiki query language - which lets you build up flexible cards through searching for other cards .
The source for Wagn is available on GitHub , and it 's under active development .
If you 've got a reasonably sophisticated user base , it would be a great alternative to a more structured CMS for many sites .

The galleon was discovered as workers dug the foundations of a block of flats Construction workers in Argentina have struck oil - of the olive variety - as they unearthed a colonial - era Spanish ship believed to be 250 years old .
The galleon was discovered as workers dug the foundations of a block of flats in the old port area of Buenos Aires .
Two large jars found inside the ship seem to indicate that it had transported olive oil .
Experts believe the as - yet unidentified vessel was an 18th Century warship driven ashore by a storm .
It was subsequently buried under 7 m ( 21 ft ) of mud .
No gold Archaeologist Gonzalo Valenzuela said the vessel was probably from the 1700s .
" So far , it has yielded several cannons , a pair of jugs we think were used to carry olive oil , and timber from the ship , " Mr Valenzuela told reporters at the digs in Puerto Madero , the AFP news agency reported .
While precious , the ship 's contents are not thought to include gold
But he said there was unlikely to be any gold or other treasure on board as locals would have probably plundered the vessel after it ran aground near the shoreline .
Mayor Mauricio Macri of Buenos Aires said the only reason the ship had been found was through the cooperation of the construction workers with archaeologists , whose wishes to explore a building site might have been ignored in the past .
" What 's important is that this would n't have happened if it was n't for this new historic conscience , in this case the collaboration of the building company , " said Mr Macri .
" In other construction sites in the past the archaeologists would n't even be allowed anywhere near the place .
This company worked together with the archaeologists and we won this unexpected treasure . "
He said the galleon and everything it contains belonged to the citizens of the Argentine capital .

The Islands have fostered for centuries the deeper meaning of Aloha .
To many of us we believe it 's used for greetings , farewells and love , but the word means much more .
It 's a way of life .
It 's a lifestyle of how to properly interact in the natural world which we are all a part of .
Some coin it as " The Way of Aloha " or " The Aloha Spirit . "
It 's being a part of all .
Treat others as you would want them to treat you .
Cherish and protect the earth , the sky and the sea .
We are all one .
Kauai luaus embrace this , and it shows in how much they put into their performances and service that is provided to you .
When the entertainment for the night is finished , they want you walking away feeling special and excited of the experience .
Here 's a quick code of ethics to remember that is taught to youngsters of the Islands .
A - “ ala ” : watchful , alertness L - “ lokahi ” : working with unity O - “ oia ' i'o ” : truthful , honesty H - “ ha' aha 'a ” : humility A - “ ahonui ” : patient , perseverance

Although we do n’t claim to understand it , a cat that has installed itself in a cardboard box is a happy cat .
You can exploit this mysterious fact to make a your own simple corrugated cardboard cat bed like this one , designed as a kitty - sized chaise lounge .
Since it ’s just cardboard , it ’s also easy to modify this basic design to suit your own ( or your cat ’s ) taste .
There are already a bunch of high - end cardboard cat bed setups out there ( example 1 ,
examples 2 - 4 ) , as well as other designs and even chaise lounges .
So why bother ?
We are again motivated by the fact that cats like cardboard boxes .
This chaise lounge is arguably a big step up from a plain old cardboard box , while remaining much simpler to build ( and much much less expensive ) than those other cardboard examples .
To do this project , you ’ll need ( surprise ! ) some big sheets of cardboard , a hot glue gun , markers , scissors and / or a hobby knife , and a cutting mat or other surface where you can safely cut .
You might want to start by downloading the 2 - page PDF pattern :
The pattern has two pages .
The first page has an actual size drawing of the foot of the cat bed , and a corresponding “ tab ” that will keep it in place .
The second page has drawings of all of the parts at 25 % scale , mainly for reference .
If you happen to have a ginormous printer , you are welcome to print out the second page ( at 400 % scale ) and trace the drawings directly onto the cardboard for a head start .
( Or if you ’re making it for your dollhouse , scale down ! )
For the rest of us , we ’ll start by printing out the first page and cutting out a traceable pattern the size of the foot and the size of the tab .
To make a more durable pattern for the foot , you can also trace the pattern directly onto cardboard to cut out a cardboard foot template ( and one for the tab too ) .
For the base you ’ll need a sheet of cardboard at least 20 × 26 ″ .
( Folks outside the US : 1 ″ = 1 inch , which is defined as exactly 2.54 cm. )
Begin by drawing a rectangle 12 ×18 ″ in the center of the sheet .
Try to make the corners right angles . :)
Next , use the foot pattern , eight times , to trace where the feet will go on the outside of your rectangle .
Connect the lines between the two feet on the long side to make one continuous foot / side panel .
Next , add the tabs .
Trace the tab pattern in four places as shown ( the dashed lines ) : stuck to the middle part of the four feet on the long sides of the base .
… And cut it out .
Caution :
Be careful not to stall at this stage of the construction , or your clients may start to get impatient .
Use a straightedge to bend the cardboard at the lines and see how it fits together .
The tabs should fit neatly underneath the feet on the short sides .
One corner at a time , apply hot glue to the tabs and use them to attach the two feet together .
Be sure that you make a clean right - angle joint here so that the finished base is nice and strong .
If your cardboard is weak or your cat is heavy , the base may not yet be strong enough .
Our design includes an optional bottom brace that can make the base much stiffer and stronger .
The brace consists of two pieces each of two shapes of cardboard .
Each piece is essentially a long rectangle with two folds .
( See the PDF pattern for dimensions )
The first fold is a 1 ″ flap that glues to the inside corner of the box .
The second fold helps to form an inner rectangle shape , where each piece has a large area where it can be glued to the next one .
The shapes are not actually rectangles– they are only full height at the edges .
Towards the center , the braces can optionally have less height ( sinking by 1/4 ″ – 1/2 ″ ) so that the top cardboard surface can gradually stretch and deform to make a nice concave surface for the cats .
If possible cut out these braces with the grain of the cardboard ( the corrugation ) pointing perpendicular to the long direction .
You can start the back panel by tracing the long side of the base onto a sheet of cardboard and improvising from there .
This is your chance to be very creative with the design .
( There are certainly a lot of designs to draw inspiration from ! )
After tracing where it meets the base , we just freehand drew the rest with a marker and added a flap on the left hand side to attach to the headboard .
Again , we used the hot glue to attach bottom part of this panel to the base .
The headboard is also a good place to improvise .
Start by tracing the narrow side of the base onto a new sheet of cardboard .
For ours , we crinkled the top of the
cardboard so we could make it curve , and added several tabs to the side so that it could be glued to the matching curved part of the back panel .
Garnish with catnip and you ’re done !
Serves one cat ( at a time ) .

I 'm not celebrating Christmas this year .
This is nothing new for me .
I have n't celebrated it for the last several years , although my family celebrated around me a few years ago when they visited .
I have only one reason for not celebrating this holiday - I see no point in celebrating it .
It really is that simple .
I 'm not trying to make some sort of political statement about my distaste for America 's culture of consumerism .
I 'm not even trying to take some sort of principled atheist stand .
I do n't have anything against people who do celebrate , including the many atheists who do so .
I simply do not see any reasons why I should do so , and so I do not .
I have no strong opinions on whether atheists should celebrate Christmas .
It really is n't up to me , and it is n't something to which I 've devoted much thought .
If you enjoy it , derive some benefit from it , or simply want to participate in it , do so .
You 'll get no judgment here .
Just because I see no reason to join in does not mean I 'll think any less of you for doing so .
Some atheists seem to have developed a complex around their participation in Christmas .
They try to justify their participation by claiming that Christmas has become thoroughly secularized in the U.S. , promoting Winter Solstice , or even referring to themselves as " cultural Christians . "
I 'm not sure if these efforts are directed at other atheists , Christians , or themselves , but I have my suspicions .
In any case , they strike me as completely unnecessary .
If you are an atheist and you want to participate in Christmas , do so .
I certainly do n't need an explanation .
I just wish that the same courtesy would be extended to those of us who have no interest in the holiday .
Happy holidays

Since writing about our lackluster experience with Fiveruns awhile back , I had been keeping my eyes open for a good way to get reliable , comprehensive , and easy - to - interpret performance metrics for Bonanzle .
Prior to our transition away from shared hosting in November , I would browse through our production logs and regularly find actions taking 10 seconds or more , but I had no way to get a good overall sense of what actions were taking the longest , how long those actions were taking , and how it was changing from day to day .
Now we have a solution , and it ’s a dandy .
Many have heard of pl_analyze , but I think that few may realize how truly easy it is to get up and running on any Rails 2.X application ( we ’re now on 2.2 ) .
To start , Geoff has written a strikingly excellent blog about how to change your log format to be compatible with pl_analyze by adding a single file to your lib directory and changing a couple lines in environment.rb .
After you follow his instructions , here are a couple more key points that I found relevant to polish the rough edges :
* By default , when we were running 2.0 ( do n’t know if it ’s the case with 2.2 , since we were pre-patched when we upgraded ) , logging of DB times was disabled .
This monkey patch fixes that .
* By default , when we moved to 2.2 , the log format changed and broke pl_analyze .
This fixes that .
* After enabling the Hodel logger as described by Geoff , our production log became extremely verbose .
One of the helpful commenters on Geoff ’s blog pointed out the solution to this : add the line “ config.logger.level = Logger : : INFO ” to your production.rb
After that , you ’re good to go .
Took me less than five minutes to get it set up , after which I was able to get priceless info like the following :
Request Times Summary : Count Avg Std Dev Min Max
ALL REQUESTS : 1576 0.242 0.229 0.000 2.487
ItemsController #show : 685 0.328 0.141 0.008 0.751
ChatsController#service_user_list : 286 0.022 0.037 0.005 0.301
HomeController#index : 158 0.256 0.308 0.000 1.461
Well , does n’t look so pretty on my crap blog ( should n’t I have upgraded this by now ? ) , but it ’ll look like a champ in your terminal window .
After getting our basic setup established a couple weeks ago , I started experimenting today with archiving our daily performance info into the database so I can track how action times are changing from day to day .
Geoff provides a great start for this as well , with his pl_analyze Rails plugin , which you can install by running
./ script/ plugin install http://topfunky.net/svn/plugins/mint
After you ’ve installed the plugin , run
rake mint:create_analyze_table
to create your table , and then
rake mint : analyze PRODUCTION_LOG=/path/to/production.log
to actually extract and store the day ’s data .
Be sure to read my comment in Geoff ’s blog ( it ’s about the 30th comment ) for a slight modification you may need to make to the analyze task if you get an error that says something to the effect that “ 0 parameteres were expected , got 1 ” or somesuch when you run mint : analyze .
Also note that this will store everything in your production log , so if you have n’t already setup log rotating on your production log , you ’ll want to do that ( it can be as simple as this ) .
After you ’re archiving performance metrics to your database , you are in a performance analysis wonderland — it ’s just a matter of applying creativity to data .
For starters , I plan to create reports that list the top 10 daily time users ( = count of action * average time per action ) , and the top 10 biggest daily deltas in time taken for various actions .
I plan to use the latter to help triangulate where code changes affect performance .
It would be trivial to create a model that actually allowed daily notes to be added to a report , so if the items # show action starts running 20 % slower one day , I could demarcate the code changes that were made on the day that happened ( though our changelist makes such a demarcation unnecessary ) .
I ’m not sure what other tools are being used by the community to keep an eye on performance , but with the quickness and reliability ( = stable results reported for weeks ) of getting a pl_analyze solution running , it gets high recommends from ’round these parts .
I ca n’t imagine returning to a day where we did n’t know if our average request time was 300 ms , 3000 ms , or 30000 ms ( yes , we had some very dark days before our server move ) .
The discussion about whether or not an unpowered vehicle can be made to go directly downwind faster than the wind ( DWFTTW ) is ongoing .
I was reading the comments this morning , and came across a link to this intriguing video , titled " Under the ruler faster than the ruler . "
It 's starting to make me think that a DWFTTW cart is feasible .
In the video , I was surprised to see which direction the big wheel turned when the ruler was run across the top .
I 'm also quite impressed that this fellow and others are making models to conduct experiment , instead of simply speculating .
Hooray for amateur science !
As I 've requested in previous posts on this subject , if you have something to contribute to the discussion boards , please refrain from insults and name - calling .
This is pretty self - explanatory .

Transatlanticism
Death Cab for Cutie ( song available here ; lyrics from here )
The Atlantic was born today and I ’ll tell you how
The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no island should go
Oh , no
Most people were overjoyed ; they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
Have been silenced forevermore
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before
Oh , no
I need you so much closer ( X 8 )
I need you so much closer ( X 4 )
So come on , come on ( X 4 )
Comment :
Yeah .
This is Death Cab .
I know this commentary is completely unnecessary .
Still , it was fun to think I saw something in the lyrics and write on it .
Even though this Flood sounds Biblical , it is not of Biblical proportions – the Atlantic is nowhere near the size of the Pacific .
And I do n’t remember people getting happy because it rained so .
The “ perforated sphere ” makes one think of a wiffle ball .
Perforations are punctures – something is being filled , or bursting , or bleeding .
Every broken heart unleashes an ocean : those “ clouds ” were n’t really above , just a bit higher than one would expect .
Along with the ocean comes an unnatural emphasis on isolation ( “ making islands where no island should go ” ) and distance ( “ it seems farther than ever before ” ) .
Something very strange is going on in this song , though .
Our speaker is not being entirely honest with himself .
“ Most people were overjoyed ” – huh ?
People like their own personal lake cutting them off from others ?
It ’s more than likely we ’re hearing this because everyone else must be happy , there must be a few couples getting smoochy and going out on the boats and seeming to have fun .
Never mind that they ’ve got their share of problems too , and never mind every other single guy getting in the boat and dutifully rowing away instead of singing this .
Moreover , remember what created the “ Atlantic ” here : this guy going “ waaaaaaaaa my heart is so broken it has flooded everything . ”
He ’s implicitly telling us that he ’s not seeing correctly , his longing is making the world seem other than what it is .
The delusions continue with “ flatlands ” – wait , what ?
Perforated spheres have holes in them .
There ’s some flatland , sure .
There ’s also these giant pits in the ground that throw you to your doom , if not make journeying so hard that you could only go out once .
Maybe you did walk a pretty far distance , but notice the main difference between walking and rowing : he ca n’t hear the rhythm of his own footsteps , the journey “ seems ” longer .
The most fatal fact is that this door has never been opened for him – otherwise , this song would n’t have been written .
So what ’s going on exactly ?
Why does this guy seem so pathetic ?
It ’s always really pathetic when you ’re in love and not loved back at all .
You might as well be an island unto yourself : you can only see what you want to see in the world , because not much else matters , and the funny thing is you ’re not trying to be an egotist .
It just has to be that way because everyone else is busy and ca n’t be bothered , and even if they were bothered they do n’t need to hear you rant for hours .
Moreover , no one can really get you the one person you want .
It ’s up to her to see differently .
This song ends with hope , stemming from the mere fact that the unrequited lover has to step beyond himself .
This flood was less than Biblical – maybe his wish is impossible , but then again , lovers do cross oceans for each other .
It happens every day .
And even if this case wo n’t resolve that way , it will resolve , and he ’s going to cross the Atlantic in a more important way .
We see this happening in the chant – the chant moves from “ I need you so much closer , ” an actual recognition that his love is n’t good enough alone .
Before , it was him just walking or maybe trying to row .
After this has been said 12 times , there ’s another shift : “ So come on , come on : ” she has to do something , the situation he ’s in is unfair .
We know , either way , that silence after this is appropriate .
Either he ’ll be loved or he ’ll have walked away .
His own personal ocean will have been crossed , and yeah , he ’s better for it either way , and not because his initial loving was wrong .
After all , the counterfactual here is : “ What if someone loved enough that the world could Flood ? ”

What you are now witnessing is the slow motion destruction of the CRIMEX , formerly known as the COMEX , a commodities futures market which is supposed to provide a means for producers to hedge their products , but which has morphed into a rigged casino where commodities that do n't exist are traded as if they did for prices that exist only in the fairytales woven by the Illuminati , who control the exchange .
This destruction is what happens when the credibility and integrity of the market owners and managers of the CRIMEX , together with the credibility and integrity of the market regulators , the CFTC , move from near zero to negative infinity .
Not only do the owners and regulators do absolutely nothing about obvious criminal manipulations and illegal concentrations of short positions , but also we believe that they conspire with the criminal operators , which we refer to as " commercial shorts , " to aid and abet their criminal mischief by divulging the precise nature of the trading positions of the " spec longs " who take the other side of the contracts , thus allowing pinpoint attacks on black - box formulations , especially where stops have been placed , thereby minimizing the cost of the manipulations by preventing the waste associated with overkill .
Also , the owners and regulators change margin requirements , and whitewash investigations of obvious illegalities , whenever it serves to protect the commercial shorts , thus making a mockery out of the exchange and transforming what are supposed to be free markets into crony capitalist , corporatist fascist systems of syndicated piracy .
This lack of integrity and criminal manipulation is the most pronounced in the gold and silver commodity markets , but many other types of commodities are under manipulation as well , especially oil , base metals and agricultural produce , meaning most of the rest of the exchange .
The despicable , nefarious dealings of the miscreant CRIMEX owners and regulators is quickly catching up to them in the precious metals markets of the exchange , and soon every one of the spec longs is going to pick up their toys and go home , and if the specs have any brains or sense of justice , they will take as much of the CRIMEX gold and silver with them when they leave by paying cash for it and taking delivery of it .
Since the end of October , when open interest for the December gold contract started a new series of decreases as the rollovers got off to any early start , the December open interest has fallen from 190,140 to this past Friday 's 122,902 , yet total open interest has fallen from 305,451 to 285,219 during that same period .
Thus , of the 67,238 December contracts that have been terminated in the rollover thus far , total open interest has plummeted by 20,232 contracts , meaning that many of the contracts are not being rolled over , and are being cashed out instead .
If this 30 % ratio persists , we could see gold open interest fall to under 250,000 , a multi- year low , an astonishing drop of 58 % from the peak of 593,953 contracts set on January 15 , 2008 .
This is an absolute disgrace for the CRIMEX owners and regulators , and we wish them well in the ensuing bankruptcies and criminal investigations that will occur after the exchange collapses .
No one wants to play in a game where the owners and sponsors are in cahoots with certain privileged players to make sure they come out on top .
In addition , we note that no commodities market can survive without speculators who provide balance to the markets by taking the other side of contracts and by keeping the pendulum of market momentum alternating between bulls and bears .
Otherwise the markets lean to far to one side or the other , and then bubble and / or collapse due to the lopsided positions .
Once the precious metals markets of the exchange collapse , all the other markets will soon follow , as everyone realizes that the whole system is rigged against them .
The CRIMEX will soon be ostracized from participation by honest market players .
The criminal manipulators will soon find themselves traipsing in and out of court in endless investigations , and they will be forced to sit in their bedrooms , lonesome , because their is no one left who wants to play with them .
In a stunning new development , the Dubai Multi-Commodities Center is now putting the finishing touches on the formation of an exchange traded fund for silver with a launch likely next month as demand for silver has surged in the past six months .
What may be happening here is that the OPEC nations , and possibly also Russia , are setting up a counterbalance against the collapse of oil prices .
You may recall from past issues that we discussed at length how we thought that sovereign wealth funds in oil - rich nations were tweaking gold and silver upward every time oil was smashed by the Illuminist manipulators .
The message was , you leave oil alone , or we will send gold and silver to the moon and expose your destruction of the US economy by killing the canaries in the coal mines , thus ringing the gold and silver alarm bells loud and clear .
This makes the Illuminists rabid , and induces collective myocardial infarctions among them , because precious metal suppression , especially of gold , is JOB ONE at the Fed .
The failure to cap the price of gold was Paul Volcker 's only regret as Fed Head during his handling of the inflationary crisis of the late 70's and early 80's , and the privately owned , Illuminist Fed does not intend to make the same mistake twice .
The Illuminati have made two major mistakes , and the Dubai exchange may be the OPEC solution to the oil takedown , which is the direct result of those mistakes .
The first mistake is that the Illuminati gave OPEC a taste of 147 oil , and then pounded it down to 55 .
This will not be tolerated , especially after these nations got a chance to experience the huge profits generated by such lofty oil prices .
The second mistake is the trashing of silver prices in the face of growing shortages at a time when the above - ground silver stocks are at an all - time low and headed even lower .
The shortages are being caused by manipulated silver prices that are below the cost of production , thus causing a collapse in production , and the manipulation of base metals prices into the subbasement is adding to the loss of production because 70 % of silver is produced as a by - product of base metal processing .
Due to these criminal price manipulations , the gold to silver ratio is now 77 to 1 , when historically is should be around 15 or 20 to 1 .
This huge price imbalance , growing shortage and all - time low levels of above - ground stocks has set up the greatest opportunity to corner a commodity market in the history of the world .
The Hunt Brothers would be drooling right now .
When they were trying to the corner the market , it was much , much larger by many billions of ounces , and prices were being driven much , much higher , topping $ 40 per ounce , because there was far less manipulation of those markets than there is today ( yes , believe it or not , we once had something bordering on free markets ) .
The Dubai silver ETF may pick up where the Hunt Brothers left off .
Since there are only about a billion ounces of above - ground silver stocks left , and because silver is trading at a ridiculous sub - 10 , ten billion could clean out the entire above - ground silver stock .
This is chump change for these wealthy oil sheiks and their sovereign wealth funds .
So get ready to rumble as the evil Illuminist scum and the price - gouging sheiks of OPEC prepare to " get it on " in an oil - silver showdown , complete with some very spectacular fireworks to come .
Both oil and silver are headed much higher , and gold will tag along for the ride as silver vaults to new heights .
In the end we expect some sort of compromise , as $ 150 oil would take down the entire world economy , which is now teetering on the brink .
We should soon see $ 80 to $ 100 oil and $ 15 to $ 20 silver .
Silver may go much higher than that depending on how stubborn the Illuminists become about the price of oil .
This is starting to get very interesting , so stay tuned , as one of the greatest financial battles of all time gets under way .
Instead of foolishly pumping money into insolvent , zombie banks , the sheiks may well have decided to go after the silver market .
Imagine what will happen as those who require silver to make their products see the COMEX gold and silver being funneled to Dubai's ETF .
All we can say is , if you were waiting for some precious metals fireworks , get ready , because it 's coming .
It is now time to load up on precious metals , especially silver .
Oil will do well also .
As some form of confirmation , we also note the growing open interest in the February gold options and futures contracts .
Let the Battle of the Titans begin .
The WSJ again avoids reality in an op - ed piece by Judy Shelton , called “ Stable Money is Key and How the G - 20 Can Rebuild the Capitalism of the Future . ”
She points out , and rightly so , “ that foreign attendees will take the view that Wall Street greed and inadequate regulatory oversight by US authorities caused the global financial crisis – never mind that their own regulatory agencies missed the boat and that their own governments eagerly bought up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities for the higher yield over Treasuries . ”
Ms. Shelton forgets that US interests asked , cajoled and strong - armed many nations into those purchases , as they did CDOs , SIVs and ABSs .
Do n’t you think they read the fine print and knew what they were buying – they are professionals ?
Behind the scenes there was a plan to spread the risk .
Why would any sane government buy such toxic waste ?
Incidentally , where are the lawsuits and criminal actions ?
There are none because they were all in on the plan to distribute America ’s problems , because if the US goes under they all go under .
Regulatory agencies deliberately missed the boat because they were told to do so .
Then she has the temerity to tell us that “ at the bottom of the world financial crisis ” is international monetary disorder .
Stating , “ ever since the past WWII Bretton Woods system – anchored by a gold - convertible dollar – ended in August of 1971 , the cause of free trade has been compromised by sovereign monetary – policy indulgence . ”
Spoken like a true internationalist Illuminist .
This is what the WSJ and Barron ’s have always been mouthpieces for – the Illuminists .
She goes on relating to sound money – perhaps even to a gold - based international monetary system .
She says , “ It ’s hard to imagine a more universally accepted standard of value . ”
Ms. Shelton admits that the nation of sound money and a new gold standard international monetary regime is appealing , neither will be part of any solution coming out of Washington or the G - 20 this weekend or anytime soon .
She goes on to say that fundamentally , our nation has only a sliver of bullion available to back tens of trillions in financial claims that are the crumbly bedrock for the entire global financial system .
Someone should make Ms. Shelton aware that in order to accommodate a gold standard for the world or the US all that has to be done is to officially increase the value of gold to where it belongs at $ 3,000 to $ 6,000 an ounce .
Nations , particularly the US , do not want to do that because they have sold most of their gold in their efforts to suppress the gold price .
That is why a gold standard is dismissed out of hand .
She says the consensus is that concerted inflationary measures are the only possible solution .
They would be would n’t they ?
She and all concerned know better .
Every time in history re-inflation has been used it has been a failure .
That said do n’t expect much in the way of public statements on a new currency .
Along those lines there will only be leaks until they decide what can be done without weakening their control .
Remember , part of what will happen is the further exposure that conventional economic doctrine is fatally flawed .
What is disturbing is that many say that today ’s problems are not the result of policies of the last 15 months .
The greatest bubble in history began on August 15 , 1971 , and is littered with a trail of greed and power .
Wall Street and banking led the looting of our country and Washington complied .
Almost universally as well the media never questions decisions by the Treasury , Fed or Wall Street .
They just report what the elitists want the public to hear .
The revisionist falsehoods promulgated by the likes of Milton Friedman , Keynes and Ben Bernanke are enough to make real scholars cringe .
The disinformation and distortion is startling .
The public does n’t know the difference and we never get to challenge them .
Often what they have had to say are lies .
Defending any of these liars from academia , Wall Street , such as Paulson , and government is a sacrilege .
These people all participated in the rape of America over the past 31 years .
The best - laid plans often go astray .
The elitists figured they ’d have the time to lay off their losses over time .
Banking analyst Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer 1 - 1/ 2 years ago when she blew the whistle on Citigroup upset that plan .
She still probably does n’t realize that she changed the course of history .
These events have upset the elitists ’ plans forcing them into policymaking out of desperation .
In fact after 15 months the system is still out of control .
We do not believe they will ever get a handle on it .
No reform is on the way and only stopgap measures , such as creating more money and credit and having zero interest rates are the solution .
Of course , they are not a solution .
The powers are going to play this out to the bitter end .
There is no stable money or monetary unit on the way .
They just want you to think there is .
They are scrambling now to create a major war , because they know if they do not they ’ll be revolution .
Over the past eight years a major change has overcome America .
As we have said before it is now socially and politically acceptable to lie and to mislead .
Fascists have stolen our rights under our Constitution , from us and our leaders in Washington and Wall Street and banking are corrupt .
There is no one left to complain too .
There is no one there to protect us .
Our Congress , courts , law enforcement , and regulatory agencies only protect the elite .
We have just seen massive fraud by Wall Street and banking and our government allows American taxpayers to illegally bail them out .
Our protectors are looking the other way deliberately as we are looted of our assets and our freedom .
This will continue until there is war or revolution .
There is no meaningful change coming from Washington nor will the corruption and looting stop .
It seems now everyone is too big to fail except the average taxpayer .
Each and every day brings us closer to the economic brink , even though our government is able without interruption to manipulate all world markets .
This fraud will soon come to an end and we will have our vengeance .
The brainwashing of the American public has been successful but there will soon come a time via more hardship that they ’ll finally wake Americans up .
All those who have misled us and lied to us will be dealt with including those in our media .

( CNN ) --
A group of skiers had a fortunate escape Tuesday after they were rescued from a stricken gondola that was left dangling over a freezing creek at a ski resort in Canada .
One gondola car is suspended above an icy creek at a ski resort near Whistler , British Columbia .
The incident at the Whistler Blackcomb resort , 177 kilometers ( 110 miles ) north of Vancouver , occurred when a support tower for the gondola system snapped in half .
Tyler Noble , a reporter for CNNRadio affiliate CKNW in Vancouver , said at least two gondola cars broke away and hit the ground after the accident , both from relatively low heights near the tower that split and caused the system 's heavy cable line to slacken .
" One hit a bus stop and the other hit a house , " Noble said .
" Another one was suspended over a creek , but everyone is out of that car . "
However Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Steve Wright stressed that no gondolas had fallen .

" At no time was anyone in serious risk and at no time were the cars separated from the line , " Wright said .
Doug Forseth , senior vice president of the resort , said a total of 53 passengers had been rescued .
He said no more people are trapped .
The section of the lift affected by the accident had 15 cars going up the mountain and 15 coming down at the time , but they were sparsely populated , Forseth said .
Three people were freed on the up side , each in a different gondola car , along with 50 people divided among the 15 cars on the down side , he said .

The accident occurred at a tower that was constructed in two pieces , and the top part came away from the lower part , Forseth said .
He said resort officials did not know what caused the structural failure , but an investigation would be conducted Wednesday .

News footage showed rescuers walking down a fire truck ladder escorting passengers from one gondola over the frozen water .
At least six people were trapped inside that cabin , which was the closest to the base of the mountain , CTV News reported .
Cynthia Jennings told CTV
News she was in a car halfway down the mountain when the tower snapped .

" All we saw were other cars swinging sideways and we thought we were going to crash to the ground , " she told CTV News by cell phone .
" I thought the whole cable system was going to come down .
I could n't even breathe . "
Authorities said they did not know the cause of the accident .
" It just started really suddenly , we saw people running everywhere , " Jean - Philippe Plante said .
Watch passengers describe what happened »
Plante , from Vancouver , was visiting the ski resort when the gondola snapped .
Plante said he planned to go skiing Tuesday morning , but changed his mind .
" We just went for a walk , so I guess it 's a good thing because we might have been one of the people stuck here , " he said .
No serious injuries were reported , but a spokeswoman for the Whistler Blackcomb resort said five people required medical attention .
Three were taken to a nearby clinic and two were taken to a hospital as a precaution , said spokeswoman Tabetha Boot .
Skiers were evacuated from the area and the resort -- site of the alpine skiing venue for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games -- was closed while authorities worked to remove riders from the cars and investigate the accident .
The gondola cars affected were close to the ground when the accident occurred , Boot said .

More and more , Americans are leaving their cars in the driveway , a new study from the Brookings Institution has concluded .
Brookings researchers Robert Puente and Adie Tomer analyzed driving patterns from 1991 to 2008 in all 50 states and in the 100 largest US cities .
Their report , titled " The Road ... Less Traveled " [ PDF ] , found that driving , as measured by total vehicle miles traveled per year , began to plateau in 2004 and then began dropping in 2007 .
Per-capita vehicle miles traveled followed a similar pattern , flatlining in 2000 and then beginning to decline in 2005 .
This drop , which adds up to 388 miles per year , is the steepest since World War II .
“ The American driver has hit a wall , ” says Mr. Puentes in a press release [ PDF ] .
“ We are now driving the same distance per year as we did in 1998 . ”
Not caused by gas prices
The trend long predates the steep hike in gasoline prices this year .
What 's more , data from the Federal Highway Administration shows that this trend continued through October , even as gas prices fell from their summer highs .
The authors speculate that the drop could be caused by the saturation of vehicle availability , the plateau in the number of women entering the workforce , increased mass - transit ridership , rising unemployment , or , optimistically , " a possible ceiling in the amount of driving any one individual can tolerate . "
Varying rates of decline
Driving is declining at different rates in different regions , with a few areas driving more .
Drivers in Nevada , Idaho , and Colorado are leading the way in kicking the car habit , with declines of more than 7 percent in miles driven since December 2006 .
The only states that showed a net increase in total driving are North Dakota , South Dakota , Montana , Oklahoma , and Wyoming .
People in cities are also getting out of their cars , with the steepest declines seen in Austin , Texas ; Indianapolis ; Atlanta ; Houston ; and Portland , Maine .
Overall driving declined in cities even as they grow in population , the Brookings report found .
The top five metropolitan areas – New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Washington , D.C. , and Dallas – saw a 0.9 percent decrease in total vehicle miles driven , even as their populations grew .
Challenges
The report concludes that the decline in driving is " largely positive for the nation as a whole , " reducing pollution , traffic accidents , dependence on foreign oil , and greenhouse - gas emissions .
But there is a downside : Gas - tax revenue , which funds transportation projects , drops as people use less fuel , stressing state and federal budgets .
To make up for these shortfalls , the authors recommend an increase in gas taxes , pegged to inflation .
For the long - term , the government should consider imposing a carbon tax to fund public transit .
But beyond that , the government will need to reconsider its entire transportation infrastructure , say the authors .
Currently , road construction is outpacing overall driving .
The report notes that , if total driving continues to decline even as states continue ot build more roads , " the nation may be wasting scarce transportation dollars on unneeded road . "
Says Puentes in the press release : “ We are in a transformational time which presents us with unique opportunities to change federal and state policies to reflect the new realities of how we get around . ”
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp , the world ’s biggest automaker , is likely to report its first annual parent - only operating loss in 71 years , hit by plunging sales and the soaring yen , Japanese media reported on Friday .
Toyota is set to issue revised forecasts for its parent - only and consolidated profits for the business year to March 31 , 2009 , at a year - end news conference scheduled on Monday , the Chunichi Shimbun and Kyodo news agency said .
Toyota last posted an operating loss at the parent level , which does n’t include its subsidiaries , in its first year of operation in 1937 / 38 .
A Toyota spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports .
Toyota made a parent - only operating profit of 140 billion yen ( $ 1.6 billion ) in the first half after incurring currency losses of 300 billion yen , making a full - year loss a near certainty if the current dollar rate of about 89 yen persists .
Toyota is assuming a more favorable dollar rate of 100 yen in the second half , after it averaged 106 yen in the first .
Shares of Toyota lost 2 percent to end at 2,900 yen in mixed trade for auto stocks , as conflicting reports emerged .
The Nikkei business daily predicted Toyota would also report an operating loss at the consolidated level , including subsidiaries , for the full year , while the Mainichi newspaper said the company would not issue a profit warning this month .
The Nikkei this week incorrectly reported that Japan ’s No.2 automaker , Honda Motor Co , would lower its annual operating profit forecast to about 300 billion yen , instead of the actual 180 billion yen .

“ Toyota has been expected to post ( consolidated ) losses for the second half , but it would be a surprise if the loss became so big that it would more than wipe out the first - half profits , ” said Koji Endo , auto analyst at Credit Suisse .
JPMorgan analyst Takaki Nakanishi , meanwhile , wrote in a note to clients that there was a “ strong possibility ” that Toyota ’s forecasts could prove as grim as the Nikkei preview .
Toyota made a consolidated operating profit of 582 billion yen in the first half , and last month slashed its full - year forecast by 1 trillion yen to 600 billion yen .
PRESSURE IS ON
Automakers everywhere are under huge pressure to cut costs as a global recession and tight credit strangle demand .
Detroit ’s General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC are seeking emergency loans as part of a U.S. government aid package to stay afloat in the short term , making progress on Thursday to secure a deal , people familiar with the talks said .
Japanese carmakers , while healthier , are feeling the extra pain from a weak dollar / yen .
Credit Suisse ’s Endo said the pressure would only grow on the automaker to cut costs , including procurement .
“ Negotiations with Nippon Steel Corp and others will begin early next year , and how much ( in price cuts ) Toyota can secure from raw material suppliers will determine whether it will post losses for the next business year , ” he said .
Toyota said in early November it would do everything it could to meet the new group operating profit forecast of 600 billion yen for the year , setting up an Emergency Profitability Improvement Committee to secure short - term cash .
But sales trends and currency rates have turned far more severe and unpredictable .
A company source said Toyota may alter its plans and refrain from announcing sales and production forecasts for the 2009 calendar year .
“ We ca n’t even see where demand is headed in the very near term , ” the source said .
“ Is there really any sense in providing projections for 2009 ? ”
Toyota had been expected to lower its 2009 global sales forecast , with various media estimating the figure at anywhere between 8.0 and 8.7 million units , down from the record 9.37 million in 2007 and well below the company ’s most recent forecast of 9.7 million .

There ’s a new preprint on the arXiv from Polyakov , entitled From Quarks to Strings , in which he tells the story of his involvement with string theory over the years .
He begins :
In the sixties I was not much interested in string theory .
The main reason for that was my conviction that the world of elementary particles should allow field theoretic description and that this description must be closely analogous to the conformal bootstrap of critical phenomena .
At the time such views were very far from the mainstream .
I remember talking to one outstanding physicist .
When I said that the boiling water may have something to do with the deep inelastic scattering , I received a very strange look .
I shall add in the parenthesis that this was a beginning of the long series of ” strange looks ” which I keep receiving to this day .
Another reason for the lack of interest was actually the lack of abilities .
I could not follow a very complicated algebra of the early works on string theory and did n’t have any secret weapon to struggle with it .
After the asymptotic freedom breakthrough , Polyakov quickly saw that a non-perturbative understanding of gauge theory was needed .
He ( independently from Wilson ) developed lattice gauge theory , but acknowledges that , unlike Wilson , he did not have the Wilson loop criterion for confinement .
In 3d , he worked out the dual - superconductor picture , where monopoles are responsible for confinement , and he has interesting comments about efforts over the years to use instantons in 4d , something that works for the N=2 supersymmetric case ( Seiberg - Witten , and Nekrasov ) , but not for QCD itself .
The strong - coupling lattice expansion was one thing that encouraged him to look for a gauge / string duality as a way to solve QCD .
One idea was to write dynamical equations for the Wilson loop ( later called Migdal - Makeenko equations ) and find a solution to these as a path integral over surfaces , thus a string theory .
About this he writes :
This action is called now the Polyakov action , demonstrating the Arnold theorem , stating that things are never called after their true inventors .
He derived the critical dimension for the string , but was much more interested in trying to understand non-critical strings , especially the four - dimensional string as a tool for studying gauge theories , and the 3d string as a tool to solve the 3d Ising model .
Later he realized that it was natural to think of the Liouville mode as a fifth dimension , and by 1996 was studying the idea of using warped 5 dimensions to get gauge / string duality .
Here ’s how he describes what he was doing in the lead - up to the breakthrough by Maldacena which led to the AdS / CFT conjecture :
At this point I was certain that I have found the right language for the gauge / strings duality .
I attended various conferences , telling people thatit is possible to describe gauge theories by solving Einstein - like equations ( coming from the conformal symmetry on the world sheet ) in five dimensions .
The impact of my talks was close to zero .
That was not unusual and did n’t bother me much .
What really caused me to delay the publication ( [ 12 ] ) for a couple of years was my inability to derive the asymptotic freedom from my equations .
At this point I should have noticed the paper of Igor Klebanov [ 13 ] in which he related D3 branes described by the supersymmetric Yang Mills theory to the same object described by supergravity .
Unfortunately I wrongly thought that the paper is related to matrix theory and I was skeptical about this subject .
As a result I have missed this paper which would provide me with a nice special case of my program .
This special case was presented little later in full generality by Juan Maldacena [ 14 ] and his work opened the flood gates .
He goes on to make some intriguing comments about the questions of integrability , and that of how to truly understand and derive gauge / string duality from first principles :
The problem of reproducing gauge perturbation theory from the string theory side remains unsolved ( and extremely important ) .
Why should we care about the derivation from the first principles ?
After all , in physics we value not so much the proved theorems but correct and powerful statements .
However , in this case the lack of the derivation really impedes progress .
We do not know how far the gauge / string duality can be extended and generalized .
The enormous accumulation of special cases has been useful but not sufficient for deeper understanding .
This is why I think that establishing the foundations is one of the most important problems in the field .
Polyakov seems to have always been a skeptic about the idea of using the 10 dimensional superstring to construct a unified theory , instead hoping that some understanding of the 4d non-critical string might lead somewhere .
Like most string theorists , he takes the attitude that we need to wait for the results from the LHC and hope that a new clue will emerge and tell us how to make progress along these lines :

Economist Michael Khazin stated the following in an interview with Echo Radio :
What is globalization ?
Globalization is a political , ideological , and cultural structure built over an absolutely material process – the global division of labor .
Beginning with the 18th century , humanity started developing scientifically and technologically , and this was accompanied by a growth of markets where people sold their products .
There were many “ globalizations ” in the 18th century ; in fact , every large country led its own system of labor distribution .
My Comment : Many define globalization as the distribution of labor , production , and the market .
However , Kabbalah defines globalization differently : it means that the world is global and integral , and all of its parts are completely interconnected like in a small village .
In it , every part determines the fate of all the others , according to the Butterfly Effect .
The world has become like this due to progress .
From this moment on , there cannot be any conflicts between different parts of the world because anyone who is against integration is also against progress , evolution , and the law of nature .
We must recognize that the absolute connection of all the world ’s parts is a fact .
We must also recognize that our discrepancy with or failure to carry out nature ’s law of Unity will elicit a negative reaction : the crisis will become more severe .
And we will be the ones who created this reaction .
Here are some more definitions of globalization :
Globalization – a process of global economic , political , and cultural integration and unification .
The main consequences of this are a global distribution of labor ; migration of capital and human and industrial resources on a global scale ; standardization of legislation and of economic and technological processes ; and greater contact between different cultures .
This is an objective , natural , historic process that is systematic .
In other words , it encompasses all areas of social life .
Globalization – the process of a continuously growing influence of various international factors ( such as close economic and political connections , exchange of cultures and information ) on the social reality of separate countries .
Globalization in politics – an approach to the world ’s formation , organization , functioning , and development that views the world as an integral economic , socio-cultural , and political super - system .
The concept of globalization – a theory stating that the evolution of financial markets and institutions leads to a state where geographic borders cannot limit contracts and other transactions .
Usually the term “ globalization ” pertains to a growing international activity of banks and other institutions .

Gas prices dropped nearly 33 cents in the past two weeks , dipping below $ 2 for the first time since March 2005 , a national survey said Sunday .
This station in Rio Vista , California , had gas prices below $ 2 on November 19 .
The average price of self - serve , unleaded gasoline on Friday in the United States was $ 1.97 , said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the Lundberg Survey .
The last time the price was below $ 2 was on March 4 , 2005 , she said .
The all - time high average was $ 4.11 , set on July 11 , according to Lundberg , and prices have been dropping ever since .
" The rate of decline has slowed somewhat , but it is still dramatic at 33 cents in two weeks , " she said .
Diesel prices averaged $ 2.93 on Friday , slumping under $ 3 for the first time since September 2007 , she said .
Lundberg attributed the price reductions to a drop in crude oil prices and demand , and also because of low refining margins .
Watch thrilled customers enjoy cheaper gas »
" Crude oil remains [ the ] main driver , " for the decline , she said , noting that crude oil futures settled on Friday below $ 50 .
Demand is always low in November , she said , but the weakening economy is reducing it further .
However , Lundberg said that if crude oil prices do not fall further , " then the end of this [ gasoline ] price crash is either here or near . "
The Lundberg Survey is based on responses from more than 5,000 service stations nationwide .
On Friday , drivers in St. Louis , Missouri , paid the least at the pump -- $ 1.61 -- while drivers in Honolulu , Hawaii , and Anchorage , Alaska , paid the most , at $ 2.81 .
Here are average prices in other cities :
• Detroit , Michigan -- $ 1.76
• Houston , Texas -- $ 1.78
• Atlanta , Georgia -- $ 1.88
• Boston , Massachusetts -- $ 2.01
• Chicago , Illinois -- $ 2.10

The patriarch oversaw a revival of the Church after communism
The head of the Russian Orthodox Church , Patriarch Alexiy II , has died at the age of 79 .
There is no word on the cause of his death at his residence outside Moscow , but he had been sick for some time .
No date has been set yet for the funeral .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called his death a " great loss " .
Alexiy II was credited with helping restore the moral authority of the Russian Orthodox Church after decades of repression under communism .
Favoured by the KGB as he rose through the Church 's ranks , he then oversaw its post - communist revival .
However , relations with the Roman Catholic Church remained frosty and he repeatedly refused to meet the late Pope John Paul II , or his successor , Benedict XVI .
He 's been ruthless in suppressing alternative views in the Orthodox church

Double life of patriarch Russia pays tribute to patriarch The Russian Orthodox Church counts nearly 70 % of Russia 's population - about 100 million people - among its members .
The BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says Alexiy II was a hugely revered figure .
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said he was shocked by the death .
" I respected him deeply , " he said .
A spokesman for Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he would return to Russia from India on Friday , cancelling a planned trip to Italy .
Unswerving obedience Born Alexei Rediger to a Russian Orthodox family living in Estonia in 1929 , the future patriarch rose swiftly through the ranks of the Church after studying theology in St Petersburg .
By the age of 32 he was a bishop , by 35 an archbishop .
After moving to Moscow he served as the Patriarchate 's chief administrator and the deputy head of the Church 's external affairs department .

In the second post , he attracted criticism for what many thought was his unswerving obedience to the dictates of Soviet foreign policy .
Supporters argued that he was merely doing his best to win concessions for his persecuted church .
Alexiy II became the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1990 , shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union .
In the new era of restored freedom and influence the church found itself with a prominent role rebuilding national self - esteem and morality in the post - Soviet period , our correspondent says .
He insisted on his Church 's right to be the sole national Church of Russia , bringing the scattered branches of the Russian Orthodox Church back under the control of the Moscow Patriarchate .
He also moved the Orthodox Church closer to political circles , often visiting the Kremlin and aligning himself with its foreign policy stances .
Churches restored
One reason for his differences with the Catholic Church was a dispute over land taken by the Greek Catholic Church from the Orthodox Church in Ukraine in the early 1990s .
He also accused the Catholic Church of missionary activity in traditionally Orthodox areas , and blocked Pope John Paul II 's long - held intention of visiting Russia .
Alexiy II enjoyed close relations with the Kremlin Relations improved after the 2005 election of Pope Benedict , correspondents say .
The Pope said he was " profoundly saddened " by the patriarch 's death .
Last year , Alexiy II presided over a union with a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church whose members fled abroad to escape the Bolshevik Revolution .
The ending of the 80 - year schism with the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad was seen as a significant achievement for the patriarch .
Alexiy II also oversaw a major programme to restore and re-open hundreds of Russia 's churches .
Michael Bordeaux , founder of the Keston College religious research centre , said he had been a " very strong patriarch " .
" The bishops appointed under Patriarch Alexiy are very much of his mindset - he 's been ruthless in suppressing alternative views in the Orthodox church . "

The latest fashion must - have : eyeball jewellery Splitting One 's Tongue Is A Form Of Art Today
If Shoe Wo n't Fit , Fix the Foot ?
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - Body piercing and tattoos make way -- the latest fashion trend to hit the Netherlands is eyeball jewellery .
Dutch eye surgeons have implanted tiny pieces of jewellery called " JewelEye " in the mucous membrane of the eyes of six women and one man in cosmetic surgery pioneered by an ophthalmic surgery research and development institute in Rotterdam .
The procedure involves inserting a 3.5 mm ( 0.13 inch ) wide piece of specially developed jewellery -- the range includes a glittering half - moon or heart -- into the eye 's mucous membrane under local anaesthetic at a cost of 500 to 1,000 euros ( 270 to 540 pounds ) .
" In my view it is a little more subtle than ( body ) piercing .
It is a bit of a fun thing and a very personal thing for people , " said Gerrit Melles , director of the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery ( www.NIIOC.nl).
The piece of jewellery is inserted in the conjunctiva -- the mucous membrane lining the inner surface of the eyelids and front of the eyeball -- in sterile conditions using an operating microscope in a procedure taking about 15 minutes .
" Without doing any harm to the eye we can implant a jewel in the conjunctiva , " Melles said .
" So far we have not seen any side effects or complications and we do n't expect any in the future . "
The Rotterdam - based institute , which develops new ocular surgical techniques in corneal , cataract and retinal surgery , developed and patented the jewellery made with special materials and the surgical procedure .
The institute , which carries out the procedure in cooperation with an eye clinic near the city of Utrecht , said it has a waiting list for people who wanted the implant .

Rebecca Willis Wins $ 275,000 Lawsuit Over Dirty Dancing
won a $ 275,000 settlement from the town of Marshall , North Carolina this week .
The lawsuit goes back 8 years when she was 56 years old and banned from the Marshall Depot Community Center for dirty dancing .
According to Willis , the town accused her of gyrating and simulating sexual intercourse while wearing a skirt and allowing a view of her underwear .
Rebecca , on the other hand , considered her style " exuberant and flamboyant " and not obscene .
Like any self respecting woman whose civil liberties had been trounced upon , she engaged a lawyer and has spent years seeing the case bounced back and forth between a federal district court and the court of appeals .
The case recently went before a 3 - Judge Panel in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and they indicated it could move forward to trial to answer the question of whether the town violated her constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment by banning her from the music arena .
Her attorney Jon Sasser and The American Civil Liberties Union have announced that a settlement has been reached and the town of Marshall will pay her $ 275,000 .
In a statement Willis said , " This sends a message that the town should allow for diversity and free expression . "
With a town population of 831 and a median income of $ 25,000 per household , having to pay the settlement is a big deal .

CONSUMERS are racking up more than $ 1 billion in cash advances on their credit cards in a single month , marking a 14 per cent increase on the same time last year .
With the exception of dubious pay day lenders , cash advances on credit cards are one of the most costly ways of borrowing money , with daily interest calculated at as much as 21 per cent with no interest - free period .
Yet according to the latest figures from the Reserve Bank , credit card holders withdrew $ 1092 million in cash from their credit card accounts in September , an increase of $ 134 million compared to last September .
The number of credit cards held by Australians has also increased by 10 per cent over the past year , prompting the NSW Opposition yesterday to accuse the State Government of defaulting on its responsibility to ensure ethical lending practices for credit cards .
In May last year , the then Minister for Fair Trading , Linda Burney , announced that the NSW Government was " leading the push to rein in credit card debt " , promising to crack down on providers offering easy access to credit cards without any rigorous assessment of the card holder 's ability to repay , and offers of large increases in credit limits on existing cards .
Beware illegal towing firms in San Francisco SAN FRANCISCO
Supervisor offers legislation to help drivers fight back
When Tori Casanova walked out of a salsa club in San Francisco 's Dogpatch neighborhood just after midnight on April 1 last year , she expected her car to be waiting where she left it .
Instead , the vehicle was gone , and the Moraga resident was stranded in a deserted area of town .
Casanova , 47 , was the victim of an illegal towing by a company out to make a quick buck .
While many of the 30 or so tow companies that work in San Francisco operate their businesses legally , city officials say others likely make thousands of dollars a year trolling for cars that may be illegally parked on private property , then towing those vehicles without the property owner 's permission - a violation of California law .
When the vehicle owner comes to pick up their car , they are generally unaware of their rights and simply pay the bill , which starts around $ 300 and increases by the day .
Casanova , however , read up on the law and took the company to court , eventually winning a $ 1,200 settlement .
" I did n't do it for the money , " Casanova said .
" It was more a matter of principal . "
In the hopes that more citizens will do the same , Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin is sponsoring legislation that will require towing firms to display brochures that inform the public of their rights under the law .
The legislation passed an initial vote earlier this month and will likely get final approval Jan.
6 .
There 's no way to know how often cars are illegally towed , said Deputy City Attorney Christiane Hayashi , who has worked on the issue for several years .
She said a handful of " bad actors " appear to be preying on people who do n't know the law .
" It can be dangerous to the public , from the economic losses to being stranded in the middle of the night , " she said .
" I frequently get people who call and say , ' I was in this lot , they towed me and I did n't pick up my car immediately , and now I owe $ 700 and I do n't even know what just happened . '
The only answer I can give them is to go to Small Claims Court . "
Some of those people will simply opt not to get their car back , thinking the bill will go away , she said .
Instead , months later , they are getting called by collection agencies .
Because the state regulates tow companies , the city can do little else than inform people of their rights , Peskin and Hayashi said .
But in addition to helping the public , officials hope the new law will help solve the problem by discouraging tow truck drivers who might act illegally .

Coming Very Soon : New Online Games & Games for the iPhone !
When animal welfare officers walked into the grounds of Watford 's Bhaktivedanta Manor Temple on13 December 2007 and put down one of its cows , the local Hindu community was outraged .
Gangotri , a 13 - year - old blue Jersey cross , was being nursed by temple officials after becoming paralysed during an overly vigorous mating session with Karma Deva , the resident bull .
But the officials , from the RSPCA , believed Gangotri was " suffering unnecessarily " and killed her .
The decision caused a bitter rift to develop between Britain 's Hindus , who regard cows as sacred , and the RSPCA .
But a year on , the two groups have buried the hatchet thanks to a series of high - level talks and a little encouragement from the Archbishop of Canterbury , a patron of the society .
The Independent has learnt that a meeting between temple officials and the RSPCA 's chief executive , Mark Watts , took place earlier this week .
The society agreed to apologise for upsetting the Hindu community and offered to give a replacement cow to the temple as a goodwill gesture .

Officials from Lambeth Palace yesterday said they played no part in brokering that final meeting but one temple official admitted that progress in the talks only came about once Rowan Williams was contacted .
" The Archbishop is a patron of the RSPCA and we wrote to him asking for his help , " said Stuart " Shyamsundar " Coyle , the chief herdsman on the temple 's farm , which claims to be Europe 's largest cow sanctuary .
" The Church of England worked very hard in getting the RSPCA to talk to us about our concerns and we are extremely grateful for their help . "
A spokesman from the RSPCA stressed yesterday that its vets had acted within the law when they put Gangotri down but admitted that they had upset the Hindu community in the way it was carried out .
" We recognise we offended religious sensibilities , " the spokesman said .
" We know what happened caused a lot of offence to the Hindu community and we wanted to show that we want to work with Britain 's Hindus in the future .
The RSPCA has so much in common with Britain 's Hindus when it comes to our attitude towards animal welfare . "
Kapil Dudaki , who led the temple 's " Gangotri Task Force " campaign group , said the donation of a new cow would help calm tensions between Hindus and the RSPCA .
" It is a wonderful gesture and we gladly accept it , " he said .
" It will very much help repair some of the damage done to our community in the past year .
It was the way and the manner in which the RSPCA killed Gangotri which upset our community the most .
To see a cow killed on the temple 's grounds was utterly devastating . "
In Hindu culture and scripture cows are considered sacrosanct .
Bhaktivedanta Manor , a community of Hare Krishna devotees that was set up by the Beatles guitarist George Harrison , has a herd of 48 cows , most of which are milked or used to work the land .
Other temples have clashed with the RSPCA and the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) over the care of sick animals .
Under the Animal Welfare
Act officials can kill an animal if they believe it is suffering unnecessarily .
Defra has powers to destroy any animals that have contracted a contagious disease .
But most Hindus believe that killing a cow , even for merciful reasons , is sacrilegious because only God can decide when a sacred animal should die .
Yesterday Defra released a new set of guidelines on how to deal with sacred temple animals without offending the Hindu community .
A spokesman from the Hindu Forum of Britain welcomed the new protocol .

Mummified man found in his apartment sitting down for 6 years
Dwellers of an apartment building in the city of Tula , central Russia , were horrified to learn of a discovery made in one of the apartments .
The mummified body of a tenant was found in a sitting position in the kitchen of his apartment .
The tenant had been dead for six years .
Mummified man found in his apartment sitting down for 6 years
One hazy morning a telephone started ringing in an office of Mark Ignashin , an investigator with the prosecutor ’s office of Tula ’s central district .
“ This is a duty officer of a district police station .
We ’ve received a report on a mummified body found in apartment building No 142 on Lenin Street .
We ’re sending a vehicle to pick you up , Mr. Ignashin , ” said the officer and hung up .
No sooner had Ignashin stepped into a typical Khrushchev - era tiny apartment than he became aware of a pungent putrid smell .
A mummified body in a plaid shirt was seated at a kitchen table .
The brownish parchment - like skin covered the mummy ’s dried - up bones .
An empty vodka bottle and a glass sat on a dusty table .
One of the policemen brought a bunch of newspapers from a living room .
All the newspapers dated back to February of 2000 .
Valentina Muradova was brought in as a witness to the official search .
The woman peered at the mummy for some minutes until she finally recognized her neighbor called Vladimir Ledenev , 68 , who vanished without a trace six years ago .
According to police records , Ledevev had earlier spent four years in prison for battery .
His neighbors told the police that the man had started drinking heavily after his mother passed away ten years ago .
Ledenev was frequently seen collecting empty bottles for a living because his pension was pretty small .
Eventually , Ledenev disappeared at the beginning of 2000 .
“ We reckoned that he ’d moved somewhere else or checked himself into a hospital , he had TB , ” said Irina Borodina , one of the neighbors .
“ Then we thought he ’d ended up in prison again though our local policeman knew nothing about Ledenev ’s new brushes with the law , ” added the neighbor .
“ A man just vanished from your house .
Has anybody felt anything strange and tried to raise the alarm ? ” Ivanshin asked the neighbors .
“ He was a standoffish kind of man , he rarely talked to us .
He kept away from the neighbors most of the time .
He was always short on money .
People from a real estate agency tried to talk him into swapping his two - room apartment for a smaller place , promising him a handsome bonus for the deal .
He just told them to get lost , ” said Borodina .
The neighbors told the investigator that quite a few people tried to contact Ledenev for several months following his disappearance .
Workers from a housing management office would knock at his door in an attempt to hand over utilities bills ; a postman would do the same on the day when pensions were delivered .
Ledenev ’s son and nephew also tried to see him but to no avail .
Then the whole world seemed to forget about Ledenev though he owed several thousand rubles in unpaid bills to a housing management office .
It was obvious that the door of Ledenev ’s apartment had been locked from the inside at a deadbolt and chain .
For some strange reasons , nobody grew suspicious about the circumstance .
All those years the lights and a fridge were on in the apartment .
“ One of our neighbors , an obese man , died a sudden death a few years ago .
Two days later people could feel the smell and soon found out what happened .
However , in this case we did n’t smell anything .
Maybe there was no smell because he died in winter ; the temperatures were very low at the time .
Besides , the guy was very thin , he looked like a mummy while still alive .
And you can imagine what kind of smell was usually hanging about that place .
Ledenev was an alcoholic , by and large , ” said Borodina .
The grisly discovery was made by workers of a housing management office as they were making their rounds in the apartments of those who owed large sums in unpaid utilities bills .
According to a spokesperson for the prosecutor ’s office , the death of Vladimir Ledenev did not entail any investigation since the police found no evidence indicating that the victim had died a violent death .
Likewise , sanitation authorities refused to carry out decontamination of the apartment despite a request filed by a local police station .
You have no problem after getting rid of a man who causes this problem , as Josef Stalin used to say .

Among thousands of weird and even silly gadgets and accessories , here 's one that is pretty unique : the Socket Deer Outlet Covers , a thingie that is supposed to add to your residence 's “ cool factor , ” and provide you with some functionality as well .
Now , one cannot tell for sure whether these rubberized antlers have reached their altogether nice goals .
After all , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and even if some would be inclined to say that the Socket Deer Outlet Covers come with a redneck aura , other people might actually like them very much .
These Socket Deer Outlet Covers come in three different shapes , and this means you get to choose which kind of deer will guard your wall sockets .
Yet , the designer claims that the device can also be used as covers for the light switches .
Now , if you install these socket covers so they 're at the level of your feet , and you happen to bump into them , it 's possible that nothing will happen .
Nevertheless , if you have the Socket Deer Covers set up for your light switches at the same level with your face and eyes , and you happen to wander in the darkness , some nasty things could occur .
These accessories are wrapped up in urethane rubber , which is tough , but still they could be a safety hazard .
The products have been designed for one thing in the first place , namely to provide a cradle for your portable gadgets as you lay them down to recharge overnight , so they do n't get scattered all over the floor , as if waiting to be stepped on .
Alternately , you can use them as key hooks , when guarding your light switch .
Also , there are other accessories as well that you can hang on these antlers .
The Socket Deer Outlet Covers have been created with a three - color scheme , in white , brown , and black .
Despite that , one 's first impression could still remain that they 're redneck - ish .
We are just a few , but there are many of you , Softpedia users , out there .
That 's why we thought it would be a good idea to create an email address for you to help us a little in finding gadgets we missed .

STERKSEL , the Netherlands 
The cows and pigs dotting these flat green plains in the southern Netherlands create a bucolic landscape .
But looked at through the lens of greenhouse gas accounting , they are living smokestacks , spewing methane emissions into the air .
That is why a group of farmers - turned - environmentalists here at a smelly but impeccably clean research farm have a new take on making a silk purse from a sow ’s ear :
They cook manure from their 3,000 pigs to capture the methane trapped within it , and then use the gas to make electricity for the local power grid .
Rising in the fields of the environmentally conscious Netherlands , the Sterksel project is a rare example of fledgling efforts to mitigate the heavy emissions from livestock .
But much more needs to be done , scientists say , as more and more people are eating more meat around the world .
What to do about farm emissions is one of the main issues being discussed this week and next , as the environment ministers from 187 nations gather in Poznan , Poland , for talks on a new treaty to combat global warming .
In releasing its latest figure on emissions last month , United Nations climate officials cited agriculture and transportation as the two sectors that remained most “ problematic . ”
Even if you ’re not a hard - core automotive enthusiast , the name Lamborghini will no doubt be familiar to you .
This famous car maker in Italy has been producing some of the most sought - after luxury sports cars in the world for decades ( including one of the most expensive Italian cars made ) – and if you do happen to be a car nut , you ’ll be pleased to know that the Lamborghini Museum outside Bologna is an excellent addition to your Italy itinerary .
Lamborghini has been based in the village of Sant ’Agata Bolognese , about 21 miles from Bologna , since the company was born in 1963 , and that ’s still where the cars are made today .
But in addition to the Lamborghini factory , the complex at Sant ’ Agata Bolognese also includes a top - notch museum of Lamborghinis , from vintage cars to race cars to concept cars .
The two best things about the Lamborghini museum , opened in 2001 , used to be the window overlooking the factory floor so you can see the cars actually being made , and the lack of an admission fee ( I used to think that was the only thing Lamborghini had its name on that did n’t cost a small fortune ) , but according to the official website there ’s now an admission fee .
Well , at least the factory window is still there .

Visiting the Lamborghini museum is easier than you might think .
Most websites say that you ’ve got to arrange your visit to the museum ahead of time ( some say up to four days in advance ) , but when I visited the museum I did n’t pre-arrange anything and was able to just walk in without any questions .
And in fact , many of the websites that talk about calling the museum in advance also say that even though they followed the instructions they were n’t asked whether they ’d called ahead when they actually showed up .
I ca n’t find any evidence that says you ’ll be turned away if you do n’t pre-arrange your visit , but if you ’re paranoid and do n’t want to risk being turned away , contact information for the museum is at the bottom of this post .
Sign marking the entrance to the Lamborghini factory
The Lamborghini Museum has an incredible collection of cars on display over two levels .
The cars are , as you ’d expect , polished to a gleaming shine – but what I did n’t expect was that the older cars would actually show some signs of their age .
A few of the cars have , when you look closely , small nicks in the otherwise beautiful paint jobs .
Instead of detracting from the look , however , what those nicks said to me was that these cars had been loved in the best way possible – they ’d been driven by people who appreciated them rather than permanently garaged .
And that impression is further borne out by the fact that many of the cars on display came from the company ’s founder ’s personal collection .
The Lamborghini Museum ’s first floor looks almost like a parking lot , with Lamborghinis from several different decades lined up nose - to - tail along the walls as well as several others set apart from the rows of cars .
I ’ll admit that I ’m not a car person , so other than the fact that I find them interesting to photograph I really have no idea what I was looking at .
The husband , on the other hand , was in heaven .
On the second floor of the museum , you ’ll find some of the race cars Lamborghini made during the 1980s and 1990s , some of the company ’s concept cars , and the window that gives you a peek onto the factory floor .
The Lamborghini website indicates that there are opportunities for guided tours of both the museum and the production line , for which you ’ll definitely need to arrange a visit in advance via email .
If you do n’t want to pay the extra money for a factory tour , or you ’ve got small kids who are n’t allowed into the factory , the window from the museum offers a glimpse of the production floor for free .
Unlike just about every other museum I ’ve been to on the planet , this one does n’t dump you into a gift shop as you ’re leaving .
In fact , finding the gift shop at Lamborghini is something of a challenge .
The front desk of the factory is in a different building than the museum , so when you depart the museum you ’ll need to head to the building next door .
When I visited , the people at the desk spoke minimal English ( enough to tell me that the museum was free of charge and we could just wander over unattended ) and seemed totally uninterested in talking with tourists .
And that makes sense , because they ’re not tour guides – they ’re Lamborghini employees , and that ’s the front desk of the factory .
But if you politely ask where the gift shop is , they ’ll direct you around the corner to the left , where you can drop all kinds of euro on Lamborghini gear .
Yes , that ’s a car on the wall
What You ’ll Find at the Lamborhini Museum
According to the official Lamborghini website , here are some of the cars on display at the museum :
First production model built by Ferruccio Lamborghini ( company founder ) , a 1963 350 GT
First production model of the Countach , chassis # 00001
25th anniversary Countach
Three Lamborghini models with a V8 engine
Full scale model of Diablo Roadster from 1992
1989 Larousse F1 car
1990 Lotus F1 car
1991 LAMBO F1 car
How to Get to the Lamborghini Museum
A trip to the Lamborghini Museum is easiest if you have a car at your disposal , because the complex is n’t in a tourist area or even the center of Sant ’ Agata Bolognese .
It ’s a great side - trip if you ’re staying in nearby Bologna – just stop into the tourist information office on Piazza Maggiore before you head out and they ’ll give you an excellent driving map with instructions on how to get to the museum .
The Lamborghini website includes the following driving directions from the town of Modena ( why they assume you ’re starting in Modena is beyond me ) : “ direction Ferrara -> direction Nonantola -> direction Bologna -> S. Agata Bolognese ( around 40 minutes ) . ”
In other words , unless you find those instructions helpful , you ’ll want to stop at the tourist information center first !
Without a car , a visit to the museum is harder , but it ’s not impossible .
There is a bus you can take from Bologna to the center of Sant ’ Agata Bolognese , which is a five minute walk from the museum location .
The ATB 576 bus ( direction Crevalcore ) departs from the main bus station in Bologna and takes roughly 50 minutes to get to the “ S. Agata Bolognese Chiesa Frati ” stop in Sant ’ Agata Bolognese , which is five minutes on foot from the museum .
Another ( though less frequently - running ) option is to take a train to the town of San Giovanni in Persiceto , which is the closest town to Sant ’ Agata Bolognese with a train station .
You can then hop on that ATB 576 bus ( direction Crevalcore ) for about a 10 - minute ride to the same “ S. Agata Bolognese Chiesa Frati ” stop in Sant ’ Agata Bolognese and make the 5 - minute walk to the museum , or get a taxi from the train station .

Because of the great scale on which World War II ( WWII ) was fought , national armies could not afford to rely on their traditional recruitment methods , and therefore often had to resort to drafts to select their combatant forces .
This means that all sorts of people ended up in the military , including very smart and very dumb designated patriots .
Scotland was among the only countries at that time to have made its citizens take a mandatory IQ test , in 1932 for those born in 1921 , which offered the central government a clear perspective on the level of education present in the population at the time of the war .
Now , scouting through the de-classified archives , researchers at the University of Edinburgh , led by Ian Deary , showed that some of the most intelligent men to have fought in the war on behalf of Scotland died in battle , while others , who were less intelligent , returned home unharmed .
" No other country has ever done such a whole - population test of the mental ability of its population , " Deary says .
" We wonder whether more skilled men were required at the front line , as warfare became more technical . "
" We also wondered whether there was an overall small tendency for more intelligent soldiers to want to do the job well , perhaps meaning they ended up in more threatening situations , " he adds .
The find was further strengthened by the fact that Scotland registered an abrupt drop in the levels of intelligence of its men , soon after the war completed , until the next generations of children grew up to replace their fathers .
" One could hypothesize that the association between greater intelligence and higher war - related mortality might be driven by the more crystallized verbal abilities , leading to greater leadership roles , " adds Phil Batterham , an epidemiologist at the Australian National University in Canberra , Australia .

Smart Sanitation
That 's the time it takes for water that was once in an Orange County , California , toilet , sewer , or God - knows - where - else to change into a form that 's purer than what 's in your morning coffee .
That Groundwater Replenishment System , the first plant of its type and scale in the U.S. , went online in January , converting wastewater that would otherwise get dumped into the ocean into seventy million gallons a day of freshwater .
The facility uses a three - step process : microfiltration , to remove bacteria and solids ; reverse osmosis , to get rid of minerals ; and an ultraviolet - light and hydrogen - peroxide treatment , to destroy any remaining organic compounds .
The water is then pumped into recharge basins , which disperse it into the groundwater ; it eventually becomes accessible six to twelve months later .
It 's enough water for half a million people , and the process consumes only about half the amount of energy of typical treatments .
For another innovative water solution , see " Lord Dumpling 's Magic Water Machine . "
Online Advertising without Douchebaggery
A couple weeks ago I wrote about the sad case of the Bike Hero video which turned out to be a fake , created by an ad agency to promote the already insanely popular Guitar Hero game .
When the video was outed as an ad , it resulted in the expected unhappiness , as well as a few moments of righteous payback .
Now here ’s a another example with a much happier ending .
Say you ’re EA sports , makers of the Tiger Woods videogame franchise .
And you see a video on YouTube , where some kid is mocking you for a bug in the game that lets Tiger walk on water .
Here ’s exactly what you do .
EA ’s response is smart and funny , as you ’d expect .
But it ’s also human .
And it made no attempt to hide who made it .
They could have tried to dress it up as “ user generated content ” but why bother ?
They ’re EA .
They know Tiger Woods .
And the ad is funnier for it .
Major props to Wieden + Kennedy who made the video .
I hear that the kid who posted the original clip even got a few bucks for letting them use his video in their response .
This is just one of many examples that show you can participate in online community without having to pretend to be something you ’re not .
In fact , participating with authenticity is not just morally good , it ’s measurably more effective .
The “ view ” is YouTube ’s only real measure of currency .
Bike Hero ’s fake ad has chalked up 1.6 million views .
The EA Tiger Woods video scored 2.5 million .
Maybe honesty really is the best policy .
Though apologist analyst were apparently out in force , and though the firm bragged about selling $ 1 million in Barack Obama knicknacks ( whee ! ) , there was no hiding the New York Times Company 's financial distress at a bank 's media conference in New York Tuesday .
The most alarming report in the wake of the event :
Word that the Times will try to renegotiate at least some of its more than $ 1 billion in debt and is preparing to do without much of a $ 400 million credit line expiring in May .
The company also said it was thinking about selling assets , but it 's been making similar noises since at least March and was still talking about the idea , internally at least , in late October .
As with the Times ' bid to mortgage its pricey headquarters , finding a buyer for , say , the Boston Globe or International Herald - Tribune would be tricky in the present economy .
About.com , perennially rumored to be for sale , might be an easier sell , to a hungry tech company like Microsoft , but many natural buyers like Google and Yahoo are retrenching .
Some shareholders — or just worried admirers of the newspaper — are not satisfied .
The company has been adding debt ( at junk prices , these days ) even as it pays out dividends to Sulzberger family members and other shareholders .
Via Jeff Bercovici at Portfolio :
One audience member wanted to know why the company , which slashed its dividend by nearly 75 percent a few weeks ago , did n't go further .
" Why keep the dividend at all ? " he demanded .
" The notion that cash is flowing out of the company to equity — it seems like you might not understand the gravity of the situation . "
Oh , but they 're learning !
This whole depression has been very educational for the entire Sulzberger family !
“ Scrubs , ” the surrealist hospital sitcom that spent seven seasons as a stepchild of NBC ’s schedule , has come close to cancellation more times than its creator , Bill Lawrence , cares to remember .
So it ’s a surprise , even for Mr. Lawrence , that the show is getting to write its own ending .
Well , some sort of ending , anyway  on a new network .
In a rare move for network television , Mr. Lawrence ’s “ Scrubs ” is moving to ABC , beginning Jan .
6 .
“ It ’s freaky , ” Mr. Lawrence said in the former hospital room that he uses as an office , between editing sessions of the forthcoming episodes .
“ I ca n’t believe we get to do it .
It ’s incredibly odd in this landscape to actually get to end a show . ”
Even the end might be in question .
This season will be the last one for Mr. Lawrence and the show ’s star , Zach Braff .
They have already taped what they call a series finale .
( CNN ) -- Republican Party reaction is divided over the decision of a candidate for party chairman to distribute a CD that features the parody tune " Barack the Magic Negro , " with the majority of Chip Saltsman 's political rivals criticizing the move .
Chip Saltsman has been criticized by some of his rivals for the RNC chairmanship .
Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan -- battling to keep his job as head of the party -- was the first prominent member of the GOP to criticize Saltsman for sending committee members the song .
" The 2008 election was a wake - up call for Republicans to reach out and bring more people into our party , " Duncan said in a Saturday statement .
" I am shocked and appalled that anyone would think this is appropriate , as it clearly does not move us in the right direction . "
He is one of several candidates running to replace Duncan in the closely contested race to lead the Republican Party .
Michigan party chairman Saul Anuzis also questioned Saltsman 's judgment .
" In my opinion , this is n't funny and it's in bad taste , " he said in a statement .
" Just as important , anything that paints the GOP as being motivated in our criticism of President - elect Obama by anything other than a difference in philosophy does a disservice to our party . "
Watch more about the controversy over the song »
Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer -- who has reportedly been weighing a run for the party 's top spot , but has not officially announced a bid -- released a Monday morning statement praising candidates who have weighed in against the " racially insulting song . "
" As the GOP Chairman in one of our nation 's most ethnically and culturally diverse states , I am especially disappointed by the inappropriate words and actions we 've seen over the past few days , " he said .
" I am proud of those party leaders who have stood up in firm opposition to this type of behavior . "
" Actions such as the distribution of this CD , regardless of intent , only serves to promote divisiveness and distracts us from our common goal of building our party . "
For Christmas , Saltsman sent RNC members the parody CD " We Hate the USA , " which includes the controversial tune .
He defended his decision Friday , telling CNN the song was clearly intended as a joke .
" I think most people recognize political satire when they see it , " Saltsman told CNN .
" I think RNC members understand that . "
Saltsman , a former chair of the Tennessee Republican Party , was a top adviser to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and managed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 's presidential campaign .
The song , set to the tune of the 1960s folk song " Puff the Magic Dragon , " was first played on Rush Limbaugh 's radio show in 2007 .
Its title was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column that suggested Obama appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation 's history of mistreatment of African - Americans .
Saltsman said the song , penned by longtime friend Paul Shanklin , should be easily recognized as satire directed at the Times .
The CD includes parody songs referencing former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , among other targets .
Ken Blackwell -- one of two African - American candidates for party chairman -- agreed with Saltsman 's assessment , defending him in a weekend statement .
" Unfortunately , there is hypersensitivity in the press regarding matters of race , " said Blackwell -- who , if elected , would be the first black chairman of the RNC .
" This is in large measure due to President - elect Obama being the first African - American elected president .
" I do n't think any of the concerns that have been expressed in the media about any of the other candidates for RNC chairman should disqualify them .
When looked at in the proper context , these concerns are minimal .
All of my competitors for this leadership post are fine people . "
But some younger members of the party were less understanding , as the debate over the satire spread through conservative circles .
iReport.com : Sound off on the controversy
James Richardson , the RNC 's online communication manager for the 2008 election cycle , called Saltsman 's move " quite the revealing faux pas . "
" Granted , he did n't pull a George Allen and personally call Obama a ' magic Negro , ' but sending a CD with those lyrics shortly after electing the first African - American president -- one supported by nearly 97 percent of the African - American community -- shows a serious lack of judgment , tact and the necessary level of racial sensitivity expected of public officials , " wrote Richardson , a Red State contributor , on conservative blog The Skepticians .
" And while I 'm sure Saltsman does n't espouse racist sentiments , this will undoubtedly be spun as an angry , white Southerner stoking the flames of racial tensions after losing to a minority candidate , " Richardson wrote .
" Hell , why do n't we go ahead and give 'em the other 3 percent , too , Chip ? "
Most of the candidates for RNC chairman -- including Saltsman , Anuzis , Blackwell and Greer -- will face off in one week in Washington in a public debate sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform .
Duncan , who has been invited , has not yet confirmed his attendance .
All About Republican National Committee • Barack Obama • Republican Party
As I wrote in my previous post , a California county uncovered a problem with its voting system software only because the county 's registrar of voters had decided to implement an innovative public auditing program .
That program , the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project , was launched by Carolyn Crnich , who has been the county 's registrar of voters since 2002 .
She created the project with help from a dedicated group of volunteers that included former Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb , an employee of the Humboldt County district attorney 's office named Tom Pinto , and three citizens , Kevin Collins , a commercial fisherman , and Parke Bostrom and Mitch Trachtenberg , two technology experts who had a strong interest in finding a way to ensure the integrity of elections .
They 've documented their efforts on a web site to help educate groups in other states and counties who may want to replicate the project .
Humboldt County uses paper ballots that are scanned by an optical - scan system made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold Election Systems ) .
Under the Transparency Project , after the ballots are officially scanned and tabulated by the Premier system , they 're scanned a second time by a separate commercial scanner , not made by any voting machine company , so that the ballot images can then be posted on the internet for the public to examine and conduct independent recounts .
Every ballot image is imprinted with a unique serial number as it's scanned through the commercial scanner to verify its authenticity , and batches of ballot images are hashed to verify that they have n't been altered before they 're posted online or saved to DVDs .
To make it easier for the public to tally the votes , Trachtenburg , an independent programmer who has launched a company called Trachtenberg Election Verification Software , wrote a program pro bono to allow anyone to sort through the Humboldt ballots by precinct or race .
( Trachtenberg has posted the latest development release online for anyone to examine . )
The sorting software , called Ballot Browser ( image above right shows the software 's user interface ) , is an open source program written in Python to run on a Windows or Linux platform .
The Humboldt version is running on Debian Linux Etch and uses a Fujitsu high - speed scanner also using Debian Linux .
Ballot Browser displays each ballot in a window and highlights the spot where it thinks the voter has made his choice .
The display can be turned off to speed up scanning to 1,000 ballots an hour .
Crnich said she got the idea for the project from Kevin Collins , who expressed concerns during a public meeting about the trustworthiness of proprietary voting systems .
He wanted to know why it was n't possible for everyone to examine every ballot .
" That was the seed , " Crnich told Threat Level .
But getting ballots into the hands of the public presented a problem .
California 's election law says that once ballots are scanned and sealed in containers by poll workers after an election , they can't be re-opened except to be recycled or destroyed or unless officials suspect there might be something wrong with the ballots .
Crnich determined that the latter provided a possible loophole .
Since there was already a strong public perception that there was something wrong with the ballots , she concluded that this was the permission she needed to make the ballots available for public perusal .
Trachtenberg said he came away from his first meeting with Crnich feeling very pleasantly surprised .
" I just thought , ' she gets it , she gets it , ' " he said .
" I had contacted the previous election staff years ago complaining in particular that the [ voting ] system would n't leave a paper audit trail .
So I was really pleasantly surprised when I discovered that Carolyn was behind the idea of election transparency and wanted to get on board . "
Crnich convinced her board of supervisors to purchase an off - the - shelf Fujitsu high - speed scanner and the group launched the project in limited form during the June primary .
Trachtenberg said before the launch they had trouble getting the scanner to work with their Linux scanning program , but contacted M. Allen Noah , administrator of the SANE Project ( the open scanning protocol known as Scanner Access Now Easy that works with Linux ) , who advised them on how to make it work .
It took about five days to scan about 32,000 ballots cast in the primary election .
The ballot scans amounted to about 8.2 GB of data and filled up 3 DVDs .
They did n't actually do a re-count of the ballots in June , however .
They just did random spot checks to establish that their system worked .
The number of ballots they scanned with their Fujitsu matched very closely the number they had scanned with the Premier system , with the exception of one or two ballots .
The November election , by contrast , was more complicated and took 65 hours to scan because the election involved 64,161 ballots that were double - sided .
The volunteers were deputized before they started the project , and the chain - of - custody on the ballots was carefully controlled throughout the process .
A county worker removed the ballots from secure storage , and the ballots were never left alone with one person at a time .
The workers had to fill out forms carefully tracking the time the ballots left secure storage , the time at which they were unsealed from containers , and other steps .
Crnich said the partnership of technical experts with election staff turned out to be the perfect combination .
" With my willingness to say yes let 's do what we can to make this a transparent and trusted election and with Mitch 's ability to develop the software in open source and make it available , it 's worked out I think to the advantage of voters in Humboldt County , " Crnich said .
" [ The point ] was not to catch anybody or anything , it was just to make the information available to the public .
Here it is .
If you question our results , please look at it yourself . "
Once they 'd finished scanning the November ballots , they knew immediately they had a problem because the number of ballots they scanned through the Fujitsu printer did n't match the number of ballots that had been tabulated by the Premier system .
As I reported earlier , they discovered that the Premier system had dropped a batch of 197 ballots from its tabulation software .
The voting company has acknowledged that a problem with its software caused the system to drop the ballots and that the software has contained the error since 2004 .
Trachtenberg said the problem they discovered underscored for him that proprietary voting systems and " secret counting " methods are n't in the best interest of democracy .
" Without any allegation of fraud , programmers make mistakes .
And sometimes people like to hide their mistakes , " Trachtenberg said .
" If it 's possible for people to do an independent count , they should be allowed , and we 're very fortunate in Humboldt that we had a registrar who not only allowed us to do an independent count but made it as easy as it could be .

Judge yelled ' tyrant ' before Mukasey collapsed Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday November 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Before Attorney General Michael Mukasey collapsed last week at a speech to the conservative Federalist Society , one audience member could not contain his disapproval with the speech 's subject matter .
Mukasey 's defense of President Bush 's policies on prisoner treatment and their indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay was too much for Washington State Supreme Court Judge Richard Sanders .
He shouted , " Tyrant !
You are a tyrant ! "
Sanders acknowledged his conduct in an interview with The Seattle Times .
" Frankly , everybody in the room was applauding or sometimes laughing , and I thought , ' I 've got to stand up and say something . '
And I did , " he told the paper .
" I stood up and said , ' Tyrant , ' then I sat down again , then I left . "
The outburst came well before Mukasey 's collapse and likely did not contribute to it .
Sanders left before the end of Mukasey 's speech because he was n't enjoying himself , he told the paper .
While he regrets shouting at the country 's top law enforcement officer , Sanders says he still believes the policies Mukasey was advocating -- namely that the US is not obligated to adhere to the Geneva conventions in battling al Qaeda -- could lead to " tyranny . "
In the speech , Mukasey argued that because the international terrorist group did n't sign the convention , the US should n't be bound by them , but Sanders said that was n't the point .
" I did n't sign the Geneva Conventions , you did n't sign the Geneva Conventions , but the United States did sign the Conventions , " he told the Times .
" And that 's the point , is n't it ? "
As a penny - pinching holiday season looms , videogame companies are cutting game - console prices , beefing up supplies and releasing a vast crop of new games in hopes of attracting a wider audience .
In September , Microsoft Corp. dropped the price of its Xbox 360 console to $ 199 from $ 279 .
Nintendo Co. has increased the supply of its popular Wii consoles by 50 % in the U.S. from last year 's holiday season , when it sold about 2.85 million machines amid widespread shortages .
Both Microsoft and Sony Corp. are offering new online capabilities for their consoles , such as movie downloading .
The videogame industry is striving to keep up its momentum .
Most videogame consoles have already been out in the market for several years , meaning that many hardcore gamers have purchased one .
So in addition to feeding their core constituency with traditional shoot - 'em - up offerings , videogame makers have developed more " everyman " games .
The titles , which go beyond the typical videogame fare aimed at young men and teenagers , feature creative themes , such as imaginary - world simulations , that a broader audience might enjoy .
The hope is that more families will buy systems and games to play together .
Yet the strategy has run headlong into the economic downturn , with many consumers now snapping their wallets shut .
Total sales of videogame software and hardware are expected to rise 22 % this year to $ 22 billion , according to Anita Frazier , an analyst at NPD Group , a market - research firm based in Port Washington , N.Y .
That 's far slower than last year 's 43 % growth rate .
Here is some video of a bioluminescent deep - sea siphonophore -- an eerily fantastic creature that appears to be a single , large organism , but which is actually a colony of numerous individual jellyfish - like animals that behave and function together as a single entity .
The individual units , called zooids , all share the same genetic material , and each performs a specialized role within the colony .
The best - known siphonophore is the poisonous Portuguese Man o' War ( Physalia physalis ) , which lives at the surface of the ocean , unlike the one shown in this video ( filmed at a depth of 770 meters ) .
Some siphonophore species can grow up to 40 meters ( 130 ft ) in length .
How happy you are may depend on how happy your friends ’ friends ’ friends are , even if you do n’t know them at all .
And a cheery next - door neighbor has more effect on your happiness than your spouse ’s mood .
So says a new study that followed a large group of people for 20 years  happiness is more contagious than previously thought .
“ Your happiness depends not just on your choices and actions , but also on the choices and actions of people you do n’t even know who are one , two and three degrees removed from you , ” said Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis , a physician and social scientist at Harvard Medical School and an author of the study , to be published Friday in BMJ , a British journal .
“ There ’s kind of an emotional quiet riot that occurs and takes on a life of its own , that people themselves may be unaware of .
Emotions have a collective existence  they are not just an individual phenomenon . ”
In fact , said his co-author , James H. Fowler , an associate professor of political science at University of California , San Diego , their research found that “ if your friend ’s friend ’s friend becomes happy , that has a bigger impact on you being happy than putting an extra $ 5,000 in your pocket . ”
Veteran energy economist Philip Verleger insists oil never should have gone much above $ 70 a barrel ; that it did so only because of " a perfect storm " of U.S. policy mistakes , European economic developments and currency shifts ; and that it could well end up back in the low $ 20s before the global economy gets back on its feet .
" I think it will go a good deal lower , particularly next spring [ when oil markets are traditionally weakest ] , " Mr. Verleger said .
" If this thing follows a natural cycle , I think we 'll see something as low as $ 20 to $ 25 . "

At least two frequent fliers will be getting a good deal on holiday travel and accommodations this Thanksgiving .
Pumpkin and Pecan , the lucky turkeys whose lives were spared by the annual Thanksgiving presidential pardon Wednesday , will fly first - class on United Airlines to Los Angeles , where one of them will be grand marshal in Disneyland ’s Thanksgiving parade today .
The pair will then take up residence in a turkey house in the amusement park ’s Frontierland .
“ In recent weeks , I ’ve talked a lot about sprinting to the finish , ” said President Bush , surrounded by pumpkins and cornstalks in Wednesday ’s Rose Garden ceremony .
“ Yet I ’ve assured these turkeys they will not be trotting to their finish . ”
The turkey pardon is a White House tradition that dates to the Truman administration .
This year ’s duo received their names after an online vote on the White House website .
Runners - up included Roost and Run and Yam and Jam .

“ This is an election season , ” Bush said .
“ So it is fitting that the names of these two birds were chosen through the democratic process . ”
Pumpkin and the backup bird , Pecan -- whom the president joked was being held in an “ undisclosed location ” just in case “ the main act chickens out ” -- hail from Ellsworth , Iowa .
They were chosen from more than 4,500 candidates based on their struts , wattles and personalities .
In years past , the pardoned turkeys were sent to Frying Pan Farm Park , an animal sanctuary in Virginia , after the White House ceremony .
Since Disney requested the birds for its 50th anniversary in 2005 , however , they have been sent to the Golden State .
Leaders of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have objected to both locations .
This Thanksgiving , PETA President Ingrid Newkirk had a stern reminder for Bush .
“ You might be a lame duck , ” she wrote to him , “ but you still have the power to help lame turkeys . ”

Regardless of their ultimate destination , the birds usually do not roost for long -- bred to be eaten , their life spans are often short .
But for the moment , Pumpkin and Pecan are perhaps the luckiest birds alive .
Bush left the ceremony after giving thanks to the troops , the American people and his family -- including his mother , former First Lady Barbara Bush , who is doing well at a Houston hospital after surgery for a perforated ulcer .
Bush is expected to spend the long weekend at Camp David , the presidential retreat in Maryland .
The menu will include cranberry sauce , buttered mashed potatoes and free - range roast turkey .
“ He was n’t pardoning all turkeys ; just those two , ” said White House spokesman Carlton Carroll .

In June , Orange County Dist .
Atty .
Tony Rackauckas made a bold grab for a crown jewel of local law enforcement : the DNA unit of the sheriff ’s crime lab .
With the lab ’s director out of town and the sheriff recently deposed by corruption charges , Rackauckas submitted a brief agenda item to county supervisors two business days before their regular meeting .
“ Our aim is to make significant changes in the way forensic DNA analysis is conducted , ” Rackauckas wrote .
The D.A. 's office is “ the only organization capable of harnessing the vast potential of forensic DNA technology . ”
The move capped a three - year tug of war for control of DNA analysis in a historically conservative county where putting criminals behind bars can bring substantial political rewards .
Advertisement
“ I have never experienced anything like it in more than 30 years of law enforcement , ” recalled Sheriff Sandra Hutchens , who took over the department in the midst of the battle .
“ I could n’t get my brain around it , and no one I ’ve spoken with could either . ”
To end the bickering , one member of the Board of Supervisors proposed putting the county ’s entire crime lab in the hands of an independent agency headed by a scientist .
But , in the end , the board split control among the political players : the D.A. , the sheriff and the county chief executive .
The power struggle in Orange County is a sign of an intensifying national debate over who should control forensic science -- a question that has taken on new importance with the explosion of genetic evidence .
More by happenstance than design , crime labs most often are run by law enforcement agencies : police and sheriffs or , in three California counties , prosecutors .
Many experts say that arrangement has left the science vulnerable to undue influence and lax oversight , leading in some cases to wrongful convictions .
Advertisement
“ Many of the forensic scandals -- cases of outright fraud or undue pressure -- are precisely the result of this institutional coziness , ” said UCLA law school professor Jennifer Mnookin , who calls the arrangement “ incredibly dangerous . ”
For these reasons , a landmark report by the National Academy of Sciences , a research arm of the federal government , is expected to recommend next year that control of crime labs be given to independent scientists , according to three people who have read the confidential draft report .
Rackauckas has pushed hard in the other direction .
He dismissed concerns about potential conflicts of interest , saying prosecutors are uniquely qualified to ensure that evidence is handled properly and that priorities are set to prevent lab backlogs .
In the years leading to his attempted takeover of the sheriff ’s DNA unit , the district attorney spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in a bid to prove his point .
He essentially built his own system of DNA collection and analysis , in some cases duplicating what was being done by the sheriff ’s lab .
Advertisement
His efforts fell largely outside the regulations that govern state and national DNA systems , which were designed to prevent abuses and protect the privacy of innocent people .
Rackauckas and his admirers point to his successes , particularly in using DNA to solve property crimes such as auto theft and home burglaries .
The bane of urban areas , these offenses typically result in charges 10 % of the time .
In a pilot project using DNA evidence in selected cases , he was able to double that rate , according to statistics he submitted to the board .
“ Mr. Rackauckas is the most innovative and aggressive of D.A.s in the DNA area , ” said Kern County Dist .
Atty .
Ed Jagels , who runs his county ’s crime lab .
“ Among D.A.s , I think there ’s some respect for what Mr. Rackauckas has done , and a certain measure of envy . ”
Wrongful conviction

Some of the deepest concerns about the Orange County D.A. 's influence over forensic science come from analysts in the sheriff ’s DNA unit .
In interviews , several said they were shaken by a 2005 carjacking case in Buena Park .
Evidence against 20 - year - old James Ochoa was conflicting :
Two victims identified him as the culprit , based on a photograph police showed them .
But half a dozen family members said Ochoa was home eating at the time of the crime .
Buena Park investigators hoped DNA from a baseball cap and shirt left in the stolen car would nail the case .
Advertisement
“ If it does n’t match . . . we ’re not proceeding , ” the detective told DNA analyst Danielle Weiland , according to Weiland ’s deposition last January in a lawsuit by Ochoa .
Both the cap and shirt contained a mixture of DNA from multiple sources .
Complex cases like this can be subject to different interpretations , experts say , requiring an experienced and impartial eye to decipher accurately .
Weiland , who had been a DNA examiner since 2001 , found a distinct DNA profile from an unidentified person , but it did not belong to Ochoa .
Convinced that the profile belonged to the perpetrator , she submitted it for comparison to those of known offenders in the national database system , hoping for a “ match . ”
Meanwhile , her lab report ruled Ochoa out after determining that three of his genetic markers were not present in the mixture -- a finding confirmed by two other lab workers .
Weiland then got a call from Camille Hill , a member of Rackauckas ’ DNA unit .
Advertisement
Hill “ asked me to change the conclusion that Mr. Ochoa was excluded , ” Weiland said in the deposition .
In a meeting at the crime lab later that day , Hill suggested that Ochoa ’s missing genetic markers might not have been detected , Weiland said .
Generally speaking , a match means all markers in a genetic profile are present , but Hill was arguing that markers might have been missing because of degradation of the sample or extremely low quantities of DNA .
In an interview with The Times , Hill said she was not applying pressure , just asking for an explanation .
Despite the three missing markers , the mixture contained a substantial number of markers that did match Ochoa ’s profile .
Hill said that left open the possibility that Ochoa ’s DNA was present .
For 25 minutes , the two sides had a “ hostile ” exchange about the evidence , Weiland testified .
In the end , Hill accepted that the lab would not change its conclusion .
Advertisement
Prosecutors decided to go to trial anyway .
After both witnesses identified him in court on the third day of testimony , Ochoa accepted a plea deal , over the objection of his attorney .
He was sentenced to two years .
Eight months later , the genetic profile that Weiland had submitted to the national database was matched to a convicted offender in California .
Jaymes McCollum bore a passing resemblance to Ochoa and had numerous carjackings on his record .
When questioned , he confessed to the crime .
Ochoa was released from Centinela State Prison in the Imperial Valley , where he had been knifed while serving his sentence .
He received a $ 550,000 settlement for his wrongful conviction .
Powerful tool

The power of DNA lies in its ability not just to solve crimes but also to transform political careers .
Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Corona built his reputation as “ America ’s Sheriff ” thanks in large part to his lab ’s use of DNA to solve the 2002 murder of 5 - year - old Samantha Runnion .
But by 2005 , the year Ochoa was arrested , Carona had been weakened by a growing corruption scandal , and Rackauckas had moved to take a greater role in the county ’s DNA analysis .
Flush with money from a voter - approved reserve fund for law enforcement , the top prosecutor sought to use DNA to solve some of the 40,000 property crimes committed in the county annually .
A similar approach in Britain was touted as a way to catch criminals early in their careers before they could progress to more serious crimes .
Advertisement
To increase efficiency , Rackauckas offered to have his prosecutors prioritize crime scene evidence before it was sent to the DNA lab for testing .
Carona balked , Rackauckas said .
The sheriff also wanted to target property crimes using DNA but sought to do so without inviting the D.A. into the lab .
Many saw the clash as a sign of DNA ’s growing political cachet .
“ DNA has changed law enforcement , ” said Dean Gialamis , director of the Orange County Sheriff ’s Department crime lab .
“ It ’s increased so much there ’s the potential to prevent crimes in the future , not just solve crimes .
There ’s a desire not just to be a part of it but to control it . ”
Frustrated , Rackauckas decided to create his own DNA testing system , one that the sheriff ’s lab would play no part in .
Advertisement
Parallel system
Rackauckas hired a private DNA lab in Northern California to analyze what he considered the most promising evidence in property crime cases .
But the plan ran into a problem : Private labs are not allowed to upload DNA profiles into the national database system for comparison to the profiles of known felons .
The Orange County ’s sheriff ’s lab offered to upload the profiles for free , but Rackauckas chose to work around the sheriff , using $ 500,000 approved by the board .
Advertisement
“ It was n’t their program and I did n’t want to give them control over it , ” Rackauckas said in a recent interview .
That ’s not what he told Jagels , when he turned to the Kern County D.A. for help .
“ He indicated the O.C. lab was refusing to review and upload results for him , ” Jagels said .
“ My suspicion is that politics may have played some part in the problem . ”
Rackauckas said in an interview that he did n’t intentionally misrepresent the issue .
Jagels said he was happy to help Rackauckas .
At the time , Kern County had a backlog of DNA cases awaiting analysis .
Rackauckas proposed paying the private lab to analyze Kern County ’s cases if Jagels ’ lab would upload Orange County crime scene profiles into the national database .
Advertisement
The agreement assumed that taxpayers in both counties were getting their money ’s worth , but Jagels confirmed there are no records to guarantee it .
“ I ’m sure we could create it if we needed to , ” he said .
Recently , the arrangement changed so Orange County is now directly paying Kern County for the work it does .
Though highly unusual , Rackauckas ’ approach does not violate any of the rules governing use of the national database system , state officials said .
Advertisement
One step further
In January 2007 , Rackauckas took his aggressive DNA program a step further .
In addition to looking for matches in the national database , he decided to build his own , using $ 875,000 approved by the county Board of Supervisors .
“ Most crime that happens is local , ” Rackauckas said in an interview .
“ And it ’s a relatively small group of people committing a large percentage of the crime .
So a local database makes sense . ”
Creating one would allow the D.A. to avoid federal and state rules that limit who can be included and how a database can be used .
Most DNA databases include only those convicted of a felony and , increasingly , those arrested on suspicion of a felony .
Advertisement
But in 2004 , California voters approved a ballot initiative , Proposition 69 , that exempted local databases from these limitations .
Rackauckas ’ deputy , Hill , was one of four principal authors of the measure .
For the last year , the D.A. 's office has asked for DNA samples from certain people who plead guilty to misdemeanors such as petty theft or trespassing .
They can refuse , Hill said , but they ’ll get a less favorable deal in return .
The same is being done with gang members when they are served with a civil injunction .
“ We ask them if they ’ll give us a DNA sample , and they pretty much always say yes , ” Rackauckas said with a chuckle .
“ Once they know we have their DNA sample on record , they might have a greater tendency to behave . ”
Advertisement
So far , 4,000 people have given DNA samples and signed a consent form .
The D.A. expects to begin searching the database for matches to crime scene evidence in the spring .
Similar DNA databases are maintained by some police agencies elsewhere , including in New York and Florida .
Because they operate outside the state and federal guidelines , critics call them “ rogue databases . ”
Rackauckas ’ , however , is the only one known to exist outside an accredited crime lab .
His staffers say they are voluntarily building in many privacy and quality control safeguards required by crime labs , in part to protect the database from legal challenges .
Advertisement
Out in the open
Having notched some successes and built his own genetic database , Rackauckas grew bolder .
First , he asked the Board of Supervisors to approve construction of a $ 4.5 - million DNA lab that would fall entirely under his control and speed up DNA analysis on property crimes .
The sheriff ’s lab , still in turmoil after Carona ’s indictment on corruption charges and resignation earlier this year , countered that it could expand the existing lab ’s capacity for $ 3 million less .
Advertisement
By this time the fight between the two departments was out in the open , with charges of incompetence and dishonesty being exchanged in the press .
In early June , the week a new sheriff was expected to be named , Rackauckas raised the stakes yet again with his abrupt proposal to take over the sheriff ’s DNA unit .
While the matter was under review , board Chairman John Moorlach suggested that the entire crime lab be taken out of the hands of elected officials and put under a new independent agency .
“ We want to end the rancor and the turf battles , ” said Mario Mainero , Moorlach ’s chief of staff .
“ The science sure seemed to be caught up in all the politics . ”
Instead , in October , the board created a joint authority composed of the new sheriff , the county chief executive and Rackauckas to run what had been the sheriff ’s crime lab , including overseeing scientific policy .
Advertisement
In approving the set - up , the supervisors ignored the advice of James Ochoa , who , in a letter from his new home in Texas , urged them to keep forensic science out of the hands of law enforcement entirely .
“ If you allow this proposal to go through , ” he warned , “ you can expect future injustices like what happened to me . ”

About this series
This is the fourth in a series of occasional articles examining how DNA evidence is transforming criminal justice .
For more information , go to latimes.com / dna .
In the city that launched the national crime - stoppers movement — which pays informants for tips that help police solve local crimes —
Albuquerque detectives are taking the idea one controversial step further .
The Albuquerque Police Department put a want ad in the city 's weekly newspaper for " people that hang out with crooks to do part - time work . "
" Make some extra cash !
Drug use OK .
Criminal record ?
Not a problem . "
The ad in the Weekly Alibi prompted 93 calls during its two - week run before it was taken down last week , police spokesman John Walsh said .
He said some calls yielded valuable information in a drug investigation and two violent crime cases .
Walsh said the ad will run again " as soon as the detectives feel they need the help " and it could become a model for other agencies .
The ad is drawing criticism from legal analysts who say it could lead to inaccurate information when some agencies are re-evaluating how they deal with paid informants .
" In an economy when jobs are scarce , this is just asking people to make up information for money , " said Ellen Yaroshefsky , a legal ethics professor at New York 's Benjamin Cardozo School of Law .
" This is extremely dangerous . "
In 15 % of cases involving a wrongful conviction overturned by DNA evidence , an informant or jailhouse snitch testified against the defendant , said Barry Scheck , co-director of the Innocence Project , which seeks to free the wrongfully convicted .
Among agencies changing how they deal with informants : • Atlanta police amended their policies in 2007 and again this year after a botched drug raid based on an informant 's tip , spokesman Otis Redman said .
Supervisors must witness informant payments , and sources must undergo credibility checks .
•
The Tallahassee Police Department reviewed its policies after the shooting death of an informant in May , Capt .
David Hendry said .
The new policy allows only 30 of 360 officers to oversee cases involving informants .
Informants " do have capabilities , " Hendry says , " but you have to be careful .
They may be playing their own games . "
In Albuquerque , Walsh said , informants get $ 50 to " several hundred dollars , " based on the value of their tips , once the tips are checked and confirmed .
The agency decided to advertise , he said , because " we were running dry on information . "
Thomas Kern , chairman of Crime Stoppers USA , said he was " taken aback " by the ad .
He said it casts all informants as " snitches " when potential witnesses are being pressured not to cooperate with law enforcement .
" I think it may be sending the wrong message , " he said .

Police have come under attack since Grigoropoulos ' killing
Police in Athens have clashed with protesters in a resumption of the violence that flared after last month 's killing of a teenager by police .
Hooded youths broke away from a student march against education reforms and threw stones and flares at riot police , who fired tear gas and flash grenades .
The centre - right Greek government has pledged to crack down on the rioting .
Earlier this week a policeman was shot and badly injured in an attack feared linked to the unrest .
The policeman underwent more surgery on Friday .
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis recently vowed that police would take a harder line against the " catastrophic violence " that swept Greece after the shooting of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos on 6 December .
The new deputy interior minister in the prime minister 's reshuffled cabinet , Christos Markoyiannakis , has promised a " zero tolerance " approach to crime .
Friday 's clashes were the first test of that resolve .
Rick Warren speaks at the 2006 TED conference .

However , an investigation into Warren ’s involvement in Africa reveals a web of alliances with right - wing clergymen who have sidelined science - based approaches to combating AIDS in favor of abstinence - only education .
More disturbingly , Warren ’s allies have rolled back key elements of one of the continent ’s most successful initiative , the so - called ABC program in Uganda .
Stephen Lewis , the United Nations ’ special envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa , told the New York Times their activism is “ resulting in great damage and undoubtedly will cause significant numbers of infections which should never have occurred . ”
Warren ’s man in Uganda is a charismatic pastor named Martin Ssempa .
The head of the Makerere Community Church , a rapidly growing congregation , Ssempe enjoys close ties to his country ’s First Lady , Janet Museveni , and is a favorite of the Bush White House .
In the capitol of Kampala , Ssempa is known for his boisterous crusading .
Ssempa ’s stunts have included burning condoms in the name of Jesus and arranging the publication of names of homosexuals in cooperative local newspapers while lobbying for criminal penalties to imprison them .
President - elect Obama made a big mistake when he selected Christian extremist and known bigot Rick Warren to speak at his inauguration .
So far , he has ignored the public outcry from his supporters and is rapidly losing the political capital he accrued with this observer during his admittedly impressive campaign .
In defending Warren , Obama loves to tout Warren 's work on AIDS in Africa .
I admit that this sounds impressive , but I am less impressed with breaking news about Warren 's association with a lunatic pastor who has been burning condoms for Jesus .
According to Max Blumenthal of The Daily Beast , controversy over Obama 's selection of Warren prompted additional investigation of what exactly Warren did in Africa .
For something so seemingly laudable , Blumenthal found that Warren was surprisingly tight - lipped about his work in Africa .
Now we know why .
Instead of praising Warren 's work on AIDS in Africa , Obama 's transition team should have realized that he was actually doing whatever he could to undermine reality - based approaches to the prevention and treatment of HIV / AIDS .
In the opinion of this author , this news is right up there with the most damning things we have yet heard about Warren .
It should certainly be grounds to uninvite him from the inauguration .
Okay , but burning condoms for Jesus ?
Come on !
No , actually that was a serious accusation .
Is this the sort of company Obama plans to keep as President ?
Does he really want to ask Americans to embrace this sort of idiocy .
I hope not , and I look to Obama to pull the invitation for Warren to speak .
By Nancy Scola *
Anyone hearing about central India 's ongoing epidemic of farmer suicides , where growers are killing themselves at a terrifying clip , has to be horrified .
But among the more disturbed must be the once - grand poobah of post- invasion Iraq , U.S. diplomat L. Paul Bremer .
Why Bremer ?
Because Indian farmers are choosing death after finding themselves caught in a loop of crop failure and debt rooted in genetically modified and patented agriculture -- the same farming model that Bremer introduced to Iraq during his tenure as administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority , the American body that ruled the " new Iraq " in its chaotic early days .
In his 400 days of service as CPA administrator , Bremer issued a series of directives known collectively as the " 100 Orders . "
Bremer 's orders set up the building blocks of the new Iraq , and among them is Order 81 , officially titled Amendments to Patent , Industrial Design , Undisclosed Information , Integrated Circuits and Plant Variety Law , enacted by Bremer on April 26 , 2004 .
Order 81 generated very little press attention when it was issued .
And what coverage it did spark tended to get the details wrong .
Reports claimed that what the United States ' man in Iraq had done was no less than tell each and every Iraqi farmer -- growers who had been tilling the soil of Mesopotamia for thousands of years -- that from here on out they could not reuse seeds from their fields or trade seeds with their neighbors , but instead they would be required to purchase all of their seeds from the likes of U.S. agriculture conglomerates like Monsanto .
That 's not quite right .
Order 81 was n't that draconian , and it was not so clearly a colonial mandate .
In fact , the edict was more or less a legal tweak .
What Order 81 did was to establish the strong intellectual property protections on seed and plant products that a company like the St. Louis - based Monsanto -- purveyors of genetically modified ( GM ) seeds and other patented agricultural goods -- requires before they 'll set up shop in a new market like the new Iraq .
With these new protections , Iraq was open for business .
In short , Order 81 was Bremer 's way of telling Monsanto that the same conditions had been created in Iraq that had led to the company 's stunning successes in India .
In issuing Order 81 , Bremer did n't order Iraqi farmers to march over to the closest Monsanto - supplied shop and stock up .
But if Monsanto 's experience in India is any guide , he did n't need to .
Here 's the way it works in India .
In the central region of Vidarbha , for example , Monsanto salesmen travel from village to village touting the tremendous , game - changing benefits of Bt cotton , Monsanto 's genetically modified seed sold in India under the BollgardÂ® label .
The salesmen tell farmers of the amazing yields other Vidarbha growers have enjoyed while using their products , plastering villages with posters detailing " True Stories of Farmers Who Have Sown Bt Cotton . "
Old - fashioned cotton seeds pale in comparison to Monsanto 's patented wonder seeds , say the salesmen , as much as an average old steer is humbled by a fine Jersey cow .
Part of the trick to Bt cotton 's remarkable promise , say the salesmen , is that BollgardÂ® was genetically engineered in the lab to contain bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterium that the company claims drastically reduces the need for pesticides .
When pesticides are needed , Bt cotton plants are RoundupÂ® Ready -- a Monsanto designation meaning that the plants can be drowned in the company 's signature herbicide , none the worse for wear .
( RoundupÂ ® mercilessly kills nonengineered plants . )
Sounds great , right ?
The catch is that BollgardÂ® and RoundupÂ® cost real money .
And so Vidarbha 's farmers , somewhat desperate to grow the anemic profit margin that comes with raising cotton in that dry and dusty region , have rushed to both banks and local moneylenders to secure the cash needed to get on board with Monsanto .
Of a $ 3,000 bank loan a Vidarbha farmer might take out , as much as half might go to purchasing a growing season 's worth of Bt seeds .
And the same goes the next season , and the next season after that .
In traditional agricultural , farmers can recycle seeds from one harvest to plant the next , or swap seeds with their neighbors at little or no cost .
But when it comes to engineered seeds like
Bt cotton , Monsanto owns the tiny speck of intellectual property inside each hull , and thus controls the patent .
And a farmer wishing to reuse seeds from a Monsanto plant must pay to relicense them from the company each and every growing season .
But farmers who chose to bet the farm , literally , on Bt cotton or other GM seeds are n't necessarily crazy or deluded .
Genetically modified agricultural does hold the tremendous promise of leading to increased yields -- incredibly important for farmers feeding their families and communities from limited land and labor .
But when it comes to GM seeds , all 's well when all is well .
Farming is a gamble , and the flip side of the great potential reward that genetically modified seeds offer is , of course , great risk .
When all goes badly , farmers who have sunk money into Monsanto - driven farming find themselves at the bottom of a far deeper hole than farmers who stuck with traditional growing .
Farmers who suffer a failed harvest may find it nearly impossible to secure a new loan from either a bank or local moneylender .
With no money to dig him or herself out , that hole only gets deeper .
And that hole is exactly where farmers have found themselves in India 's Vidarbha region , where crop failure -- especially the failure of Bt cotton crops -- has reached the level of pandemic .
In may be that Bt cotton is n't well - suited to central India 's rain - driven farming methods ; BollgardÂ ® and parched Vidarbha may be as ill - suited as Bremer 's combat boots and Brooks Brothers suits .
It may be the unpredictable and unusually dry monsoon seasons that have plagued India of late .
But in any case , the result is that more and more of India 's farmers are finding themselves in debt , and with little hope for finding their way out .
And the final way out that so many of them -- thousands upon thousands -- have chosen is death , and by their own hands .
Firm statistics are difficult to come by , but even numbers on the low end of the scale are downright horrifying .
The Indian government and NGOs have estimated that , so far this year , at last count more than a thousand farmers have killed themselves in the state of Maharashtra alone .
The New York Times pinned it as 17,000 Indian farmers in 2003 alone .
A PBS special that aired last month , called " The Dying Fields , " claimed that one farmer commits suicide in Vidarbha every eight hours .
But let 's not be so pessimistic for a moment , and say that Iraqi farmers see the risks of investing in unproven GM seeds .
Let 's say they reject the idea that the intellectual property buried inside the seeds they plant is " owned " not by nature , but by Monsanto .
Let 's say they decide to keep on keeping on with nonengineered , nonpatented agriculture .
The fact is , they may not have a choice .
Here is where Order 81 starts to look a lot like the forced and mandatory GM - driven agricultural system that cynics tagged it as when it was first announced .
Read the letter of the law , and the impact of Order 81 seems limited to using public policy to construct an architecture that 's simply favorable to a company like Monsanto .
The directive promotes a corporate agribusiness model a lot like the one we have in the United States today , but it does n't really and truly put Monsanto in the driver 's seat of that system .
Actually handing the keys to Monsanto is instead biology 's job .
Biology -- how so ?
That 's a good question for Percy Schmeiser , the Saskatchewan farmer featured in the film The Future of Food , who found himself tangled with Monsanto in a heated lawsuit over the presence of RoundupÂ® Ready canola plants on the margins of his fields .
The Canadian farmer argued that he had purchased no Monsanto canola seeds , had never planted Monsanto seeds , and was frankly horrified to find that the genetically modified crops had taken hold in his acreage .
Perhaps , suggested Schmeiser , the plants in question were the product of a few rogue GM seeds blown from a truck passing by his land ?
Monsanto was uninterested in Schmeiser 's theory on how the RoundupÂ® Ready plants got there .
As far as the company was concerned , Schmeiser was in possession of an agricultural product whose intellectual property belonged to Monsanto .
And it did n't matter much how that came to pass .
Monsanto's interpretation of the impact of seed contamination is , of course , a good one if its goal is to eventually own the rights to the world 's seed supply .
And that goal may well be in sight .
In fact , a 2004 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that much of the U.S. seed pool is already contaminated by GM seeds .
If that contamination continues unabated , eventually much of the world 's seeds could labor under patents controlled by one agribusiness or another .
In one agricultural realm like Iraq 's , GM contamination could in short order give a company like Monsanto a stranglehold over the market .
Post - Order 81 Iraqi farmers who want to resist genetically modified seeds and stick to traditional farming methods may not have that choice .
Future generations of Iraqi growers may find that one seed shop in Karbala is selling the same patented seeds as every other shop in town .
And when that happens , what had been a traditional farming community -- where financial risk is divided and genetic diversity multiplied through the simple interactions between neighboring farmers -- finds itself nothing more than the home to lone farmers caught up in the high - stakes world of international agribusiness .
It 's a world not unfamiliar to former CPA honcho Bremer , if the company he keeps is any indication .
Robert Cohen , author of the book Milk A - Z , talks about the Bush administration as the " Monsanto Cabinet . "
Among the many connections between that company and the current White House : Former Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman served on the board of directors of Calgene , a Monsanto subsidiary ; one - time Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld had an eight - year stint as president of Searle , another Monsanto subsidiary ; Clarence Thomas worked as an attorney in Monsanto 's pesticide and agriculture division before coming to the Supreme Court as a George H.W. Bush appointee .
Those connections , as much as anything else , might help to explain the impetus behind and timing of Order 81 .
Let 's suppose for a minute that GM - driven globalized agriculture is , indeed , in the long - term best interests of the new Iraq .
Even in the best of circumstances , such a significant policy shift in so core an economic sector can be expected to cause short - term pain .
When Bremer issued the directive , Iraq was hardly in a good place :
It had recently been invaded , its government dismantled .
Considering the desperate need for immediate stability in Iraq in April 2004 , Order 81 begins to look like the triumph of connections and ideology over clear - headed policymaking .
In India , seed activists like Vandana Shiva are working to weaken the connection between that world of U.S. agribusiness and the farmers in villages and towns across India .
Shiva , featured in the PBS special The Dying Fields , implores local farmers to stop forking over their money to commercial seed producers and return to the days of homegrown seeds .
While Monsanto sells seeds that become India 's corn , rice , potatoes , and tomatoes , it 's cotton where Monsanto is king , as Shiva well knows .
" You have become addicted to Bt cotton , " she chides farmers .
Though if the perpetuation of the GMO - seed / crop - failure cycle is any indication , few Indian farmers are listening .
Will Iraqi farmers making their way in the new post - Order 81 agricultural world fare any better ?
Maybe .
Can they manage to reap the benefits of genetically modified farming , trading their newfound dependence on Monsanto and other corporate behemoths for the increased yield their patented and IP - protected seeds promise ?
Hopefully .
But it 's possible that Iraq 's farmers will indeed find themselves in the same predicament that India 's farmers have ended up in -- a world where growers no longer rely upon their fields and their communities to meet their needs but in a world in which , when hard times strike , the only way out seems like the final exit .
A world in which , in a twist perhaps worthy of Shakespeare , the farmer borrows one last time from whatever bank or moneylender will hand over a few last rupees , buys one last bottle of RoundupÂ® , and -- as has happened so many times in India -- ends it all by drinking it down .
Monsanto to the end .

The good Dr. Zelenko
I hate to attack PeterKa , who went whole hog for us to test Hydroxychloroquine by adminstering it to his own person as a protective measure against the Wuhan virus infection , but the three studies as presented in the article he cited is nothing better than a doubling down on moronicity .
" Dr. Zelenko , you promised Hydroxychloroquine would work ! "
" No , I promised it would n't work .
Why else would my treatment protocol include two other drugs as repeated back and forth several times by my colleague User: Conservative ? "
" But those scientists seemed so dismissive ! "
" Republicans like Trump stand in the way of a lot of ' experts ' who'd like a stable career in the government , stable that is , in the sense of not worrying each year if the Republican is going to cut the federally - or state - funded largess that would otherwise appear annually on their plates .
" They do n't think having no competition is a detriment like we do , but rather their place in the natural order of things .
That 's why they have no hesitancy at all following on the heels of the Lancet scandal to shoot off remarks that presuppose gross misrepresentations about how hydroxychloroquine is actually used .
" Medical journals too have the loudest voices on the editorial boards directed toward politicizing medicine from the throats of those whose positions and titles are the most determined by what happens in government .
Those who are barely affected by government do n't stand a chance in developing the same kind of vital interest that the self - proclaimed elites do .
" For example , one of studies Peter 's article cites comes from the Scripps Translational Science Institute which received $ 34 million from United States Government 's National Institute of Health ( NIH ) in 2018 .
" You 'd think medical professionals and their science media allies would n't be petty enough to run a test on the literal sense of what was actually the President 's shorthand reference to the treatment protocol I presented , rather than the actual treatment protocol itself that I developed .
But you 'd only be so much the more mistaken for not thoroughly considering the plausibility of the points I 've made . "

Here 's another gem from Peter 's article by the American Association for the Advancement of Science :
On 5 June , researchers in the United Kingdom announced the results from the largest trial yet , Recovery , in a press release .
In a group of 1542 hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine , 25.7 % had died after 28 days , compared with 23.5 % in a group of 3132 patients who had only received standard care .
“ These data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit , ” wrote the investigators , who ended the study early and promised to publish the full results as soon as possible .
An incredulous Dr. Zelenko ( and not just me channeling him ) replied :
The WHO says hydroxychloroquine is no longer a potential COVID treatment , citing data from Oxford 's “ Recovery ” Trial .
# ZelenkoProtocol is 200 mg , twice a day , for 5 days .
" Recovery " was 2400 mg the first day .
Are professional researchers accidentally administering TOXIC doses ?
Needless to say , the Oxford study only relied on the University 's own endowment fund to run the scientific trial to avoid conflicts of interest .
— Just kidding !
It was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation , the biggest vaccine funder in the world , whom , having been reported to the United Nations on charges of crimes against humanity , certainly could use an opportunity to raise their profile , and should they come to the rescue by funding the vaccine that cures the Wuhan virus , why that 's destiny calling !
Unless somebody else develops an effective treatment protocol first .

Recent HCQ research
This French paper looked at 29 published hydroxychloroquine studies , took the best 15 of them , and mathematically combined those into a giant super - study , called a " Bayesian meta - analysis . "
It concluded that HCQ by itself has no statistically significant effect on covid - 19 .
The combination of HCQ and azithromycin increases mortality by 27 percent .
There were studies that focused on patients in early stages of the disease , as well as other studies of late stage patients .
So that does n't seem to make a difference .
According to this preprint article , there are two redundant pathways that allow the virus to enter a cell .
One uses a receptor called ACE2 and the other depends on the presence of the chemical TMPRSS2 .
In microscopic images of the virus , you can see the receptors stick out like plants growing on the surface of the virus .
HCQ blocks only the ACE2 receptor , so it wo n't work by itself .
The obvious question is , is there another drug that could block the TMPRSS2 pathway ?
This French study suggests that zinc may do the trick .
Switzerland was using the three - drug Zelenko treatment ( HCQ , AZM , and zinc ) until the WHO banned HCQ after the bogus Lancet study .
The article uses the Swiss data to create a dramatic before - and - after chart .

Hong Kong is lost - at least in the near term .
The current type of economic sanctions imposed by countries against China are not working .

In the short to midterm , China a paper tiger .
" As per Institute of International Finance , China ’s total domestic debt hit 317 % of its GDP in first quarter of 2020 , up from 300 % last year , registering a largest quarterly increase .
What ’s worse , this data under - reports the true picture of China ’s indebtedness , since a lot of debt is taken by local governments through financing vehicles that are not reflected in balance sheets .
Since 2008 , the annual growth in China ’s domestic debt has been 20 % , which has outpaced its GDP growth .
Add to it the political culture of central Chinese leadership being favourably disposed towards local governments that have shown “ development ” backed by an ever increasing debt burden .
" And China is set to take on more debt as it tries to beat the Covid - 19 induced slowdown to increase its spending .
With Beijing announcing advance quota of local government special purpose bonds to the tune of 1 trillion yuan to fund infrastructure projects , it is now almost a given that debt at the local level — which is non-transparent and often violates banking rules — is set to balloon further .
The move will ensure local government debt will more than double as compared to last year from 1.9 trillion yuan in 2019 to almost 3 trillion yuan this year .
" A banking crisis and systemic collapse of the financial sector are now looming large amidst growing concerns that many of the debts taken at household level and at local government level are at a very high risk of default .
This could hit China ’s state - dominated financial system hard and unravel the non-transparent financial dealings that have been the hallmark of its growth model .
In fact , the extent of regulatory lapses can be gauged from the fact that Ministry of Finance has been forced to call out certain regional governments for illegal fundraising in multiple audit reports .
Obviously , the pandemic will slow regional economies and will drive down revenues of local governments , which will limit their ability to repay / refinance previous large amounts of debt , leading to large scale defaults . " [ 4 ]

I looked at the reports , and yet , while I agree there is a good chance of massive flooding because they did n't dig deep enough , there 's also a good chance the dam itself will hold .
The reports say " it 's reached its capacity " , but the truth is that dams are supposed to be built with what 's called a " factor of safety " — they take the worst - case scenario and then build the dam to be able to support twice or three - times that amount .

Amidst the Democrat riots and coronavirus , WWIII and Cold War II are being overlooked .
Time for an update .
The PRC in 2020 is way more powerful than the Third Reich or the USSR combined ever were , and presently engaged in the same aggression and human rights abuses .
Tensions are ratcheted up daily .
The CCP has no regard for the lives of its own people , be it through man made bio weapons , floods , earthquakes , locust plagues , gulags , slave labor , or organ harvesting so long as it aids in clinging to power .
In today 's world ( rather than send an army after Saddam or Hitler as in the past ) , this is countered with the Global Magnitsky Act .
What is the Global Magnitsky Act ?
It is modeled after the Magnitsky Act which originally targeted Russian oligarchs .
The U.S. controls the vast bulk of international money transfers which are delineated in dollars .
When Magnitsky sanctions are placed upon individuals , such as Putin , Ayatollah Khamenei , Kim jong - un etc and their intimate business partners , it makes it difficult or impossible for them to profit from their corruption .
Any American who does business with these people faces FBI investigation and harassment ( like they attempted to frame Roger Stone and Michael Flynn for ) .
Additionally , U.S. allies such as France , Germany , the U.K. , Canada , Mexico , Brazil , etc or corporate entities such Airbus , likewise face sanctions and FBI harassment .
So the Global Magnitsky Act has the effect of invoking a world - wide boycott , embargo , sanction ( whatever word you choose to use ) against targeted individuals from trading in U.S. dollars .
( So the law encourages targeted individuals to trade among themselves using something other than U.S. dollars .
Fortunately , ( a ) the amount of trade is fractional compared to the aggregate of global trade , and ( b ) they are all so corrupt and do n't trust each other , making it hard to agree on an honest unit of measure to use as currency between themselves .
This explains the spiking gold price ; so sanctioned individuals who can't afford gold do n't get any slack trading their home currency with sanctioned individuals in other countries ) .
So what 's next ?
What is the Trump card the U.S. can play to serve the cause of U.S. interests , human rights , and liberation of the Chinese people ?
If global sanctions were placed upon all 90 million members the Chinese Communist Party , the whole structure of the Chinese government would implode .
It wo n't happen in a day , but the mere threat of talking about this next phase of the scenario is creating open factions in the CCP , and resentment against dictator - for - life Xi Jinping , who can have that honorary title removed by CCP members shortening his life or some other way .

Flashback : Northwest
From what I 've read here , BLM may actually be a front for the Communist Party USA .
Obama 's involvement in agitating the BLM protesters to continue rioting , vandalizing and even targeting the police is making it more and more evident that the usurper in the White House has to be stopped .

VargasMilan may be right about the presidential 2020 election .
A Trump electoral college landslide may happen
An anonymous poll in Las Vegas taken by a cab driver indicates a Trumpslide in 2020 : Betting on a Trumpslide .
I also read this : The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday shows that 48 % of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump ’s job performance .
Fifty - one percent ( 51 % ) disapprove . [ 5 ]
This is a significant rise in Trump 's approval rating by Rasmussen in recent times .
I think many of the polls may be wrong because the mainstream press wants to rig them and due to shy and sneaky Republican ladies who do n't want to admit they are voting for Trump and the " Silent Majority " .
Many voters probably believe the coronavirus is going to be solved soon by an upcoming vaccine and they are voting for Trump due to : their pocketbooks ; due to the far left having undue influence on the Democratic Party and the incompetent , corrupt and lackluster Joe Biden being the Democrat running for president .
The riots and the Democratic governors / mayors responses to them do n't help either .
I think many people are having lockdown fatigue also .
If the Democrats picked someone more electable than Hillary and Biden , maybe Trump would have never been elected once and possibly twice .
It 's very hard to predict the election ( Trump is a relentless fighter , incompetent pollsters , swing states , changing / unexpected events , etc. ) .
The coronavirus is rising in the USA .
How much is Trump 's fault is hard to know .
America has the largest obesity problem in the world and many people with underlying conditions as a result ( Obesity suppressing immune systems too plus taxes the bodies system ) .
Americans are very independent and it may be hard to get them to comply with social distancing , masks , etc .
The U.S. press does a poor job educating the public as well .
I do think America could have done a better job mitigating the pandemic .

Trump has so swollen the minds of activist and hidden socialists with anger by slighting their ideas without their being able to tell how much he 's actually examined them , if it all , that they are pushed into thinking the best way to recover ground with the voting public is to extend their usual play of assuming high dudgeon combined with ignoring the facts that make that posture irrelevant , into every possible avenue of prospected advantage .
All Trump has to do is guide them by raising their prospects selectively into areas where these socialists must cross over boundaries of which the voting public wo n't approve , but of which these same socialists incorrectly think the public 's familiarity with their conveniently mistaken political assumptions has caused them to tolerate the hostility that motivates the crossing of those boundaries equally well .
A good example ?
A respect for law and its responsible enforcement .
How could they be so blind ?
If they can't publicly examine their ideas , they at least deserve to have the closure of seeing Trump feel their pain caused by the dismissal of their ideas in a definite way , even if they have to present the non-self - inflicted component of it on a larger scale than what it is in reality to make sure it happens !
That 's the badly kept secret : good sense is the White Whale ; the permanent majoritarian victor that underlies all the frustration the Captain Ahab that is cultural Marxism can't slay .
The idealists like Starbuck do n't know it ; the cynics can't depend on it as a rallying point without losing the idealists .
Can we expect another foray against " Western Civilization " ?
Of course .
News events are the cultural Marxists ' slot machine .
If enough surrogates for good sense are framed as persecutors within a short enough time period with the help of rechanneling that frustration , it will induce the idea that maybe good sense needs to be abandoned as a foundation .
Is this possible ?
So far the principle brought to national attention that those who are favored by the police are actually persecuted by them , has levitated without visible means of such support for months now .
As respect for good sense diminishes , respect for histrionics fills the empty space ( and the " best " given the right - of - way at the intersection ) .

Some Bernie bros are populists who may really end up preferring an anti-establishment conservative like Donald Trump over some " moderate " establishment Democrat hack like Joe Biden .
I 've seen leftists outraged over the fact that around 15 % ( if I remember correctly ) of Bernie supporters are willing to back Trump over Biden .
If President Trump appeals to that base with economic opportunities , he can potentially win in a landslide .

Jack Dorsey re-testifies to Congress Monday
Jack Dorsey , the founder of Twitter ... how do I say it ?
Misled Congress ?
Lied to Congress ?
Perjured himself ?
Over whether Twitter practiced political censorship .
There was a picture leaked and passed around on Twitter ( which was naturally censored ) showing a Twitter moderator 's management console programmed with large buttons labelled with various censorship tasks like , for example , " shadowban " .
In this case , the subtle minds at Twitter have cleverly concealed what the button label might mean , so although we would need a modern - day Sherlock Holmes to learn the operation to which it truly refers , I suspect it has something to do with the prohibition of large summer umbrellas , though I 've steeled myself to the prospect of discovering it applies to the performance of some equally fiendish behavior .

Who was America 's first racist president ?
With Joe Biden shooting off his idiotic mouth again , we need to get a handle on this one : " Biden claims Trump is America 's ' first ' racist president . "
I see this as yet another category in which Woodrow Wilson , our 28th president , represents the bottom of the barrel .
He was a supporter of the Confederacy , the KKK , and segregated federal employees .
See " The 11 Most Racist U.S. Presidents . "
Of course , this brings to mind Biden 's claim that Obama was " articulate and bright and clean . "
These days , it 's so hard to find a black man who is truly clean that once you find one , you automatically start thinking about putting him in the Oval Office .
Did Biden have a joint appearance with Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton and go away thinking , " Holy , cow , what a stinkbag ! " PeterKa ( talk ) 01:28 , 24 July 2020 ( EDT )
Peter , Biden had to say something , and let me explain .
There 's a conservative meme floating around that goes " People thought that Obama would be the post - racial president , but he turned out to be the most racial president . "
As I 'm sure you know , Biden 's campaign 's job is to find any well - known damaging generalizations that might prevent his attractiveness as a candidate from reaching its full effect and counter them .
But this is sometimes done for many such perspectives , like the one you mentioned , true or false , at once , with something that blocks and replaces them , or at least confuses them .
This is often done by means of time - wasting disputations his supporters can use even though people know they are n't true , but are effective because they are annoying enough for people aged 18 - 49 to respond to .

" The politically charged review , which shifted into a criminal investigation last fall , has been criticized by Democrats as a scheme to damage President Trump 's rivals ahead of the 2020 election
There it is again !
You 'll notice if it damages his rivals it will be wholely rooted in the self - inflicted kind of damage .
But because they 're damaged they get the moral supremacy anyway .
And did n't Plato tell us punishments are medicinal for the soul ?
Do n't we have the right to a government that sees that justice is done even when we ourselves are wrong ?
Damaged instead of punished on the basis of what ?
Gee , I wonder why they did n't characterize the evidence that would determine that .
Maybe the whole Justice Department should recuse itself , since the suspects attempted high treason against their boss , and so they have a conflict of interest .
Do you think if Trump 's " rivals " shoot themselves in the foot in the course of trying to frame Trump 's staff for a crime , they 're immune from punishment because the results are too ironic ?
We wo n't know because they do n't mention that activity as part of the case either .

Anthony Fauci did behave hypocritically and he did it in public .
Recently , a person from New Zealand whose political views skew to the secular left indicated to me that the USA had poor leadership when it comes to the coronavirus epidemic .
Due to excessive nationalism , rather than investigate this matter more fully , I decided to point out to him that some nations that are atheistic / nonreligious / evolutionistic in their ideology have had less than a stellar response to the pandemic ( China / UK / some European countries ) .
Looking back , given that there are 195 countries in the world and that the USA is among the top countries in deaths by coronavirus per 100,000 people [ 6 ] [ 7 ] , I should have been more open to the notion that America has had poor leadership during this pandemic .
And the current administration is not entirely to blame since the coronavirus has a bigger effect on overweight and aging populations ( the USA did not transform itself into an overweight / aging population in the last 4 years ) .
By the way , the UK , which is the fountainhead of Darwinism , has the highest rate of covid - 19 deaths per 100,000 people in the world !
Next , I am a big believer in masks and social distancing .
I not only wear a common blue masks that many others wear in public , but I cover it with a t - shirt mask that I form .
So I double mask !
I also social distance .
In addition , soon I am getting a face shield which are very inexpensive to get .

Instead Newsom insisted that Trump jawbone for Newsom on liberal social issues , and when Trump declined , Newsom announced that he was leading California as a " nation - state " .
Well , everything Newsome tried did n't stop the cases , probably because he was still letting in the illegal aliens , and Trump did n't warn him .
Everybody in California remembered what Newsom did , and how he went out of his way to do things differently than Trump , like allow the enormous communist protests to take place without any calls for medical restrictions , so it looked like he was n't listening , and then he tried micromanaging the crisis so he'd look engaged , but everybody thought he was gutting the economy just to go through the motions of making tough decisions .

" As I recall , 2019 - 20 was predicted to be a very heavy flu season , and yet , it turned out to be a light flu season and a heavy Covid season .
Could that be because we were just coding flu cases as Covid ? "
There is no controlling legal standard for reporting Covid fatalities reported to the CDC , and the regulations they do have explicitly state they are only aspiring to 50 % accuracy and reward health care providers each time Covid is the cause of death and give them nothing if it is n't .
There are no examinations by the residing county 's coroner 's office to confirm the cause of death unless a crime is involved .

Mike S. Adams
Mike S. Adams ( no relation to the Mike Adams up on this page ) , commentator on social Marxism , for those who knew him in person or through his satirical writings , was known by us to be assassinated in his home by a firearm last week — he had no financial motive to take his own life as he was set to collect his pension as a professor ; no personal motive , he had droves of adoring fans on TownHall ; no mental motive , as he had a model conservative intellect for dealing firmly but not harshly with those who saw him as an obstacle to their vengeance and power over those who sought success by the legitimate means of being of use and service to their community rather than extorting a kind of ransom to escape destructive abuse the way they themselves achieved success .
And no spiritual motive as he was a devout Baptist .
I will miss his humor the most ; he stuck mostly to bad puns on his Twitter account — it was heavily shadowbanned to the point that he probably could have been a Top Conservative on Twitter otherwise , but his influence was enormous ; the 2.2 million follower account of Ann Coulter repeated news of his suspicious death .
But his longer riffs I liked the best ; his most perfected trope was a deadpan satirically earnest engagement with the empty glittering appearances of liberal insight at face value ; I 'd be in hysterics at the times when the more foolish his liberal challenger became to extricate themselves from exposure of their insincerity , the more satirically apologetic he became .
Do n't get me wrong , the idea of political assassination is scary as h--- to someone who grew to appreciate and even adopt his clever sensibilities ( the best example is probably when I use the phrase " that 's big of you " ) , but he also had a heavy side using his discernment skills as a professor of criminology , as , frankly , some of the liberals he'd encounter at their Meccas at the state liberal arts colleges were psychological and emotional messes .
Especially in his books he'd resort to an analysis that was however as deep as he'd happen to encounter in the opinions of others along the way , like of feminism , where I did n't want to go , and when I went past my qualms out of a desire to support him financially , I 'd be sorry I did .
I had to stop reading him when I went to work among certain liberals ; his analysis in a column would bring you to a certain point of looking briefly at motives brought up in each one , one at a time , that frequently forced you to hesitate when you encountered it again until what you remembered grew to a kind of cascade that had a way of blocking the direct kind of communication .
But as I let on , what he did write ( he also gave speeches ) was really quite instructional ( and harrowing ) after the ideas were reinforced on repetition about how liberals had corrupted the intellectual education that is supposed to take place at our colleges and universities .
In the months before his death the issue he cared the most about was being against abortion , saying something like " if in a political discussion if you can't get that right I would n't trust you to get anything right " .
Which brings me to the chilling suspicion that someone thought when the founder of Twitter re-testified in Congress , that there would be a prospect of the end of shadow - banning and in consequence , some nefarious person feared Mike Adams ' could find success as a powerful , well - known abortion opponent on Twitter .
I 'd like to add some comforting generalities here to be kind , but what 's kind of preventing that is the feeling of being the private witness to a crime , as , like I said , I belong to the few among whom what they know just happens to indicate he did n't have any known motive to take his own life .

Well , if part of your credibility for accuracy 's going to go down in flames ( that is , at the only place where I wrote about it , above ) , I did it in the best possible way : defending a flawed but inspiring conservative being piled on by a horde of mendacious undeservedly - esteemed liberal pseudo - journalists .
There was no assassination , but had Mike Adams lived , his reputation would have undoubtedly been trashed and smeared even like President Clinton 's top admiral would have , who , as Rush Limbaugh reported at the time , had even less reason to commit suicide , though having done so , after being summoned by a journalist for questions about a medal on his uniform that turned out to be fully deservedly - earned .
Mike apparently had applied for his job with a mis-statement on his résumé for which he thought he'd be legally liable , having just agreed to leave his teaching post at a state university at age 55 for a settlement of $ 500,000 .
He may very well have made the mis-statement before he converted to Christianity and later " converted " to conservatism , but never having corrected it .
Maybe you 're wondering if you 've never heard of him , what his relationship is to mainstream conservatism .
I do n't remember what his opinion of Trump was , but Adams was the subject of a seven - year 's duration lawsuit that reached U.S. Federal Appeals Court .
You 've probably heard of his attorney , and friend , David French , who worked at National Review Online .
Peter Ka and 1990 's guy reported on him for us as being a pretty well - known anti-Trumper in Trump 's first run for office , prospectively competing against Trump in a candidacy that was a sort of centerpiece for the damage the neo-conservative movement did to itself in relation to the U.S. federal elections that year .
The self - account of the lawsuit represented by French ( who no longer lists his National Review Online experience on his Twitter bio ) shows him redeeming himself , at least in my eyes , as he rung up a defeat on behalf of a conservative client whose political philosophy he did n't entirely share , against a clique of insincere beneficiaries of academic freedom devoting themselves to stifling others with regard to the only academic freedoms having to do with the American Constitutional protections that matter as bearing a cost outside of equal opportunity : the freedom of political viewpoint .
David French noted Adams was n't a racist , but in his eulogy he seems to have unwittingly proved that to be understatement , though it was already known by his regular readers .
Sporadically , the North Carolinan resident wrote articles that put words in the mouths of his adversaries in an effort of presenting a reconstruction of what could be the quite plausible attitude motivating the dumbing - down of various educational standards at his college system that all - too apparently could be explained by cynical exploitation of blacks and other politically - distinct minorities .
He wrote with the realization that rather , accounts suggested the same to be molding their targets into loyal cliques to be used as political bludgeons all while slighting , if not exacting , the cost of the loss of providing them a fundamental mastery of the liberal arts that would help them succeed as citizens and / or in a chosen career field .
Opposing counsel used these fairly audacious reconstructions , always made in passing , of dialogues and descriptions that subsequent evidence of detrimental outcomes sadly confirmed that the motivating attitudes portrayed in them , as I said , were quite plausible , themselves in a cynical way .
They were gathered and read together and , without their context in open court , French reports Adams , whom he feared would speak too plainly of his unvarnished disdain for self - serving doctrinaires , " crumbled " in confidence to the point of low responsiveness as the " half - African - American ... jurors ' eyes narrowed " .
He had all at once faced the prospect of not only having mistakenly disappointed the jurors by being subject to the presentation of a scornful misrepresentation of his views , but , should he lose the case , even being " discredited as a vicious bigot " .
" Fortunately , we rallied , " wrote French , " The evidence was just too overwhelming .
When we caught his department chair contradicting her previous sworn testimony the jurors ’ eyes narrowed again , but this time their anger was directed at the defendants .
By the next day , the light was back in Mike ’s eyes .
The happy warrior had returned . "
I do n't have time to draw up a full picture of Mike 's contributions , and the loss he was facing before his demise , tonight , but I hope if you did a web search of his contributions to conservatism , you 'll be inclined to understand better when I tell you that representations of his being prejudicial to blacks and other politically - distinct minority groups themselves are components of commonly - used abusive ploys by liberal activists to present conservatives that way to hide their own complicity in actually only being that way themselves .

Donald J. Trump
Trump has a way of holding his head up with quiet dignity and foresightedness through this Covid fakery / Antifa / BLM activism period , but he 's gotta be thinking : " What a bunch of idiots . "
VargasMilan ( talk ) Tuesday , 01:56 , 28 July 2020 ( EDT )
Trump always plays his cards very close to his chest .
And , with the exception of the CCP bio attack , he already has contingencies in place .
His biggest mistakes happen when the media forces him to reveal a card he 's holding , which he does reluctantly and is usually combination of him tossing a bone to pacify them , tinged with a bit of pride and arrogance .
But no one has a record of being 2 or 3 years ahead of policy directions , if not 20 or 30 years as Trump does .
It goes unappreciated in an age of 30 second sound bytes that are forgotten in a day or two .
Trump is the anti-Nixon .
Nixon put a vision in place that maintained the peace and avoided nuclear war with the communists for 48 years under all administrations , Democrat and Republican .
Trump between 1986 and 1996 was already saying it was a mistake - it would kill American jobs and destroy " the middle class " ( to borrow a Marxist term ) .
Trump truly is a visionary as Nixon was , and will set the course for a division of the world for decades to come , as Nixon did , whether he or not he is recognized as the architect of the coming international structure of world peace .

Coronavirus , masks , medical vector , USA , Japan and East Asia
" Yet masking became almost universal , and though there is no proof it was a magic bullet , Japan ’s virus success indicates it had a serious impact .
The country has experienced only 7.68 deaths per million , compared with 385 per million for the United States . " [ 14 ]
" If you ’re wondering whether to wear or not to wear , consider this .
The day before yesterday , 21 people died of COVID - 19 in Japan .
In the United States , 2,129 died .
Comparing overall death rates for the two countries offers an even starker point of comparison with total U.S. deaths now at a staggering 76,032 and Japan ’s fatalities at 577 .
Japan ’s population is about 38 % of the U.S. , but even adjusting for population , the Japanese death rate is a mere 2 % of America ’s ...
If 80 % of a closed population were to don a mask , COVID - 19 infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one twelfth the number of infections — compared to a live - virus population in which no one wore masks . " [ 15 ]
" But in most democracies that have had the greatest success in fighting COVID - 19 , including South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , and Japan , mask - wearing is common practice . " [ 16 ]
" When Singapore and South Korea figured out that if as a medical provider you wash your damn hands before and after , without exception , every potential contact with an infected person or surface even if you did n't have a mask on for 30 minutes during casual conversations with others ( e.g. neither of you is hacking ) transmission to and between their medical providers stopped .

America 's Declaration of Independence speaks of " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " .
Donald Trump's # 1 priority is the custodian of American lives .
You can't have liberty or the pursuit of happiness in this world if you are dead .
Donald Trump failed on the coronavirus because the key to beating the coronavirus pandemic is prevention .
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure .
And Trump failed to promote masks and social distancing in public ( when it is possible to do so ) .
He did not lead from example or stress the importance of these two things .
It is true that Trump did well on the economic liberty front ( lower taxes , enterprise zones in cities , less unnecessary regulation ) , the educational liberty front ( school choice ) , the prison reform front and the religious liberty front .
It is also true that in terms of liberty and " pursuit of happiness "
Trump does oppose political correctness which is stiflying free speech .
On the other hand , if you fail on your # 1 priority which is the protection of life , you may be voted out of office .
On top of this , the coronavirus has negative effect on the economy .
If Trump wins , it will be due to Biden faltering when the public has a better chance of seeing him such as the debates .
Or because you can't win the presidency by hiding from the spotlight , which Biden is doing .
A bunker strategy to keep you out of the limelight is unprecedented in American politics in terms of it lasting for an entire presidential campaign ( not sure about any presidential campaign which may have occurred during the Spanish flu ) .

I have some theories : 1 ) Many people do n't like the rioting and the defund the police idea .
2 ) The closer we get to the election , the more odd Joe Biden hiding in his basement during a pandemic will be .
It strengthens the charge that he is too frail / old to be president .
3 ) People are getting lockdown fatigue .
I am seeing more and more people be wearing mask scofflaws .
Mask fatigue is setting as many Americans tend to be independent freespirits .
I think people should wear masks in public , but many people are going to do what they are going to do despite what they are advised / told to do .
4 ) Joe Biden keeps being pushed to the left which hurts his appeal to moderates .
For example , many blue collar , Reagan Democrats type people do n't like Biden approving of much of the Green New Deal .
5 ) Some of the Bernie Sanders populists are getting mad at the Biden campaign and deciding to vote for Trump in the 2020 campaign .

Breaking : Maxwell 's then - teenage accused - victim claims Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper Gore went to Epstein 's 70 - acre island
Maxwell U.S. Court of Appeals petition : Vice - president Al Gore and his wife , Tipper , were also guests of Jeffrey Epstein on his island .
In a November 14 , 2016 deposition , Virginia Giuffre testified as per the court reporter 's notes : " Virginia disclosed that Mr. Clinton 's vice president Al Gore and his wife , Tipper , were also guests of Epstein on his island . "
Giuffre also denied in the same testimony earlier reporting phrases about her associations with Epstein attributed to her ; that is , phrases that looked like crude attempts by Maxwell 's counsel to make it seem like she had implicated President Trump as being both familiar to herself and approving of Epstein 's lifestyle .
RobS regalled us with Maxwell 's father being an interesting person , but her lawyer sounds like a real shyster , and that Maxwell is going to fight like a wildcat to try to shake the bad publicity surrounding her base career of pandering she apparently carried out over a greatly prolonged period in a stupefaction as a lurid personal pre-occupation and actually try to rehabilitate her reputation after her expected prison sentence .

So it looks like no one released the whole list on other news outlets .

It would be interesting to look at Al & Tipper 's divorce laid against a timeline of when this happened .
If memory serves right , Al was accused of sexual assault ( " you crazed little sex poodle " ) 30 days after the press release of their separation ( she knew it was coming ) .
Roger Stone is good source on this kind of dirt .
He says Epstein & Maxwell basically were free - lancers , working alternatively for various clients , such as Mossad , CIA , etc or even private clients to set honeytraps , frame , and blackmail people .
Some of it they probably even did on their own .

The Gore divorce was effectively covered up .
The escapades evidently occurred sometime before the announcement .
Then came the announcement of the divorce .
Then the announcement of sexual assault charges .
An orderly process .
Now , more than a decade later , I do n't ever recall hearing how it was settled .
Tipper actually was the money in the family .
She had $ 350 million .
He did n't have half of that when they came out of he White House .
She probably did n't want to pay his blackmail money .
And the divorce likely was n't pathological ; it may have never occurred if she had been First Lady at the time .
But Bush v. Gore allowed them vacation time at Little Saint James ( the airstrip was at Big Saint James ) .

I was about to report here that the mob was reported to be assualting the Portland federal building in hopes of destroying criminal records and enlisting convicts as mercenaries for their cause .
Instead they played right into Trump 's hands , and the worst offenders got stuck like flypaper there without realizing they were now committing federal crimes .
Meanwhile the federal non-Defense Department military inside were n't trapped , but pretty much just clocking in each day helping effect the arrests !

This was the testimony made - up from whole cloth reported by Ann Coulter that Maxwell 's shyster lawyer placed in Guiffre 's mouth : " Donald Trump was aiso a good friend of Jeffreys .
He did n't partake in sex with any of us but he flirted with me .
He 'd laugh and tell Jeffrey , ' You 've got the life . ' "
This was Guiffre 's testimony :

[ That turned out to be hearsay from Jeffrey Epstein .

My take [ in hopes to develop a narrative ] .
Epstein owned a condo at Mar-e - Lago , his onshore residence when not at Little St. James .
Epstein used the Mar-e - Lago condo for two purpose : ( 1 ) to consort with new powerful , influential blackmail prospects , perhaps even Trump himself , for which if successful , Epstein could end up owning a portion of Mar -e - Lago ; also as a rendezvous point for existing blackmail clients to hop on the Lolita Express for a trip to Fantasy Island .
And ( 2 ) recruitment of new girls , such as Giuffre .
When Trump found out about Epstein recruiting Giuffre out of Mar-e - Lago , he banned Epstein from the complex ( and likely refunded his money ) .
Trump then needed to protect both his personnel reputation and the business reputation of Mar-e - Lago ( we know had had presidential aspirations at this time as well ) .
His relation with Epstein changed at this point , c. 2008 .
We know he flew on the Lolita Express once , which likely can be explained as part of the business relationship before 2008 when he sold Epstein the condo .
After Epstein 's conviction and Giuffre 's initial allegations , Trump turned the relationship around to use to his advantage : he knew about the suspicions of Bill Clinton ( which likely could even be the source of Roger Stone 's extensive documentation in the 2015 book , Clinton 's War on Women ) .
Trump knew the Mueller FBI and local authorities did nothing , i.e. Deep State corruption , for the rape of his former 15 year old employee .
These events likely gave Trump further impetus to run for president ( it also explains stiff opposition from the " establishment " , i.e. Epstein 's blackmail clients ) .
The attorney for Giuffre and other victims says Trump was the only one willing to help with information , cause the local authorities , feds , and media refused to investigate .
To me it appears that while Trump had long standing ambitions to run for president , what happened to Giuffre affected him personally and threatened his business , and had a huge impact on his determination to strike back at the corrupt establishment and its facilitators .
He knew this corruption went well beyond the President of the United States Bill Clinton , his apologists and defenders in media , Hollywood , and the elite donor class .
When the final bios are written a decade from now , I believe you 'll see the recruitment and rape of a 15 year old employee of his by a confidential informant of Robert Mueller brought a sense of outrage and responsibility out of him to stand up do what he could to make things right .

Trump 's polling :
We 've seen it all before
Trump is now at 42 percent favorable and 56 percent unfavorable .
That 's a net favorability of - 14 , which sounds horrible .
But on July 29 , 2016 , Trump was at - 25 percent . [ 22 ]
Given what happened in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries , there is reason to believe that the polls dramatically overstate the actual level of support that Biden enjoys .

Chile ( talk ) 15:22 , 2 August 2020 ( EDT )
Events in Chile seem to be anticipating those in the US .
Chile was a prosperous , stable democracy until protests started in October .
A million people came out to protest a subway fare hike , 5 percent of the entire population .
One hundred and twenty Walmarts were burned and looted . [ 23 ]
All this was triggered by a 3 percent fare increase !
Attention soon shifted from Santiago subway fares to the Chilean constitution .
A constitutional referendum is scheduled for October .
The current constitution is supposedly tainted by the fact that it was issued in by a military government back in 1980 , much as ours is supposedly tainted by slavery .
But the Chilean constitution is apparently not that difficult to amend .
In fact , it has been amended over 30 times since 1980 .
The militaristic provisions were removed long ago .
Pinochet 's two - party system has been replaced by proportional representation .
One remaining objection is that there are some supermajority requirements to protect the free market economy .
Like the left in Chile , the Obama is using the riots to push a proposal to eliminate the filibuster , American 's version of a supermajority requirement .
PeterKa ( talk ) 04:12 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
The next steps after eliminating the filibuster and lowering the voting age is assassination of Supreme Court Justices .
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 16:57 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
Yes , the events are very similar and the " indigenist " cause will be spread on the US as well .-- Capitalist .
Chile ( talk ) 18:30 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT ) U.S. Senator John McCain became a liberal hero in 2005 by joining the Gang of 14 in order to save the filibuster .
Think of the amazing double funeral he got .
Now he'd be just another " Jim Crow relic . "
In short , Obama reversed an entrenched position of the Democratic Party just by flinging out a nonsensical Jim Crow reference .
Why would Chile 's protests anticipate those of the U.S ?
Is Venezuela , Soros , or whoever using Chile as a testing ground ?

In America we 'd call them mestizos or mulattos ( the Yellow Rose of Texas incidentally was a mulatta ) .
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 01:58 , 4 August 2020 ( EDT )
Taos , New Mexico incidentally had a slave market long before whites ever showed up .
Mestizos , or half Spanish half Indian , were n't wanted by either tribe and were sold to both .
Kidnappings were common to bring them to market .
So slavery was n't invented by whites , it was n't confined to blacks , and it was Angelo takeover of the Spanish Empire that put a stop to it .
But try and tell that to some punk kid today or communist public school teacher and see what happens .

That 's a problem with Democrat identity politics ; Latinos are Conquistadors - they never were slaves .
Yet Democrats want them to forget their heritage and become part of the oppressed masses .
The only basis for this is an appeal to them as victims of anti-Catholicism , which the atheist Marxists promoting this hate and division are themselves some of the biggest offenders .
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 12:33 , 4 August 2020 ( EDT ) By Latino , I assume you mean central and south American hispanics .
The social history of the region is fascinating because of the intermarriage of many indigenous people with the colonists , Spanish and Portuguese .
In many countries , there was also intermarriage with slaves .
Bottom line : south and central American hispanics are not the same as Spanish .
As for the Catholicism thing , maybe User : Conservative can correct me but the biggest growth in Latin America is among evangelicals and has been for decades Rafael ( talk ) 18:09 , 5 August 2020 ( EDT )

What determines whether a claim to some property ( in the broadest sense ) is a natural right ?
I have a working theory that I use , that I have n't examined in a while .
Like me , you 've probably reversed a political opinion you 've once held , like I did about world government .
I did n't know that the United Nations was first chaired by the American communist infiltrator , Alger Hiss .
I learned that when Conservative ( the user ) featured the Alger Hiss article on Main Page Left .
Well , when I first advanced the theory 29 years ago on a discussion board , I was shouted down and scorned .
Later , I used it once on a different discussion board to solve a political puzzle someone had posed but without mentioning it in the form of a proposition .
He was n't sure I had the right answer , but he was very surprised , left and never came back !
Conservatives maintain strongly natural rights come from God not distributed out by a government , but how do we determine what is a natural right ?
VargasMilan ( talk ) Monday , 18:29 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
Hiss did n't just chair the meeting , he authored the UN Charter , which is still the basis of much international law - written by a Stalinist .
Property is basically an extension of one 's labor .
For example , a person who builds their own log cabin home .
They cut the trees , haul the wood , lumber it , and nail it together .
A person who burns down the home did n't just destroy property , they stole time or years of life of the builder .
The crime is equal to , or worse than , enslavement , approaching murder ( the thief cometh to kill and destroy ) .
In a monied society , currency represents the labor of workers .
Inflation steals their labor and transfers it to others .
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 18:48 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
Let 's talk about the labor theory and then get back to the other threads you started .
Yahoo !
had a news service that treated conservatives abusively and consequently through their efforts earned about a million dollars in ill - will by the public .
It was an extension of labor , but do we have a natural right to ill - will that the government should take positive steps to help everybody attain ?
VargasMilan ( talk ) Monday , 19:04 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
( ec ) Walter O. Williams says ' slavery is a moral crime because it interferes with property rights ' .
What are those property rights ?
To labor to feed yourself , through working the land or by barter and exchange , not by theft .
These are natural rights .
Trade unionists back in the day often said , " everybody has a right to eat " ; Marxists today claim " healthcare is a right " .
Food and healthcare are produced by labor .
Nobody has the right to another person 's labor ( or property , the same thing ) .
That is a violation of natural rights .
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 19:11 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
In the illustration of the builder of the log cabin , let 's say it took 2 years of extensive labor to build it .
Then another 2 years to replace it .
That 's a loss of four years enjoyment of the fruit of his labor .
He could have easily spent the 2 years or 4 years in some otter pursuit that maybe gave him more enjoyment or profit .
Would 8 or 12 years of equal value compensation satisfy the debt of loss to his life ?
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 19:25 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
You are talking about the right of compensation for opportunity cost , am I correct ?

Yes , that 's one way of stating ot .
RobSTrump 2Q2Q 20:11 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
Everyone knows Lincoln started the Gettysburg Address with " Four score and seven years ago " , a pretty exact number since the founding of the nation , almost as though as he were conveying impatience .
VargasMilan ( talk ) Monday , 20:14 , 3 August 2020 ( EDT )
( ec ) Let 's say the victim is age 40 at the time of settlement , with a remaining 38 years life expectancy .
Let 's say he 's doubled his compensation of 8 years .
The settlement does n't really compensate for the portion of his life he has to enjoy the fruit of his labor , neither does it take into consideration the decades it took him to acquire the skills .
In sum , the point I am really making is the violation of natural rights , be it theft , arson , or even excess taxation , is no small matter that has a huge , unfair impact on the life of the victim that 's almost incalculable .
We live in society today where governments , political parties , ideologies , and the educational systems venerates impingement on natural rights - the simple basic human right to labor and feed oneself without stealing or violating other people 's natural rights .

Ha-ha Rob , Rob do n't you know the difference between per se and per accidere ?
They just did n't want anyone lingering or dawdling in the supermarket .
It reminds me of that opera , though : The Useless Precaution .
Maybe you remember when a New York City mayor issued orders restricting the size of Big Gulp soda drinks sold at convenience stores .
The hue and cry was on every conservative radio and TV talk show and editorial column .
But the government has always been making those exceptions if you can extrapolate from two data points .
Did you know who was the first person to try to regulate the food of New Yorkers ?
It was Thomas Jefferson .
Government established among men to secure " Life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " Jefferson ?
Yes , and I can prove it .
1807 : Blood was soon shed , but Jefferson did not shrink .
The new army was stationed along the Canada frontier .
The gunboats and frigates patrolled the coast .
On every side dangers and difficulties accumulated .
" I did not expect a crop of so sudden and rank growth of fraud and open opposition by force could have grown up in the United States . "
At Newburyport an armed mob on the wharf prevented the custom - house officers from detaining a vessel about to sail .
The collectors and other officers were ill - disposed , or were harassed by suits at law for illegal detentions .
Rebellion and disunion stared Jefferson in the face , but only caused him to challenge an outbreak and to invite violence .
" That the Federalists may attempt insurrection is possible , " he wrote to Gallatin , " and also that the governor would sink before it ; but the Republican part of the State , and that portion of the Federalists who approve the embargo in their judgments , and at any rate would not court mob law , would crush it in embryo .
I have some time ago written to General Dearborn to be on the alert on such an occasion , and to take direction of the public authority on the spot .
Such an incident will rally the whole body of Republicans of every shade to a single point , —that of supporting the public authority . "
The Federalists knew when to rebel .
Jefferson could teach them little on that subject .
They meant first to overthrow Jefferson himself , and were in a fair way to gratify their wish ; for the people of New England — Republican and Federalist alike — were rapidly rallying to common hatred of the President .
As winter approached , the struggle between Jefferson and Massachusetts became on both sides vindictive .
He put whole communities under his ban .
He stopped the voyage of every vessel " in which any person is concerned , either in interest or in navigating her , who has ever been concerned in interest or in the navigation of a vessel which has at any time before entered a foreign port contrary to the views of the embargo laws , and under any pretended distress or duress whatever . "
When a permit was asked for the schooner Caroline of Buckstown on the Penobscot , Jefferson replied , —
" This is the first time that the character of the place has been brought under consideration as an objection .
Yet a general disobedience to the laws in any place must have weight toward refusing to give them any facilities to evade .
In such a case we may fairly require positive proof that the individual of a town tainted with a general spirit of disobedience has never said or done anything himself to countenance that spirit . "
Jefferson went still further in his reply to a petition from the island of Nantucket for food .
" Our opinion here is that that place has been so deeply concerned in smuggling , that if it wants it is because it has illegally sent away what it ought to have retained for its own consumption . "
Of all the old Republican arguments for a policy of peace , the commonest was that a standing army would be dangerous , not to foreign enemies , but to popular liberties ; yet the f

Compiz feature branch compiz ++
Hi , I 've currently pushed a new branch called " compiz + + " to the freedesktop repository , with some features I 've been working on during last months .
Because most of the features also require ( BIG ) changes to the plugins , I 've decided to put them all together .
-
No direct access to member variables : Everything is now done with getter and setter functions .
This helps with the problem where every variable addition broke the plugin ABI .
While this usually is not a problem in the development tree , we can not do it in a stable tree .
Even if it is needed to fix a bug .
It also gives us more control what other plugins can do , so that broken plugins can not mess up our core structures .
- Composite / OpenGL seperation : All XComposite handling is moved into the composite plugin and the opengl rendering into the opengl plugin .
This allows compiz to run also as normal window manager without compositing ( still needs some work and a few new plugins ) , but also the creation of other rendering backends ( XRender , clutter , ... ) . - Tiled textures : Modifications to the texture system allow to have more than one texture per pixmap and also to have other plugins that provide texture from pixmap functionality .
The new copytex uses the ( slow ) " copy pixmap content to texture " approach to provide texture from pixmap functionality .
It 's main advantage is that it supports pixmaps bigger than the maximum texture size .
In this cases a pixmap is split into multiple textures .
Compiz will use the glx texture - from - pixmap extension for pixmaps / windows but will fall back to the copytex plugin if thex are bigger than the maximum texture size .
- Reparented decorations :
Like other window managers , compiz now supports reparented window decorations .
This will allow compiz to run as a normal window manager and to be able to have decorations for windows that are bigger than the maximum texture size ( copytex plugin ) .
( Currently only implemented in the kde4 - window - decorator ) - Dropped multi display and multi screen support *:
The multi display support is not completed , and the multi screen support is almost unmaintainded .
Additionally , our normal proposal for bugs in the multi screen support is to start one compiz instance per screen .
Dropping multi-screen support has the additional benifits of : -- Per screen plugin lists ( e.g. cube on one screen and wall on the other ) -- Rendering of one screen can not block the rendering of the other screen -- Different libGL per screen ( with LD_PRELOAD ) -- Simplier plugins -- Simplier option handling - New plugin interface :
The compiz WRAP / UNWRAP interface is perhaps the most efficient system to create a plugin funcion " call chain " , but it is not the the best for compiz .
In compiz we have a lot of plugins loaded that hook into the drawing functions , but do nothing most of the time .
Only when activated ( keybinding / dbus / event ) do they usually draw something .
The end result is that most functions get called , then the plugin checks if it is active .
The plugin then calls the function of the next plugin in the call chain .
The following plugin repeats the cycle .
I 've measured that we are loosing 8 - 15 % of CPU time here .
The new system allows plugins to dynamically disable " wrapped " functions if they are not needed .
The core then only needs to check some boolean variables , and will only call the functions that are really in use .
I 've kept the word " wrapping " in the system so that every compiz developer knows what it does , even if it does not fit the new system well .
- CMake build system : Everyone is happy if the build system ( autotools ) works , but starts to cry if it does n't .
At least that is my impression after more than 2 years of compiz development .
In compiz fusion we have already decided to switch to cmake after the next stable release ( 0.8 ) , and we also provided cmake tarballs for a while .
CMake provides a real great documentation , and in my opinion it is much easier than autotools .
- Port to C++ : With C we have to write almost the same code in each plugin and run into the same bugs over and over again .
A lot of this can be avoided with C++. C++ allows us also to do more and this in a easier way : -- Smarter function callbacks with Boost ( boost : : function / boost : : bind ) -- Easier and smarter privates system ( get the plugin struct for a given core struct / old FOO_SCREEN ( s ) , FOO_WINDOW ( w ) macros ) .
The new system hides most of the ugly handling from a plugin developer and provides a new simple and ABI safe way to work with plugin plugins ( plugins that expose features / functionality to other plugins ) -- Constructors / Destructors allow easier initialisation / cleanup for a lot of systems .
--
Containers avoid the implementation of lists and resizeable arrays over and over again .
--
Containers like maps and other smart classes can improve performance in several areas . -- ...
This branch is my proposal for a possible compiz future .
The decision to make this the future of compiz is something that everyone involved in compiz should make .
Espesially because it would need a huge amount of work to get all plugins ported .
In my opinion , it would be better to stay with the old system if such change would create a fork again .
I 've also pushed compiz ++ branches into the libcompizconfig , bcop and crashhandler repositories .
They contain some initial work for the compiz ++ branch .
The crashhandler branch also contains a modified ( not finished ) version of the universal Makefile .

Every driver is probably thinking the same thing :
Is there a suicide bomber in this jam ?
Security has improved in Baghdad , but it remains one of the world 's most dangerous cities .
Daily bombings and drive - by shootings traumatise its residents .
An Iraqi member of BBC 's staff describes his daily journey to work - anything but a mundane affair .
His identity has been protected for his own safety .
COMMUTER PREPARATIONS
Here 's an interesting new disorder for medical science to investigate : Baghdadophobia - an Iraqi 's fear of his own capital city .
Other phobias are common enough - fear of flying , fear of spiders - but Baghdadophobia has reached pandemic proportions , afflicting virtually every Iraqi , including the writer of these lines .
And I think my fear is justified .
I start my day by taking a bath and praying .
I listen to the news while I have my breakfast , then I get dressed for work , and always kiss my wife and my children before leaving the house - everyone here does the same these days , because everyone knows when they leave home that they may not return .
Death lurks around every corner , and nobody is immune .
Almost all the victims are innocent bystanders who wrongly think that because they are n't in the government or military their chances of survival are greater .
So we steer clear of areas that are out - of - bounds because of our ethnicity or religion .
We do n't express opinions in public beyond criticising our wives ' cooking or the nosiness of our mothers - in - law .
Leaving the house , the first thing I do is check beneath my car and the inside , in case someone stuck a magnetic bomb underneath it - an easy - to - use weapon used frequently in Iraq lately .
I start the engine and drive off , and the whole road seems fraught with danger .
Was that my neighbour 's car that just set off behind me ?
No .
Who does it belong to ?
Am I being followed ?
Maybe I should slow down or pull over , just in case .
Thank God , the driver passes by , continuing his journey until he's out of sight , probably as afraid of me as I was of him .
I start driving again .
SCARY ROAD USERS
Car bombs caused havoc and despite a relative lull they still create terror
The road is very busy , bumper to bumper .
Suddenly , a convoy of four - wheel - drive vehicles - the kind used by Iraqi officials - swerves madly through the traffic , sirens blaring , and a voice from a loudspeaker telling drivers to get out of the way .
Automatic weapons bristle from the jeep windows .
Everyone panics , the road is total chaos until the convoy disappears .
Before long , I 'm stuck in a traffic jam stretching for more than a kilometre .
It moves just a few metres at a time , backed up from the entrance to a bridge across the Tigris that I have to cross daily to get to work .
Iraqi soldiers scan the waiting vehicles with an explosives detection device that looks like a weapon used by aliens in low - budget sci- fi films .
I 'm still in the back of the traffic jam .
I 'm trying to kill time by studying the faces of other drivers .
This driver beside me looks a lot like my mental image of a suicide bomber : long beard , nervous glances .
But the truth is no - one knows what a suicide bomber looks like today - he could be an old man or a woman .
Or he could be driving a wired - up car with a woman and a child on board just for camouflage .
The driver of that luxury car seems to be a government official .
It may be safer to stay as far away as possible from him .
Someone might have put a bomb in his car which he is not aware of and it could explode at any minute .
I recall that many government officials have been assassinated this way recently .
That truck over there , with " highly flammable material " written on it What a disaster if it were to explode !
The driver behind me is becoming increasingly impatient ; he 's started blowing his car horn in a desperate attempt to get the attention of the traffic policemen who are only making things worse .
IMAGINING DEATH
It could happen at any time , and the most likely to suffer are ordinary families
Sometimes we can't hide our feelings .
But we 've learned to hide our fear in public - we pretend to be braver than we are , so that people do n't make fun of us .
But I am certain that everyone here , in this traffic jam from hell , is to some extent , afraid , just like me .
In just the blink of an eye , my whole life will have ended for nothing .
Hot shrapnel will hit me , I suppose , and I wonder if I will even hear the explosion .
I wonder what it would be like for bullets to tear through my body .
Every day this is how the living imagine the way in which they will die .
And being blown up is only one of a long , long list .
Suddenly , my car shakes as there is a horrible blast somewhere else in the city .
I wonder if the victims of that explosion had the same thoughts as mine .
Did they imagine that they might die today ?
Did they have a chance to say goodbye to their families ?
LONG , TERRIFYING JOURNEY
I think of the other threats to the commuter in downtown Baghdad .
A box , a trash bin , an animal cart parked on the side of the road , a mentally ill person crossing the street , or even a stray dog , every one of these could have been wired with a bomb waiting to explode spontaneously or by a remote control .
Everything is unknown , everything is anonymous - the killer , the victim , and the means of the murder .
That broken - down car , why is it parked here ?
Where is the owner of that motorcycle ?
God knows how much I fear motorbikes , especially the fast ones , with two riders .
One of them drives the motorbike and the other one fires from a pistol equipped with a silencer .
The memory of the remains of the university professor assassinated by shots to the head in precisely this way will never leave me .
And it 's not just our own killers we have to be careful of .
I fear that my children will be orphaned when a US military convoy passes by .
A US convoy is one of the most terrifying things you can run in to on the streets of Baghdad today .
The driver next to me acted selfishly , not allowing me to get out of the way of the convoy .
The convoy guards have a reputation for not hesitating one second before shooting at anything in their way .
In peace time , my journey to work would take 15 minutes .
Today , it takes an hour and a half .
Once I 'm at the office , I start the day with a cup of heavy black coffee .
And two aspirin .

We knew Lindsay Lohan 's rant yesterday would n't be the last we'd hear of her Facebook tribulations .
Lohan wagged a finger at Facebook ( on MySpace , no less ) after discovering her account had been disabled .
She publicly chastised the company for erroneously deleting her real account instead of one of the many Lohan fakers on the social network .
The hurdle is not uncommon for celebrities , who regularly have competition to secure their online identities on every new social networking service that rolls around .
But it was n't a case of mistaken identity this time .
" Her claim was an incorrect assumption of the issue , " Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said in an e-mail .
" We 've explained the actual issue to her and it has been resolved . "
So , what was the actual issue ?
" We do n't comment on the details of individual users , including their interactions with us , without their consent , " Schnitt wrote .
Darn !
But wait !
" However , since she has made her account status public , I can tell you that the actions taken were to enforce our terms of service and not a mistake , " Schnitt said in an e-mail .
" We 've since been in touch with Ms. Lohan and the issue has been resolved . "
What section of Facebook 's 13 - page TOS could Lohan be guilty of violating ?
Facebook would n't say , and Lohan was n't available for comment .
But Lohan did write on her MySpace blog that she was operating under a fake name .
( Reports say she was using the alias Lindsay Ronson -- taking the surname of her companion Samantha Ronson . )
Under the " user conduct " section of the TOS , one clause prohibits impersonating " any person or entity " -- a situation of which Lohan is often the victim .
But on the same line , it says that as a user you may not " falsely state or otherwise misrepresent yourself . "
So , her last name is n't really Ronson .
I wonder if maybe ... whoops !
After a long day of social network mudslinging , all seems to be well in Lohan land .
The Lindsay Ronson profile appears to be back in action -- along with about 14 others with similar account names and pictures of Lohan .
Yup , every thing has been straightened out , all right .

Cannabis was downgraded to Class C under Tony Blair Peers have voted to support government plans to upgrade cannabis from a class C to a class B drug .
The change is due to come into force in January , reversing Tony Blair 's 2004 downgrading , and raising a maximum jail sentence for possession to five years .
This is despite the Council on the Misuse of Drugs ' recommendation that cannabis should remain a class C drug .
The House of Lords voted by a majority of 52 against an amendment which would have overturned the government 's plans .
The government says the mental health risks of cannabis , particularly stronger varieties such as " skunk " , mean it should return to class B. Opponents say this is unnecessary and could even increase use .
' Alcohol more dangerous ' Crossbencher Baroness Meacher 's amendment had been backed by the Liberal Democrats , but opposed by the other two main parties .
If peers had voted in favour of her proposal it would have postponed a decision on the drug for two years , pending another review by the advisory council .
During the debate , Lady Meacher , chairman of the East London and City Mental Health Trust , said : " We all know that alcohol is far more dangerous than cannabis .
SKUNK
So called because it has a very strong smell
Three times stronger than other types of cannabis Contains much higher levels of the active ingredient - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
Now accounts for between 70 and 80 % of samples seized by police Six years ago it accounted for 15 % of samples
Head - to - head : drug laws
Are voters getting drugs message ?
" Alcohol abuse leads to violence , suicide , liver cirrhosis , mental illness , dependence , addiction and lasting effects on the foetus .
" In marked contrast , the only possible - possible - health effect of cannabis referred to in the government 's statement on reclassification is the possible causal link with schizophrenia . "
But Home Office minister Lord West said the reclassification was " to protect the public " , especially young people .
He said cannabis use had fallen to its lowest level for 10 years and it was " crucial this trend continues " , as there was " clear evidence that it can produce physical harms as well as medium to long - term mental health harms " .
Peers rejected Lady Meacher 's amendment by 116 votes to 64 .
' Protect the young '
Afterwards , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : " This is the next step towards toughening up our enforcement response - to ensure that repeat offenders know that we are serious about tackling the danger that the drug poses to individuals and in turn communities .
We need to act now to protect future generations . "
Ms Smith said in June that cannabis should return to class B because of " uncertainty " over its impact on mental health .
This would lift the maximum prison sentence for possession from two years to five years .
The government 's reclassification order was made in October and is due to come into force on 26 January .
A letter to the Guardian newspaper on Tuesday , signed by former government chief scientific advisers David King and Lord Robert May , said the drugs classification system must be " credible " and that changing it again would give an " ambiguous message " .
In its report , Cannabis : Classification And Public Health , the advisory council described cannabis as a " significant public health issue " .
But it said it should still remain a class C drug , as the risks were not as serious as those of class B substances , such as amphetamines and barbiturates .
The report said the evidence suggested a " probable , but weak , causal link between psychotic illness , including schizophrenia , and cannabis use " .
However , in the population as a whole , it played only a " modest role " in the development of these conditions .

OMG .
Literally .
Check out this baby preaching the “ word of the lord ” on stage .
Funny and freaking disturbing all at the same time .
We found it on Godtube .
This kid is a Billy Graham in the making .
Mrs Clinton seems poised to serve under her former presidential rival Hillary Clinton will agree to serve as secretary of state in US President - elect Barack Obama 's cabinet , the New York Times has reported .
The paper quotes two " confidants " as saying Mrs Clinton has decided to quit her Senate position for the job .
Mrs Clinton 's office says discussions are " very much on track " but says further reports are premature .
But correspondents say some kind of deal between the two former political rivals seems far advanced .
The latest report comes after days of speculation on Mrs Clinton 's prospects .
KEY APPOINTMENTS
Chief of staff : Rahm Emanuel , a deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton Senior advisers : David Axelrod , Valerie Jarrett , Peter Rouse and John Podesta ( formerly chief of staff to Bill Clinton ) Press secretary : Robert Gibbs White House counsel : Greg Craig , formerly special counsel to Bill Clinton Vice - president 's chief of staff : Ron Klain , formerly chief of staff to Al Gore Staff secretary : Lisa Brown , formerly counsel to Al Gore
Obama 's team so far The BBC's Kim Ghattas , in Washington , says if Mr Obama did not want those stories out there - because he was not thinking of Mrs Clinton for the job - someone from his team would have already been scotching the reports .
Reports also suggest Mr Obama is likely to pick former presidential candidate and New Mexico Gov Bill Richardson as commerce secretary .
And Timothy Geithner , president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , is expected to be nominated to the post of US Treasury secretary .
American stock markets reacted positively to the reports about Mr Geithner , with the Dow Jones index rising by more than 6 % .
Reports ' premature ' Philippe Reines , a senior advisor to Mrs Clinton , told the BBC it would be premature to say Mrs Clinton had accepted the position .
" We 're still in discussions , which are very much on track .
Any reports beyond that are premature . "
But unnamed officials in the Obama and Clinton camps said they had every reason to believe Mr Obama would announce her as his choice , the Associated Press reports .
Mrs Clinton , who was First Lady when her husband Bill served as president from 1993 to 2001 , lost a close race against Mr Obama for the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination .
If she is appointed secretary of state ( foreign minister ) , she will have to step down as a senator for New York .
She would succeed Condoleezza Rice , who has had the job for the past four years under President Bush .
To date , the most senior appointment made by Mr Obama , who succeeds President Bush in January , is Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff .
He is expected to announce a round of appointments after the Thanksgiving holiday next Thursday .

UPDATE 9:45 am : Ed Shurna , Executive Director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless , is quoted today in the Chi-Town Daily News :
“ They should take those signs down and find a way to take care of people , not punish people .
These are people who are cold , these are people who are poor , these are people who are suffering already .
Why slap them in the face ? ”
____
Ten days ago when I first blogged in these pages and on Huffington Post Chicago about what looked like a crackdown on homeless riders by the Chicago Transit Authority , I could not have hoped for the citywide surge of interest in the welfare of the transit agency ’s least fortunate riders that continues to coalesce .
Yesterday , I was invited to discuss the issue on two of Chicago ’s most important radio programs : WBEZ 91.5 Chicago Public Radio ’s Eight Forty - Eight morning show with Richard Steele ; and WVON 1690 - AM ’s late - afternoon Cliff Kelley Show .
( How I managed to run between WBEZ ’s Navy Pier studio and WVON ’s digs at 87th and Cottage Grove in little more than an hour while taking a number 87 bus the wrong way across the South Side is another story in itself . )
You can hear my Eight Forty - Eight interview with fellow former New Yorker Richard Steele in its entirety over the air on today ’s show ( airing at 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. ) , live - stream it at any time , or subscribe to the podcast .
As always , Cliff Kelley ’s show was live and there ’s no podcast option here , but suffice it to say I was honored to meet both beloved radio icons and gratified at their interest in the issue .
RECAP
And what an issue it is .
To recap for new viewers , just in time for the holiday season and the frigid Windy City temperatures that go with it , the CTA has implemented a seemingly grinch - inspired policy to eject homeless riders from the ‘ L ’ system .
New signs recently installed at rail terminals demand that riders exit the system and pay an additional fare before attempting to ride back in the other direction , an act called “ continuous riding ” by the transit agency .
Chicago homeless advocates have little doubt who the new policy is aimed at .
Regular CTA customers––Like Yours Truly– –know to expect a surge in overnight homeless riders during Chicago ’s harsh winter months .
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out who this ominous signage is aimed at .
THE CTA SPIN GAME
The new signs , pictured below , are currently installed at all 24 - hour rail terminals in the CTA system and at Midway Airport .
According to the CTA , these facilities have the highest numbers of continuous - riding “ violators ” , although the agency says it plans to install the signs at all ‘ L ’ terminals .
In a detailed written exchange with the CTA regarding the signs that I published on November 22nd , the CTA denied the signs are aimed at homeless riders , telling me , “ CTA does not make a distinction between homeless and any other fare paying customers . ”
Instead , the agency claims the signage was installed as a “ customer service reminder ” and that the continuous - riding ban applies equally to all riders .
However , when I noted that some CTA riders might have legitimate reasons for riding back from a terminal without exiting the system––for example , missing one ’s stop or simply deciding not to continue with one ’s trip– –the transit agency responded that station staff are advised to “ use their discretion ” to make an “ on - the - spot decision based on the circumstances of each customer ” before asking a rider to leave the system .
It ’s this case - by - case , discretionary application of a rule supposedly applying to all CTA customers equally that now has homeless advocates wondering who exactly the agency is trying to target with the new signs––and who will be singled out for expulsion from the ‘ L ’ system .
Shannon Moriarty , editor of the national homeless watchdog campaign at Change.org , is among those casting a doubtful eye at the continuous - riding ban .
“ If you ask me , there ’s no question that this message is intended for the city ’s homeless population , ” writes Moriarty .
“ Why else would someone continuously ride the trains unless they were without a home and in need of a place to stay warm ? ”
The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless ( CCH ) shares Moriarty ’s suspicion about the CTA ’s motives .
In response to the growing controversy , on Wednesday the organization publicly announced on its blog , “ CCH will track any efforts to crack down on homeless people riding the CTA . ”
OUT IN THE COLD WITH NOWHERE TO GO
Whether or not homeless riders are the explicit target of the continuous - riding ban , they stand to be the riders most impacted by it .
In its written response regarding the new signage , the CTA told me that riders to whom station staff chooses to apply the continuous - riding ban will be asked to leave the system immediately , potentially by law enforcement .
If such expulsions occur during even a typical Chicago winter , the implications are pretty dire .
Although the city ’s Department of Human Services ( DHS ) deploys late - night homeless - outreach teams across the CTA rail system , the transit agency currently specifies no provision for a DHS team to be contacted before a rider is ejected from the system .
Instead , under the current policy homeless riders can find themselves put out in the cold , in far - flung neighborhoods , with no care given to whether they have adequate means to make it back to warmth and shelter .
The stakes are particularly high for homeless riders who may be put off at the Red Line ’s northern Howard terminal .
The North Side ’s only emergency homeless shelter ( the REST facility at 5253 North Kenmore ) closed its doors on Monday ( December 1st ) after losing its lease , making a trip on foot to an emergency shelter an impossibility .
With no nearby shelter , an expulsion from the Howard terminal during the height of a Chicago winter could prove deadly for any homeless rider unlucky enough to be caught up in the CTA ’s continuous - riding crackdown .
“ What ’s the problem with having someone just sitting on a train ?
Shall we try to throw homeless people off … because we do n’t like the way they look or smell , or [ because ] they make us uncomfortable ? ” asks editor M. Leblanc on the widely read national feminist blog , Bitch Ph.D. “ If [ Chicago ] is concerned about the city ’s homeless riding on the trains all night , perhaps [ it ] should fund additional shelters instead of spending money on enforcement of a law that is unfair , cruel , and almost certain to be disproportionately applied . ”
A COMPASSIONATE WAY FORWARD
While it ’s clear that spending the night on Chicago ’s transit system is not a sustainable option for the city ’s homeless , opportunity exists for the CTA to update its continuous - riding policy to make it less cruel and more constructive .
New options could include having station staff contact DHS outreach teams and other agencies with the means to transport homeless riders to shelters with the capacity to take them , providing homeless riders with a pre-printed list of the nearest shelters and resources in the vicinity of each terminal , and guaranteeing that no homeless rider will be ejected from the ‘ L ’ system during life - threatening outside temperatures .
Unfortunately , the CTA remains silent on any alternatives to the current continuous - riding ban .
Until the agency comes up with something better , you can guess which blogger intends to keep a spotlight on the issue .
Just because some riders do n’t want to be reminded that they share this city with citizens less fortunate than themselves , the CTA does n’t have to cater to their cold - heartedness .
CTA President Ron Huberman should rescind the current continuous - riding policy and replace it with one that treats the homeless with the compassion and dignity all human beings deserve .
No matter where they ’ll be sleeping tonight .

The five accused 9/11 plotters said they want to plead guilty
Thirty - three relatives of people killed in the 9/11 attacks on the US have denounced the Guantanamo war crimes trials as illegitimate and unfair .
In a letter posted on a civil liberties website , the relatives say the military trials are politically motivated .
Pre -trial hearings began on Monday in Guantanamo for five prisoners charged with plotting the 9/11 attacks .
Other 9/11 relatives brought to the hearings by the Pentagon praised them as giving the accused a fair trial .
" Many of us do not believe these military commissions to be fair , in accordance with American values , or capable of achieving the justice that 9/11 family members and all Americans deserve , " says the statement posted on the website of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
" These prosecutions have been politically motivated from the start , are designed to ensure quick convictions at the expense of due process and transparency , and are structured to prevent the revelation of abusive interrogations and torture engaged in by the US government . "
CHARGES
Conspiracy , murder in violation of the law of war , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury , destruction of property in violation of the law of war , terrorism and providing material support for terrorism Hijacking or hazarding a vessel ( except Mustafa al - Hawsawi )
Obama 's Guantanamo dilemma ' Extraordinary day ' Q&A : Military tribunals
The statement continues : " No comfort or closure can come from military commissions that ignore the rule of law and stain America 's reputation at home and abroad . "
Nearly 3,000 people were killed on 11 September 2001 when four planes were hijacked and crashed into New York City 's World Trade Center , the Pentagon and a farm field in Pennsylvania .
Alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants said they wanted to plead guilty at Monday 's pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo Bay .
He said they would postpone their pleas until an investigation to determine whether two of the defendants are mentally competent to stand trial is complete .
The five men face death sentences if convicted .
No trial date has been set and there seems little chance that one will begin before President - elect Barack Obama takes office in January .
He has said he is opposed to the military tribunals and has pledged to close down the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay .

Global Clean Tech Investments Reach Record High
December 22nd , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
It is hard to boot up the computer or turn on the television without hearing about the recession , credit crisis , budget deficits , and unemployment rates .
Amazingly , venture capital investment in the clean tech sector reached new levels over the first three quarters of 2008 .
Ernst & Young ’s recent analysis of activity in the United States , China , Europe , and Israel using data from Dow Jones VentureSource shows such investment to be at $ 4.6 billion .
This is an impressive 83 % increase from the first three quarters of 2007 .
The United States is a main driver , with $ 3.3 billion of investments during this period , of which $ 1.7 billion went to the solar energy sector .
European investment reached $ 481 million Euros , with wind energy as the leading recipient .
China ’s investments grew 567 % over the same period in 2007 .
The solar energy sector was the largest recipient with $ 85 million .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
A SENIOR Hamas official , Ahmed Yousef , has declared that the organisation is already re-arming itself and that international efforts to stop the smuggling of weapons into the Gaza Strip would fail .
In an interview with he Herald , Dr Yousef , a senior adviser to Hamas 's Prime Minister , Ismail Haniyeh , said attempts at a peaceful resolution to the Israel - Palestinian conflict were pointless .
" I 'm gonna tell you that as long as there is occupation and there is a struggle , we will find our way to have more advanced weapons to defend ourselves , " Dr Yousef said .
" Of course we are bringing in weapons because occupation and suffering , this is the equation , and that means the struggle will continue and the Palestinians will find their own way to defend themselves and how to make the enemy bleed . "
Dr Yousef , who is considered a moderate face of Hamas , declared Israel 's three - week assault on the Gaza Strip a victory for Hamas because it showed that military force cannot destroy the Palestinian people 's desire for an independent state .
Tzipi Livni went to Cairo at the invitation of Egypt 's government Israeli leaders have issued stern warnings to Palestinian militant group Hamas to stop rocket attacks on Israel .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he would not hesitate to strike Hamas and another militant group , Islamic Jihad , in the Gaza Strip .
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni warned Israel " cannot tolerate " Palestinian militants targeting Israeli citizens .
Some 50 rockets have been launched from Gaza in recent days , after the killing of three Hamas members by Israel .
A six - month ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas ended last week .
' Enough is enough ' Speaking after talks with the Egyptian leadership in Cairo on the failed ceasefire in Gaza , Ms Livni described the latest escalation as " unbearable " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Hamas needs to understand that our aspiration to live in peace does n't mean that Israel is going to take this kind of situation any longer .
Enough is enough , " she said .
The BBC's Christian Fraser says some will see the visit as the first of several diplomatic steps Israel must take before launching military action .
Mr Olmert called on residents of Gaza to stop militants " firing on innocent civilians " , in an interview with the Arab television station Al - Arabiya .
" I say to you in a last - minute call , stop it , " Mr Olmert said , Israeli media reported .
" Do n't let Hamas , which is acting against the values of Islam , put you in danger .
Stop them .
Stop your enemies and ours . "
Mr Olmert added : " I will not hesitate to use Israel 's might to strike Hamas and [ Islamic ] Jihad .
How ?
I will not go into details now . "
Egyptian anger Ms Livni had earlier been holding talks with Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit , who brokered the ceasefire .
Mr Aboul Gheit urged restraint from both sides , and said Egypt would continue to act as a mediator but admitted that a new truce currently seemed unlikely .
Relations between Egypt and Gaza are strained , our correspondent says .
President Mubarak has told the militants he believes they are making a mistake in abandoning the ceasefire .
It is widely understood the Egyptians are furious with Hamas for boycotting peace talks with Fatah last month , which were due to be held in Cairo .
The question now , our correspondent says , is whether the Egyptians would back an Israeli military offensive against Hamas .
The London - based newspaper Al - Quds al - Arabi has reported that Egypt would not object to a limited Israeli operation in the Gaza Strip , aimed at toppling Hamas .
Ms Livni travelled to the Egyptian capital at the personal invitation of the government .
This is rare given that Mr Mubarak usually only meets Israeli officials in the Sinai resort of Sharm el - Sheikh .
It is being read as an Egyptian endorsement of Tzipi Livni , who is seeking to become prime minister in February 's general election .
It has been noted that President Mubarak has not yet invited for talks the Defence Minister and Labour Chairman Ehud Barak , who is also a prime ministerial hopeful .

A photograph and a U.S. soldier 's testimony prove Canadian Omar Khadr could not have killed a U.S. soldier in a 2002 firefight in Afghanistan , the terror suspect 's military - appointed lawyer said on Friday .
Khadr , who attended the pretrial hearing Friday at the U.S. detention centre in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , is accused of killing a U.S. army medic with a hand grenade during a four - hour firefight at a suspected al - Qaeda compound .
Lt. - Cmdr .
Bill Kuebler told the hearing that the photograph shows Khadr buried under the rubble of a collapsed building at the time the grenade that killed Sgt. Christopher Speer was thrown , proving he could not have thrown it .
The Globe and Mail reported that the Col. Patrick Parrish , the military judge in Khadr 's case , barred Kuebler from showing the photograph to the media .
Kuebler said he wants the soldier who gave a similar account — identified in court documents only as " Soldier No. 2 " — to testify at Khadr 's Jan. 26 trial .
That account differs widely from another report from a soldier that says Khadr was sitting up and moving when the soldier , believing Khadr threw the grenade , shot him twice in the back .
Khadr , now 22 , was 15 when he was wounded and captured before being sent to the controversial base at Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal on numerous charges , including murder and conspiring with al - Qaeda .
If convicted of the most serious charge against him , Khadr faces a maximum sentence of life in prison .
The commission 's military prosecutors have disputed the defence 's claims that Khadr , the only westerner remaining in detention in Guantanamo Bay , is a child soldier deserving leniency .
They also have said they will present definitive evidence showing Khadr threw the grenade that killed Speer , as well as videotape showing him planting roadside explosives in Afghanistan .
Khadr 's trial is expected to be the first military commission held under the administration of U.S. president - elect Barack Obama , whose election has thrown the fate of the prison and the military commission into question .
The Democrat has called for the closure of the country 's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay .
He also has voiced opposition to the two - year - old law signed by President George W. Bush that allows the military commission to try those accused of war crimes .
This is why John McCain ‘s fear mongering campaign is bad .
Every time Sarah Palin talks about Barack Obama “ palling around with terrorists , ” it lends credence to the absurd idea that he ’s a terrorist .
Every time a campaign surrogate shouts
Obama ’s middle name , it allows his supporters to justify hating him by saying , “ Just look at his name . ”
And every time McCain spends a speech or a rally or a town hall meeting talking about tenuous character issues , it makes it okay to base your vote on a e-mail your uncle forwarded you , rather than , you know , things that actually matter .
But the people of Strongsville , Ohio , featured in this clip take this sad and disturbing story to a whole new level .
There ’s been a lot of talk lately about whether or not 99 cent apps are ruining the app store , but more than the price , it ’s the abundance of crapware that can often make browsing the app store a somewhat jumbled experience .
While there are certainly an impressive number of great iPhone applications that do amazing things , the following example of iPhone apps epitomizes everything that ’s wrong with the app store :
Shitty software with limited functionality that does n’t perform as advertised .
In this post , we ’ll look specifically at iPhone apps developed by ‘ Ethan Productions ’ .
A “ Weather History ” app that gives you a date , but not a year .
Lovely !
There are 39 programs in the App store that were developed by ‘ Ethan Productions ’ , including the one pictured above .
Nearly all of Ethan Productions ’ applications are 99 cents and generally offer functionality that can easily be attained for free .
Some of the applications include titles such as “ Quote of the day ” , “ Insect Picture of the Day ” , and “ This day in history ” .
In addition , there are language apps that give you a new “ word of the day ” in either French , Italian , German , Russian , Irish , or Spanish .
And oh yeah , each language has its own unique app , and for all of the above mentioned apps , you have to wait 24 hours for each fact / picture / word to refresh .
So what ’s the problem ?
Well , nearly every app from Ethan Productions has abysmal reviews that complain about apps that do n’t work , have too many ads , and even a few that suggest the developer ripped off ideas for already existent free applications .
In addition , every app from Ethan Productions has a 5 star rating from someone named “ EthanWA ” , presumably the developer himself .
Also , any glowing review for an Ethan Productions app seems to have been written generically by someone who gave every app from Ethan Productions 5 stars .
Essentially , the only positive reviews are from Ethan himself and his buddies .
And if that were n’t enough , EthanWA took the time to give competing applications 1 star reviews .
Some of the reviews from EthanWA for his own apps include :
“ This app is sweet .
AMAZING pictures .
I love that I can just take a screenshot and save the pic as my background .
Great app .
Highly recommend ”
“ Been looking for something like this ”
Some of the user reviews , however , are n’t so forgiving :
“ Stop charging money for crap we can easily get for free via the web ” .
“ EthanWA – interesting how you give every EA Productions program 5 stars and then give every competitor 1 star .
And you have the same name as the guy in charge of EA productions .
Weak . ”
Regarding his “ Word of the day ” app , one user wrote ,
“ Only displayed one word due to a ridiculous amount of ads .
Completely unusable ”
And another wrote ,
“ Why ca n’t you use normal ads like most ad - supported apps ?
I touch the screen and an ad appears and I ca n’t do anything .
It ’s ridiculous .
I deleted this app in less than 5 minutes .. ”
Ethan Productions even has a 99 cent app that counts down the days till Obama takes office .
The reviews for this app are pretty funny .
“ Too bad I ca n’t give it 0 stars . . ”
“ I downloaded this just so I could write a review about how stupid the developer is . ”
Clearly , Apple needs to do something about developers like EthanWA before their lowest common denominator crapware proliferates the app store to such an extent that users have trouble finding worthwhile apps .
And as the app store continues to grow , this problem will only become more apparent .
It ’s unclear , however , what steps Apple can take to combat this .
Should apps with abysmal reviews be tossed out of the store after a few weeks ?
Should they be relegated to a less prominent “ sale bin ” area of the store , separate from the other more quality apps ?
Eventually Apple will need to take note of this before browsing the app store becomes too much of a hassle for users .
Until then , users will have to navigate around applications such as the following :
Is this “ Advice ” app worth 99 cents ?
From the “ Weather Picture of the day ” app .
There is nothing extraordinary inside the municipal jail in Chihuahua City :
Half a dozen men kill time – some sleeping , others pacing – their languid motions caught on TV monitors outside their cells .
But the cameras are n't just to aid the guards .
Across town , Chihuahua 's state human rights office is viewing the same scene on a TV screen that shows images from cameras set up throughout two city jails .
The three - month - old program , which allows human rights workers 24 - hour access , is the newest effort toward transparency in Chihuahua 's police department .
And in a country where the police rank among the least respected institutions , Chihuahua 's moves toward accountability are garnering its police a rare reputation for honesty and competency that experts hope can be implemented elsewhere .
" I dare to say that they are the best municipal police in Mexico , " says Juan Salgado , a police reform expert in Mexico City who is compiling a report on the best practices in Chihuahua , to be distributed to police departments across the country .
The force 's most visible sign of accomplishment to date hangs outside the municipal police department in Chihuahua city : a banner boasting of the May 2007 certification given by the Virginia - based Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies ( Calea ) .
Police force in a league of its own
The force was the first – and is still the only – municipal force in Mexico to be accredited by Calea .
It means they meet 459 standards ranging from procedure codes to ensuring higher levels of training for cops .
Many other forces in the country are now seeking to follow suit .
It was a huge feat , but it is innovations in transparency and accountability that Mr. Salgado says have made a bigger difference .
On a recent day , a young man in Chihuahua 's municipal jail gets cuffed and carted off to federal authorities after getting caught selling cocaine on the street the night before .
The cameras above him record every action .
Ernesto Garnica , who is in charge of public security at Chihuahua 's human rights office , says that he does not view every such incident , but cameras modify behavior .
" It 's an accountability tool , but also a preventive measure , " Mr. Garnica says , pointing to the images on the TV placed in front of his desk .
He says it 's working : Last year they registered 103 complaints , slightly higher than this year 's 96 complaints to date .
Citizens work to keep cops honest
The 1,000 - member force in Chihuahua has also opened itself to public scrutiny .
All complaints that the state human rights department receives , for example , are posted on the Internet .
Citizens have also formed a committee consisting of more than 50 organizations , such as universities and business associations , divided into seven commissions .
Citizen review boards are common in the US but are a rarity in Mexico , says Antia Mendoza , a police reform researcher at the Institute for Security and Democracy ( Insyde ) in Mexico City .
The commissions , all volunteer , organize training for police , give them access to credit for cars and homes – often difficult for officers to gain – and even have a say in the promotion of police officers .
When citizens started participating in police matters four years ago , it was revolutionary , says Ignacio Manjarrez , the operational president of the citizen 's committee , which is housed under the local chapter of Coparmex , an employers ' union .
" But times are changing , and the participation of citizens is every day more important . "
The police chief of Chihuahua City , Lazaro Gaytan , calls transparency a " personal conviction . "
But it has a practical appeal , too .
" The citizens help me do my job ; they help me supervise , " he says during in an interview in his office .
Some of these measures can be repeated in other municipal departments , says Ms. Mendoza , who specializes in citizen participation .
Others are harder to copy , but Chihuahua still provides valuable lessons , most importantly in political will , she says .
Where most incoming mayors , elected to three - year terms , appoint their own officials , in Chihuahua only two men have overseen the police department in a 10 - year period , says Daniel Sabet , a visiting associate professor at Georgetown University who does comparative analyses of police departments in Mexico , including Chihuahua City .
In other departments , he says , police chiefs have made huge strides , only to have their programs dismantled with incoming administrations .
" Citizen committees can further ensure this type of continuity , " Mr. Sabet says .
Police resisted this degree of transparency at first , says Captain Mauricio Escobar .
" It 's human nature , for all of us , to fear the citizens will use it in a political way , " Mr. Escobar says .
But on the contrary , it 's been a way for citizens to vent frustrations and , as such , improved the relationship between the community and cops .
Mr. Gaytan also says police acceptance is practical :
If they do n't adapt , they wo n't move forward .
This does not mean that the local police are immune to criticism .
The reputation they enjoy in police reform circles is not always shared by the community at large .
Miguel Angel Perez , who sells candy and cigarettes on a corner in Chihuahua City , says he and other vendors have been shaken down so many times he cannot even count .
" They are rats with badges , " he says .
As drug violence finds its way to Chihuahua City , a place that residents boast is one where they used to leave their keys in their cars at supermarkets and their doors open at night , the reputation of the police department faces new challenges .
The corruptive forces that afflict so many other municipal police forces – some of which have been disarmed and demoted by the military , which is leading the effort against organized crime – have been the exception here so far .
In arms checks carried out by the military this year , for example , no cop was arrested , says Gaytan .
But when the municipality has tested its officers for drug use , some officers have refused and resigned .
One officer resigned and nine months later was murdered , allegedly at the hands of drug traffickers .
" There is always the possibility that someone is involved , " Gaytan says .
" You can never be complacent . "
Gaytan says they have taken measures beyond accountability to prevent corruptive influences .
They have raised salaries by 28 percent this year , he says , to an average of $ 750 a month for the lowest - ranked officers .
And where the national average for training to become an officer is four months , here they receive nine months .
They have also earmarked money for technology .
Currently 100 police officers have laptops and 400 Palm Pilots are on the way .
The force even has its own helicopter .
That compares with some municipal police units that do n't even have bulletproof vests .
Citizens say they can play a role in corruption prevention too , particularly in education and by emphasizing community policing .
" If you know someone , it creates empathy , " Mr. Manjarrez says .
" You are not going to go and bribe them . "
Thanks to Google , there ’s a unit - testing framework for the iPhone .
There ’s not much more to say about it — the instructions are crystal clear and it worked exactly as described .
It ’s compatible with OCUnit ( the Objective - C unit test framework in XCode ) , so once you set it up , you can just create test cases the way you would for any ObjC project .
One quirk — it instructs you to add a build step that runs the unit - tests during build time and shows the failures as compiler errors that you can then use XCode to track down .
That ’s nice , but I have found that you do n’t really have enough of an environment to successfully run every kind of test — they run fine if you run them in the simulator .
The main problem I have is with setting up my database in my Documents folder — I get errors at build - time that work just fine at run-time .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A pact that would allow U.S. troops to stay in Iraq for three years failed to secure the support of Iraqi political leaders on Sunday , raising doubts about whether it can survive without new negotiations .

The Iraqi government took pains to say the pact was not yet dead , but the lack of an endorsement from a body known as the political council for security -- which groups parliamentary faction leaders -- makes its future far from certain .
“ They just finished the meeting and they did not take a decision on the pact because some groups had reservations , ” government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh told Reuters .
The leaders were “ still hesitant to approve or reject ” the deal , he said , adding that only the main Kurdish groups supported the pact without reservations .
Earlier , the Shi’ite alliance that forms the core of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government said it wanted changes in the pact , despite a government position that the draft is final and unlikely to be renegotiated .
Enacting the pact would mean that , for the first time , U.S. troops in Iraq carry a mandate from Iraq ’s elected government , seen as a major step on the road to full sovereignty .
But Iraqi politicians are keen to win more control over a foreign force that has previously operated outside Iraqi law .
“ Beside the positive points that were included in this pact , there are other points that need more time , more discussion , more dialogue and amendments to some articles , ” the Shi’ite alliance said in a statement .
Dabbagh said that among the issues leading to doubts at Sunday ’s meeting were details of a mechanism to let Iraq try U.S. troops for crimes .
“ They say it needs clarification , ” he said .
The pact will still go to Iraq ’s cabinet for approval later this week , Dabbagh said , adding that the cabinet ’s decision could reflect the reservations of the faction leaders .
Even if the cabinet backs the plan , it still must pass in Iraq ’s notoriously fractious parliament where the faction leaders hold sway .
The U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the U.S. mission expires at the end of this year , and Iraqi leaders have already discussed seeking an emergency extension as a plan B .
FINAL DRAFT
The draft requires U.S. troops to leave Iraq at the end of 2011 unless Baghdad asks them to stay .
It also provides certain conditions under which U.S. troops might be tried in Iraqi courts for serious crimes committed while off duty , which Iraqi officials have described as a major concession from Washington .
The Shi’ite parties ’ call for amendments appears to contradict Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari , a Kurd , who said on Saturday that Washington and Baghdad both consider the draft final and would be unlikely to reopen it .
Iraq ’s parliament would be sent the draft to approve or reject but would not be permitted to make changes , Zebari said .
U.S. officials still have yet to comment on the contents of the draft in public , but briefed members of Congress -- including the two presidential candidates -- about it on Friday .
“ When the agreement is finalized , and both sides agree that that is the final language , it will be an open and transparent document so that the citizens both of Iraq and the United States can understand what is in it , ” U.S. military spokesman Rear - Admiral Patrick Driscoll said on Sunday .
Followers of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr oppose the pact , and thousands of Sadrists marched against it on Saturday .
Data visualization continues to grow online and in the real world .
It exists as masterful art pieces and amazingly useful analysis tools .
In both cases though it brings data — which is oftentimes cryptic — to the masses and shows that data is more than a bucket of numbers .
Data is interesting .
As we collect more and more data about ourselves and our surroundings , the data and the visualization will only get more interesting .
On that note , I give you FlowingData ’s picks for the top 5 data visualization projects of 2008 .
Visualizations were judged based on the use of data , aesthetics , overall effect on the visualization arena , and how well they told a story .
Honorable Mention : Wordle
Wordle , by Jonathan Feinberg , is the word cloud revamped .
Wordle caught on like wildfire across the Web as people were putting in their RSS / Atom feeds , cutting and pasting snippets , and visualizing presidential speeches .
It was even added to the Many Eyes visualization toolbox .
It ’s hard to say what exactly made Wordle so popular , but I think it was a mix of randomness , aesthetics , and customization options .

The Radiohead “ House of Cards ” music video was a bit different in that no cameras were used to “ film ” it .
Instead , they used a rotating scanner and lasers to collect 3D data .
What you see in the music video ( below ) is a visualization of all that data .
The group behind the video also made the data freely available , which is icing on the cake .
You do n’t have to be a Radiohead fan to appreciate that .
3. Last.fm and Movie Box Office Streamgraphs
Lee Byron was certainly on to something when he created Streamgraphs to visualize music listening history on last .

They are a variant of stacked graphs and an improvement on Havre et al . ’s ThemeRiver in the way the baseline is chosen , layer ordering , and color choice .
In February 2008 , Amanda Cox ( yes , again ) , Matthew Bloch , and Shan Carter of The New York Times , together with Lee , used a similar technique to show the ebb and flow of box office receipts for 7,500 movies over 21 years .
Discussion burst out across the Web — about the technique and what people were seeing in the data — that I am convinced would not have come about if instead of a Streamgraph , they used say , a stacked bar chart .

Wide - ranging survey reveals low levels of some drugs and pesticides in US tap water .
The researchers found small traces of pesticides and drugs in US drinking water .
Punchstock
The most comprehensive survey so far has found a slew of drugs , personal care products , pesticides and other contaminants in drinking water being delivered to millions of people across the United States .
None of the compounds appeared at levels thought to be immediately harmful to human health .
But the researchers were surprised to find widespread traces of a pesticide , used largely in corn ( maize ) growing , that has , at higher levels , been linked to cancer and other problems .
The researchers from the Southern Nevada Water Authority ( SNWA ) in Las Vegas tracked 51 compounds in a survey of 19 water utilities supplying more than 28 million people .
Of the 20 drugs or drug metabolites on their list , most of those that the chemists detected were at concentrations of below a microgram per litre , in source water , treated water and tap water .
Their findings are published in Environmental Science & Technology1 .
The study unexpectedly revealed relatively high levels of the pesticide atrazine , a suspected endocrine disruptor used throughout the US corn belt ( the American midwest ) but banned by the European Union .
The authors detected atrazine in water far from farm land and even in the source water of a plant located in the most arid part of the United States , where the pesticide is not used at all .
Atrazine could be getting into water through food and drink , the researchers suggest , with , for example , many soft drinks containing corn syrup helping the pesticide to spread through the water - treatment system .
However , like the other contaminants found by the team , the levels were below the US Environmental Protection Agency 's safe maximum .
For atrazine , this is 3.0 micrograms per litre ; the highest value recorded by the researchers was 930 nanograms ( 0.93 micrograms ) per litre .
The atrazine findings underscore that " there 's more contribution [ to contaminant loads ] from industrial chemicals than pharmaceuticals , " says Jörg Drewes , an environmental engineer at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden .
He points to the study 's results on other endocrine disruptors : bisphenol A , nonylphenol and chlorinated flame retardants .
" These could be leaching out of [ household ] plastics , even plastic pipes [ used in ] the treatment process , " says Drewes .
The tiniest of traces
Scientists and regulators have tracked these compounds for years .
But this team was able to detect contaminants at some of the lowest levels yet , using analytical methods generally beyond the means of most labs and utilities , says Stuart Krasner of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California .
" As analytical chemists improve the sensitivity [ of their techniques ] , they are ... going to see things we could n't see before , " Krasner says .
Now , he adds , researchers must establish what risks are posed to human health from long - term , low - level exposure to such contaminants , as well as to mixtures of these chemicals .
The survey is part of a larger project by the Awwa Research Foundation in Denver , Colorado , that is set to be made public next year .
Its aim is to help water utilities to find substances that they can monitor to check that their treatment processes are working .
Water companies in the United States generally use oxidants — chlorine , ozone or both — to treat water .
" There are virtually no data " on what happens in water - distribution systems , adds Alexa Obolensky of the city of Philadelphia 's Water Department .
This study " provides that data and toxicological relevance , " she says .
Odd abundances
The SNWA survey , says co-author Shane Snyder , found that for drugs " prescription volume did not translate into occurrence " .
For instance , the team detected the anticholesterol drug atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) , the most prescribed drug in the United States in 2006 and 2007 , only in source water and then only for three utilities .
But the epilepsy medicine carbamazepine , not even in the top 200 prescribed drugs in the United States , was one of the most frequently detected in source waters , and appeared at the tap on several occasions too .
The drug is hard to break down and so may be more persistent than some other compounds .

The team also found steroid hormones in source water , but never at the tap .
" You have to look at what people are exposed to , not what 's in the reservoir , " when assessing human exposure risks , says Snyder .
Chlorination breaks down these endogenous steroid hormones in seconds , Snyder adds .
And at least one report of hormones in tap water , for San Francisco , has since been found to be a false result .
The survey illustrates that cleaner source waters produce cleaner drinking water at the tap .
" We should be going toward protecting water resources , " says Obolensky .
She believes preventing pollutants getting into the water supply in the first place is the most efficient way of tackling contamination — rather than putting money into advanced treatment at drinking water plants .
LOS ANGELES  Jay Leno , who has lived a life of comedy , knows the rules as well as anybody who has ever stood on a stage and told jokes .
“ The first rule of comedy is : Do n’t create anything bigger than yourself , ” Mr. Leno said in an interview in the green room of “ The Tonight Show . ”
“ The trick is to keep the water just below a rolling boil so it stays in the pot a little bit longer . ”
But the truth is that the comedy pot where Mr. Leno and his many competitors live  late - night television  has been simmering ever since Mr. Leno stunned the television business in 2004 by agreeing to step down from the host role where he has thrived since 1992 to make room at “ The Tonight Show ” for NBC ’s other late - night star , Conan O’Brien , currently the host of “ Late Night . ”
And until last week it seemed that the pot was about to spill over into a new round of overheated competition , with Mr. Leno moving toward accepting an offer from ABC to star in a show to challenge both Mr. O’Brien and David Letterman on CBS .
The deal was close enough to coming to fruition that ABC affiliates were getting word to be ready for a change to Mr. Leno in January 2010 , according to what NBC was hearing from its own affiliates .
Then Mr. Leno shocked the television world again by agreeing to stay at NBC to create a new version of his show , tentatively titled “ The Jay Leno Show , ” at 10 every weeknight starting next September , moving from late night to prime time .
Many would argue that the real estate bubble started in 1997 .
At this point , residential real estate values in the United States disconnected from any economic fundamentals .
We have heard this argument many times .
Yet I am going to argue that the current real estate bubble started in 1979 .
The real estate bubble started in 1979 ?
I know what you are thinking that this statement in itself is preposterous but hear me out .
Since 1945 post World War II , the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) of the United States had always had a higher value than all household residential real estate wealth until , 1979 .
That means for 34 years or a solid three decades the production of the United States was higher than the value of homes in the country .
I have constructed a detailed graph highlighting the 30 - year bubble below and will discuss historical reasons later in the article :
* click for sharper image
If we are to believe that the GDP reflects the actual economic power of a country , we can state that in 1979 we started valuing residential real estate more than we valued the economic production of our country .
History is rather unforgiving for past mistakes .
The fact that this year we have witnessed the housing bubble pop and the big 3 automakers on the verge of bankruptcy is n’t two separate and distinct events .
What it does represent is our shift from manufacturing jobs to jobs in the finance and real estate parts of our economy .
First , let us look at the loss of manufacturing jobs :
Manufacturing peaked in 1979 with over 19,500,000 million people employed in this sector .
After that as you can clearly see from the chart above , it has been a 30 year steady decline .
Yet our population has been increasing and for the most part employment has remained steady with a few bumps along the way .
Where did many of these jobs go ?
Well the manufacturing jobs as we all know were shipped overseas .
But what industries picked up Americans that once would have been employed in the manufacturing sector ?
This chart above is rather telling .
For 3 decades , those of the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s real estate contributed to roughly 10 % of employment in this country .
This current decade real estate has contributed to well over 30 % of employment ( the chart stops at 2006 ) .
The shift from an economy that produces actual goods to a country so dependent on real estate is amazing to witness over this timeframe .
In addition , many other people found work in the services field many times selling items directly related to real estate .
It is no coincidence that the domestic auto industry and real estate bubble are collapsing at the same time .
But to think this is something that only happened over the past few years is simply not looking at the systemic problems that caused the housing bubble to form .
Stage # 2 – Mania
Robert Allen wrote a best selling book in 1980 called Nothing Down .
It was an interesting book on investing in real estate and discussed some perfect - case scenarios where someone would take back a 2nd note or borrow money from some random borrower and the deal would work .
It made it seem all too easy .
You had to have a perfect storm of events for you to buy real estate at a good deal given interest rates were sky high :
I think much of this was a fad when it initially came out and was relegated to a pocket of savvy real estate investors .
This mentality contributed to the S & L Crisis which again was based with real estate .
Then came the era of low interest rates which were ushered in the 1990s .
This spurred a renaissance in real estate but a large portion of the funds were quickly chasing the technology sector .
Toward the end of the decade , real estate was catching on as a savvy investment vehicle .
You need to remember that during the 1990s numerous real estate investing books were flooding the market .
Seminars were being filled by countless newbie investors .
Carleton
Sheets was one of the more famous TV infomercial salesmen preaching easy street via real estate investing .
And what had to be one of the more comical methods of selling real estate investing was ushered in via Tom Vu :
“ Tom Vu promised that by attending his free 90 - minute seminar you ’d learn the same secrets he used to make millions - and you could use them too .
Then all the accoutrements of wealth that Tom enjoyed would be yours as well : mansions , luxury cars , yachts , and , most of all , dozens of luscious babes ready to please you for the rest of your life .
The barely - dressed ladies appeared all over this infomercial as lovely backdrops : there they were playing backgammon , sipping cocktails in the yacht ’s bar , sunning themselves in various alluring poses , standing around the pool at the “ Tom Vu Mansion ” in Florida , bending over the edge of the yacht so as to give the viewers an eyeful of their firm - yet - supple rears . ”
I think in the initial phases much of this was taken as a major pipe dream .
But what had to usher in the mainstream real estate investing idea to everyone is a real estate guru euphoria produced from Rich Dad , Poor Dad which ironically came out on April 1 , 2000 .
What this book did at least to a certain extent was made real estate investing a mainstream way of getting wealthy .
Not only that , it also mocked people that actually worked for a living .
If you read the book , there are subtle hints at this .
Take a look at this quote :
“ Most people are poor because when it comes to investing , the world is filled with Chicken Littles running around yelling , ‘ The sky is falling .
The sky is falling . ”
Another view that people came away with after reading the book was :
“ The poor and middle class work for money .
The rich have money work for them . ”
We already were on path to losing our manufacturing base and the only thing many people needed was someone to tell them rich people basically do nothing while getting rich and those who are poor and middle class ( the majority ) are simply suckers for not jumping into real estate .
If all the recent bailouts to Wall Street and investment banks prove something is that those few people that actually are getting any money in the current environment truly have done nothing to earn it .
So this set the psychological stage for the nation .
People now believed in the god of real estate .
All they needed was the financing to make it happen .
Curtain opens up and here comes Alan Greenspan .
After the 9/11 attacks we were already in a recession .
It is a mistake to believe that 9/11 was the entire reason for the recession since we were already on our way to dealing with the technology bubble bursting .
9/11 tipped us over the edge to the prospect of a more severe recession .
Alan Greenspan with his infinite wisdom decided to flood the market with easy credit .
In comes the toxic mortgage mess .
You can almost pinpoint where the housing craze went off into a bubble by looking at the Case - Shiller Index :
I think simply looking at when the mania started is too easy an explanation for this bubble .
Since 1979
Americans were already mentally shifting their belief gradually that work was for chumps and easy money was not only a possibility but a right .
When the idea of no money down was just a sophisticated way of making a deal in 1980 to being mainstream in 2000 we had completed the process .
We really bought into the “ poor and middle class work for money ” because only those who do n’t understand finance or real estate ( FIRE ) are too simple minded to understand what really makes a country work .
Yeah right .
Try explaining why $ 50 trillion in global wealth has evaporated in one year because of the greatest credit bubble ever known to humankind and explain why it is a smart move to load up with real estate .
In 1999 the Glass - Steagall Act was repealed when Senator Phil Gramm introduced the bill in the House of Representatives for consideration .
The repeal of this act allowed commercial lenders like Citigroup to underwrite and trade instruments such as MBS ( mortgage - backed securities ) and CDOs ( collateralized debt obligations ) and also established complicated structured investment vehicles that bought many of these securities .
Citigroup who was on the verge of bankruptcy and received a $ 306 billion backstop just a few days ago .
So the entire stage was set .
One singular party is n’t too blame but certainly without the financing of Wall Street , this game would have never gotten started .
The removal of modest regulations in 1999 , Alan Greenspan dropping rates to 1 % , and 2 decades of letting our manufacturing base be decimated proved to be the perfect ecological system to create a housing bubble that spread like a fungus .
Stage # 3 – Bust
Like all bubbles , they do eventually burst .
When they pop , they usually end in a spectacular fashion .
The technology bubble for example annihilated the NASDAQ which to this date has not recovered :
Bubbles like that in technology do burst and leave only a shadow of what they once were .
The NASDAQ is still over 70 % below the peak reached in March of 2000 .
Residential housing wealth hit a peak of $ 24 trillion at the height of the market mania .
The Fed flow of fund report used above to construct the first graph measures real estate declines by the OFHEO measures which are extremely conservative .
They ’ve always been this way .
Why ?
They focus on conforming loans which even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been virtually nationalized , the vast majority of the loans in their portfolio are high quality .
Now of course in a severe recession like the one we will face , even prime borrowers will default .
But the OFHEO numbers largely missed the bubble which was fueled by Alt - A , option ARMs , and subprime mortgages .
So looking at the Case - Shiller Index fall gives us a better idea how much we have fallen because it looks at single home sales measured over time .
According to the Case - Shiller we are now approximately down by 22 % nationwide in terms of housing prices .
What that means is $ 5.28 trillion in housing wealth is now gone .
I would argue that prices are much lower and in states like California , we are now seeing median price drops of 50 % and above .
The global equity markets have collapsed and have seen $ 32 trillion in wealth disappear since the markets peaked in October of 2007 .
This is n’t simply a decade long bubble but a system that was given life 30 years ago .
The destruction of our manufacturing base and focusing our energy on the FIRE economy has left us at this perilous crossroad .
I ’m afraid there is still much more pain to be felt since as we ’ve noted above , much of our employment base is now tied to real estate so logically it would follow that a busting real estate market would carry jobs down with it .
It would be different if we were setup like the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s where a large portion of our employment base was n’t dependent on housing .
It is now .
The question we have to ask ourselves is do we want to continue to perpetuate an economy that is largely based on “ not having to work for your money ” or are we going to focus on actually working for our wealth ?

So how did a story about a far - flung village in rural Alaska about starving and freezing natives ever gain the attention of traditional media ?
Partly due to the Palin factor , a governor seemingly more concerned with peddling her book deal ( for a measly asking price of $ 11 mil ) than her citizens .
More than just her involvement ( or lack thereof ) though it 's been a testament to the perseverance of a few people in Alaska who have really lit the fire .
It began with a story in an Alaskan newspaper ( The Bristol Bay Times ) , spread to various Alaska progressive blogs ( The Mudflats , Progressive Alaska , Immoral Minority , Diva 's Blue Oasis ) , who in turn alerted the large progressive blogs on the net ( Huffiington Post , Firedoglake , and The Daily Kos ) .
Recounted here from Huffington Post ( 1.14.09 ) :
Four days ago , a cry for help went out from rural Alaska via the Bristol Bay Times .
Many of us have known that residents of Alaska 's rural villages are having a hard winter .
The weather has been unusually cold this year , and prices of heating oil and gasoline have been astronomical .
Add to that a disastrous collapsing salmon fishery in Bristol Bay that left residents in that area heading in to winter with less than usual , and you have the makings for a humanitarian crisis .
So in desperation , Nicholas Tucker , from the Village of Emmonak ( eh - MON - eck ) sent out a cry for help .
With 21 days left in the month , Mr. Tucker had only $ 440 left to feed and keep his family of nine warm , with heating oil at $ 7.83 / gallon .
As Emmonak runs out of fuel , it will have to be flown in , potentially raising the price to $ 9 / gallon or more .
The blogs involvement lead to direct donations of food and money , as well as sending videographer Dennis Zaki to Emmonak to record a firsthand account when other media would not send anyone .
And just today the LA Times published a piece on the problems facing the Yupik Eskimo villages ( " In rural Alaska , villagers suffer in near silence " ) .
All this attention seems to have created a backlash as well , both among the rightwing / talk radio crowd in Alaska who 've called the villagers plight a " scam " , and among urban Alaskans who think they already pay too much to help their remote neighbors .
There is also an international component to this story :
At the moment , villagers in Tuluksak say their greatest hope is that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will come through again on his pledge to deliver free fuel to Native Americans -- a promise that could mean 100 gallons for many families .
" What most people do not realize is that what our country as a whole has been seeing for the past year or so is nothing compared to the economic conditions that have been prevailing in many of our Native communities for over 100 years , " Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on Jan. 15 .
" It is truly tragic , " she said , " that Alaska Native villages must depend on Venezuela for their safety net . "

From a modern chemist ’s perspective , the structure of DNA in our genes is rather mundane .
The molecule has a well - known importance for life , but chemists often see only a uniform double helix with almost no functional behavior on its own .
It may come as a surprise , then , to learn that this molecule is the basis of a truly rich and strange research area that bridges synthetic chemistry , enzymology , structural nanotechnology and computer science .
But what happened in front of horrified witnesses happened fast - so fast , police would say later , that there was no chance for anyone to stop it .
Charged with murder : Arthur Freeman in police custody yesterday .
Credit : Joe Armao Just after 9am , Freeman 's white Toyota LandCruiser , driving towards the city , slowed in the left lane .
It stopped .
Freeman is 35 .
He works in IT and lives in Hawthorn .
He is estranged from his wife .
What happened next is before the courts .
This is what witnesses told police they saw :
Freeman got out of the car .
He walked to the rear passenger door .
His two sons , aged six and two , were in the back seat .
But it was his four - year - old daughter , Darcey Iris Freeman , whom he leaned over and unbuckled .
He lifted her up and carried her to the edge of the bridge near its highest point .
Witnesses later told police the child seemed limp ; she did not fight .
She did not protest .
Those who had to deal with what happened next have prayed that maybe she was unconscious , or thought it was a game ; that she had no idea .
Freeman allegedly walked to the edge of the bridge near its highest point , lifted his daughter over the railing - and let go .
Darcey fell past the railings , past the line of cars , past the pylons .
She fell 58 metres into the murky waters below .
Her father got back into his car .
He drove off .
Frantic motorists called police .
Water police got there first .
They dragged the little girl from the water at a spot near a pumping station at Spotswood .
They desperately tried to resuscitate her .
Paramedics arrived .
They worked on her for almost an hour before she was flown to the Royal Children 's Hospital .
She was in a critical condition with internal injuries .
Meanwhile , a massive police hunt swung into action .
Police searching for the white LandCruiser feared a second crime scene .
But about 10.30 am they were called to the Commonwealth Law Courts , on the corner of William and La Trobe streets in the city .
Security staff there are trained to recognise people in distress .
They phoned police after noticing a man in the foyer crying and shaking uncontrollably .
He looked , one said later , like " he 'd had enough " .
His two sons were clinging to him .
He begged security guards , " Can you take my kids for me ? "
He was having trouble talking .
It was his older son who gave the guards mum and dad 's names .
When police arrived , Freeman was arrested and handcuffed .
Family friends were called to the court to collect the children .
Peta Freeman rushed to the hospital to be with her daughter .
Darcey died at 1.35 pm .
It is believed that while in police custody , Freeman was unable to utter a word .
He continued to shake and to weep , apparently in deep shock .
He was charged with murder .
Yesterday afternoon , the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told a doctor had found him unfit for interview and was concerned he was suicidal .
Magistrate Lance Martin said he would ensure staff at the Melbourne Custody Centre were advised of his condition and remanded him in custody to reappear on May 21 .
Zelma Rudstein , whose law firm Rudstein Kron Lawyers had acted for the man , described him as a " devoted and loving father " .
" It 's devastating and unexpected .
We are just trying to come to grips with it , " she said .
" It 's very tragic and certainly not anything anyone could have predicted . "
Traumatised police and paramedics were being counselled last night .
Detective Inspector Steve Clark from the homicide squad said the incident was distressing for the girl 's family members , witnesses , police and the emergency workers involved , some of whom had young children .
He said the incident had taken place so quickly that " no one had the opportunity to intervene " .
" He 's got straight out of the car and taken the young girl and walked to the edge of the bridge , so that would have happened in a matter of seconds , " he said .
" It 's a dreadful set of circumstances .
Often you think you 've seen it all and you have n't . "

BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
The landmark " Sexual Behavior in the Human Male " report revealed major insights into bisexual behavior and orientation -- without even using the word " bisexual " -- when it was published 60 years ago by pioneering sex researcher Alfred Kinsey and his research team at Indiana University .
The iconic " Kinsey Report " unveiled the seven - point Heterosexual - Homosexual Rating Scale , commonly known as the Kinsey Scale , as a tool to gauge a person 's sexual orientation or experiences with both sexes .
While the Kinsey Scale has become a fixture in sexuality textbooks and even popular culture , the rating system and Kinsey 's findings regarding male bisexuality , and cultural influences on male sexuality in general , have largely been overlooked by today 's sex researchers , according to an article in the December issue of the " Journal of Bisexuality . "
For this article , which is part of a special issue recognizing the 60th anniversary of the first " Kinsey Report , " sex researchers from the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at IU collaborated with Paul H. Gebhard , an original member of Kinsey 's research team and later a long - time director of The Kinsey Institute at IU , to reflect on research involving male bisexuality since the " Kinsey Report " and potential directions for future research .
" Overall , Kinsey would be disappointed , " Gebhard told the researchers , Michael Reece and Brian Dodge , director and associate director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion in the School of Health , Physical Education and Recreation .

Kinsey believed that culture plays a key role in a person 's sexual behavior .
Gebhard said Kinsey and his research team avoided looking for causes for sexual orientation out of concern that the findings could be used against people .
Through sexual history interviews , they instead sought to capture snapshots of human sexual experience , which proved to be fluid , according to their research , with individual sexual preferences or orientation often moving along the heterosexual - homosexual scale during one 's lifetime .
Since Kinsey 's day , Gebhard noted that many researchers have moved to a medical model of sex research -- looking for genetic causes of homosexuality , often conducting research solely in the context of sexually transmitted disease transmissions or in an attempt to define what is " normal , " usually using heterosexuality as the reference point .
The place for bisexual individuals in sexuality research is vague , with research generally categorizing people either " homosexual " or " heterosexual , " giving scant recognition to the continuum described by the sexual orientation scale .
" It 's not necessarily a bad thing that research is evolving , " Dodge said .
" Biology and genetics , of course , are part of the picture .
But we seem to be swinging in the direction where some scientists are using these as universal explanatory constructs and trying to minimize , or even negate , the role of an individual 's culture and environment , aspects that Kinsey thought were most important . "
Gebhard , 92 , is the last living member of the original Kinsey research team .
He is professor - emeritus in the Department of Anthropology at IU and served as director of the Kinsey Institute from 1956 - 1982 , when it was called the Institute for Sex Research .
He lives in southern Indiana .
He and his co-authors offered the following suggestions for future research focusing on male bisexuality :
* Move away from a disease - focused lens .
Dodge said the medical model of sexuality research has established heterosexuality as the norm even though Kinsey 's findings indicated it was natural for people to move across the Kinsey Scale throughout their lives .
* Improve sampling methods for bisexuality research .
Dodge acknowledged that finding " bisexual " participants for studies is often challenging but important , requiring innovative techniques .
All too often , however , researchers recruit participants from predominantly " gay- identified " venues , like bars , which are considered convenient yet lack the bisexual individuals that researchers seek .
* Revive the concept of the Kinsey continuum .
Dodge suggested the need for a revival of the discussion surrounding this concept in research circles , as well as popular culture .
" The implications of Kinsey 's findings with regard to this scale are significant , " Dodge said .
" People should not be pigeon - holed into social categories , such as homosexual , heterosexual or even bisexual .
This scale comes as close as anything I 've seen to help with an understanding of where people are currently and across the lifespan . "

The liberal economist , Paul Krugman , has seen fit to advise the president elect on how to solve all the country 's ills in the latest edition of the Rolling Stone magazine .
The article is entitled “ What Obama Must Do – A Letter To The New President ” .
As of this writing it was not available online .
I will leave it to the trained economists to debunk all the economic fallacies Mr. Krugman puts forward in this article .
My goal here is to focus on his contradictory views of war .
Many on the left are holding up President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's ( FDR ) New Deal as a guide for Mr. Obama .
Mr. Krugman is no exception .
He clings to the fallacy that FDR got us out of the Great Depression .
While acknowledging that the New Deal did n't end the Depression ( he thinks it was n't aggressive enough ) Mr. Krugman states in the article that “ It took the giant public works project known as World War II – a project that finally silenced the penny pinchers – to bring the Depression to an end . ”
The idea that WW II ended the Depression or that military spending can bring prosperity is easily debunked .
( See here . )
Why , Mr. Krugman , strangely , provides us with an excellent example on the next page .
He writes , “ It 's possible that reviving the economy might cost as much as a trillion dollars over the course of your first term .
But the Bush administration wasted at least twice as much on an unnecessary war . ”
Let me get this straight , Mr. Bush spending of more than two trillion dollars failed to keep us out of the recession , but Mr. Obama spending less than half as much will get us out ?!?!
Mr. Krugman contradicts himself , tripping over his own feet as he engages in nothing but naked partisan propaganda .
As if that were n't bad enough Mr. Krugman seems to be endorsing war , or at least preparation for war , as a means of keeping the economy growing .
True , he nowhere explicitly states this , but notice that he has not taken care to clearly state his opposition to war as economic policy while claiming that WW II got us out of the Depression .
That is an implicit endorsement of the war economy .
The immorality of killing for profit needs no further going over .
This leads to the question , what , then , are the real differences between liberals and neoconservatives ?
They both , in their own ways , are advocating the same things , big government , war , and empire .
It is very much as Bill Clinton 's mentor , Carroll Quigley , wrote :
The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the Right and the other of the Left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers .
Instead , the two parties should be almost identical , so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy .
Then it should be possible to replace it , every four years if necessary , by the other party , which will be none of these things but will still pursue , with new vigor , approximately the same basic policies .
This is leading us down the road to Fascism .
At this point many readers are perhaps thinking that I 've just ruined this article .
But when one takes a good look at what Fascism really is one sees that it 's the direction we 're going in .
The only difference between our system and pure Fascism is that we get to elect our dictator .
As John T. Flynn warned in his book “ As We Go Marching ” back in 1944 :
Fascism will come at the hands of perfectly authentic Americans who have been working to commit this country to the rule of the bureaucratic state ; interfering in the affairs of the states and cities ; taking part in the management of industry and finance and agriculture ; assuming the role of great national banker and investor , borrowing billions every year and spending them on all sorts of projects through which such a government can paralyze opposition and command public support ; marshaling great armies and navies at crushing costs to support the industry of war and preparation for war which will become our nation 's greatest industry ; and adding to all this the most romantic adventures in global planning , regeneration , and domination , all to be done under the authority of a powerfully centralized government in which the executive will hold in effect all the powers , with Congress reduced to the role of a debating society .
We can only save our liberties by turning away from these Fascistic policies and embracing freedom .
This country can't take another FDR .
I only hope it 's not too late .
Behold the American teenager , a lump in a hoodie who 's capable of little more than playing " Grand Theft Auto , " raiding the liquor cabinet , and denting the minivan , thanks to a brain so unformed that it 's more like a kindergartner 's than a grown - up's .
That 's the message that seemed to emerge from the past decade 's neuroscientific discoveries : that the brain , once thought to be virtually complete by age 6 , is very much a work in progress during adolescence and not to be trusted .
But experts now are realizing that the popular parental response — to coddle teens in an attempt to shield them from every harm — actually may be counterproductive .
Yes , teenagers make woefully errant decisions that factor big in the 13,000 adolescent deaths each year .
And yes , their unfinished brains appear to be uniquely vulnerable to substance abuse and addiction .
But they also are capable of feats of learning and daring marvelous enough to make a grown - up weep with jealousy .
How they exercise these capabilities , it now appears , helps shape the brain wiring they 'll have as adults .
" You have this power you 're given , " says Wilkie Wilson , codirector of DukeLEARN , a new program at Duke University designed to teach teenagers how to best deploy their brains .
Far from coddling the kids , he says , Mom and Dad need to figure out how to allow enough " good " risk - taking to promote growth and prevent wasted talent — while also avoiding disaster .
It can be a nerve - racking exercise .
" These kids are such a crazy mix of impulsiveness and shrewdness , " says Marcia Harrington , a survey researcher in Silver Spring , Md . She recalls the time she thought her then 16 - year - old daughter , Alexandra Plante , had sleepover plans , but the girl instead ditched school and flew to Chicago to visit an acquaintance she 'd met briefly during a family trip .
The scheme was revealed only because bad weather delayed the flight home .
Alex returned unharmed and has never conceded that the escapade was too risky .
" She 's going to be a great adult someday , " says Harrington .
" But , boy , there are moments that are terrifying . "
Further along the road to adulthood now , Alex has applied her daring spirit to becoming an emergency medical technician and volunteer for the local fire department , and to heading off to college 2,500 miles from home .
Taking a peek under the hood .
While society has known since forever that adolescents can be impulsive risk - takers , it was n't until the 1990s , when MRI scans became a common research tool , that scientists could peek into the teenage cranium and begin to sort out why .
What they found astonished them .
The brain 's gray matter , which forms the bulk of its structure and processing capacity , grows gradually throughout childhood , peaks around age 12 , and then furiously " prunes " underused neurons .
By scanning hundreds of children as they 've grown up , neuroscientists at the National Institute of Mental Health have been able to show that the pruning starts at the back of the brain and moves forward during adolescence .
Regions that control sensory and motor skills mature first , becoming more specialized and efficient .
The prefrontal cortex , responsible for judgment and impulse control , matures last .
Indeed , the prefrontal cortex is n't " done " until the early 20s — and sometimes even later in men .
Meantime , the brain 's white matter , which acts as the cabling connecting brain parts , becomes thicker and better able to transmit signals quickly .
Recent research shows that this myelination process of white matter continues well past adolescence , perhaps even into middle age .
Now , dozens of researchers are studying how all these changes might affect adolescent behavior , and also shape adult skills and behavior , for good and for ill .
The maturation lag between emotional and cognitive brain centers may help explain why teenagers get so easily upset when parents see no reason , for example ; teens seem to process input differently than do adults .
In one experiment , young teenagers trying to read the emotions on people 's faces used parts of the brain designed to quickly recognize fear and alarm ; adults used the more rational prefrontal cortex .
Deborah Yurgelun - Todd , the researcher at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Mass. , who led this work , believes young teens are prone to read emotion into their interactions and miss content .
Therefore , parents may have better luck communicating with middle - schoolers if they avoid raising their voice ( easier said than done ) and instead explain how they 're feeling .
Other experiments shed light on why even book - smart teenagers come up short on judgment :
Their brain parts are n't talking to each other .
When Monique Ernst , a child psychiatrist and neurophysiologist at NIMH , uses functional MRI to watch teenage and adult brains engaged in playing a gambling game , she finds that the " reward " center lights up more in teens than in adults when players are winning , and the " avoidance " region is less activated in teens when they 're losing .
There 's also less activity in teens ' prefrontal cortex , which adults use to mediate the " yes ! " and " no " impulses from other brain regions .
" The hypothesis is that there is this triumvirate of brain regions that needs to be in balance " in order to produce wise judgments , says Ernst , whether that 's to wear a seat belt or use contraception .
Does an unfinished brain make for bad behavior ?
There is as yet no proven link between bright blobs on an MRI and real - life behavior , but researchers are hard at work trying to make that connection .
In a 2005 study by Laurence Steinberg , a developmental psychologist at Temple University , teenagers in a simulated driving test were twice as likely to drive dangerously if they had two friends with them — and brain scans showed that the reward centers lit up more if teens were told that friends were watching .
A savvy parent might conclude that what 's needed in the teen years is more guidance , not less .
In fact , study after study has shown that one of the most powerful factors in preventing teenage pregnancy , crime , drug and alcohol abuse , and other seriously bad outcomes is remarkably simple : time with responsible adults .
" It does n't have to be parents , necessarily , " says Valerie Reyna , a professor of psychology at Cornell University .
But it does mean that teenagers should be directly monitored by responsible adults so they have less time to get in trouble .
Reyna thinks adults also need to teach what she calls " gist " thinking , or the ability to quickly grasp the bottom line .
Instead , she says , teenagers often overthink but miss the mark .
When Reyna asks adults if they 'd play Russian roulette for $ 1 million , they almost universally say no .
Half of teenagers say yes .
" They 'll tell you with a straight face that there 's a whole lot of money , and they 're probably not going to die .
It 's very logical on one level , but on another level , it 's completely insane . "
If it 's any comfort , the evidence suggests that teenagers ' loopy behavior and combativeness is hard - wired to push them out of the nest .
Adolescent primates , rodents , and birds also hang out with their peers and fight with their parents , notes B. J. Casey , a teen brain researcher who directs the Sackler Institute at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York City .
" You need to take risks to leave your family and village and find a mate . "
A turbocharged learning machine .
The revved - up adolescent brain is also built to learn , the new research shows — and those teen experiences are crucial .
Neurons , like muscles , operate on a " use it or lose it " basis ; a teenager who studies piano three hours a day will end up with different brain wiring than someone who spends that same time shooting hoops or playing video games .
A 16 - year - old who learns to treat his girlfriend with care and compassion may well develop different emotional brain triggers than one who 's thinking just about the sex .
Only in early childhood , it turns out , are people as receptive to new information as they are in adolescence .
The human brain is designed to pay attention to things that are new and different , a process called salience .
Add in the fact that emotion and passion also heighten attention and tamp down fear , and teenagerhood turns out to be the perfect time to master new challenges .
" You are the owners of a very special stage of your brain development , " Frances Jensen , a neurologist at Children 's Hospital Boston , tells teenagers in her " Teen Brain 101 " lectures at local high schools .
" You can do things now that will set you up later in life with an enhanced skill set .
Do n't waste this opportunity . "

Jordan Dickey is one teen who seized opportunity .
As a 14 - year - old high - school freshman , he asked his father for something unusual : a $ 26,000 loan to start a business .
The Dickey family , of Ramer , Tenn. , raised a few cattle , and Jordan had noticed that people paid a lot more for hay in square bales than for the same amount in less - convenient round bales .
After doing a feasibility study as an agriculture class project , Jordan convinced his dad to give him a three - year loan to buy a rebaling machine .
He worked nights and weekends , mowing , raking , and rebaling ; paid friends $ 7 an hour to load the bales into a trailer ; and hired drivers to deliver the hay to local feed marts , since he was too young to drive .
" It taught me how to manage my own money , " Jordan says .
That 's an understatement .
Not only did he pay off the loan in one year , he made an additional $ 40,000 .
Now 17 and a senior , he has saved enough money to pay for a big chunk of college , much to his parents ' delight .
" He likes for the job to get done and get done right , " says Perry Dickey , who owns an electroplating shop .
" It was a big responsibility for him , and I 'm glad he took the lines and produced . "
Teens can apply the new findings to learn more without more study , notes Wilson , whose DukeLEARN program will be tested in ninth - grade health classes next year .
Key points :
Brains need plenty of sleep because they consolidate memory during slumber .
The brain 's an energy hog and needs a consistent diet of healthful food to function well .
Drugs and alcohol harm short - and long - term memory .
" Learning " how to be addicted .
Teens ' predisposition to learn plays a critical role in the vexing issue of teenage drinking , smoking , and drug use .
Neuroscientists have learned that addiction uses the same molecular pathways that are used in learning , most notably those involving the neurotransmitter dopamine .
Repeated substance use permanently reshapes those pathways , researchers say .
In fact , they now look at addiction as a form of learning : Adolescent rats are far more likely to become hooked than adults .
And epidemiological studies in humans suggest that the earlier someone starts using , the more likely he or she is to end up with big problems .
Last month , a study tracking more than 1,000 people in New Zealand from age 3 to age 32 found that those who started drinking or using drugs regularly before age 15 were far more likely to fail in school , be convicted of a crime , or have substance abuse problems as an adult .
" You can really screw up your brain at this point , " says Jensen .
" You 're more vulnerable than you think . "

When can the brain handle a beer ?
The new brain science has been used as a weapon by both sides of the drinking - age debate , though there is no definitive evidence for a " safe " age .
" To say that 21 is based on the science of brain development is simply untrue , " says John McCardell , president of Choose Responsibility , which advocates lowering the drinking age to 18 .
But there 's also no scientific basis for choosing 18 .
The bottom line for now , most experts agree : Later is better .
