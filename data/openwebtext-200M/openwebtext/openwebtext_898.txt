Here is small selection of movies that we think are excellent films , but also quite bizarre .
Hope you enjoy , please comment !
Eraserhead
Eraserhead is a surrealist - horror film written and directed by David Lynch , and released in 1977 .
The sound accompanying this movie is frankly a disturbing concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical hall and sonorous church organ , it is almost an extra character in the film , and easily it ’s most prominent factor .
Brazil
Brazil is a 1985 film directed by Terry Gilliam .
It was written by Gilliam , Charles McKeown , and Tom Stoppard and stars Jonathan Pryce .
In an Orwellian vision of the future , the populace are completely controlled by the state , but technology remains almost as it was in the 1970’s .

The mistake leads to the arrest of an entirely innocent man , and although Lowry attempts to correct the error , it just gets bigger and bigger , sucking him in with it .
Pink Floyd ’s The Wall
Pink Floyd The Wall is a 1982 musical film by British director Alan Parker based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album The Wall .
The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters .
The life of the fictional rock star ‘ Pink ’ is the subject of the visually evocative cult film based upon the music and visions of the group Pink Floyd as portrayed in the album of the same title .
Relationships , drug abuse , sex , childhood , WWII and fascism combine in a disturbing mix of episodic live action and lyrical animation drawn by British caricaturist Gerald Scarfe .

His former colleague Ed Dillinger ( David Warner ) stole the ideas for several popular arcade games from Flynn .
Flynn is sure that if he can get inside his old company , he can successfully crack the system and find the stolen code — proving that it ’s his .
Ok so this is n’t the most bizarre , but it ’s definitely an awesome one .
200 Motels
200 Motels is a 1971 musical film featuring Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention , produced at Pinewood Studios , England .
Directed and written by Frank Zappa and Tony Palmer .
Absurd and witty , 200 Motels is a mixture of musical , opera-rock and sitcom truthfully conveying the catatonic state of any rock band on the road .
Includes The Dental Hygiene Dilemma segment , animated by Chuck Swenson .
A Scanner Darkly
A Scanner Darkly is a 2006 film directed by Richard Linklater based on the novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick .
The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near - future dystopia constantly monitored by intensive high - technology police surveillance in the midst of a drug addiction epidemic .
To give the film its distinct look , the movie was filmed digitally and then animated using interpolated rotoscope over the original footage .
The Magic Christian

The film tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms , newly arrived in Los Angeles , California , who meets and befriends an amnesiac hiding in her aunt ’s apartment .
The story includes several other seemingly unrelated vignettes that eventually connect in various ways , as well as some surreal scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative .
Surf Nazis Must Die
An earthquake leaves the California coastline in ruins and reduces the beaches to a state of chaos .
A group of Neo - Nazis led by Adolf ( Brenner ) , the self - proclaimed “ Führer of the new beach , ” take advantage of the resulting chaos by fighting off several rival surfer gangs to seize control of the beaches .

Leroy ’s mother “ Mama ” Washington ( Neely ) , devastated by the loss of her son , vows revenge .
After arming herself with a handgun and grenades , she breaks out of her retirement home and sets out to exact bloody vengeance on the Surf Nazis .
What a bizarre movie !
Even Dwarfs Started Small
A group of dwarfs confined in an institution on a remote island rebel against the guards and director ( all dwarfs as well ) in a display of mayhem .
The dwarfs gleefully break windows and dishes , abandon a running truck to drive itself in circles , engineer food fights and cock fights , set fire to pots of flowers , kill a large pig , torment some blind dwarfs , and crucify a monkey .
Ohhh haha little people .

When you watch the trailer you ’ll realize why the movie is on this list .
Scanners
Darryl Revok is the most powerful of all the scanners , and is the head of the underground scanner movement for world domination .
Scanners have great psychic power , strong enough to control minds ; they can inflict enormous pain / damage on their victims .
Doctor Paul Ruth finds a scanner that Revok has n’t , and converts him to their cause – to destroy the underground movement .
A court hearing is underway to determine the sentence for Don Michael Ayala , the U.S. mercenary who was employed by the Human Terrain System , the program that also hired the army reservist and anthropologist , Paula Loyd , set on fire by Abdul Salam in Chehel Gazi , Kandahar Province , Afghanistan on 04 November 2008 , and dying from her wounds on 07 January 2009 .
Ayala has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of “ voluntary manslaughter ” for having executed Salam ( see here , and here ) .
Emotional pleas from friends , colleagues , and even members of Paula Loyd ’s family , including her military fiancé , have poured in to defend Ayala , seeking a light sentence that would exclude any time in prison .
Ayala served nine years in the military as a decorated member of the Army Rangers and worked six years as a mercenary in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Yet , his defense claims , he was not prepared for the “ horror ” of what happened to Loyd .
To be absolutely clear : Ayala executed a subdued detainee , in clear violation of the human rights conventions to which the U.S. is a signatory .
Nonetheless , this has not stopped those who would support Ayala ’s heroism in illegally executing an unarmed detainee who could not fight back , having failed in his job of protecting Paula Loyd in the first place .
A local “ news ” service , Nola.com , has gone as far as producing a “ documentary ” in defense of Don Ayala , shown below .
That same source has Ayala rescuing “ U.S. hostages from Granada ” — they likely meant Grenada , during the 1983 U.S. invasion , also unprovoked , and where there were no U.S. hostages .
It ’s not the only self - serving and self - glorifying myth presented in this story , and many stemming from this case have already been rubbished on this blog .
Ayala ’s legal defense “ described ” the actions of Abdul Salam as “ a violent and incomprehensible attack upon an unarmed , vulnerable American woman who was actively working to improve the lives of all Afghans , including her assailant . ”
Leaving aside that kind of puffery and the low grade sentimentality , Salam was a member of a vulnerable population under the domination of the U.S. military occupation , who fought back and chose as his target a member of a U.S. military program .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack .
Ayala ’s defense claims , as the ultimate challenge to credulity , that the U.S. military is in Afghanistan to improve the lives of the Taliban .
The attack on Loyd is only incomprehensible to those who have been nurtured in the propaganda that stipulates that not only is God on America ’s side , America is God , and therefore any attack on an American , even one in military uniform and part of an invading force , is an attack on all that is good and holy .
Let it be noted that all of this is forthcoming in the same week as news of another indiscriminate massacre of Afghan civilians by the U.S. Air Force , with the deaths of at least 120 .
The following article by John Stanton , and the attached court document , were sent to me by John with permission to reproduce it here .
John Stanton ’s earlier articles on the Human Terrain System are also available here : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 .
A warning to readers : some of the photographs that follow show graphic violence .
Before anyone disingenuously protests that Paula Loyd is being used as a “ weapon ” by opponents of the Human Terrain System , let us keep the facts crystal clear : the only agencies that come anywhere close to having used Loyd almost literally as a weapon are the U.S. Government , the U.S. military , and the Human Terrain System specifically .
No longer able to use her as an instrument of war , HTS has found one more use for Loyd : cheesy propaganda that almost has Loyd jumping up , saluting , and winking , following her attack .
Americans can be wonderful , can do !
types in such familiar renditions of retro-style military propaganda .
Finally , I will respectfully disagree with John on the final section of his article , not necessarily on a factual basis , but for reinforcing the one - sided attention to women ’s rights that has become the standard for the war in Afghanistan , as if violence and discrimination against women , including the many reports of violent sexual assaults within the U.S. military itself , not to mention gay bashing ( both literal and otherwise ) , were somehow alien to the U.S. Paula Loyd did not need to travel to Afghanistan to encounter gender discrimination .
Paula Loyd did not need to travel to Afghanistan to “ help improve people ’s lives . ”
And the U.S. will not be teaching lawfulness and gender equality through illegal executions .
Regardless of the sentence , the case is a farce to begin with .
It is another in - house show trial for which the U.S. has become notorious in pursuing its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
ADDENDUM :
While it is highly unlikely that we will ever know the exact details of the event , especially as absolutely no Afghan eyewitnesses have ever been heard in any report , as if the entire village was absent , one can see from the photographs alone that some details of the official story are suspicious at best .
For example , there is no evidence in the photos of any market or bazaar , unless Afghans like to set up their goods in the village drainage ditch .
Yet HTS claims Paula Loyd was interviewing Abdul Salam in a market .
Also , given the depth of the scorching of the ground , and the details presented by John below , the notion that the flames were quickly or even immediately extinguished is hardly credible .
In addition , that ditch does not appear to be a “ stream . ”
One may suspect that by piling dirt on her open wounds , then dragging her on the ground , and then rolling her into what may be sewer water , that Loyd ’s injuries were significantly exacerbated .

USA v Don Ayala :
HTS Management , Army Leadership on Trial Too
06 May 2009
by John Stanton
“ This example also provides a glimpse into the type of person that is needed to operate in this environment and the training that must take place in order to effectively work with foreign nationals .
Not just anyone can do this kind of work , and there is a need for a set of inherent personality traits needed by operators in order to achieve the desired end state no matter the obstacle .
A degree of moral flexibility and an understanding the political and strategic significance of handling delicate cultural issues are just a few of the characteristic needed in order to function in this environment . ” – Major Kevin Burke , USA
On May 8 , 2009 at 9:00 AM Eastern ( USA ) Don Ayala , a member of a Human Terrain Team ( HTT ) operating in Afghanistan , will be sentenced by Judge Claude Hilton in the Eastern District Court of Virginia .
On February 3 , 2009 , Ayala pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter of Abdul Salam , an Afghan national who doused Paula Loyd , a fellow HTT member , with a lit container of flammable liquid and set her alight .
Loyd suffered burns on 60 percent of her body and ultimately succumbed to her wounds dying on January 7 , 2008 .
According to court filings , she was “ engulfed in a ball of flame large enough to force those near her to involuntarily back away to a distance of 3 to 5 meters ” .
Loyd screamed in agony as flesh and clothing burned .
A US platoon medic tried to put the fire out by using dirt but ultimately dragged her by her foot to a nearby drainage ditch where “ helmetfuls ” of water were applied to put out the flames .
All her clothing burned off leaving only her helmet and body armor intact .
According to court documents , Salam “ fled immediately from the scene and ran 50 meters towards Ayala .
Ayala drew his sidearm but did not fire and instead pinned Salam on the ground on a commonly traveled path .
Salam resisted violently but was eventually flex - cuffed and restrained with the assistance of members of the accompanying platoon .
Ayala kept his sidearm “ trained at Salam ’s head ” .
Moments later , a US soldier and interpreter approached Ayala and Salam .
The interpreter “ yelled at Salam , punched and kicked him and dragged him into an adjacent creek .
Ayala retrieved Salam from the creek and put him back on the path , ” pinning him down with knee to chest .
According to court documents , Ayala was advised of Loyd ’s status and subsequently shot Salam in the head killing him instantly .
Ayala agreed to the factual nature of these events and entered a plea of voluntary manslaughter .
A photographic packet contained within court filings [ see exhibits below ] shows US Army ’s Criminal Investigative Division ( CID ) personnel examining the scene and reenacting portions of the crime .
The same photographic packet contains an unsettling picture depicting the narrow pathway and the scorched earth where Loyd lay burning .
A picture of Salam ’s corpse is also included .
Tragic events like this one have followed every conquering force that has attempted to pacify Afghanistan .
Now it ’s the USA ’s turn .
The Ayala - Loyd - Salam tragedy could very well have been pulled from The Wasted Vigil by Nadem Salem , a novel of war and tragedy in Afghanistan .
The Wasted Vigil should be read by anyone deploying to Afghanistan .
Ayala ’s defense team has , as expected , argued that the act of manslaughter by Ayala ca n’t be decoupled from Salam ’s assault and , ultimately , murder of Loyd .
As such , the defense team argued that “ a sentence of three years of supervised probation is sufficient , but not greater than necessary , to comply with the sentencing set forth in 18 USC 3553 ( a ) [ Imposition of a Sentence , Factors , etc. ] .
Any imprisonment of Mr. Ayala would violate the stricture of 3553 ( a ) and further compound the tragedy … ”
According to court documents , Ayala , already suffering from prior “ dormant combat stress injuries ” described the thoughts he felt upon learning of Loyd ’s status that would ultimately determine Salam ’s fate .
“ I was overcome with the horror of what had been done to her , knowing that she was suffering and that she would never be the same , even if she lived .
Immediately after the incident I was allowed to go see Paula .
I will never forget hearing Paula cry “ I ’m cold ” over and over as the medic tried to treat her wounds . ”
Court filings reveal 54 letters of support have been written on behalf of Ayala .
The Times - Picayune of Louisiana has also posted a documentary video in support of Ayala here http://www.nola.com/news/?/base/news-1/124158792126600.xml&coll=1.

HTS , COIN , Involvement in Afghan - Pak on Trial
“ In this situation , all sense of fairness is shattered and the rules of combat broken .
This is not a scenario that anyone is trained for , prepared for … ” said LTC David Thomas , USA ( Ret. ) in a court filing supporting Ayala .
Rules of combat in Afghanistan ?
Fairness ?
Why not prepare ?
Why is this scenario not rehearsed for a country where “ western values ” do not apply to women ?
What the hell is going on with HTS and US Army leadership , training and recruitment !?
Does anyone involved ( contractors / government ) with US Army cultural , human , counterinsurgency efforts actually know what they are doing ?
Do they really know the environment to which they are sending warfighters and contractors ?
What ’s the end - game in Afghan - Pak ?
It is common knowledge that women who are unlucky enough to be born into various tribes in Afghanistan are generally treated horribly .
Women have few rights in Afghanistan save the right to be silent , and only speak when spoken to .
Beatings are common .
Being doused with acid is not uncommon .
Women are cautious about reporting crimes committed against them by their male counterparts .
“ In many parts of the country , a majority of women report being assaulted by their husbands .
Global Rights , a Washington , D.C. - based human rights organization , surveyed 5,700 households in 16 of the country ’s 32 provinces .
Fully 87.2 percent of respondents reported they had experienced at least one form of abuse , which included psychological , physical and sexual acts of violence as well as forced marriages .
Fifty - two percent of respondents reported physical violence ; many described being regularly punched , kicked , hit with sticks , cut with sharp objects , or having their hair pulled and clothes torn .
One child bride , for example , reported that she had been woken up one day by her in - laws pouring a kettle of scalding hot water over her body ( http://www.herizons.ca/node/263).
And it seems not much better for young males in Afghanistan .
According to Major Kevin Burke writing in Civil Reconnaissance : Separating the Insurgent from the Population , “ … incidents of homosexual rape and bestiality among the Afghans has become an excepted [ sic ] fact in working with the Afghan nationals and other predominately Islamic countries .
The act is not isolated within their military , but is practiced among the rural Afghan nationals and witness by most who spend any significant amount of time living among them .
This example also provides a glimpse into the type of person that is needed to operate in this environment and the training that must take place in order to effectively work with foreign nationals .
Not just anyone can do this kind of work , and there is a need for a set of inherent personality traits needed by operators in order to achieve the desired end state no matter the obstacle .
A degree of moral flexibility and an understanding the political and strategic significance of handling delicate cultural issues are just a few of the characteristic needed in order to function in this environment . ”
The Ayala - Loyd - Salam case is a portent for the larger tragedy that is sure to follow as America ’s attempt to Westernize Afghanistan and Pakistan gains momentum .

Four and one - half percent interest rates create some unique opportunites , defer some big problems , and create other problems .
The policy will probably save the Federal Reserve ’s member banks billions of dollars , and that is all they care about anyway .

The Third Wave — Pain
No compromising , a nation going blind
The leaders are on their knees
The third wave has just begun
When I first wrote about the impact of 4.5 % Mortgage Interest Rates , I decried the idea because the subsidy is obviously going to be temporary , and the removal of the artificial props will cause prices to resume their decline .
The impact of rising interest rates on future home prices is dramatic .
With more time to contemplate the impact of 4.5 % interest rates , I now see they open up unique opportunities for cashflow investors .
People buying for cashflow are not concerned with resale value because they do not intend to resell .
Profit and loss for a cashflow investor is determined by its income not its resale costs decades into the future .
The Federal Reserve with the blessing of the Treasury Department of the US Government is orchestrating 4.5 % interest rates to entice cashflow investors back into residential real estate .
Without cashflow investors this mess will never get cleaned up .
If prices fall low enough , and if interest rates drop low enough , returns to cashflow investors become very large .
In fact , they come to be greater than all competing investments in the marketplace .
Under those circumstances , money will flow back into residential real estate , and the plethora of foreclosures both on the market and in the pipeline can be absorbed by cashflow investors seeking superior returns .
The next several years represent a once - in - a - generation opportunity for cashflow investors to pick up long - term holds generating superior cash returns .
If lenders are stupid enough to inflate another real estate bubble later , profiting by appreciation would be a nice bonus to the cashflow investor .
The very low interest rates also create opportunities for people to purchase 20 + year homes at or below rental parity and avoid the pain of further price declines ; however , this is the harder play .
Few properties in Irvine are trading at or below rental parity , but they are common in desirable areas of Riverside County ( Yes , there are desirable areas there ) .
This NOT a play where you overpay today and wait for appreciation to catch up to you .
It only works if you are saving money over renting .
If there are properties in which you would be willing to live for the long term , and if they can be had for at or below rental parity , then you are only hurt by rising interest rates and declining prices if you must sell while resale values are depressed ( an event that happens more often than most believe ) .
Eventually–cue the 20 year holding time –fundamentals will rise to support prices at higher interest rates .
On an inflation adjusted basis , you can never recover from overpaying up front , but in nominal terms , there will come a point when you can get out at breakeven .
Keep in mind , you are trapped in an underwater situation once interest rates start going up and values start going down ; however , you are trapped in a property that still costs you less than renting , so you are far better off than the typical homedebtor trapped in their homes today .
Do I recommend this play ?
No .
But it is a legitimate way to acquire a property with 4.5 % interest rates and not get burned .
I still recommend waiting until ( 1 ) prices are even more depressed , ( 2 ) the foreclosure crisis begins to wane and ( 3 ) interest rates are higher .
You will get a better price , and you have the possibility of refinancing into a lower payment if interest rates drop again .
You can refinance into a lower payment , but not into a lower debt .
If you look at the cost of ownership for today ’s featured property , you see that it costs about $ 2,200 per month to own .
With 4.5 % interest rates , this is at least at rental parity and probably below it .
If someone can find a rental listing where an updated 1500 SF 3 /2 can be rented for $ 2,200 in Irvine , please post the link in the astute observations .
I believe this property is at rental parity –not that people would want to live here for 20 years .
To illustrate why this play does not work for any property other than a very long term hold , consider the impact of an increase in interest rates to 7.25 % illustrated below .
The long term historic average for mortgage interest rates is 8 % .
It is realistic to think we will see 7.25 % interest rates in the future .
When and if that happens , the value of this property would drop another $ 100,000 .
Is this property nice enough to be trapped in for 20 years ?
Everyone who understands credit cycles knows interest rates are going to rise , it is only a matter of when and how far .
As I outlined in Real Estate ’s Lost Decade if the FED can somehow control the rate at which interest rates rise , they may be able to hold prices relatively stable .
If they lose control ( likely ) and interest rates rise too fast , then prices will resume their descent .
Buying at 4.5 % interest rates is fraught with risk ; however , many people will buy once prices are at or below rental parity .
Usually , buying for cashflow is not quite so risky , but then again , our government usually does not manipulate home mortgage interest rates to such low levels to clean up after a housing bubble .
One of the first problems of the developing bubble was identified by bubble watchers as early as 2003 ; the widespread use of adjustable rate mortgages during a period of low interest rates .
Once interest rates go up , so do the payments on ARMs , and so do the foreclosure rates .
There are three types of ARMs : ( 1 ) amortizing , ( 2 ) interest - only , and ( 3 ) negatively amortizing .
When prices reached the practical limit of fixed - rate mortgages , many people turned to adjustable rate mortgages to increase affordability because they have lower interest rates .
At first people turned to amortizing ARMs , but that soon gave way to interest - only ARMs and finally to negatively amortizing ARMs .
When the FED aggressively moved to lower interest rates , many cheered that the ARM crisis was averted ; at best it was delayed .
The assumption most people made is that all the ARMs written are amortizing ARMs .
There is no payment shock with an amortizing ARM unless interest rates rise ; unfortunately , reality is that very few of the ARMs still utilized
by borrowers are amortizing ARMs .
The first wave of the foreclosure crisis was subprime .
That wave has crested , and its devastation is nearly done .
The second wave that is building now is caused by the deteriorating economy and ARM mortgage recasts ( Calculated Risk has a good post on this ) .
As I wrote in The ARM Problem , it is not the reset of interest rates that is the problem , it is the recasting to a significantly higher payment caused when the mortgage goes from interest - only to fully - amortized .
The negatively amortizing ARM , also known as an Option ARM is shown in
yellow on the chart above .
It is the most toxic loan product ever
conceived .
The Option ARM and the interest - only
ARM –and their associated recasts to amortizing loans–are the two loans responsible for the second wave of the
foreclosure crisis .
The third wave will come when everyone still clinging to their adjustable rate mortgage is wiped out by higher interest rates .
Everyone who does not refinance into a fixed - rate mortgage while interest rates are this low , and the fools who actually buy a property with an ARM while rates are at historic lows will all be wiped out during the third wave of the foreclosure crisis .
The timing of that wave is much harder to predict because nobody knows when interest rates will climb .
Four and one - half percent interest rates almost guarantee a third wave in the foreclosure crisis .
Perhaps everyone will purchase with or refinance into a fixed - rate mortgage and this crisis will be averted .
I doubt it .
Based on what is still happening in our mortgage market , it looks like this third wave is still coming .

They tried to build a nation , greater than anyone
But what they did n’t know was that someone else would have control
The mob starts infiltrating , at gunpoint they will roam
They show no mercy and the government is on their payroll
No compromising , a nation going blind
The leaders are on their knees
The third wave has just begun
The whole world is corrupted , it ’s spinning out of control
The third wave is on the roll
It ’’s slipping through our fingers and rising to the top
The third wave is on the roll
Roll with me , roll with me

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. unemployment rate soared to 8.5 percent last month , a 25 - year high , as employers slashed jobs and cut workers ’ hours to the lowest level on record , the government said on Friday .
In a report underscoring the economy ’s distress , the Labor Department said employers slashed 663,000 jobs in March and revised prior data to show job losses of 741,000 in January , the biggest decline since October 1949 .
February ’s drop in non-farm payrolls was unrevised at 651,000 .
But coming in the wake of recent economic data that has surprised on the upside , the report did little to alter perceptions that the economy ’s downward momentum is slowing , as unemployment tends to peak well after a recession ends .
The economy , now in its 16th month of recession , remained on track to recover in the second half of this year and the intense phase of job losses is likely over , economists said .
“ I do n’t think the recovery for the end of this year is derailed by this jobs report .
These are lagging indicators .
Job losses are down significantly from January , which may very well be the peak , ” said Bernard Baumohl , chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton , New Jersey .
U.S. stocks initially fell on the data but reversed course to end higher , cheered by solid earnings from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on efforts to stabilize banks .
The Dow Jones industrial ended up 39.51 points at 8,017.59 .
Government bond prices fell sharply , as some traders had braced for an even weaker jobs report .
Economists had expected non -farm payrolls to fall by a slightly less severe 650,000 jobs in March , but had anticipated the jump in the jobless rate from February ’s 8.1 percent .
The March unemployment rate was the highest since November 1983 , when the economy was recovering from the back - to - back recessions of 1980 and 1981 , the latter lasting 16 months .
Since the start of the current downturn in December 2007 , the economy has shed 5.1 million jobs , with about two - thirds of the losses occurring in the last five months , the department said .
In the first quarter of 2009 , 2 million jobs were lost .
WORST OF JOB LOSSES LIKELY OVER
“ What we saw today may indicate the intense portion of job declines may have reached its nadir , ” said Joseph Brusuelas , an economist at Moody ’s Economy.com in West Chester , Pennsylvania .
“ The fact that weekly jobless claims continue to increase and we have further auto cuts in front of us creates some risk . ”
To combat the deep recession , which is on track to become next month the longest downturn since the Great Depression , the government has put in place a $ 787 billion package of tax cuts and spending .
In addition , the Federal Reserve has pumped trillions of dollars into the economy .

Christina Romer , the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , called the job figures “ unquestionably horrible . ”
She told Reuters Television the economy should be growing by the year ’s end , but that jobs growth would lag .
“ As painful as it is to say , you have to be a little bit patient , that is unfortunately where we are , ” she said .
“ We are taking every action we can to make sure we do n’t see numbers like this a few months from now . ”
Job losses in March were broad - based .
Even government payrolls , normally resilient during downturns , contracted -- the first drop since December .
Only education and health services added jobs .
The manufacturing sector shed 161,000 jobs last month , after eliminating 169,000 positions in February .
Construction payrolls fell 126,000 after a 107,000 loss in February , and the service sector axed 358,000 positions after cutting 366,000 .
The report showed it has become increasingly difficult to find new jobs , with the number of Americans experiencing long spells of joblessness rising by 265,000 to 3.2 million .
Nearly one in four of the unemployed had been jobless for 27 weeks or more , the highest ratio since mid-1983 .
Rising unemployment is cutting into household incomes , which already have been decimated by the collapse in housing and stock prices , restricting consumers ’ spending ability .
A separate report showed activity in the service sector , which represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity , shrank for a sixth straight month in March .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s services index slipped to 40.8 from 41.6 in February , indicating a deepening contraction .
In the jobs report , a measure of unemployed people working part - time for economic reasons and those who have given up looking for work hit a record rate of 15.6 percent from 14.8 percent in February .
The length of the average work week fell to 33.2 hours in March , the lowest on records dating back to 1964 , from 33.3 hours the prior month , suggesting further job losses ahead and erosion of first - quarter output .
While payrolls generally lag the rest of the economy , economists cautioned that continued steep job losses could outweigh government efforts to resuscitate the economy .
“ The fiscal stimulus will be overwhelmed if the job market does not begin to stabilize in the coming months .
We will be keeping a close eye on jobless claims , ” said Ethan Harris , co-chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York .
Slate.com , “ It ’s time to move beyond those squiggly letter tests ” :
Any solution that could replace CAPTCHAs en masse would have to be free , work across a wide variety of platforms , and be easy for the average blogger or Web admin to install .
One of the reasons that CAPTCHAs have spread like kudzu , I suspect , is that they ’re so easy to implement — in some cases , as simple as checking a box on a site that helps you set up an input form .
The more a bot - fighting algorithm can insinuate itself behind the scenes , the better .
In the meantime , we ’ll all have to keep debating the eternal question :
Is that a W , or is it a V and an I attached at the hip ?
Why not just have a system like OpenID ?
Google knows you ’re a person : you send and receive a ton of gmail every day ; you make a bunch of human - like searches ; you ’ve been registered with them for years .
Why do n’t they just let us choose to log in ( like OpenID ) , then send the website their estimate of how spammy we are on a scale from 0 % to 100 % ?
Indeed , Google does n’t need to be the only one doing this .
Yahoo could do it too .
MS. Etc. Think OpenID .
The website you want to comment on could have a list of websites whose recommendations it trusts , it tells your browser about the sites on that list , and then if you decide you want to , you could click a button on your browser ( or in early versions of this , just fill in a form ) to give Google permission to give the website your spamminess rating .
Google could do different things on their end , like figure that people who want to comment on one thousand pages in a day are probably spammers .
As are people who just signed up and have n’t done anything human like yet .
It could take months of work for the spammer to make one account that Google considers to be possibly human – and then that account is labeled spam again after a single spamming spree !
There could also be a system where if the websites end up marking the comment as spam on their side , they could tell Google about it , which would also be bad for your humanness rating .
This idea is sort of like the web of trust model that semantic web people sometimes talk about … except as I see it , it has some chance of actually working .
Or am I crazy ?
Douglas Bowman , visual design lead at Google , says he ’s leaving the company because an obsessive , engineer - heavy , data driven - culture made it impossible for him to work there anymore .
After nearly three years at Google , where he built the design team that remains , Bowman admits that he does have something else lined up .
But in a candid blog post headlined " Goodbye Google " he says he got fed up with constant pushback from a bureaucracy that seeks empirical justifications for choices made within what is essentially is an art form — and often about relatively insignificant details .
" I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3 , 4 or 5 pixels wide , and was asked to prove my case , " said Bowman .
" I ca n’t operate in an environment like that .
I ’ve grown tired of debating such miniscule design decisions .
There are more exciting design problems in this world to tackle . "
He also brings up an anecdote mentioned in a recent New York Times article on Google 's vice president of search and user experience , Marissa Mayer , where Google could n’t decide between two blue colors and — so they conducted testing of 41 shades to see which performed better .
Despite her affinity for design , her background is in engineering , a common characteristic of Google staffers that Bowman openly criticizes .
" When a company is filled with engineers , it turns to engineering to solve problems .
Reduce each decision to a simple logic problem , " he writes .
" And that data eventually becomes a crutch for every decision , paralyzing the company and preventing it from making any daring design decisions . "
Bowman is an award winning designer who worked for Wired , and redesigned the website back in 2002 .
His work won him the attention and commissions to start up his own San Francisco - based design firm , Stopdesign , but put this work on hold in 2006 to work full time for Google .
His work there included the design of Google Calendar , which he says was
a design that hinted heavily in Gmail ’s direction ( so that Google Calendar would feel like a brand extension of
Gmail ) .
But it also consisted of design components and features that
Google had never offered before .
Consistent with Google ’s product philosophy , Google Calendar sought to be a game - changing web app that made online calendar creation , sharing , and publishing super simple .
The potential to impact the Internet giant ’s millions of users motivated him to make the switch , he says , but he found that there was little wiggle room for change .
" When I joined , I thought there was potential to help the company change course in its design direction , " he said .
" But I learned that Google had set its course long before I arrived .
Google was a massive aircraft carrier , and I was just a small dinghy trying to push it a few degrees North . "
Bowman also hinted at a Part 2 to his blog rant , which will include his plans with another company .

Dafür zahl ’ ich nicht !
Diese Seite ist nicht gegen das öffentlich - rechtliche Fernsehen – im Gegenteil : Sie will dafür kämpfen !
Doch was ist öffentlich - rechtliches Fernsehen überhaupt ?
Was dürfen wir Zuschauer erwarten , wenn wir jeden Monat stattliche 17,98 Euro bezahlen müssen ?
ARD und ZDF verlieren im Informationsbereich immer mehr an Glaubwürdigkeit , im Unterhaltungsbereich an Kompetenz , im Film - und Serienbereich erheblich an Niveau .
ARD und ZDF zeigen eine erschreckende Ideenarmut , neue Sendungen sind zumeist Ableger von abgestandenen privaten Ideen .
Zugleich werden anspruchsvolle Programmteile und Programme für Minderheiten immer mehr ins Nachtprogramm oder in digitale Spartenkanäle verdrängt .
Die Inhalte in ARD und ZDF gleichen immer mehr denen eines privaten TV - Angebots – nur mit weniger Werbeunterbrechung .

This is getting to be a habit .
During the stimulus debate , President Obama exploited Caterpillar and spread exaggerated claims about the massive spending program ’s effects on the manufacturer ’s jobs .
Caterpillar had to publicly refute Obama .
He ’s moved on to his government health care takeover plans .
And once again , the b.s. ’er - in - chief is using private industry to float inflating promises about the massive spending program .
The health care companies have now publicly refuted Obama :
Hospitals and insurance companies said Thursday that President Obama had substantially overstated their promise earlier this week to reduce the growth of health spending .
Mr. Obama invited health industry leaders to the White House on Monday to trumpet their cost - control commitments .
But three days later , confusion swirled in Washington as the companies ’ trade associations raced to tamp down angst among members around the country .
After meeting with six major health care organizations , Mr. Obama hailed their cost - cutting promise as historic .
“ These groups are voluntarily coming together to make an unprecedented commitment , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Over the next 10 years , from 2010 to 2019 , they are pledging to cut the rate of growth of national health care spending by 1.5 percentage points each year — an amount that ’s equal to over $ 2 trillion . ”
Health care leaders who attended the meeting have a different interpretation .
They say they agreed to slow health spending in a more gradual way and did not pledge specific year - by - year cuts .
“ There ’s been a lot of misunderstanding that has caused a lot of consternation among our members , ” said Richard J. Umbdenstock , the president of the American Hospital Association .
“ I ’ve spent the better part of the last three days trying to deal with it . ”
Nancy - Ann DeParle , director of the White House Office of Health Reform , said “ the president misspoke ” on Monday and again on Wednesday when he described the industry ’s commitment in similar terms .
After providing that account , Ms. DeParle called back about an hour later on Thursday and said : “ I do n’t think the president misspoke .
His remarks correctly and accurately described the industry ’s commitment . ”
O -nocchio !
In 1944 , a book was published that shook the intellectual and political cultures of the Western world .
Dedicated to “ The Socialists of All Parties , ” The Road to Serfdom was authored by the Austrian School economist Friedrich A. Hayek , who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 .
In his book , Hayek vividly showed that if unchecked , all forms of collectivism , including those under democracies , lead logically and inevitably to tyranny and autocratic rule and that if Great Britain , the United States , France , and other Western countries continue to embrace the socialist policies of central government planning they would be propelled into a vortex of despotism .
The book had a profound effect on the thinking of people worldwide and created a new wave of insight that hindered the growth of statism in many countries and reversed it in some .
However now , building upon a many decades - old escalation of government power in the U.S. , including the huge explosion of federal power and spending under George W. Bush , Barack Obama is proving to be not a champion of real change but a sorry caricature of the true believer in foolish pursuit of a dangerous agenda based on the exact myths of collectivism and statism that Hayek warned about .
Americans and people worldwide would be well - advised to read Hayek ’s great book , which after thirty - two printings is more timely now than ever .
In the meantime , here is a video based on the cartoon portrayal of the book as originally published in 1950 by Look Magazine .

Thursday , April 2 , 2009 GAZA CITY —
The Hamas regime acquired U.S. - origin air defense systems but was unable to use them in combat .
" We were disappointed by them , and they were found to have been useless , " a Hamas source said .
The source said Hamas smuggled four Stinger systems in 2008 .
The source said the Hamas military deployed the Stingers against Israel Air Force AH - 64 Apache attack helicopters during strike missions in the northern Gaza Strip .
Also In This Edition New , by Bill Gertz : ' Failure Factory '
" Our gunners could n't fire the weapon , " the source recalled .
" A notice came up on the display saying ' friendly aircraft . ' "
Industry sources said Raytheon , producer of Stinger , installed identification friend / foe capabilities more than a decade ago .
The sources said this would prevent Stinger from being fired against any aircraft used by the U.S. military .
Another Hamas source said gunners deployed Stinger along with heavy machine guns in attacks on Israeli helicopters during the war in the Gaza Strip .
The source said one Stinger surface - to - air missile was launched , but the projectile veered off course and struck a Hamas gunner squad .
" The Stinger was drawn by the heat of our guns rather than the engines of the Israeli helicopters , " the source said .
" At that point , we stopped using this weapon . "
The sources said Hamas has abandoned plans to acquire additional Stingers .
Instead , the Islamic army has been ordering the Russian - origin SA - 16 , or Igla - 1 , surface - to - air missile system , with a range of five kilometers .
COMMENT LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Comments
It 's ironic that Raytheon can make these missiles identify friendly or enemy aircraft , but these missiles are a threat to civilian airliners .
It 's also strange that Hamas is supposed to be supported by Iran , going through Egypt , but with U.S. missiles ???
These missiles were less than ten years old .
Where did they get them ?
Mike 8:50 a.m. / Monday , April 13 , 2009
This is how Hamas spends its " aid " money .

For three years , 2007 , 2009 and 2010 , the company ’s lobbyists pushed a bill called “ The Level Playing Field ” ; the number changed each year , but the language was essentially the same .
After three years of striking out , their bill made it through in 2011 as H129 .
While federal policy is to expand broadband access , NC has decided to limit it .
If you live in Wilson , your all - fiber optic network , Greenlight , was largely exempted from the new law .
Nearly 6,000 households and businesses subscribe to our services , however , the new law limits Greenlight to areas inside Wilson County only .

Chocolates as a Gift Idea .
‘’ All I really need is love , but a little chocolate now and then does n't hurt ” Lucy Van Pelt ( in Peanuts , by Charles M. Schulz )
When our mind is hovering over the idea of a perfect gift to send to our loved ones on any special occasion , the one thing that ’s always on the mind is chocolate .
Chocolates can make for an indispensable gift for everyone
The word " chocolate " is derived from the word Xocolate used in the acient times by the Aztecs of Mexico .
It is believed that Chocolate was first noted in 1519 when Spanish explorer Hernando Cortez visited the court of Emperor Montezuma of Mexico .
Native to lowland , tropical South America , cacao has been cultivated for at least three millenniums in Central America and Mexico , with its earliest documented use around 1100 BC .
The majority of the Meso - american people made chocolate beverages and made drinks out of chocolate .
The first use of cacao is said to have been at a site in Puerto Escondido , Honduras , dating from about 1100 to 1400 BC .
Send chocolates to India .
Chocolate is made from the beans of Cocoa .
From the cocoa bean pods the beans are separated after fermentation .
These beans are cleansed and then blown in a process to remove foreign particles and husk .
Then the kernel of the seeds is broken in small bits which are called nibs .
These nibs are ground finely to obtain what is called cocoa liquor .
The liquor when crystallized produces the dark chocolate which is the mother of virtually all other chocolates that are prepared .
Depending upon what goes into it there are many types of chocolates available now .
These types of chocolates include cocoa powder , dark chocolate , bittersweet chocolate , semi sweet chocolate , sweet dark chocolate , milk chocolate , white chocolate , Couverture chocolates , and Gianduja chocolates .
Chocolate is a popular gift item that you can give to anyone for any special occasion .
You can give chocolate to your loved one with a bunch of red roses .
You can wish your friend good luck with this delightful treat .
Parents can be greeted happy anniversary with a chocolate basket .
The best way to cheer up kids is by gifting them a box of chocolates .
No matter what the celebration is , chocolate gifts are sure to bring a smile to the faces of the people who are close to your heart .
A box full of delicious chocolates can be an ideal gift .
A variety of branded chocolates from Cadbury , Nestle , Vochelle , Ferrero Rocher can be included in the box , which is decorated for an artistic appeal .
If the recipient is a chocolate lover , he is sure to be delighted with the miscellany of white chocolate , dark chocolate , chocolate with nuts , fruits , and almonds .
Chocolates can also be moulded in different shapes like roses , stars , etc .
The chocolate roses can be sent decorated with red ribbons and nets .
Chocolates are a great gift for occasions .
What better way to say , “ I love you ” to that special someone than by gifting chocolates on Valentine 's Day !
Love and chocolates go hand in hand .
Birthdays are occasions which demand something sweet .
Chocolates to your loved ones on their Birthday will surely be the most preferred gift .
On a wedding ceremony , the best way to wish a newly wed couple is to gift them a pack of gourmet chocolates .
Chocolates can be treated to a couple on their Anniversary also .
Chcolates have such a magic that it can sweeten up any moment of life .
Moderate consumption of chocolates can have many benefits on the various aspects of our health .
Chocolates are made from cocoa and acts as a great antidepressant .
Chocolates act as a source of antioxidants and thus lower the threats of cancer and cardiac problems .
Naturally processed dark chocolates are an excellent source of flavonoids , which are a type of polyphenols , present in plants having antioxidant properties .
So the next time you want to bring back a smile on someone ’s face , cheer up a friend - send them a pack of assorted chocolates .
Be it Diwali , Easter , Holi , Christmas , Rakhi , Eid or any other festival , chocolates are the most precious gift item to send to your family , friends and loved ones .
When away from the family , chocolates can be a good long distance gift to send back home .
If you are in a hurry , simply give a single piece of chocolate bar as a gift .
Choose the favorite chocolate bar for that special person and tie a small ribbon around it and the gift is ready .
Chocolate gifts are indeed ideal for any occasion .
Whether it is a basket bursting with chocolate variants , a neatly wrapped chocolate gift box , or a simple chocolate bar , it is sure to make that special day more memorable .

The Highland Park home is on the market , with an asking price of $ 2.3 million .
The Highland Park house made famous by the 1986 movie " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off " is for sale .
The architecturally stunning , art - filled , 5,300 - square - foot house went on the market last week for $ 2.3 million .
Its most famous feature is its steel and glass " pavilion " that hangs over the ravine .
In the movie , an angry Cameron Frye sends his father 's rare Ferrari through its glass walls and into the woods .
" There 's been a lot of interest in it already , " says Sudler Sotheby 's International Realtor Meladee Hughes ( no relation to movie director John Hughes ) .
" It 's spectacular inside .
It 's like living in a tree house . "
The pavilion contains a wall of memorabilia dedicated to the movie , including pictures of actors Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck taken during the filming , Hughes said .
The owners were avid car collectors and the space is still used for special car events , such as a Ferrari Club meeting held there last weekend .
John Hughes , who still lives on the North Shore , has been informed that the house is for sale but so far they have not heard from him .

Since people can learn about Darwin and still believe that God created them , I am sure they can go on believing in God whatever science finds out about human nature .
So I am not as optimistic as Colin Blakemore .
As the giant combine harvester of science continues to round up the mousy believers in God , they will always find a way out – so , to stretch Colin 's delightful metaphor , they will sprout wings , dig tunnels , or get crunched to bits by whirring blades and still come out squeaking " God did all this for a purpose , to test our faith , and we are stronger for it . "
Leaving metaphors aside , determined believers may claim that God designed our brains to look as though natural selection designed them for religious belief ; that God , not natural selection , made us social creatures ; and that God endowed us with altruism and kindness .
Among the last defences , as Blakemore realises , are those central human capacities of consciousness and free will .
Surely God gave them to humans ( and to humans alone ? ) so that they could freely choose between good and evil , did n't he ?
Well no .
As Blakemore implies , the latest scientific theories suggest that both are more akin to visual illustions than powerful forces .
How can this be ?
It certainly feels as though I am conscious ; as though I am some kind of inner self who looks out through my eyes at the world around me , and inhabits my body like a driver inside a magnificent machine that does my bidding by the power of thought .
But this feeling is completely misleading .
When neuroscientists look inside brains they do not find what Dan Dennett calls the Cartesian Theatre – that magical place where decisions are made and consciousness happens .
There is no such place .
The brain is simply not organised that way .
Instead there are multiple parallel processes going on , no central headquarters , and no place where a self could lurk even if there were one .
For example , if a flying field mouse suddenly heads your way , you will probably either duck or catch it deftly .
These actions have to be fast , so they are coordinated by one part of the visual system , the dorsal stream , that completes its job well before the much slower ventral stream whose job it is to work out what that flying object is .
Brains are like this .
They do lots of things at once .
So why do we feel as though we are having a single stream of conscious experiences ?
Perhaps it was useful for our past survival to have a false model of ourselves , to attribute our body 's actions to an inner self , and to see the world in terms of spiritual forces and non-physical agents , when there are no such things .
Perhaps it is possible to give up these illusions by practising watching the mind .
Where I disagree with Blakemore is that these misconceptions are " no more significant than a visual illusion " .
I think that belief in the illusion of free will is highly significant and becomes more so the more science learns .
For example , our legal system is largely based on belief in free will , which leads us into all kinds of tangles .
For example , we accept that people who are too young or mentally disturbed are not responsible for their actions and should not be punished , while everyone else is .
But then along comes evidence that , for example , Mr G carries the " murderer gene " , or Ms T's kleptomania was caused by pre-natal trauma , or that Mr F could n't resist the advertisements for sweet foods that made him violent .
What do we do ?
We try to protect the idea of free will , while the possible space for its operation shrinks .
The combine harvester comes round again and the terrified field mice squeal " But you can't take away our consciousness and our free will !
The world will fall apart , our legal system will be destroyed , all hell will break loose . "
Like many naturalists , I say it wo n't , and it is high time we faced up to the changes we need to make .
We can do this personally by practising not thinking in terms of free will .
We can do it communally by realising that our legal system can punish wrongdoers not because they could have done otherwise and freely chose to be bad , but because some punishments are effective .
Indeed , I believe this approach would be better .
Instead of asking how much punishment someone deserves , we should ask what actions we can take to make this person behave better in the future , and others not follow this bad example .
More constructive use of prison and other kinds of sentences might even result .
So we should not despair .
I am sorry the field mice are so frightened of losing what they hold so dear .
I understand why they are , and why many will never give up their beliefs , but we are far better off taking scientific discoveries as our guide and finding out the truth about human nature and its origins .
A commenter named Christopher on the NORML Blog had this to mention about my previous Who Are You ? post :
I would like to know the percentage of smokers , from those charts , that are successful .
The biggest argument I hear is that Marijuana makes you lazy and unable to do real work .
So what percentage of average smokers are bums and what percentage are productive members of society ?
Ask and ye shall receive .
According to the Quick Tables at SAMHDA based on results from the 2007 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health , people who have smoked pot are better educated and work harder than people who never have smoked pot .
EMPLOYED
FULL TIME EMPLOYED
PART TIME UNEMPLOYED OTHER / NOT
IN LABOR FORCE NEVER USED MARIJUANA 48.7 % 56.5 % 46.2 % 73.7 % HAVE USED MARIJUANA 51.3 % 43.5 % 53.8 % 26.3 %
Now it ’s likely the employment data have changed since 2007 , but at first glance , it appears that the majority of people employed full - time and the majority of the unemployed have smoked marijuana .
The 43.5 % figure for the part time workers makes sense , if you figure that more low - skilled , part - time positions are likely to face a drug test .
Based on the responses , about two - thirds ( 67.8 % ) of all American adults are employed part - time or full - time , and the unemployed account for 3.2 % of all adults ( remember , 2007 figures , plus these numbers will vary from official unemployment statistics because some of those “ others ” would be counted as unemployed , but are n’t in this survey . )
But when you break these numbers down for only those American adults who have used marijuana , we find that over three - quarters ( 78.3 % ) of all marijuana users are employed part - time or full - time .
To be fair , a larger proportion ( 4 % vs. 3.2 % ) of marijuana users are unemployed than the proportion for all adults , but not so much as to be statistically significant .
There are 12.9 million American Adults , out of the 22 million total who have smoked at least once a year , who are employed full time .
When we break down their use by frequency , we find the largest proportion , well over a third ( 36 % ) of full - time employed marijuana smokers are using more than 100 days per year .
That ’s 4.7 million full - time employed chronic marijuana users – and they ca n’t all be snowboarders , rappers , and head shop owners .
Finally , almost half of American Adults who have one year or more of college education have smoked marijuana , while among those with only a high school diploma / GED or less educational attainment , about one - third have smoked marijuana .
I ’m not saying that smoking marijuana will make you smarter , but it seems the smarter you are , the more likely you ’ll smoke marijuana .
So there you have it .
The “ average ” pot smoker , if there is such a thing , is a white , college educated , full - time employed male under the age of fifty .
In other words … ME ! 🙂

North Korea 's concentration camps can be seen on Google By By Adriana Stuijt Feb 13 , 2009 in Politics
Those who have lived to tell the world about Camp 22 , located in the bleak northeastern tip of North Korea , can be counted on the fingers of one hand , and all of them are former guards or staff .
Incredibly , it 's about the size of Los Angeles .
That is how Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong
Il kept the secrets of Camp 22 inside its ten - foot wire fences and distinctive blocky guard posts for decades .
That changed when satellite photography went public .
Since then , Google Earth has revealed the world ’s most secret places to armies of amateur “ squints . ”
Satellite photography was available to the human rights researcher David Hawk when he set to work on “ The Hidden Gulag , ” his ground - breaking study of North Korea ’s forced labor camps .
Hawk ’s interviews with survivors and former guards alone would not have had the same impact had those witnesses not been able to point to those photographs and say , “ This is the detention center , ” he said .

For Google Earth newbies , you can download the program Google Earth ’s high - resolution imagery covers less than half of Camp 22 , it is said to hold 50,000 men , women , and children .
One can only see one portion of the camp with Google Earth ’s high - resolution photography .
A camp the size of Los Angeles
The yellow scale line to the right of the fence line is just shy of 14 miles .
According to “ The Hidden Gulag , ” the whole camp is 31 miles long by 25 miles wide .
That works out to over 700 square miles , but if one makes allowances for the camp ’s irregular shape , a rough estimate of 500 square miles seems more likely .
That would make it as big as the city of Los Angeles .
Where high - resolution photography is available , it ’s not hard to see the fence line punctuated at intervals of about 1200 feet by guard posts , buttressed , in places , by smaller guard shacks .
There are unusual ditches , which could be “ land mines and man-traps . ”
It ’s impossible to draw any firm conclusion , but these ditches could be “ tiger traps ” whose coverings have weathered away .
It ’s certainly hard to imagine what other reason there could be for digging trench lines like this along the fence line of a forced labor camp .
The camp is in a remote area , surrounded mostly by forest .
In a few areas , however , just beyond the fence , the lives of North Korea ’s peasant farmers , such as they are , go on .
They cannot read foreign newspapers , listen to foreign broadcasts , possess cell phones or radios that can pick up unauthorized broadcasts , express unauthorized opinions , or travel abroad without fear of entering this gate .
The state owns everything , including the meager rations they grow , and on which they live .
Still , for farmers in North Korea , survival is a little easier than it is for workers in the blighted factory towns where unemployed survivors of the Great Famine still live by stripping the ruins of copper wire .
Just the same , one suspects that the farmers know what ’s good for them .
Most likely , they stay away from the fence , keep their eyes on the soil , and never mention it .
The camp ’s presence is impossible to ignore completely when it intrudes into the lives of those who live near it , of course .
While living in Seoul , a Korean - American teacher , Joseph Songhoon Lee , taught a defector who had lived just outside the camp ’s gate .
Lee described the defector ’s experiences in a recent article for the Washington Post : " He graduated from School 34 a few weeks ago and is studying at Sungkyunkwan University , one of the nation ’s top colleges .
He grew up a few minutes away from one of North Korea ’s most notorious political prisons , Prison 22 in Hyeryung , Ham - Kyung Province , at the northern tip of North Korea .
Because food and alcohol are scarce in the countryside , the prison guards went to my house for libations .
“ They always drank heavily , ” he told me .
“ And when they got drunk , they would mumble about how sorry they felt for what they did to prisoners . ” / see
Of all of North Korea ’s network of labor camps and detention facilities , large and small , Camp 22 is the most terrible .
There are reports of inhuman experiments carried out on men , women , children , and even infants sent there .
The BBC reports that North Korea ’s system of spying , thought - control , isolation , and terror may have no equal in human history .
That is how Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong
Il kept the secrets of Camp 22 inside its ten - foot wire fences and distinctive blocky guard posts for decades .
That changed when satellite photography went public .
Since then , Google Earth has revealed the world ’s most secret places to armies of amateur “ squints .
” Satellite photography was available to the human rights researcher David Hawk when he set to work on “ The Hidden Gulag , ” his ground - breaking study of North Korea ’s forced labor camps .
Hawk ’s interviews with survivors and former guards alone would not have had the same impact had those witnesses not been able to point to those photographs and say , “ This is the detention center , ” he said .
“ If someone goes inside this building , in three months he will be dead or disabled for life .
In this corner they decided about the executions , who to execute and whether to make it public .

History is full of faked deaths and re-appearances of people long thought dead , but there are also a small number of people who did most likely die , but become the center of theories that claim they live .
This list looks at ten of the most well know deaths that have fueled the fires in the minds of conspiracy theorists .
10 Tupac Shakur 1971 - 1996
Tupac , was a rapper who was killed in a drive - by shooting .
The murder remains unsolved , inspiring many theories over who was responsible .
In addition , many fans insisted that Tupac was still alive .
The rumors were partly fueled by Tupac ’s release of eight albums in the decade after his death .
In a strange coincidence , the first of those albums included the song “ Blasphemy ” on which Tupac raps “ Brother ’s getting shot and coming back resurrected . ”
9 Andy Kaufman 1949 - 1984
The offbeat comedian , best known for playing Latka on the TV series Taxi , died from lung cancer at age 35 .
Partly because he had kept his illness a secret almost until the day he died , many fans thought the death announcement had been staged as an elaborate prank .
Kaufman ’s frequent collaborator , fellow comedian Bob Zmuda , admitted that he and Kaufman had discussed faking his death and he seemed “ obsessed with the idea . ”
However , in a 1999 interview Zmuda declared , “ Andy Kaufman is dead .
He ’s not in some truck stop with Elvis . ”
Just in case , Kaufman ’s friends held a “ Welcome Home Andy ” party on the 20th anniversary of his death .
The guest of honor failed to appear .
8 Elvis Presley 1935 - 1977
There have been thousands of sightings of the King since his death .
At the funeral , Elvis ’ father Vernon allegedly acknowledged that the corpse in the coffin did not look like his son .
He said that Elvis was “ upstairs , ” adding , “ We had to show the people something . ”
Presley was also said to have been fascinated with The Passover Plot by Hugh Schoenfield , who speculated that Jesus ’ resurrection was faked with a drug that temporarily made him appear dead .
Presley , no stranger to prescription drugs , may have had the knowledge to pull off a similar scheme .
7 Jim Morrison 1943 - 1971
In March of 1971 , Morrison , lead singer of the Doors , moved to Paris to write poetry .
On Friday , July 2 , Morrison left his apartment , telling his girlfriend , Pamela Courson , that he was going to see a movie .
On Monday , Courson called Elektra Records representative Bill Siddons and told him to come to Paris .
When he arrived , Siddons found Courson , a sealed coffin and a death certificate saying that Morrison had died from a heart attack .
Exactly what had happened that weekend remained a mystery .
Despite the claim on the death certificate , rumors suggested that an overdose of drugs or alcohol had killed Morrison .
Unconfirmed reports that the singer had been spotted boarding a plane that weekend fueled speculation that he was still alive .
Even Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek said in a 1973 interview , “ I do n’t know to this day how the man died and in fact I do n’t even know if he ’s dead .
Nobody ever saw Jim Morrison ’s body … it was a sealed coffin .
So who knows , who knows how Jim died . ”
6 Adolf Hitler 1889 - 1945
Hitler and his bride of one day , Eva Braun , committed suicide in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery on April 30 , 1945 .
The next day , German radio announced that the fuehrer had died leading his troops in battle .
The Soviet news service
Tass picked up the report but added that “ by spreading the news of Hitler ’s death , the German Fascists apparently wish to give Hitler the means of leaving the stage and going underground . ”
During the Potsdam Conference in July , Joseph Stalin insisted that Hitler had escaped to either Spain or Argentina .
In fact , by this time the Russians possessed the remains of Hitler and Braun , having recovered them from the bomb crater they had been buried in .
When Soviet autopsy reports on the pair were released in 1968 , they showed that the bodies had been positively identified as Hitler and Braun from dental records .
Despite this evidence , alleged sightings of Hitler continued .
5 Grand Duchess Anastasia 1901 - 1918
The youngest daughter of Nicholas II , the last tsar of Russia , was shot with the rest of the royal family by a Communist firing squad .
Over the years , several women declared themselves to be Anastasia .
The most famous was Anna Anderson , who began making her claims after being rescued from a Berlin canal in 1920 .
She later lost a lawsuit in which she sought to be recognized as a Romanov heir , married Jack Manahan and settled in Virginia , where she died in 1984 .
A decade after her death , DNA testing established that Anna Anderson Manahan was not related to the Romanovs but instead came from a Polish family , the Schanzowskis , as her detractors had long claimed .
4 Jesse James 1847-1882
In 1948 , a 100 - year - old Oklahoma man named J. Frank Dalton announced that he was Jesse James , who officially had been killed by Robert Ford 66 years earlier .
Dalton convinced writer Robert Ruark and Rudy Turilli , an acknowledged expert on James , of his claims .
The man allegedly killed in James ’ stead was another outlaw , Charlie Bigelow .
Reportedly , when James ’ mother was first shown the body of the man Ford had shot , she blurted out , ‘ No , gentlemen , that is not my son . ’
However , in 1995 , the body buried in Jesse James ’ grave was exhumed for DNA testing .
The results confirmed that it was the famed outlaw .
3 Alexander I 1777 - 1825
Towards the end of his reign , the Russian tsar expressed to his family and close friends a desire to give up his throne .
During an inspection tour of the Crimea in the winter of 1825 , Alexander died suddenly of either malaria or pneumonia .
He was buried in a closed casket .
The hazy circumstances of his death fed rumors that Alexander had faked his death and secretly abdicated .
Feodor Kuzmich , a wandering holy man who died in Siberia in 1864 , was rumored to have been the former emperor .
Further enhancing the mystery around the Tsar , in 1925 the Soviets opened Alexander ’s tomb and did not find a body .
2 Louis XVII 1785 - 1795
The dauphin , heir to the throne of France , died in prison of tuberculosis during the French Revolution .
Even before the death was announced , rumors circulated that royalist sympathizers had freed him and replaced him with a double .
Madame Simon , the wife of the jailer , asserted that Louis had been smuggled out of prison in a basket of dirty laundry and replaced by a child with rickets .
Eventually , over a hundred royal pretenders claimed his identity , a situation Mark Twain satirized in the duke and “ dolphin ” sections of Huckleberry Finn .
1 Jesus Christ
Obviously this is a complicated item as many people ( over 1 billion in fact ) believe that Jesus rose from the dead .
But we are not talking about the resurrection aspect of Christ – we are talking about what happened later .
According to Christianity , Jesus ascended into heaven after his resurrection – and was henceforth gone from the world .
But some people believe that he continued to live for a longer period of time and , believe it or not , went to America and taught the people there a new gospel .
It is , of course , the Mormons who believe this .
There are even some people who believe that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and lived a long life bearing many children .
The many blessings of rural life generally need to be set against one huge drawback : bad Internet connections .
Both urban and rural Internet use have soared in the US over the last few years , but some new number - crunching from the US Department of Agriculture puts a number on the urban / rural gap : 9.3 percent .
72.6 percent of urban Americans use the Internet somewhere ( though not necessarily at home ) , but among rural residents that number falls to 63.3 percent .
The reasons for the discrepancy are n't hard to come by ; as the USDA 's " Rural Broadband At A Glance 2009 " suggests , the difference is likely chalked up to " the higher cost and limited availability of broadband Internet in rural areas . "
But despite the higher cost and lower availability in all rural areas , Internet access is surprisingly variable when you break down the country by geography .
For instance , Internet usage at home is 61.7 percent in the urban South , a number actually on par with the rural Northeast ( 61 percent ) .
The rural South does far worse , turning in the lowest scores in the country .
Only 46.4 percent of rural Southerners have Internet access at home , making the rural South the only part of the US to see in - home Internet usage rates of less than 50 percent .
Data source : USDA
And the lower usage rates are n't due to some " farmers do n't need the Internet " attitude .
Internet access is about far more than Facebook and YouTube ; between 2005 and 2007 , farmers ' use of the Internet for business more than doubled from 30 percent to 63 percent .
And , for household use , " online purchases now replace the once common Sears and Roebuck catalog . "
Making Internet access faster and more affordable is n't a balm for every woe — " local banks must compete with Internet - only banks , " for instance — but it does so many good things that the USDA wants to make the service more available for those who want it ( though the Pew Internet & American Life Project shows that a good chunk of those without any Internet access at all do n't actually want to be online ) .
To do so , the agency has a new $ 2.5 billion pot of cash that it was given as part of the broadband money from the recently - passed stimulus bill ( the rest will be doled out by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ) .
USDA , NTIA , and the Federal Communications Commission are hosting a public meeting in Washington on March 10 to start thinking through how best to issue grants and loans with the money , an indication that they intend to move quickly on projects .
Unfortunately , good data on Internet speeds and availability is lacking , largely due to weaknesses in FCC data collection .
" Broadband " has long been defined as anything faster than 200 Kbps , for instance , and an ISP is said to " serve " an entire ZIP code if it serves even a single customer there .
At least the USDA is aware of the issue , and its report calls out the FCC over the data , saying that " results reported here should be interpreted with these limitations in mind . "
One hopes that , given the limitations of the data , grants and loans for rural areas will be well - targeted and effective , though we'd feel a lot better about that possibility if the USDA had some truly excellent data to begin with .
Lawrence Kaplan ( with Bill Kristol )
February , 2003 :
The United States may need to occupy Iraq for some time .
Though the UN , European and Arab forces will , as in Afghanistan , contribute troops , the principal responsibility will doubtless fall to the country that liberates Baghdad .
According to one estimate , initially as many as 75,000 US troops may be required to police the war ’s aftermath , at a cost of $ 16 billion a year .
As other countries ’ forces arrive , and as Iraq rebuilds its economy and political system , that force could probably be drawn to several thousand soldiers after a year or two .
After Saddam Hussein has been defeated and Iraq occupied installing a decent democratic government in Baghdad should be a manageable task for the United States .
Now here 's Kaplan in March 2006 :
The administration intends to draw down troop levels to 100,000 by the end of the year , with the pullback already well underway as U.S. forces surrender large swaths of the countryside and hunker down in their bases .
The plan infuriates many officers , who can only say privately what noncommissioned officers say openly .
" In order to fix the situation here , " Sabre Squadron 's Sergeant José Chavez says , " we need at least 180,000 troops . "
Iraq , however , will soon have about half that .
An effective counterinsurgency strategy may require time and patience .
But the war 's architects have run out of both .
And now , naturally , in May 2007 he says congressional liberals are ignorant about Iraq .
UPDATE : It should be said , though , that if you want bad Iraq commentary , accept no substitutes for Martin Peretz 's article .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Gov. David A. Paterson and leaders of the Legislature have reached a deal to temporarily raise taxes on New York ’s highest earners in order to close the state ’s yawning budget deficit , lawmakers and officials involved in the talks said on Saturday .
The new plan , which would expire after three years , would represent the largest state income tax increase in recent history , significantly larger than the surcharges imposed from 2003 to 2005 , when the state last faced a major recession .
The plan would raise $ 4 billion a year by creating two new tax brackets , the highest one affecting those who earn $ 500,000 or more .
If approved by rank - and - file lawmakers in the Assembly and State Senate , the tax increases would be a major victory for unions and liberal advocacy groups and a signal of the new balance of power in Albany , where Democrats won control of both houses of the Legislature and the governor ’s office in last year ’s election .
Although the proposed tax has been called a “ millionaires ’ tax , ” it would affect those with incomes starting at $ 300,000 , who would be taxed at a rate of 7.85 percent .
The highest bracket would carry a tax rate of 8.97 percent  the same as New Jersey ’s current highest rate .
* Juli Berwald is a freelance science writer living in Austin , Texas .
Her Ph.D. in Ocean Science is from the University of Southern California .
On March 25 , she presented her testimony before the Texas State Board of Education in its final public hearing regarding revisions to the state 's science education standards .
The final vote took place two days later .
The words " strengths and weaknesses " were dropped , but language ** was adopted that * questions evidence for evolution in the fossil record and challenges the Big Bang .
Just hours before the Texas State Board of Education held its final hearings on the science education standards that would be put in place for the next decade , I set my kitchen timer for three minutes .
I practiced my testimony among open jars of peanut butter and jelly strewn about from making kids ' lunches .
Ding .
I still had my conclusion to read .
What could I cut ?
For months I had been slinking around the controversy in Texas .
I had gone to every public hearing , sitting on the floor in the back of the packed room .
Behind rows of folding chairs , I had gotten to know the voices , if not the faces , of the board members .
At issue was the wording of a science standard that states students must be taught the " strengths and weaknesses " of evolution .
Since Kansas passed similar legislation in 2005 and Dover , Pennsylvania , in 2006 , scientists have viewed these three words as a means for inserting the creationist theology that goes under the name " intelligent design " into science classes .
The language has never persisted .
Federal Courts have struck down teaching of supernatural explanations of the origin of the species , citing separation of church and state .
Still , scientists see those words as a serious affront to the teaching of rigorous science .
I handed 35 copies of my written testimony to the clerk and clutched a version in my sweaty palms .
I listened as a fifth and sixth grade teacher with 35 years of experience said that denying the teaching of weaknesses in evolution was akin to shutting down creative inquiry .
The 15 board members were seated in an oval , the state seal of Texas emblazoned into the leather chair backs just above their heads .
I looked around the oval , knowing that seven members would never agree with me .
" Thank you to the Board of Education for taking my testimony , " I began .
" For the last decade I have worked in the textbook publishing industry : writing , editing and developing curricula for science textbooks .
While I am certain of my expertise writing scientific text , I do n't want , nor should you want me to have , the responsibility for writing textbooks containing information that is not scientific fact . "
I concluded with the paragraph that had n't fit when I practiced in my kitchen .
" I urge you to uphold language that supports the rigorous teaching of evolution to our students .
I would n't want students to read fiction in a history book and try to determine which part of their text is historical fact .
Why would you want students to read non-scientific ideas in a science book ? "
Questions followed .
" If the language ' strengths and weaknesses ' were included in the standard , would you feel the need to include weaknesses of evolution in your text ? "
My voice was tight and throaty .
" It 's really hard to come up with scientifically based weaknesses to evolution . "
The intelligent - design supporters exploded in protest .
The chairman banged his gavel repeatedly .
" I will not have that kind of outburst in this room .
If it happens again , I 'll clear the room and we 'll only have the testifiers in here .
I 'll do it ! "
Next question .
" If the language ' analyze and evaluate ' were included in the standard would you feel an onus to include weaknesses of evolution in your text ? "
My mind raced .
Is there any way ' analyze and evaluate , ' which seems like reasonable language , might be just another way to say ' strengths and weaknesses ? '
" Not an onus . " I finally squeaked .
What makes this debate so heated ?
In the hearing room , when creationists bring up weaknesses in evolution , scientists are baffled .
When evolutionists say that nothing in biology makes sense without evolution , creationists are baffled .
Science is about explaining the how of the natural world : how the universe began , how life originated , how the diversity of species occurred .
Scientists feel no need for their work to answer why the universe exists , why we are here .
For scientists , those are questions better left to philosophy , religion and after - work hours .
Perhaps creationists find theories that only answer how to be completely unsatisfactory .
Maybe for creationists , any theory that does n't answer why contains weaknesses .
Is this discrepancy the reason the " weaknesses " of evolution that creationists speak of so passionately are so casually dismissed by scientists ?
Gaps in the fossil record , the geologically fast explosion of species in the Cambrian , and the complexity of the bacterial flagella are issues that are not fully understood .
But scientists insist that given tools , time and the fundamental ideas of evolution , they will be solved .
Even if science could give creationists solutions to some of these issues , evolution is never going to answer their most pressing questions :
Why are we here ?
Why were we given consciousness ?
What is the meaning of life ?
Only alternative , supernatural explanations of the natural world , the type espoused by intelligent design , can answer those questions .
Maybe evolutionists and creationists can't find common ground because they really are n't even having the same argument .
Scientists are fighting to preserve their ability to answer how unimpeded by why .
Creationists are fighting to have answers to why , unthreatened by answers to how .
As I walked away from the podium , a man approached me holding a magazine with a tree of life strewn across the cover .
" Have you heard about lateral gene transfer ?
Do n't you think it proves evolution is n't real ? "
" No . " I snapped .
" It does n't prove it at all . "
I hurried toward the back of the room and sat down in my comfortable spot on the floor .

Linux only : Reader Chris writes in with an excellent tip that changes the prompt to red when using the root account from the terminal — as a reminder to be more careful .
Using the tip is relatively simple — just edit the / root /. bashrc file and add in the following , preferably commenting out the existing lines that set the color , though you can simply add this line to the end of the file .
PS1='${debian_chroot :+( $ debian_chroot ) }\[ \033[01;31 m\] \u@\h\[ \033[00 m\ ] :\[ \033[01;34 m\ ] \w\ [ \033[00 m\ ] \$ '

Once you 've added this line , anytime you switch to using the root shell you will see the prompt in red with white text for the command line .
Chris takes it further , with a line that turns the prompt green for regular users , which you can enable by adding the following to your ~/. bashrc file :
PS1='${debian_chroot :+( $ debian_chroot ) }\[ \033[01;32 m\] \u@\h\[ \033[00 m\ ] :\[ \033[01;34 m\ ] \w\ [ \033[00 m\ ] \$ '
This tip can really come in handy if you have a bunch of terminal windows open at once , so you can tell at a glance which ones are using root mode and which are n't .
Thanks ,
Chris !

You may have heard by now that Wizards of the Coast has removed all its PDF products from sale , including both current edition and legacy AD&D products .
Sites including Paizo and RPGNow have been asked to remove around 900 Wizards of the Coast products from sale , taking the company from the biggest supplier on RPGNow to a conspicuous zero .
Customers of PDF retailers have also found that Wizards of the Coast has revoked their right to download or re-download PDFs they ’ve already purchased .
I ’m particularly annoyed with this , as I ’ve lost three PDFs on Paizo.com and one on RPGNow .
Several well - known industry figures have also voiced their dissatisfaction , including Stan ! , JD Wiker , Eric Haddock , Sean K Reynolds .
So why are they doing it ?
Here ’s a round - up of the conspiracy theories .
1 . It ’s in response to PDF piracy
This appears to be the official company response .
According to an announcement posted on ENWorld :
Unfortunately , due to recent findings of illegal copying and online distribution ( piracy ) of our products , Wizards of the Coast has decided to cease the sales of online PDFs .
We are exploring other options for digitial distribution of our content and as soon as we have any more information I ’ll get it to you .
This tactic may be less successful than Wizards hopes .
Customers locked out of their existing PDFs may turn to filesharing sources to recover them , and this in turn may act as a gateway to heavier filesharing .
There has also been significant PR backlash on internet forums painting Wizards of the Coast as the bad guy , and D&D players more than anyone might believe that it ’s okay to steal treasure from a villain .
2 . It ’s part of Wizards ’ new Internet Sales Policy
On the same day that all PDFs were cancelled , Wizards of the Coast enacted a new Internet Sales Policy restricting how products are sold online .
In particular , the new policy forbids retailers from selling online unless they have a physical presence .
However , this contract only seems to cover Magic : the Gathering products .
RPGNow never sold Magic cards , and Paizo continues to sell Magic cards and D&D print books .
There ’s also nothing forcing websites to sign the agreement .
3 . Wizards is trying to cripple third edition / OGL retailers
One theory doing the forum rounds is that Wizards are withdrawing their products to kill off support for third edtion .
By removing third edition books from sale , the theory goes , 3E players are forced to update to 4E by a lack of official WotC PDFs , while the diminished traffic hurts PDF resellers and other publishers .
However , it ’s doubtful that Wizards third edition PDFs sold especially well .
None appeared on RPGNow ’s Top 100 Products list last week , according to a Google cached version of the site .
Of twelve WotC products that made the list , eleven were fourth edition products , including two in the top ten .
If this is their plan , it ’s backfiring : several major publishers are using the opportunity to offer PDF customers their thanks and appreciation .
Malhavoc has made an announcement , Green Ronin is offering a 40 % discount on True20 , White Wolf is offering a free copy of Exalted Second Edition and a 10 % discount , and Paizo is offering a 35 % discount on all Pathfinder products .
4 . It has something to do with Dave Arneson
Speculation has arisen that the PDF issue relates to rights that recently lapsed after Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Dave Arneson passed away recently .
However , there are two problems with this theory .
The first is that Arneson is still alive , if not “ alive and well ” .
The second is that it ’s likely Arneson signed away all rights to D&D long ago , except for a credit in every D&D sourcebook .
5 . It ’s an RIAA - style tactic to provoke PDF piracy
The Recording Industry Association of America has taken a lot of bad PR over the past few years for an infamous anti-piracy tactic : wait until until someone downloads an album , then sue them for $ 150,000 per song .
With Wizards ’ recent lawsuit against eight filesharers , some have suggested that they ’re picking up on the RIAA strategy of monetizing piracy at the cost of consumer goodwill .
Wizards ’ critics would n’t rule this out , but it ’s a little far - fetched .
6 . Wizards are going to sell D&D PDFs themselves
PDF sites like RPGNow charge a commission on sales .
That cuts into WotC ’s profit margin , when they could be selling on their own site for free .
This would conveniently take sales away from competitors while allowing finer control of anti-piracy features such as watermarking and DRM .
This is a reasonably likely outcome .
There ’s a clear demand for PDF versions of D&D products , and keeping PDFs from sale wo n’t stop piracy as long as pirates have flatbed scanners and filesharing software .
What does counter piracy is for customers to trust that publishers take great efforts to treat their fans as people and not revenue streams .
According to a post by RPGNow ’s Steve Wieck , it seems likely that WotC will restore downloads for customers who had already purchased WotC products .
This would makes a good step toward restoring consumer trust in Wizards of the Coast .
Importantly , it would also let me finish my download of The Great Modron March .

Shani Shingnapur , also known as Sonai , is a village in the Indian state of Maharashtra .
Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmadnagar district , the village is known for its popular temple of Shani , the Hindu god of the planet ( graha ) Saturn .
Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors , only door frames .
Despite this , no theft is reported in the village .
Villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key .
Legend says that the temple is a “ jagrut devasthan ” ( lit. “ alive temple ” ) , meaning that the god here is very powerful .
They believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft .
Devotees , pilgrims and tourists arriving in Sonai can leave their valuables in a car or bus with all the doors unlocked and not worry about anyone stealing it .
The only barrier to enter a house are curtains which keep out stray animals .
People believe that nobody dares to steal anything because they are punished by Shanishwara , the local deity , and the owner has always got the stolen things back – if any such thing ever happens .
The village has a post office and a high school known as Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad .
The chief source of water supply in the villages is wells .
Shrine of Shani
The shrine for Shani compromises of a five and a half feet high black rock installed on an open - air platform , which symbolizes the god Shani .
A Trishula ( trident ) is placed along the side of the image and a Nandi ( bull ) image is on the south side .
In front are the small images of Shiva and Hanuman .
Generally , the temple has 30 - 40,000 visitors a day , which swells to around three lakh ( i.e. three hundred thousand ) on amavasya ( the new moon day ) , believed to the most auspicious day to appease Lord Shani .
The village holds a fair in honor of the deity on this day .
A bigger fair on new moon days that fall on Saturdays .
Devotees bathe Lord Shani ’s image with water and oil and offer flowers .
A palanquin procession of Shani is held on the day of the fair .
Other festivals include the birthday of Shani , Shani Jayanti .
Devotees generally wear a saffron - coloured attire and have a head bath in the holy water close to the temple before entering it .
There is no priest to perform the pooja .
The pooja is carried out in the form of offering Pradakshinams – of going around the idol a couple of times , chanting specific prayers such as Shani gayathri and slokas .
Devotees also perform Abhishekam with water and gingelly oil .
Some facts about Shani Shingnapur
1 . The idol is out in the open , as the Lord made it clear in various ways to his devotees , that He did not want to be covered .
2 . The temple is open for everyone twenty - four hours .
Even at night , men ( women are not allowed near the deity ) can bring the puja material and perform all prayers by themselves .
3 . No house / shop in the village has doors .
It ’s believed that the deity protects them and if someone tries to steal or do something wrong , they would be paralyzed .
Getting There
Road
Shani Shingnapur is 350 km from Mumbai and to reach there it ’s best to hire a taxi from Mumbai .
Long - distance cabbies from Mumbai take about 7 hours to reach Shani Shingnapur .
Although there are MSTC ( Maharashtra State Transport Corp ) buses from Mumbai to Shirdi ( 60 km from Shani Shingnapur ) and privately - operated buses as well , locals advise not to attempt the bumpy , shaky ride on the MSTC buses , nor the long , frequent - stopping private buses .
Air
The nearest airport is Aurangabad ( 144 Km ) which is connected by Indian Airlines and private airlines with other cities / towns .
Rail
Trains from Mumbai leave for Nasik ( 123 Km ) and Manmad ( 60 Km ) .
Accommodation
The village , being a very small one , does not offer any accommodation for the devotees , though there is a Dharmastala nearby where the devotees are fed .
Since the village is about 60 km. from Shirdi , it is advisable to stay at Shirdi and visit this unique temple .
“ Those decisions will be made by people in the state , and our members in the state know who will stand with them , ” Trumka said on the ABC News daily webcast “ Top Line . ”
“ And if Arlen Specter — he stood with them in the past — if he continues to stand with them , they ’ll support him .
If he does n’t , they wo n’t support him . ”
“ There will be opposition to Specter in the Democratic ranks , ” said Pennsylvania GOP political analyst Charlie Gerow .
“ It was believed that the governor would be able to muscle out the Democratic opposition , and that has n’t taken place . ”
Toomey has n’t exactly caught the fancy of his party , either .
Almost as soon the reality sunk in that the conservative former three - term congressman could be the GOP nominee in Democratic - trending Pennsylvania , some Republicans began casting about for an alternative .
“ I do n’t think there is anybody in the world who believes he can get elected senator there , ” Utah Sen .
Orrin Hatch , the vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , said last week .
POLITICO reported Thursday that the National Republican Senatorial Committee was in contact with moderate Pennsylvania Rep. Jim Gerlach .
On Saturday , Roll Call reported that national and state Republicans were urging another moderate , former GOP Gov. Tom Ridge , to join the race .
“ The irony , of course , is that Republicans are looking for that moderate candidate who can beat Toomey and hold the seat , which , if that is the case , makes Arlen Specter ’s argument , ” said Pennsylvania Democratic consultant Larry Ceisler .
“ They bought the message but not the messenger . ”
In the first public poll taken since Specter ’s party switch , the five - term incumbent leads Toomey in a prospective matchup by 20 points , 53 percent to 33 percent .
The Quinnipiac University survey shows Ridge would be a formidable opponent against Specter and shows Specter leading the former governor by only 3 points , 46 percent to 43 percent .
NRSC Chairman John Cornyn of Texas hesitated when given the opportunity to endorse Toomey on Friday .
“ I do n’t think it ’s wise for me to tell Pennsylvania Republicans who their nominee should be , so I ’m not going to do that , ” said Cornyn .
“ But we want to make sure the strongest nominee is chosen so we can run them against whoever wins the Democratic nomination .
Our goal is to hold onto that seat , and we ’ll do whatever we can to make it happen . ”
The Colorado congressman says the murder of gay Iraqis are “ egregious human rights violations ” and wants U.S. and Iraqi officials to investigate how this could happen .
It ’s something Queerty ‘s been demanding too , but even we ’ll admit : Rep. Jared Polis , Congress ’ first openly gay member , has more pull with higher ups .
He ’s been traveling Iraq this week and “ met with the Iraqi Charges D’Affairs , members of the Iraqi Parliament ’s Human - Rights Committee , and US State Department officials in Baghdad , and gave them a letter outlining the allegations and urging their immediate investigation .
Thus far , the Charge D’Affaires has requested more documentation and the chance to speak with witnesses and victims . ”
The letter is here ( PDF ) .
The results ?
Forthcoming … we hope .
Meanwhile , Amnesty International is sending a letter to Iraqi president Nouri al - Maliki demanding “ urgent and concerted action ” to stop the murders — veritably sanctioned by the Iraqi government by failing to satisfactorily investigate the crimes , nor condemn them .
While some of us were trying to absorb the full facts of the Bush - Cheney torture program , which rested on a claim of total extra-constitutional power of the president to suspend habeas corpus , detain anyone in the US without charges , and torture them , Jonah Goldberg was writing a book called " Liberal Fascism . "
Even now , he is conducting interesting discussions on whether taxation in a representative democracy could be described as " tyranny . "
After a single stimulus package and three months of Obama , Fox News is predicting fascism .
I have long been at a loss to explain this .
Some kind of psychological denial mechanism ?
Rank projection ?
Displaced panic ?
Partisanship so deep it erodes any moral faculties or critical reasoning ?
To Zelikow again :
The underlying absurdity of the administration 's position can be summarized this way .
Once you get to a substantive compliance analysis for " cruel , inhuman , and degrading " you get the position that the substantive standard is the same as it is in analogous U.S. constitutional law .
So the OLC must argue , in effect , that the methods and the conditions of confinement in the CIA program could constitutionally be inflicted on American citizens in a county jail .
In other words , Americans in any town of this country could constitutionally be hung from the ceiling naked , sleep deprived , water - boarded , and all the rest -- if the alleged national security justification was compelling .
I did not believe our federal courts could reasonably be expected to agree with such a reading of the Constitution .
But remember John Yoo :
Cassel :
If the president deems that he's got to torture somebody , including by crushing the testicles of the person 's child , there is no law that can stop him ?
Yoo : No treaty Cassel : Also no law by Congress -- that is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo ...
Yoo : I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that ... "
But a top tax rate in line with the Clinton era is tyranny .

The concept of devices as files Standard input / output redirection to / from files ( implemented with > and < in Bash ) / dev/audio
While you may not be aware of it , most modern *n?x systems come with a built - in industrial music generator .
This generator consists of three parts :
That 's about all you need .
The output of just about anything , most notably cat , can be interpreted as raw sound data and sent to the speakers instead of the monitor .
Most of the time this will just give you weird static .
Try ( outputs literally random sound ) .
If you want something more meaningful , try simple patterns of values ; the most simple value , and a good place to start , would be , which outputs a high whining as the value 'y ' is sent as audio over and over .
The trick is finding ways to get interesting patterns out of the speakers .
One way to do this is to write simple programs :
int n=0 , i=1 ; for ( ; ;) { cout << char ( n+=i ) ; if ( n>255 || i < =0 ) {i++ ; n = n % 255;} } However your best bet is to try to find something large with a repetitive structure but varying information -- large data files for example .
And the two best examples of this , if you ask me , would be cat / dev/ hd a1 > / dev/audio ( or your equivalent ) or cat / proc / kcore > / dev/audio .
Core is more .. well , hardcore , but catting your hard drive into / dev/ audio is uncontestedly the best .
You get weird , vaguely looping noise , shifting , completely unpredictable , infinitely varied but usually with a constant feel to it .
Plus if there are any sound files on your drive saved in a lossless format they just play at random and then disappear back into the soup .
Someday i'm going to tape 45 minutes worth of my linuxppc partition , then drive down to the local college radio station during the ambient show and ask them to play it .
I doubt they'd be disappointed .

Frequent Mental Distress ( FMD ) , defined as having 14 or more days in the previous month when stress , depression and emotional problems were not good , is not evenly distributed across the United States .
In fact , certain geographic areas have consistently high or consistently low FMD incidence , as shown in a study published in the June 2009 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
Combining data from annual large - scale surveys in 1993 - 2001 and 2003 - 2006 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , researchers found that the adult prevalence of FMD was 9.4 % overall , ranging from 6.6 % in Hawaii to 14.4 % in Kentucky .
FMD prevalence varied both over time and by geographic area within states .
From the earlier period to the later period , the mean prevalence of FMD increased by at least 1 percentage point in 27 states and by more than 4 percentage points in Mississippi , Oklahoma and West Virginia .
The Appalachian and the Mississippi Valley regions had high and increasing FMD prevalence , and the upper Midwest had low and decreasing FMD prevalence .
The state - based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) has asked questions about mental health since 1993 and collects data from random telephone surveys of adult residents across the U.S.
More than 1.2 million people were surveyed in each of the two periods .
FMD prevalence was determined by county , and the results were smoothed to reduce variation from random sampling due to small sample sizes in less populous counties .
For the 1993 period , the smoothed FMD prevalence was less than 8 % in 31.8 % of the 3112 counties analyzed and was ≥ 12.0 % in 4.8 % of the counties .
For the 2003 period , the smoothed FMD prevalence was < 8 % in 15.9 % of the 3113 counties analyzed and was ≥ 12.0 % in 16.1 % of the counties .
consistent multicounty geographic patterns were evident for both periods — including areas where smoothed fmd prevalence was < 8 % in adjoining parts of several states in the upper midwest region ( nd , sd , ne , ks , mn , ia , mo , wi , il ) and an area where fmd prevalence was ≥ 12 % that was centered on kentucky ( in , oh , ky , wv , va , tn ) .
differences in physical conditions ( like disability or diabetes mellitus ) , stressful life events ( like job loss ) , and social circumstances ( like income ) may be associated with differences in fmd prevalence .
" Because FMD often indicates potentially unmet health and social service needs , programs for public health , community mental health and social services whose jurisdictions include areas with high FMD levels should collaborate to identify and eliminate the specific preventable sources of this distress , " said Dr. Matthew M. Zack , the study 's lead investigator .
" With the growing scientific literature linking FMD to treatable mental illnesses and preventable mental health problems , the increased use of these surveillance data in community mental health decision making is especially warranted .
The continued surveillance of mental distress may help these programs to identify unmet needs and disparities , to focus their policies and interventions and to evaluate their performance over time . "

Hatley has been jailed for 40 years with the possibility of parole A US Army master sergeant convicted of the 2007 murder of four Iraqi detainees has been sentenced to life in jail .
A jury of eight officers and NCOs handed the sentence to Master Sgt John Hatley during a court martial at a US base in southern Germany .
Hatley , 40 , is the most senior of seven soldiers allegedly involved .
Two have been convicted of murder and two admitted to lesser charges .
He was acquitted over an incident where a wounded insurgent was shot dead .
As well as the prison sentence , which comes with the possibility of parole , Hatley 's rank will be reduced to private and he will be dishonourably discharged .
Hatley , who had denied the charges , showed no emotion as his guilty verdict was read out on Wednesday at the US Army 's Rose Barracks in southern Germany .
Ammunition found
The soldiers that Hatley led were stationed at a highly exposed combat post in West Rashid , which in early 2007 was one of the most violent neighbourhoods in Baghdad .
When they found four Iraqi men not far from a cache of weapons , including sniper rifles , just a week after one of their own sergeants had been shot and killed , they took the law into their own hands , says the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington .
On two separate occasions , the accused became the judge , jury and executioner
Capt Derrick Grace
Prosecution lawyer
With no real evidence against them the detainees should have been released , our correspondent says .
Instead they were bound , blindfolded and summarily killed .
It is thought their bodies were dumped in a canal but they have never been found .
Because of that absence of physical evidence , Hatley was convicted on the strength of witness statements including those from the two other soldiers already convicted of the killings .
Capt Derrick Grace , for the prosecution , said testimony had pointed to " a complete breakdown of discipline and crimes that are among the worst of a soldier " .
" On two separate occasions , the accused became the judge , jury and executioner . "
Hatley is one of seven soldiers allegedly involved in the case and the third to be convicted for murder .
In February , Sgt Joseph Leahy , 28 , was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the case and last month Sgt Joseph Mayo , 27 , was sentenced to 35 years in prison .

A pair of UCLA geographers did not claim to have found Osama bin Laden — despite screaming headlines to the contrary .
Professors Thomas Gillespie and John Agnew made a semi-educated guess about the Al Qaeda chief 's whereabouts , based on a combination of urban myths about the jihadist leader , oversimplifications about his behavior and the creative employment of biogeographic theories — methods for " predicting how plants and animals distribute themselves over space and over time . "
The geographers admit that their brief paper , suggesting bin Laden 's hidey - hole could be narrowed down to three buildings in Pakistan 's tribal backwater , is just a thought experiment .
" What we have attempted to demonstrate is that it is possible to narrow down where Osama bin Laden is by ruling out where he is unlikely to be , " the UCLA researchers write ( emphasis mine ) .
That 's far from claiming that they 've nailed down Osama 's new headquarters .
What 's more , the geographers ' paper suffers from a classic data - crunching problem : garbage in , garbage out .
In this paper 's case , the trash includes some hoary urban myths about Osama .
First , the professors accept as fact that bin Laden requires a kidney dialysis machine .
That means he must need to be close to an electrical grid or generator , the UCLA pair reason .
Too bad the thing is complete folklore — debunked again and again .
An intelligence community source also warns that the UCLA paper grossly oversimplifies how tricky a terrorist mastermind can be .
The geographers use a " distance - decay " model to argue that bin Laden could n't have traveled more than 12 miles from his last known location .
They figure that he might be in the Pakistani town of Parachinar .
It " has a long history of housing mujahideen , " after all .
And " residing near or in a large city should reduce bin Laden ’s chances of exposure . "
Well , sure .
Assuming bin Laden plays by UCLA rules .
But maybe he thinks a rural location is a better place to hide .
Or that it 's a bad idea to do something as obvious as stay in a town that traditionally supports militants .
" The dude , and [ his ] methods of hiding are more complex than anyone thinks , " the source tells Danger Room .
The UCLA methods " would work if they [ al Qaeda ] were complete idiots .
We would have had him by now . "
" Admirable attempt , weaksauce methods , " the source adds .
The Biggest , Weirdest Rip -Off Yet
The widening of the M25 is a private finance initiative scheme that requires little private finance .
Or initiative .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 7th April 2009
Here ’s what the banks have taught us : wherever you come across unnecessary complexity , you know that someone is being swindled .
So please bear with me on this one .
The tale I ’m about to tell is a tangled one , but you should read it .
Why ?
Because the person being fleeced is you .
Over the next few days , the deal to expand the M25 ( the orbital motorway around London ) will be completed .
Construction has to start by the end of the month if the road is to be ready in time for the Olympics in 2012 .
The new lanes will be built and managed by private companies in a deal worth £ 5 billion .
It ’s the second - biggest private finance initiative ( PFI ) scheme launched in the UK ( 1 ) .
And the all - time biggest rip - off .
Under PFI , private companies build public infrastructure – roads , bridges , schools , hospitals , prisons and the rest – then lease it back to the state for 25 or 30 years .
Over 800 deals have been signed since the scheme was launched in 1992 .
They commit the taxpayer to future spending of around £ 215 b n ( 2 ) .
The government says that because private companies are more efficient than the state , PFI is cheaper than public procurement .
And it is – if you accept Mr Brown ’s accounting devices .
All PFI schemes must be tested against a yardstick called the public sector comparator .
It looks straightforward : you work out how much they would have cost to build by conventional means , compare this to the cost of PFI , then go private if that ’s the cheapest route .
But that is n’t how it works .
When Labour took power in 1997 , it told public servants that there would be no alternative to PFI .
“ When there is a limited amount of public - sector capital available , as there is , ” the health secretary Alan Milburn announced , “ it ’s PFI or bust ” ( 3 ) .
After 12 years , the policy has n’t changed .
A leaked email summarising a meeting with the current health secretary , Alan Johnson , in January this year revealed that “ PFIs have always been the NHS ’s ‘ plan A ’ for building new hospitals …
There was never a ‘ plan B ’ . ” (4 ) If you apply for public funds , you wo n’t get them : to build a new hospital or school or prison , you must PFI it .
But the bid still has to show that private finance beats the public sector comparator .
As Jeremy Colman , then the UK ’s assistant auditor - general , pointed out , “ If the answer comes out wrong you do n’t get your project .
So the answer does n’t come out wrong very often .
” (5 ) Some of the public sector comparators used , he said , are “ utter rubbish ” and “ utterly irrelevant ” .
How do you produce the right answer ?
By costing risk the right way .
When private companies take on a PFI project , they are deemed to acquire risks the state would otherwise have carried .
These risks carry a price , which proves to be remarkably responsive to the outcome you want .
A paper in the British Medical Journal shows that before risk was costed , the hospital schemes it studied would have been built much more cheaply with public funds ( 6 ) .
After the risk was costed , they all tipped the other way ; in several cases by less than 0.1 % .
Britain ’s PFI rip - offs would make the Camorra splutter into their grappa .
A bridge from the mainland to Skye which should n’t have cost more than £ 15 m stung local people and the taxpayer for £ 93.6 m ( 7 ) .
A hospital scheme in Coventry was reverse - engineered by health chiefs to attract private capital .
The city ’s two hospitals were to have been renovated by the public sector for £ 30 m .
Instead they were demolished and one was rebuilt for £ 410 m ( 8 ) .
To attract backers for the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital , the Department of Health , acting on instructions from the Treasury , left a £ 95 m sweetener in the contract ( 9 ) .
The companies which built the first eight PFI road schemes in the UK have made average annual operating profits of 68% ( 10 ) .
But the worst is yet to come .
Like the hospital in Coventry , the M25 widening scheme appears to been designed to maximise corporate profits .
The Campaign for Better Transport points out that if the whole scheme had used existing hard shoulders rather than building new lanes , the total cost would have been £ 478 m – not £ 5 bn ( 11 ) .
Like all PFI projects , because the contract is so long and the costs of breaking it are so high , this road widening locks us into existing transport patterns : if in future a government tries to respond to climate change or peak oil by changing the way we travel , it will have to pay a stonking penalty to the companies which enlarged the road .
Those perversities are standard .
But this scheme gets much weirder .
The government , as usual , is telling us as little as it can get away with .
But the Department for Transport has admitted that , to make the project viable , it might have to bail out the M25 consortium ( 12 ) .
Some reports suggest that to make sure the consortium remains solvent during the construction phase of the contract – which is worth £ 1280 m ( 13 ) – the government will have to lend it £ 400 m ( 14,15 ) .
The European Investment Bank has already pledged £ 500 m ( 16 ) , which is also taxpayers ’ money .
This private finance initiative scheme does n’t require much private finance , or initiative .
If the government underwrites the scheme , the greater part of the risk will fall on taxpayers , negating the entire rationale of PFI .
But , citing higher lending risks during the recession , the banks backing PFI infrastructure projects have increased their margins , in some cases by 500 % ( 17 ) .
The government will lend or promise to lend cheap money to the banks , which will then charge us , through the consortium , crushing rates of interest for the use of our own cash .
Weird enough for you yet ?
Well one of the banks reported to be backing the scheme is RBS .
The taxpayer now owns 58 % of it .
This is likely to rise soon to 95 % ( 18 ) .
If the government underwrites the M25 expansion , it will in effect be bailing out RBS twice then charging itself for the privilege – and for the bankers ’ fees , including salaries and bonuses .
RBS – in other words you and me – already has £ 10bn invested in PFI schemes in this country ( 19 ) , for which we are paying extravagant rates .
If you have come across a state spending scheme madder than this , please let me know .
So why does n’t the government just cut out the middleman and fund the project – or a much cheaper version of the project – itself ?
The old explanation – that PFI allowed it , like Enron , to keep its public liabilities off balance sheet – no longer holds .
The government has bowed to the demands of accountants and auditors : from this month onwards , PFI schemes will be counted as public sector debt .
This is something quite different : a toxic combination of ideology and terror .
No lesson , however brutal , can divert the government from its central project of propitiating its old adversaries : industrialists and the rightwing press .
Gordon Brown will keep feeding the beast , however much this costs .
True disciple , he worships still at the altar of market fundamentalism , even when the market no longer exists .

The Register explains that the multi-core support in the new chips is essentially transparent to application developers :
In other words , the SGX543 can have any number of cores from two to sixteen with no change in the driver software or the application .
All that complex data / pipeline / thread management is done in hardware .
No muss , no fuss .
The Register then makes a questionable leap that this could power an Apple Tablet .
Still , Apple 's interest in the technology seems certain as they are a licensee and investor of Imagination Technologies and currently uses the company 's PowerVR chip in the iPhone and iPod Touch .
According to the press release , the new chips are being delivered to customers in two - core and 16 - core variants and appear to incorporate support for OpenGL and OpenCL .
While Apple has not announced any new hardware revisions to the iPhone , many believe that the next generation iPhone will likely be released alongside the public release of the iPhone 3.0 firmware this summer .
Swine Flu Outbreak Revives Controversy Over Stimulus Funds
By Ben Pershing
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee announced today it will hold a hearing this Wednesday on the federal government 's response to the swine flu outbreak , even as a controversy is brewing over the role a senior member of the panel played in blocking funds for just this kind of public health emergency .
The liberal blogosphere has been percolating this morning with criticism of Sen. Susan Collins ( Maine ) , the top Republican on HSGAC , for having helped to strip close to $ 900 million for pandemic influenza preparedness from the economic stimulus package back in February .
That bill passed with the crucial support of Collins and just two other Republicans after a handful of controversial or arguably non-stimulative items were removed , including the pandemic funding .
" Everybody in the room is concerned about a pandemic flu , " Collins said at the time , referring to the stimulus negotiations .
" But does it belong in this bill ?
Should we have $ 870 million in this bill ?
No , we should not . "
Now that the swine flu outbreak has precipitated an official public health emergency , critics are piling on .
John Nichols writes in The Nation that Collins and her fellow flu funding opponents -- including Karl Rove -- " were just playing politics , in the exceptionally narrow and irresponsible manner that characterized the Republican response to the stimulus debate . "
Another blogger put it more simply : " Way to have foresight , Susan . "
But Collins 's office is pushing back against the charge that she somehow put the nation at risk by opposing the inclusion of pandemic money in the stimulus .
The record does show that the Maine senator is a longtime proponent of increased funding for flu preparedness , and in December , her office points out , Collins wrote to Senate leaders asking for a $ 905 million increase for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund at the Department of Health and Human Services .
Even during the stimulus debate , Collins said repeatedly that she backed the idea of boosting the preparedness budget , but just did n't think it made sense to include the money in the stimulus measure because it was a stretch to consider it stimulative ( though some analysts have pointed out that a widespread outbreak right now would make a bad economy even worse ) .
Instead , Collins wanted the money added in the regular appropriations process , and the omnibus spending bill that was approved in March did include a small increase in funding for pandemic flu research .
To be fair , Collins was n't the only senator who criticized the pandemic funding back in February .
At the time , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) referred to the flu money as " one of the little porky things " that the House had put in the stimulus measure but the Senate had taken out .
Most importantly , Collins 's spokesman points out , " There is no evidence that federal efforts to address the swine flu outbreak have been hampered by a lack of funds . "
And at the moment , the outbreak is not actually a pandemic .
Collins and the others who led the fight to axe the flu money three months ago can only hope that does n't change .
If it does turn out the government does n't have enough cash to fight the problem , Wednesday 's hearing could get interesting .
Doodling could help the mind remain alert during dull tasks Doodling may look messy , but it could in fact be a sign of an alert mind , a study suggests .
Plymouth University researchers carried out memory tests on 40 volunteers , asking them to listen to a phone call and recall names and places .
Doodlers performed 29 % better than non-doodlers , the team found .
Experts said doodling stopped people from daydreaming , which was a more taxing diversion , and so was good at helping people focus on mundane tasks .
During the study , half of the volunteers were asked to colour in shapes on a piece of paper while they listened to a 2.5 minute telephone message .
The other half were left to their own devices while they listened .
Both groups were told the message would be dull , the Applied Cognitive Psychology journal reported .
Daydreaming distracts them from the task , resulting in poor performance
Jackie Andrade , lead researcher Afterwards , both groups were asked to write down eight specific names and eight places mentioned .
The doodlers on average recalled 7.5 , while the non-doodlers only managed 5.8 .
Lead researcher Jackie Andrade said : " If someone is doing a boring task , like listening to a dull telephone conversation , they may start to daydream .
" Daydreaming distracts them from the task , resulting in poor performance .
" A simple task , like doodling , may be sufficient to stop daydreaming without affecting performance on the main task . "
Professor Alan Badeley , from the British Psychological Society , said : " Doodling is a relatively undemanding task so this makes sense .
" The temptation during meetings or telephone conversations that you are not particularly engaged with is to start thinking about things .
You visualise things such as holidays .
" That then takes you away from the task at hand .
Or you may even end up nodding off .
" However , by comparison , doodling is not that taxing and keeps you more alert so you are more likely to absorb what is being said . "

More than thousand people have gathered in the streets of the Swedish capital Stockholm today , to protest against yesterday 's Pirate Bay verdict .
The demonstration was organized by the Swedish Pirate Party that is campaigning for the European Parliament elections in June .
Yesterday , The Pirate Bay Four were sentenced to a year in prison , and on top of that each of them was ordered to pay the entertainment industry $ 905,000 in damages .
The defendants have all anounced that they will appeal , which means that the case is likely to drag on for years .
Many Swedes were outraged by the harsh sentence that was given and today the Swedish Pirate Party organized a demonstration to support the defendants .
The demonstration took place in in Stockholm , and there were similar protests in other Swedish cities .
“ Politicians have declared war on our entire generation , ” Pirate Party Leader Rick Falkvinge told the crowd , adding .
“ Our politicians are digital illiterates .
We need politicians who ca n’t be hen - pecked by a foreign power . ”
Pirates Demonstrate in Stockholm
“ The Pirate Bay is a completely legitimate service that transmits information between people .
After this ruling , no one can feel secure when linking to a YouTube clip on its website , ” Daniel Nyström from the Pirate Party said in his speech while the crowd yelled “ Free TPB , free TPB ! ”
The verdict has brought many new members for the Pirate Party , and they hope to get a seat at the European Parliament later this year .
Over the past day over 6000 members applied , raising the member count from less than 15,000 up to more than 20,000 making them one of the largest political parties in Sweden .
Tomorrow the Pirate Party has planned another demonstration in the city center of Goteborg , hoping to equal the success of today .
Scientists identified seven new species of bamboo coral discovered on a NOAA - funded mission in the deep waters of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument .
Six of these species may represent entirely new genera , a remarkable feat given the broad classification a genus represents .*
Scientists expect to identify more new species as analysis of samples continues .
“ These discoveries are important , because deep - sea corals support diverse seafloor ecosystems and also because these corals may be among the first marine organisms to be affected by ocean acidification , ” said Richard Spinrad , Ph.D. , NOAA ’s assistant administrator for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research .
Ocean acidification is a change in ocean chemistry due to excess carbon dioxide .
Researchers have seen adverse changes in marine life with calcium - carbonate shells , such as corals , because of acidified ocean water .
“ Deep - sea bamboo corals also produce growth rings much as trees do , and can provide a much - needed view of how deep ocean conditions change through time , ” said Spinrad .
Rob Dunbar , a Stanford University scientist , was studying long - term climate data by examining long - lived corals .
“ We found live , 4,000 - year - old corals in the Monument – meaning 4,000 years worth of information about what has been going on in the deep ocean interior . ”
“ Studying these corals can help us understand how they survive for such long periods of time , as well as how they may respond to climate change in the future , ” said Dunbar .

Among the other findings were a five - foot tall yellow bamboo coral tree that had never been described before , new beds of living deepwater coral and sponges , and a giant sponge scientists dubbed the “ cauldron sponge , ” approximately three feet tall and three feet across .
Scientists collected two other sponges which have not yet been analyzed , but may represent new species or genera as well .
The mission also discovered a “ coral graveyard ” covering about 10,000 square feet on a seamount ’s summit , more than 2,000 feet deep .
Scientists estimated the death of the community occurred several thousand to potentially more than a million years ago , but did not know why the community died .
The species of coral had never been recorded in Hawaii before , according a Smithsonian Institution coral expert they consulted .
Finding new species was not an express purpose of the research mission , but Dunbar and Christopher Kelley , a scientist with the University of Hawaii , both collected specimens that looked unusual .
Kelley ’s objective was to locate and predict locations of high density deep - sea coral beds in the Monument .
NOAA scientist Frank Parrish also led a portion of the mission , focusing on growth rates of deep - sea corals .
The three - week research mission ended in November 2007 , but analysis of specimens is ongoing .
“ The potential for more discoveries is high , but these deep - sea corals are not protected everywhere as they are here , and can easily be destroyed , ” said Kelley .
The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument has more deep water than any other U.S. protected area , with more than 98 percent below SCUBA - diving depths and only accessible to submersibles .
The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory , sponsored by NOAA and the University of Hawaii , piloted the Pisces V submersible from a research vessel to the discovery sites , between 3,300 and 4,200 feet deep .
Funding for the mission was provided by NOAA through the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and NOAA ’s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research .
Identification of the corals was provided by Les Watling at the University of Hawaii .
The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument is administered jointly by the Department of Commerce , Department of the Interior , and the State of Hawaii and represents a cooperative conservation approach to protecting the entire ecosystem .

The Red invasion — which the Blu-ray Disc Association has delayed as long as possible — will bring a wave of cheap Blu to the United States , in the form of $ 99 Blu-ray players this Christmas .

The BDA had held out bringing Blu-ray to China , knowing that when the technology and licensing became available to manufacturers over there , cheap no -name players would flood the market over here , and undercut the price of players from companies like Sony , Pioneer and Samsung — who were already unhappy with just how fast prices fell , calling $ 399 for a player a " bargain " over a year ago .
Consider this gem from Pioneer on why they did n't go HD DVD : " Why would Pioneer want to build one when Toshiba was selling them at $ 150 ? "
That moment arrived this Christmas .

It 's not altogether surprising that a year after crossing the $ 199 threshold , like they did this holiday season , they 'd finish plummeting below a hundred bucks , which is what Mark Leathan , Marketing Director at Samsung predicts :
That once the Chinese enter , " we will have a $ 99 Blu ray player . "
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Is $ 99 the actual price for Blu-ray to go mass market , since the economy robbed $ 200 of its magical properties ?
Now if only they could do something about the disc prices .

Are Americans flunking science ?
A new national survey commissioned by the California Academy of Sciences and conducted by Harris Interactive® reveals that the U.S. public is unable to pass even a basic scientific literacy test .
Over the past few months , the American government has allocated hundreds of billions of dollars for economic bailout plans .
While this spending may provide a short - term solution to the country 's economic woes , most analysts agree that the long - term solution must include a transition to a more knowledge - based economy , including a focus on science , which is now widely recognized as a major driver of innovation and industry .
Despite its importance to economic growth , environmental protection , and global health and energy issues , scientific literacy is currently low among American adults .
According to the national survey commissioned by the California Academy of Sciences :
Only 53 % of adults know how long it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun .
Only 59 % of adults know that the earliest humans and dinosaurs did not live at the same time .
Only 47 % of adults can roughly approximate the percent of the Earth 's surface that is covered with water . *
Only 21 % of adults answered all three questions correctly .
Knowledge about some key scientific issues is also low .
Despite the fact that access to fresh water is likely to be one of the most pressing environmental issues over the coming years , less than 1 % of U.S. adults know what percent of the planet 's water is fresh ( the correct answer is 3 % ) .
Nearly half did n't even hazard a guess .
Additionally , 40 % of U.S. adults say they are " not at all knowledgeable " about sustainability .
Despite this lack of knowledge , U.S. adults do believe that scientific research and education are important .
About 4 in 5 adults think science education is " absolutely essential " or " very important " to the U.S. healthcare system ( 86 % ) , the U.S. global reputation ( 79 % ) , and the U.S. economy ( 77 % ) .
" There has never been a greater need for investment in scientific research and education , " said Academy Executive Director Dr. Gregory Farrington .
" Many of the most pressing issues of our time — from global climate change to resource management and disease — can only be addressed with the help of science . "

Methodology
This survey was conducted by telephone within the United States by Harris Interactive on behalf of the California Academy of Science between December 17 and December 21 , 2008 among 1,002 adults ages 18 +.
* The approximately correct answer range for this question was defined as anything between 65 % and 75 % .
Only 15 % of respondents answered this question with the exactly correct answer of 70 % .
" Congressman Nunes ' attempt to grab headlines with finger pointing will not solve this problem and will only lead to the same gridlock that has paralyzed the water debate in this state for the last 50 years .
We encourage Congressman Nunes to be part of the solution as opposed to part of the problem . "
It varies from month to month which of the die - hard lunatic fringe members of the state 's Republican congressional caucus is the most extremist congressmember from California -- and now that Tom McClintock and Duncan Hunter , Jr. are part of the delegation , all bets are off .
But right now California 's worst member of Congress -- as it often is -- is Inland Empire crook Gary Miller .
In assessing every single vote since he was elected , Hunter 's score , second worst in California , is identical to North Carolina sociopath Virginia Foxx , beaten out on the scale of lunatic fringeness only by Iowa freak Steve King , Miller and Texas secessionists Kenny Marchant , Mac Thornberry , Sam Johnson , Pete Sessions , and Randy Neugebauer .
Other California congresskooks who have held the distinction as the most extreme right wing jerk in the state ( judging only by House votes ) have included Darrell Issa , Kevin McCarthy , George Radanovich , Dan Lungren , and , frequently , Devin Nunes .
But Nunes is n't in the news today because of his atrocious voting record or his penchant for selling out working families at the behest of his wealthy campaign donors .
( Nunes , who scooped up $ 499,235 in legalized bribes from the financial / insurance / real estate sector , voted against the biggest tax cut for middle class families in history , against the Stimulus package , against health care for needy children , against equal pay for women , against mortgage relief for responsible homeowners ... in fact , against every single solution President Obama has offered to solve the economic meltdown and the severe problems that were caused by Bush and rubber stamp ideologues like Nunes . )
No , today Congressman Nunes , who represents Tulare County and the part of Fresno County that does n't include Fresno , had a hissy fit on his official congressional website demanding that the governor of his state resign .
The governor of his state is Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican like himself .
I mentioned above that Nunes has gobbled up nearly half a million dollars in bribes from the banksters .
His agricultural district is almost totally devoid of family farms and completely dominated by the worst kinds of corporate farming anywhere on earth .
Needless to say , they pay their congressman well .
Nunes has raked in a massive $ 1,449,107 from AgriBusiness , more than any other member of Congress other than the equally corrupt and venal Collin Peterson ( Blue Dog - MN ) , chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and , like Nunes , an implacable enemy of family farms and of the environment .
It 's Nunes ' contention that Schwarzenegger is the cause of California 's drought ; it 's " due to the Governor 's failure to respond to the ongoing California water crisis , " he hissed .
" San Joaquin Valley communities are drying up and they are dying .
Communities have withered away , families have been left with nothing and people are literally starving . "
Schwarzenegger is fully aware that Nunes is a kook and he had an aide brush him off like a fly : I think Schwarenegger has been active in the Republican Party long enough to know that extremists like Nunes are never party of the solution andpart of the problem -- a big part .
July 29 , 2010 - Nunes seems to have slipped up , admitting what Republicans are loathe to ever address , that Bush 's massive tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 % of Americans has been an economic catastrophe for the country -- and for most of the other 98 % of Americans .

A pair of giant robotic spiders designed and built by French performance art group La Machine have come to Yokohama to take part in the upcoming Expo Y150 , a 5 - month festival commemorating the 150th anniversary of the opening of the city 's port .

Although the Expo Y150 festivities are not scheduled to officially begin until the end of April , the enormous steampunk spiders could be seen prowling the Yokohama waterfront this weekend .
Here is some superb video of the spectacle on Friday ( April 17 ) night , when one of the 12 - meter ( 40 - ft ) tall , 37 - ton mechanical spiders was observed in the red brick warehouse area of Yokohama -- far from its natural habitat of Nantes , France .

On Saturday ( April 18 ) evening , one of the mechanical spiders performed a water dance at Shinko Pier while the other looked on from its perch atop a nearby shipping container .
For the performance , the spider moved its mechanical legs and shot steam and water and from its mouth and rear end , while suspended over the water from a large crane .
Water cannons , fog machines , lights and live atmospheric music added to the drama .
[ +]
On Sunday ( April 19 ) , both spiders were scheduled to depart Shinko Pier , take a stroll up Nihon - Odori street , and head back to the red brick warehouse area .

La Machine 's giant spiders will be on public display at Expo Y150 from April 28 to September 27 .
First , the banks :
You know how it has become standard procedure for the vultures in the banking industry to try to fleece you with so - called " prepayment penalties " if you pay back your mortgage earlier than they want you to pay it back ?
And you know how many banks charge excessively high interest rates ?
Well , now , according to the Wall Street Journal , the same banking industry is claiming the federal government is trying to charge excessive interest rates via a " prepayment penalty " when the banks pay back their bailout funds and - and that banking industry is actually complaining about the situation .
“ In my Congressional district in Michigan , there are thousands of UAW employees who have employment contracts , and they ’ve been told they need to renegotiate those contracts and make concessions to justify taxpayer investments .
There are thousands of white collar employees with employment contracts who have forgone promised bonuses and benefits and have taken pay cuts in order to save the companies they work for .
People are sick of this double standard where working class and middle class workers are treated differently than the financial industry executives . ”

According to consumer advocacy groups , the judicial loan modification power would compel banks and their middlemen to work with borrowers to adjust unsustainable mortgages before bankruptcy and would help to reduce the growing wave of foreclosures sweeping the country .
David Sirota made an ironic point last week about banks bewailing having to pay a prepayment penalty .
Irony on irony , David missed the fact that the worthless banksters are using taxpayer bailout money to lobby members of Congress whom they routinely bribe with immense campaign " contributions " ( $ 2.2 billion since 1990 ) to let them off the hook when it comes to living up to their end of the deal .
And as long as we 're piling on the irony , imagine my disappointment when Senate Banking Committee member Jon Tester ( D - MT ) started behaving very much like the crooked reactionary he replaced in 2006 , Conrad Burns , by coming out against the bankruptcy legislation that seeks to keep homeowners from being foreclosed on .
" I just think a deal 's a deal .
I have a lot of empathy for folks who tend to get led astray , but I just think it 's going to create some problems -- pretty obvious , actually .
I do n't have to list them .
I 'm generally opposed .
I do n't think it works well . "
The banksters must be laughing their asses off .
And we find out that Jon Tester is no Gary Peters ( D - MI ) , the courageous member of the House Financial Services Committee who threw their " deal 's a deal " bullshit back into the faces of the contemptible banksters and their congressional protectors : I do n't understand why members of the Banking Committee are allowed to take blatant -- if legalized -- bribes from the banksters .
By the standards of the banksters , Tester did n't get much loot from them , but , even so $ 73,765 is nothing to sneeze at , which is what the banksters gave him last year .
No committee members should be allowed to vote on this kind of legislation if they accept " contributions " from the industries they are responsible for overseeing .
That would make voting a lot easier , especially on the corrupt Senate Banking Committee .
These were the payoff for 2008 for each member :
So that means the only members who should be permitted to vote are Herb Kohl ( D - MN ) , Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) and Mike Johanns ( R - NE ) since the three of them -- and only the three of them -- ran for election and did n't accept any money from banksters .
They 're the only ones not financially compromised by organizations like , for example , the National Association of Federal Credit unions which voted unanimously last Tuesday to oppose the proposal , which would allow bankruptcy judges to reduce mortgage principle and interest rates for certain distressed homeowners .
CREW has done a report on one of the most repulsive varieties of banksters , the payday lenders and their efforts to gain influence with Congress .
The report shows that " the payday loan industry is following the familiar path already cleared by other industries suddenly confronted with congressional oversight .
Payday lenders have joined the ranks of defense contractors , investment funds and others who influence the legislative process through lavish political contributions , expensive PR campaigns , and strategic lobbying . "
The chart below shows the most perps from the latest election cycle :
Meanwhile , Matt Renner reports at Truthout that a " handful of Democratic senators have joined with Republicans and industry lobbyists to oppose the measure , stalling the bill 's progress . "
Thursday night the Bayh anti-Obama bloc voted with the Republicans to kill the president 's cap and trade approach to cleaning up the environment and combating climate change .
Apparently Bayh and his treacherous followers -- what Rachel Maddow dubbed the Conservadems intend to collaborate with the Republicans to wreck the change agenda .
The bill Tester declared his opposition to , judicial loan modification , or " cram down " provision of S. 61 - the Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy
Act of 2009 - would empower bankruptcy judges to adjust a borrower 's mortgage during bankruptcy proceedings .
Currently , a bankruptcy judge can change the terms of other debts such as mortgages on vacation homes , liens on boats and credit card debt , but cannot touch primary residence mortgages .
What Tester and the other Conservadems oppose is ordinary working families getting a break for a change .
I expect it from a swine like Lincoln , Nelson or Bayh but for Tester to throw his lot in with these reactionary creeps is a real blow .
I wonder how long it will be before ads like this one that was launched against filthy Blue Dog Marion Berry -- by Democrats -- will be running against senators like Tester , Lincoln and other Democrats who have gone over to the Dark Side :

Study : Arctic sea ice may be gone in 30 years Associated Press
Published : Friday April 3 , 2009
Print This Email This Arctic sea ice is melting so fast most of it could be gone in 30 years .
A new analysis of changing conditions in the region , using complex computer models of weather and climate , says conditions that had been forecast by the end of the century could occur much sooner .
A change in the amount of ice is important because the white surface reflects sunlight back into space .
When ice is replaced by dark ocean water that sunlight can be absorbed , warming the water and increasing the warming of the planet .

A 26 - year - old mother has been convicted of steadily giving her toddler cocaine over 14 months , finally administering a near - lethal dose that left him brain - damaged .
" It 's difficult to see what would motivate her to give him cocaine , possibly to stop his crying , or to get him to sleep , or to control him .
Was it to punish him or to get back at the father ? "
Justice Tamarin Dunnet said yesterday .
The Scarborough woman , who can not be named to protect the identity of her son , also intentionally fractured a number of her son's ribs over time and failed to take him to hospital for a broken forearm , the judge said .
Cocaine levels discovered in the 2 - year - old in testing at Hospital for Sick Children were so high that if he were an adult , he would be in the top 5 per cent of users , an expert testified .
Now aged 6 and living with his father and grandmother in Scarborough , the boy is happy but has permanent brain impairment , family members said outside court .
Yesterday Dunnet convicted the mother of assault causing bodily harm , aggravated assault , failing to provide the necessities of life and administering a noxious substance .
In September 2004 , the woman split up with the boy 's father – then a drug dealer – and became the sole caregiver .
In early 2005 , she limited the father 's access , and he became concerned when he noticed the boy had an arm injury and black marks under his eyes , court heard .
In the early hours of Aug. 1 , 2005 , the mother took the boy to Scarborough General Hospital , claiming that he had an unexplained seizure .
But she had actually given him a cocaine overdose that night and delayed getting help until " she realized he was dying in front of her eyes , " the judge said .
She phoned the father from the hospital and said she feared the boy might die from ingesting cocaine she claimed he likely had picked up somewhere in her Midland Ave. apartment building .
Yet she never told doctors about the cocaine – knowledge that would have helped them treat her boy , who was transferred in a coma to the Hospital for Sick Children .
Doctors had to cut open his skull to relieve the swelling .
When a doctor told the mother at 10 that morning that her son had cocaine in her system , she expressed surprise , Dunnet said .
A children 's aid worker who accompanied the mother to the hospital heard her say she hoped her son would be okay " because he is so cute .
He 's bad but he 's cute . "
In a police interview she covered her face as if crying , but shed no tears ; next minute she was laughing , the judge said .
" She expressed no concern about the child . "
After the judgment , the mother brushed past reporters without comment .
She remains on bail , at least until her sentencing hearing on May 8 .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki confirmed Tuesday that the Obama administration is considering a controversial plan to make veterans pay for treatment of service - related injuries with private insurance .
Lawmakers say they 'd reject a proposal to make veterans pay for treatment of war wounds with private insurance .
But the proposal would be " dead on arrival " if it 's sent to Congress , Sen. Patty Murray , D - Washington , said .
Murray used that blunt terminology when she told Shinseki that the idea would not be acceptable and would be rejected if formally proposed .
Her remarks came during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs about the 2010 budget .
No official proposal to create such a program has been announced publicly , but veterans groups wrote a pre-emptive letter last week to President Obama voicing their opposition to the idea after hearing the plan was under consideration .
The groups also cited an increase in " third - party collections " estimated in the 2010 budget proposal -- something they said could be achieved only if the Veterans Administration started billing for service - related injuries .
Asked about the proposal , Shinseki said it was under " consideration . "
" A final decision has n't been made yet , " he said .
Currently , veterans ' private insurance is charged only when they receive health care from the VA for medical issues that are not related to service injuries , like getting the flu .
Charging for service - related injuries would violate " a sacred trust , " Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis said .
Davis said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments .
A second senator , North Carolina Republican Richard Burr , said he agreed that the idea should not go forward .
" I think you will give that up " as a revenue stream if it is included in this April 's budget , Burr said .
Murray said she 'd already discussed her concerns with the secretary the previous week .
" I believe that veterans with service - connected injuries have already paid by putting their lives on the line , " Murray said in her remarks .
" I do n't think we should nickel and dime them for their care . "
Eleven of the most prominent veterans organizations have been lobbying Congress to oppose the idea .
In the letter sent last week to the president , the groups warned that the idea " is wholly unacceptable and a total abrogation of our government 's moral and legal responsibility to the men and women who have sacrificed so much . "
The groups included The American Legion , Disabled American Veterans , Military Order of the Purple Heart , Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States , and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
At the time , a White House spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the option was being considered .

DIRECT is an alternative architecture , proposed to replace Ares I and Ares V with a single “ Jupiter ” vehicle , capable of performing both roles .
The DIRECT approach claims to offer significant improvements in performance , schedule , and budget expenditure – when compared to Ares – by relying more on the existing technology and components of the space shuttle and EELV programs .
The DIRECT proposal has its roots in the Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) studies ( 1990s ) to design a shuttle - based heavy lift cargo vehicle to compliment the space shuttle .
Known as the National Launch System ( NLS ) , the concept was deemed to have significant merit – before being deleted due to budgetary concerns .
In 2006 , a group of engineers and members of the space community revived and modernized the concept , calling it DIRECT .
The proposal was first presented in October 2006 , followed by a major revision in September 2007 , known as DIRECT 2.0 .
The team claims to be comprised of eight public representatives and 62 NASA and contractor engineers – who work on the project on their own time .
NASA Analysis Background :
As DIRECT gained attention via two AIAA papers , and presentations at the ISDC , before MSFC performed two reviews of the DIRECT 2.0 architecture in May and October of 2007 – which found serious issues with DIRECT ’s performance and capabilities .
“ Analysis of the DIRECT architecture shows significant performance shortfall in assessed capability , ” noted the October , 07 analysis .
“ The DIRECT architecture aggressively estimates its stage dry mass predictions , which results in optimistic in - space performance .
Consequently , the Direct 2.0 would likely be a Three Vehicle Launch Solution Mission to accomplish the Project Constellation Payload Requirements with NASA design margins , ground rules and assumptions .
“ Assessed performance has improved from May 2007 EOR - LOR , but still fails to meet minimum requirements by at least 50 percent of needed Lander Payload . ”
In order to back up these claims , NASA commissioned a ‘ Team B ’ review to attempt to design and fly a DIRECT lunar mission using NASA tools and specifications .
Their results showed significantly larger masses and lower performance predictions , than those claimed by DIRECT .
“ DIRECT currently unsuitable for its proposed goal of replacing the Ares I /V architecture to carry out the earth - to - TLI transportation functions for the Constellation Programs , ” noted the review .
The analysis also attacks the infrastructure and development of the DIRECT vehicles , specifically DIRECT ’s claimed redesign of the External Tank vs .
Ares I ’s clean sheet upper stage .
“ Assessment of design would lead to major redesign , development and qualification of Mod ET Core for Jupiter 232 missions .
Predicted touch labor of Ares 1 Upper Stage estimated to be significantly less than current ET touch labor .
“ Examined approaches like this in the past 20 years : Concluded that this effort incurs significant expense and development with marginally applicable STS ET heritage .
“ The Jupiter common core requires a new : Main Propulsion System , thrust structure , avionics , forward LOX tank structure and a payload shroud , substantial intertank / LH2 modifications , and a stack integration effort .
The October 07 analysis ’ final major criticism of DIRECT referenced Ares ’ operational safety and simplicity .
“ DIRECT launch architecture requires increased number of spacecraft separations and dockings for all phases , increasing risk Separation , flip around and docking of Orion to Altair Rendezvous and docking of Orion - Altair stack to first EDS pre-TLI burn .
DIRECT shows a 1/1400 PLOC for Jupiter 232 Lunar / Mission .
DIRECT ’s Rebuttal :
DIRECT ’s response to NASA ’s analysis is forthcoming via a 100 + page rebuttal document that deals with the claims and explains why the criticisms are flawed – according to DIRECT .
* CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE PRESENTATION *
The document centers around the allegation that DIRECT was significantly misinterpreted by NASA ’s analysis teams in an attempt to discredit the proposal .
“ NASA ’s October 2007 analysis of DIRECT , on the surface , appears to be a carefully executed analysis of the DIRECT architecture and its central launch vehicle , Jupiter , ” notes the rebuttal document .
“ However , a closer examination of the document reveals significant flaws in the evaluation of DIRECT that sets up a scenario where DIRECT would inevitably look inferior when compared to Ares .
“ The errors are so numerous that the only conclusion possible is that this document was not a true analysis , but rather an attempt to discredit the DIRECT architecture . ”
DIRECT claims that NASA ’s inability to match the DIRECT team ’s claimed performance hinges on the arbitrary mass increase of the EDS ( Earth Departure Stage ) by ‘ Team B ’ .
“ For Every 1 kg Upper Stage Growth , 3 kg Less Payload Delivered through TLI .
Arbitrarily increasing the mass of the Upper Stage penalizes the performance of the entire system 3 - fold .
“ On pages 55 & 56 of NASA ’s Analysis , a breakdown of the mass of the Upper Stage shows NASA ’s ‘ Case # 2 – Team B ’ design methodology using INTROS , results in a 17,797kg difference in burnout mass for the Upper Stage ; 23,062 kg vs. 40,859 kg – a 77 percent performance penalty .
“ A penalty applied to the Upper Stage mass of nearly 18 mT results in a net reduction of EDS lunar performance by nearly 36mT . ”
DIRECT contends that this mass increase is due to the use of a NASA design tool that does not assume the Centaur - based components of DIRECT ’s upper stage .
“ NASA ’s Upper Stage was designed using the NASA - developed “ INTROS ” tool , ” claims the rebuttal .
“ While this is based on heritage data , this tool has never been utilized in the production of any flying vehicle to date .
Boeing did not utilize the tool for its Delta - IV and Lockheed Martin did not utilize the tool for the Atlas V – the two most modern US launchers .
“ NASA ’s analysis ( also ) ignores DIRECT ’s plan to use a Common Bulkhead design for the Jupiter Upper Stage . ”
The DIRECT team also attempt to back up their claims that the External Tank ( ET ) would only have to undergo minor redesign – which is an area of contention due to claims DIRECT ignore the testing requirements any changes to the ETs require – by noting the “ minor ” claim is comparative to the “ major ” changes required by Ares I and Ares V .
“ It is worth noting that the requirement to build two new SRB designs , a vast new 10 m Core Stage , two new Upper Stages and two completely separate production and launch processing infrastructures to support both Ares I – and then Ares V – would certainly qualify as a “ major ” undertaking , ” DIRECT claim – adding they would also save billions in development costs .
“ In that single context , it might be accurate to describe DIRECT ’s plans as comparatively ‘ minor ’ .
“ Development costs for Jupiter - 120 are approximately $ 5,000 m lower than Ares I . Development costs for Jupiter - 232 are a further $ 9,000 m lower than Ares V. Operations costs for two very different Ares vehicles are approx .
$ 3,100 m higher per year than for the common - core Jupiter ’s .
Total DIRECT lifecycle savings thru 2020 are greater than $ 19,000m . ”
To address NASA ’s last major criticism concerning safety and operations , DIRECT points out that the risk calculations have been easily skewed , and are essentially subjective .
“ There is a ‘ time factor ’ at work also which severely skews NASA ’s conjecture .
The Jupiter ’s LOC ( Loss Of Crew ) and LOM ( Loss Of Mission ) figures were calculated in late October 2007 , ” DIRECT claim .
“ This date coincides with the Ares I Integrated System Technical Interchange Meeting ( IS - TIM ) on November 8 .
“ The design of Ares I has not changed significantly since that time , only the methodology for calculating the risk has altered since then .
Somehow Ares I has doubled its LOC claims to “ 1/2400 ″ – according to NASA , yet the Ares I still uses all the same engines and stages . ”
However , it appears DIRECT completely ignore the central claim by Constellation that their first stage SRB has obvious safety benefits when compared to Jupiter ’s “ numerous moving parts ” in its first stage liquid engines .
DIRECT also admit they are still awaiting new analysis .
“ At time of writing , DIRECT is still awaiting results of a new analysis and expects similar improvements as Ares , ” the rebuttal admits .
DIRECT claim that they would have lower total mission risk due to its capability to return safety systems that have been stripped of Orion due to mass issues .
“ Because of DIRECT ’s surplus performance , all of the capabilities deleted from Orion in the Zero Base Vehicle ( ZBV ) studies could be added back in , ” they claim .
“ If those systems can be reintegrated , it would dramatically improve the overall mission LOM figures , which represent a far larger portion of the total risks than just the launch . ”
DIRECT anticipates being heavily involved in the upcoming Blue Ribbon review for human space flight – which will include an evaluation on NASA ’s current exploration direction – and the team will be presenting their latest proposals at the Orlando ISDC conference at the end of May and will also have representatives there able to discuss the latest evolutions of the proposal .
Common Atheist Mistakes
Every man , wherever he goes , is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions , which move with him like flies on a summer day .
Bertrand Russell
Atheists are humans like everybody else .
They find comfort in “ knowing ” they are right .
Absolute certainty feels good .
Atheists can slip into special thinking just like believers can .
In fact , it is quite natural for our brains to hold contradictory ideas at the same time , and we must all fight that urge .
Earlier , I wrote about Four Common Christian Mistakes .
In this post , I want to highlight some common mistakes in atheist thinking .
Blaming religion for everything
Religion is not the root of all evil , but some atheists like to think it is .
Richard Dawkins did a TV documentary about religion called The Root of All Evil , and the subtitle of Christopher Hitchens ’ latest book is How Religion Poisons Everything .
Obviously , many evils – including the atheist genocides mentioned above – do not come from religion .
Evil can come from greed , power , poverty , shame , desire , good intentions , love , anger , drugs , and many other sources .
And I find it hard to believe that religion poisons everything .
Does religion poison math ?
Renaissance art ?
Sailing ?
Hats ?
Pro-atheist myths
Every people group retells history in a way that favors itself .
Liberals and conservatives , socialists and anarchists , Christians and Buddhists , hockey fans and NASCAR nuts – we all have some myths that make us look good .
Atheists are no exception .
To show that atheists are morally better than Christians , some atheists claim that less than one percent of imprisoned Americans are atheist , even though atheists represent 10 % of the population .
Such statistics are either made up or based on a questionable 1925 study .
In truth , “ the segment of the prison population which self - identifies as non-religious is approximately twice as large as found in the general population . ”
Some atheists claim that Muslims destroyed the library of Alexandria , the greatest treasury of knowledge in the ancient world .
Supposedly , Muslim crusader Umar proclaimed that “ the books will either contradict the Koran , in which case they are heresy , or they will agree with it , in which case they are superfluous , ” and then burned the library .
That makes for a good story , but history shows it probably did n’t happen that way .
Other atheists say the idea of Jesus as God did not arise until 300 years after Jesus ’ death , at the Council of Nicea .
But both Christian and secular sources show that some people worshiped Jesus as a god much earlier .
And finally , to exaggerate the historic conflict between religion and science , atheists say Galileo was tortured by the church for claiming the earth went around the sun .
In fact , Galileo offered false proofs of heliocentrism , lied blatantly in court , and was sentenced to an honorable detention where he continued scientific work on other subjects .
These and other atheist myths hinder the search for truth and the conversation between believers and non-believers .
Bad scholarship
There is a lot of bad and dishonest scholarship from both Christians and atheists .
For now , let me point out two instances of bad atheistic scholarship .
Atheists often point out that the word for God in Genesis 1:1 is elohim , the plural of el .
Thus , they say , it should be translated as “ In the beginning , the gods created the heavens and the earth , ” revealing Judaism ’s pagan roots .
Now , it ’s probably true that elohim was borrowed from the earlier Canaanite religions , where the term was used to denote a pantheon of gods .
But in this verse and hundreds of others , elohim is used with a singular verb , bara .
Here , elohim could be a collective noun for a singular God of many persons , much like we say “ The United States is full of fat people ” instead of “ The United States are … ”
Also , it is probably an instance of plural majesty , a Hebrew way of showing greatness by pluralizing a noun , as when Job 40:15 refers to behemot , meaning the greatest of all beasts ( the singular for “ beast ” is behemah ) .
It would be nice for atheists if the first verse of the Bible betrayed Judaism ’s polytheistic origins , but a careful reading of the Hebrew shows no such thing .
Another example .
The conspiracy theory documentary Zeitgeist argues that Jesus was just a made - up mix of other ancient gods .
For example , it claims that the Egyptian god Horus was born of a virgin , adored by three kings , was baptised at age 30 , had 12 disciples , walked on water , was crucified and buried for three days , and was then resurrected .
In fact , if you read any sources on Horus that are n’t specifically trying to draw parallels to Jesus , you ’ll find that nearly all these claims are simply false .
So are most of the other claims made in this section of the movie .
Still , these claims are repeated widely by many atheists , including Bill Maher in his movie Religulous .
Dogmatic materialism
Some atheists start with the Carl Sagan ’s assumption that “ the cosmos is all there is , or was , or ever will be . ”
Everything is matter .
Nothing is supernatural .
They may be right .
I do not expect to find evidence of the supernatural .
But we must be open to discovery .
The universe is a surprising place .
In fact , scientists recently discovered that only 4 % of the universe is matter and energy – at least , matter and energy as we have always understood them .
The other 96 % of the universe consists of stuff we know almost nothing about – “ dark matter ” and “ dark energy . ”
This stuff may not be supernatural , but it sure is unnatural !
Lewis Thomas wrote , “ The greatest of all the accomplishments of twentieth - century science has been the discovery of human ignorance . ”
Almost everything we once thought we knew has turned out false , and we often discover truths that our intuitions despise .
Dogmatism and absolute certainty do not belong in limited human minds .
Atheists should look at religion and atheism with the same common sense .

But now harder minerals have been found to exist Isifa Image Service sro/Rex Features

Diamond will always be a girl ’s best friend , but it may soon lose favour with industrial drillers .
The gemstone lost its title of the “ world ’s hardest material ” to man -made nanomaterials some time ago .
Now a rare natural substance looks likely to leave them all far behind – at 58 per cent harder than diamond .
Advertisement
Zicheng Pan at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China and colleagues simulated how atoms in two substances believed to have promise as very hard materials would respond to the stress of a finely tipped probe pushing down on them .
Extreme conditions
The first , wurtzite boron nitride has a similar structure to diamond , but is made up of different atoms .
The second , the mineral lonsdaleite , or hexagonal diamond is made from carbon atoms just like diamond , but they are arranged in a different shape .
Only small amounts of wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite exist naturally or have been made in the lab , so until now no one had realised their superior strength .
The simulation showed that wurtzide boron nitride would withstand 18 per cent more stress than diamond , and lonsdaleite 58 per cent more .
If the results are confirmed with physical experiments , both materials would be far harder than any substance ever measured .
“ Lonsdaleite is sometimes formed when meteorites containing graphite hit Earth ”
Doing those tests wo n’t be easy , though .
Because both are rare in nature , a way is needed to make enough of either of them to test the prediction .
Rare mineral lonsdaleite is sometimes formed when meteorites containing graphite hit Earth , while wurtzite boron nitride is formed during volcanic eruptions that produce very high temperatures and pressures .
Flexible friend
If confirmed , however , wurtzite boron nitride may turn out most useful of the two , because it is stable in oxygen at higher temperatures than diamond .
This makes it ideal to place on the tips of cutting and drilling tools operating at high temperatures , or as corrosion - resistant films on the surface of a space vehicle , for example .
Paradoxically , wurtzite boron nitride ’s hardness appears to come from the flexibility of the bonds between the atoms that make it up .
When the material is stressed some bonds re-orientate themselves by about 90 degrees to relieve the tension .
Although diamond undergoes a similar process , something about the structure of wurtzite boron nitride makes it nearly 80 per cent stronger after the process takes place , says study co-author Changfeng Chen at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , an ability diamond does not have .
Single crystals
Natalia Dubrovinskaia from the University of Heidelberg in Germany has carried out similar research .
“ This is important because any attempt to give an insight into the mechanism that improves a material ’s property , especially hardness , is technologically extremely significant , ” she told New Scientist .
The more that is understood about what influences the hardness of materials , the more it will become possible to design hard materials to order , she explains .
However , she points out that in order to prove the theory , single crystals of each material would be needed .
So far there are no known ways to isolate or grow such crystals of either material .
Journal reference : Physical Review Letters ( DOI : 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.055503 )
Update : 13 May 2014 by Jeff Hecht
The exciting results of the simulations described above remain unconfirmed by experiment , because there ’s simply not enough of these exotic materials to test .
“ There has been no report of synthesis of wurtzite boron nitride or hexagonal diamond in large quantity since our 2009 work , ” says Changfeng Chen .
But the search for ultra - hard crystals continues to turn up promising candidates .
Last year , Yongjun Tian of Yanshan University in Qinhuangdao , China , and colleagues studied a cubic form of boron nitride – rather than the hexagonal form
Chen studied – which they claimed was also harder than diamond .
The experimental details of that study have been criticised , but Chen believes Tian ’s material still bears investigating .
“ The main challenge is to understand the atomistic mechanism underlying this extraordinary result , ” says Chen .

No , they are not jelly candies ... they are Nudibranchs , probably the most colorful creatures in this world .
These amazing sea animals are members of one suborder of soft - bodied , shell - less marine mollusks , which are noted for their often extraordinary colors and striking forms .
Scientists have discovered more than 3000 species of these little moving rainbows but probably other thousands still have to be discovered .
They vary in adult size from 2 to 60 cm and thay are carnivorous and sometimes cannibals of their own species .
Their wonderful colours are due to the loss of the shell as a protection .
Some of them developed colours to achieve a perfect camouflage with their habitat , others on the contrary developed garish flamboyant colours to warn their predators about their toxicity .
I 've chosen some pictures from three wonderful galleries .
These first pictures are by David Doubilet .

Game developers tasked with crafting a game based on a movie franchise need only look to The Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena to learn how to do it right .
First , capture the central theme of the film : in this case , the careful balance between high - octane action and mankind 's innate fear of the dark .
Then ensure that the characters that initially gave the film such appeal are represented by pitch - perfect simulacra within the virtual world .
Finally , load the disc with content .
Athena 's biggest draw is the fact that it includes an upgraded version of its predecessor , Chronicles of Riddick : Escape From Butcher Bay , a 2004 sleeper hit on the original Xbox hardware that defied all the ( mostly true ) stereotypes about terrible games based on movies .
A " remastered " version is included here with the sequel , making this Xbox 360 ( reviewed ) , PlayStation 3 and PC game perfect for Riddick fans and newbies alike .
Both Athena and the updated Butcher Bay are excellent first - person , stealth - oriented , spooky adventures .
Created by Starbreeze Studios and Tigon Studios ( a development house founded by * Riddick * star Vin Diesel ) , Butcher Bay has received a high - definition makeover for its upgrade .
It would have been simple to port the game to the new hardware with upscaled textures and a widescreen aspect ratio , but its creators went the extra mile and reworked nearly every aspect of the game 's aesthetic presentation .
The next - gen remake retains Butcher 's Bay 's cinema - quality voice acting .
The game stars Diesel , Ron Perlman ( Hellboy ) , Lance Henriksen ( Aliens ) and Steve Blum ( Cowboy Bebop ) .
Hollywood actors lending their voices and likenesses to games is nothing new , but rarely is the process so well executed .
The voice actors all meld with their virtual counterparts so seamlessly that , while you may recognize their faces , your suspension of disbelief is never shaken by their presence .
Butcher Bay 's gameplay did n't get mucked around with either .
Once you 're accustomed to the new sights and sounds of the world , playing it feels exactly like the Xbox original .
The sequel , Assault on Dark Athena , plays quite similarly .
The focus is still on using shadows and stealth to avoid firefights while knocking off unwary enemies .
It 's filled with tension , although the difficulty level has been taken down a bit .
Dark Athena offers a good challenge , but it never becomes frustrating .
It would n't be much of an action game if all you did was slink by heavily armed soldiers , so when the time comes to fight , Riddick is well - equipped with a surprisingly large number of options .
Gunfights in Dark Athena are run -of - the - mill action - game fare .
There are some interesting motion blur effects and a useful cover mechanic , but if you 're ever played Gears of War , Halo or any other game featuring guns larger than most people 's torsos , you 'll instantly grasp the fundamentals .
Melee combat is the real joy of this game .
Throughout your quest , you 'll find a huge range of blunt weapons and cutting implements , all of which can be turned against your foes .
Instead of simply copying a single stabbing animation over every single bladed weapon , Dark Athena 's creators programmed noticeably different fighting styles for every single weapon .
Attacking with a club will lead to blunt swings at your foe 's head , and attacking with a combat knife will lead to a series of thrusts and slashes .
If , instead , you come at your enemy with a scalpel — a weapon not that far removed from a combat knife — your slashes are much more delicate and precise .
This variety in killing styles is most entertaining when sneaking up on enemies from behind .
Depending on what you happen to be holding when you creep up on a foe , you can assassinate them in any number of grisly ways , from the standard neck snap to gouging a hole in their skull to repeatedly stabbing the vital organs through the rib cage .
The care and attention to detail will make you want to witness every variation on the stealth kill .
At some point during gameplay , no matter how well you sneak , your enemies will discover you and attack .
Here again , the developers ' affection for melee combat is obvious .
Let ' say that an enemy rushes you with a shotgun .
If you get in close enough , he 'll attempt to club you with it , allowing you to counter his attack and turn the gun back on its owner .
Despite all this brutality and bloodshed , * Dark Athena 's * biggest success is in its more cerebral moments .
Running toward your enemies with guns blazing is a sure - fire way to get shot to pieces , so you 're often tasked with using the environment to your advantage .
As the game 's difficulty ramps up — and it does get very hard toward the end — it becomes crucial that you not only use the shadows and ventilation systems to navigate Riddick 's world , but also that you leave no tracks behind .
Each time you kill a foe , his body stays on the ground , offering evidence that you 've been there .
Stashing corpses in an out - of - the - way corner is thus very important .
Trying to ditch a body while listening to the angry shouts of an approaching enemy squad creates pure , adrenaline - fueled tension .
Riddick could have used a bit more polish , as you 'll often encounter bizarre graphical anomalies , particularly in the Butcher Bay remake .
For instance , during one cut - scene , a thin black line ran the length of Riddick 's head .
It disappeared moments later , but you will notice minor glitches .
Loading times , while infrequent , can take a long time .
They range from 15 to 40 seconds , and while it is n't enough to completely take you out of the game , players with short attention spans could easily lose focus staring at the black screen and loading bar .
The multi-player component is also not all I 'd hoped for .
" Pitch Black " mode ( which pits a single Riddick against a group of mercenaries in a dark arena ) makes fantastic use of the character and the game 's mechanics , but everything else included in the package just seems stale .
There is n't anything here you have n't seen in any number of other action games , and you wo n't be missing a crucial part of the game by ignoring its online components .
Even if you were to completely strip out the multi-player options , however , I 'd still highly recommend Assault on Dark Athena .
With a blend of action , strategy and atmospheric tension that perfectly complements the film series it 's drawn from , Dark Athena sets a new standard for games based on films .

Strains on the U.S. economy are so profound the Federal Reserve will be shackled to its zero interest rate policy for years to come , a San Francisco Fed economist argues in new research .
Writing for the bank ’s Economic Letter , Glenn Rudebusch says the Fed ’s history and its current economic expectations indicate “ the funds rate should be near its zero lower bound not just for the next six or nine months , but for several years . ”
The economist said the Fed will need to maintain this stance in part because its current interest rate policy is not easy enough , having been constrained by an inability to go below zero .
“ In order to deliver a degree of future monetary stimulus that is consistent with its past behavior , the FOMC would have to reduce the funds rate to - 5 % by the end of this year — well below its lower bound of zero , ” he wrote .
That ’s not possible , and it explains why the Fed will have to keep rates where they are for such a long time .
The policy Rudebusch is referring to is the one the Fed put in place at the end of last year , as it struggled to stimulate a rapidly faltering economy .
The Fed then took a step unprecedented in the era of modern monetary policy - making and pegged its overnight target rate in a band between 0 % and 0.25 % .
That was down from the overnight target of 5.25 % that was in place at the start of the crisis in late summer 2007 .
Pegging overnight lending rates so low allows monetary policy to add the most possible support to the broader economy .
But economic and banking troubles have been such that policy makers have been forced to adopt a radical agenda of emergency lending and direct market interventions , to create an environment where those rock - bottom borrowing rates can be more effective .
It ’s these more interventionist policies that have become the focus of market participants and economists .
Indeed , FOMC meetings are now more watched for what the Fed says about its intentions regarding purchases of Treasury or mortgage - related debt .
Most already expect , as Rudebusch predicts , monetary policy is n’t going anywhere anytime soon .
But even if rate policy decisions are n’t the star right now , they still matter .
The stance of policy has a lot to say about how weak the economy has become , and how much ground has been lost since the recession began .
Rudebusch wrote , “ Given the severe depth of the current recession , it will require several years of strong economic growth before most of the slack in the economy is eliminated and the recommended funds rate turns positive . ”
He notes that “ like many private forecasters , FOMC participants foresee persistently high unemployment and low inflation as the most likely outcome over the next few years . ”

Many have expressed irritation with the mother , Karin Venable Morin , for appearing to try to exert too much control over her adult daughter ’s life ( she is a senior at Stanford . )
Others have taken issue with Stanford for even making such rooms an option .
Still other comments have rapped the daughter for missing the dorm meeting at which rooms were assigned , though nowhere in the article is there any indication that the daughter was disappointed in her assignment .
Late this afternoon ( on the East Coast , at least ) , we received an extended comment from someone who described herself as “ Karin Morin ’s daughter , the person in question . ”
We spoke soon afterward , and she confirmed her full name , Daisy Morin .
She is 22 , and her major is film studies .
She graduates June 14 .
( Toward the bottom of this post , you ’ll find reference to a comment that arrived late tonight from Karin Morin . )
In her comment , the younger Ms. Morin confirms much of what our readers have suspected , namely that this matter is more a dispute between mother and child than between student and Stanford .
The younger Ms. Morin writes :
This conflict has very little to do with Stanford and gender - neutral housing .
Is has everything to do with my parents having a hard time adjusting to the fact that I ’m out of the house ( I ’m the oldest ) , I ’m 3,000 miles away , and - especially - that I ’m a liberal agnostic while they are conservative Catholics .
The NR really should have looked into this situation a little bit before publishing that article .
She also writes , “ I was happy with my rooming situation .
It made no sense to inconvenience a lot of busy people over something that was n’t actually a problem for me . ”
And she says in her comment that she moved into her co-op dorm fully aware of the possibility of “ living in a co-ed room . ”
When we spoke by phone , I asked Daisy Morin if her mother had made good on her promise — expressed in the National Review article — to refuse to pay for her daughter ’s spring term at Stanford .
The mother said she threatened to do so as a sign of her moral outrage at the institution for making such housing available .
Daisy Morin said her mother had indeed cut off her spring tuition payments .
In response , the younger Ms. Morin said she had taken out $ 3,000 in loans , in addition to other loans she already had as part of her financial aid package .

If you wish to comment further , you can do so using the comment box below or the comment box on our original post .
Meanwhile , the comment posted tonight by Karin Morin begins :
I take no particular pleasure in putting my family situation into the public eye .
I do think it ’s important for other parents to know what they are buying .
Some people like to call this concept “ transparency . ”
We would have been happy to have a discussion of what room situations were and were not acceptable to us as a condition of helping with college .
We do not believe in giving anyone a carte blanche with our money , even our adult children .
Unfortunately , dependents tend to avoid conflict ( and that includes college students ) .
That ’s why parents rely on institutional transparency .
For me , the point of writing about what happened to our family is to help other parents know what questions to ask and what discussions to initiate .
You can read Karin Morin ’s full comment here .
Finally , some of you asked in your comments — and in direct e-mails to me — for a bit more detail on the actual room that Daisy Morin was assigned , and whether it was one of several bedrooms off a main suite , or a single room .
Lisa Lapin , a Stanford spokeswoman , wrote me tonight to say , “ The room in question is a very large quad bedroom — so yes , a single room , but unusually large . ”
Keith Olbermann offers Sean Hannity $ 1000 for every second he can endure waterboarding .
Lawrence O'Donnell weighs in on why someone like Hannity would offer to be waterboarded in the first place .
Olbermann :
You 'll do it for charity ?
For the troops families ?
I 'll take you up on that Sean .
For every second you last , $ 1000 .
Live or on tape provided other networks cameras are there .
$ 1000 a second Sean because this is no game .
This is serious stuff .
Put your money where your mouth is , and your nose .
And I 'll double it when you admit you feared for your life .
When you admit the horrible truth .
Waterboarding , a symbol of the last administration , is torture .
[....]
O'Donnell :
The reason Sean Hannity thinks torture is a good idea .
The reason Sean Hannity thinks it works is because it would work on him .
There are two different kinds of people out there in the world .
The warriors which are a very , very tiny minority , less than 1 % of our population is ever going to face combat and then there 's the rest of us .
I am like Sean Hannity , one of those cowards , just like Dick Cheney who has refused throughout my life to enter the military and ever subject myself to anything dangerous occupationally where I might lose a tooth .
That is exactly Sean Hannity 's approach to life and he has exactly the same cowardly fear that I do of combat or submitting myself to anything of the kind of risk the American military does .
And so people who live where Sean Hannity lives and those safe places and the safe Cheney home where no one in the Cheney family would ever submit themselves to military service , ever submit themselves to the risk of torture .
They think torture works because it would work on them .
Because they are soft .
They are weak people compared to our military service people and they would crack under torture .
But al Qaeda , people who have devoted their lives to destroying their enemy , the people are willing to die in their exercises , they were all willing to die on 9 - 11 .
Sean Hannity thinks torture is going to work on them because he has never , never known the kind of commitment that those people have and nothing he 's done in his life measures that kind of commitment that the American military has or that our enemies have .
Our enemies are more committed than Sean Hannity will ever be .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Executives at American International Group have started giving back their bonus cash in full , according to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
On a conference call with reporters Monday , Cuomo said that of the top 20 executives who received the biggest bonuses , 15 have given them back in full .
The amount returned so far is about $ 50 million .
Of the top 10 highest earners , 9 have returned their bonuses .
According to Cuomo , the investigation into the distribution of the bonus cash continues .
" I am trying to get the money back because I believe that is what the American people deserve , " said Cuomo .
" I am hopeful that more AIG employees will heed the example set by their colleagues and pay the money back , " said Cuomo .
To those bonus earners who have returned the bonus cash , the attorney general said they have " done the right thing . "
Of the $ 165 million in bonus cash paid out to executives at the bailed out insurer , " it might be possible to recoup approximately $ 80 million , " said Cuomo .
The rest of the bonus cash will be hard to recover because it was paid out to non-Americans , and that is out of their jurisdiction .
Cuomo said that the Attorney General was going through the executives and calling them one by one , in collaboration with AIG .
Cuomo also said that for those AIG executives who returned the bonus cash , there was no " public interest " in making his or her name public .
" If they do return the money , I do n't believe they will be on a list that is ever revealed , " said Cuomo .
News of the bonuses sparked outrage over the idea that a company bailed out with taxpayer funds would compensate its executives so richly .
There have even been reports of threats against the safety of some AIG employees .
Out of the $ 165 million in bonus cash awarded to senior executives , 73 bonuses topped $ 1 million .
Cuomo said that some of the executives , who have been under tremendous public scrutiny in recent weeks , were not necessarily guilty of undermining the financial system .
" Many of these employees have nothing to do with the meltdown in the financial products division , " he said .
" These are people who are trying to do the right thing , " said Cuomo .
" These are people who have been subjected to outrage . "
The top bonus recipients who have n't committed to return their bonuses have not necessarily saying that they will not return the money .
Cuomo said that some executives were thinking about their decision , and that in some cases , the Attorney General 's office was simply not able to contact the executive .
AIG responded that they were happy their Financial Products ( FP ) personnel had opted to give back the bonus cash .
" We are deeply gratified that a vast majority of FP 's senior leadership have expressed a willingness to forsake their recent retention payments , " said Christina Pretto , Vice President of Corporate Media Relations at AIG .
" We continue to review the responses of our other FP employees and we appreciate Attorney General Cuomo 's support . "

Advertisement New CCTV cars to catch drivers using their mobile phones or being otherwise distracted at the wheel are being piloted by Greater Manchester Police .
The small Smart cars , which have a 12ft ( 3.6 m ) mast with a camera attached , are parked at junctions to monitor traffic .
Mike Downes of the Greater Manchester Casualty Reduction Partnership said the scheme was successfully " driving the number of accidents down " .
But the AA 's Paul Watters said drivers " might regard it as Big Brother " .
Proportionate and fair
Two cars are currently being piloted in Greater Manchester , among the first of their kind in the UK .
Anyone seen driving while distracted - eating at the wheel , playing with the radio or applying make - up for instance - is filmed by the cameras .
CCTV enforcement lacks connection with the driver until after the event
Paul Watter
AA Later , a letter is sent to the owner of the car , in many cases along with a fine .
Anyone caught using their mobile will be asked to pay £ 60 and have three points added to their licence .
Fines could also be handed out to anyone who is thought to be driving without due care and attention , or similar offences .
According to the Partnership - also known as Drivesafe - there have been 406 collisions in Greater Manchester in the past two years which can be attributed to distracted drivers .
Of those , 51 were said to involve the use of a mobile phone as a significant factor .
Mr Downes said the cars would only trace people who are committing an offence .
" The camera is only trained on the vehicle to secure the evidence , " he said .
" I would say the actions we are taking are reasonable , proportionate and fair in light of the fact that we are trying to save lives . "
' Lacks connection '
The scheme is only a few weeks into the pilot , so figures on the numbers of people who have been caught using this technology are unavailable .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It might be a deterrent to the unbelievable bad driving in this country Alex , Edinburgh
But the CCTV cars have already attracted criticism from people who argue they are an infringement of people 's privacy .
Paul Watters from the Automobile Association ( AA ) , said he had reservations about the cars , and would watch the pilot scheme with interest .
" CCTV enforcement lacks connection with the driver until after the event and some drivers might regards it as Big Brother .
" We think that most drivers would prefer police in cars to dish out tickets on the spot and instil better driving behaviour , " he said .
If the scheme is seen to be a success in reducing the number of accidents , those behind it hope it could be rolled out across the UK .
Some councils already use Smart cars with cameras to track parking and bus lane offences .

The drug court phenomenon celebrates its 20th birthday this year .
The first drug court , designed to find a more effective way for the criminal justice system to deal with drug offenders , was born in Miami in 1989 under the guidance of then local prosecutor Janet Reno .
Since then , drug courts have expanded dramatically , with their number exceeding 2000 today , including at least one in every state .
drug court scene
According to Urban Institute estimates , some 55,000 people are currently in drug court programs .
The group found that another 1.5 million arrestees would probably meet the criteria for drug dependence and would thus be good candidates for drug courts .
The notion behind drug courts is that providing drug treatment to some defendants would lead to better outcomes for them and their communities .
Unlike typical criminal proceedings , drug courts are intended to be collaborative , with judges , prosecutors , social workers , and defense attorneys working together to decide what would be best for the defendant and the community .
Drug courts can operate either by diverting offenders into treatment before sentencing or by sentencing offenders to prison terms and suspending the sentences providing they comply with treatment demands .
They also vary in their criteria for eligibility :
Some may accept only nonviolent , first - time offenders considered to be addicted , while others may have broader criteria .
Such courts rely on sanctions and rewards for their clients , with continuing adherence to treatment demands met with a loosening of restrictions and relapsing into drug use subjected to ever harsher punishments , typically beginning with a weekend in jail and graduating from there .
People who fail drug court completely are then either diverted back into the criminal justice system for prosecution or , if they have already been convicted , sent to prison .
Drug courts operate in a strange and contradictory realm that embraces the model of addiction as a disease needing treatment , yet punishes failure to respond as if it were a moral failing .
No other disease is confronted in such a manner .
There are no diabetes courts , for example , where one is placed under the control of the criminal justice system for being sick and subject to " flash incarceration " for eating forbidden foods .
Conceptual dilemmas notwithstanding , drug courts have been extensively studied , and the general conclusion is that , within the parameters of the therapeutic / criminal justice model , they are successful .
A recently released report from the Sentencing Project is the latest addition to the literature , or , more accurately , review of the literature .
In the report , Drug Courts : A Review of the Evidence , the group concluded that :
Drug courts have generally been demonstrated to have positive benefits in reducing recidivism .
Evaluations of the cost - effectiveness of drug courts have generally found benefits through reduced costs of crime or incarceration .
Concern remains regarding potential " net- widening " effects of drug courts by drawing in defendants who might not otherwise have been subject to arrest and prosecution .
" What you have with drug courts is a program that the research has shown time and time again works , " said Chris Deutsch , associate director of communications for the National Association of Drug Court Professionals in suburban Washington , DC .
" We all know the problems facing the criminal justice system with drug offenders and imprisonment .
We have established incentives and sanctions as an important part of the drug court model because they work , " he said .
" One of the reasons drug courts are expanding so rapidly , " said Deutsch , " is that we do n't move away from what the research shows works .
This is a scientifically validated model . "
" There is evidence that in certain models there is success in reducing recidivism , but there is not a single model that works , " said Ryan King , coauthor of the Sentencing Project report .
" We wanted to highlight common factors in success , such as having judges with multiple turns in drug court and who understand addiction , and building on graduated sanctions , but also to get people to understand the weaknesses . "
" Drug courts are definitely better than going to prison , " said Theshia Naidoo , a staff attorney for the Drug Policy Alliance , which has championed a less coercive treatment - not - jail program in California 's Proposition 36 , " but they are not the be-all and end - all of addressing drug abuse .
They may be a step forward in our current prohibitionist system , but when you look at their everyday operations , it 's pretty much criminal justice as usual . "
That was one of the nicest things said about drug courts by harm reductionists and drug policy reformers contacted this week by the Chronicle .
While drug courts can claim success as measured by the metrics embraced by the therapeutic - criminal justice complex , they appear deeply perverse and wrongheaded to people who do not embrace that model .
Remarks by Kevin Zeese of Common Sense for Drug Policy hit many of the common themes .
" If drug courts result in more people being caught up in the criminal justice system , I do not see them as a good thing , " he said .
" The US has one out of 31 people in prison on probation or on parole , and that 's a national embarrassment more appropriate for a police state than the land of the free .
If drug courts are adding to that problem , they are part of the national embarrassment , not the solution . "
But Zeese was equally disturbed by the therapeutic - criminal justice model itself .
" Forcing drug treatment on people who happen to get caught is a very strange way to offer health care , " he observed .
" We would see a greater impact if treatment on request were the national policy and sufficient funds were provided to treatment services so that people who wanted treatment could get it quickly .
And , the treatment industry would be a stronger industry if they were not dependent on police and courts to be sending them ' clients ' -- by force -- and if instead they had to offer services that people wanted . "
For Zeese , the bottom line was : " The disease model has no place in the courts .
Courts do n't treat disease , doctors and health professionals do . "
In addition to such conceptual and public policy concerns , others cited more specific problems with drug court operations .
" In Connecticut , the success of drug courts depends on educated judges , " said Robert Heimer of the Yale University School of Public Health .
" For example , in some parts of the state , judges refused to send defendants with opioid addiction to methadone programs .
This dramatically reduced the success of the drug courts in these parts of the state compared to parts of the state where judges referred people to the one proven medically effective form of treatment for their addiction . "
Heimer 's complaint about the rejection of methadone maintenance therapy was echoed on the other side of the Hudson River by upstate New York drug reformer Nicolas Eyle of Reconsider : Forum on Drug Policy .
" Most , if not all , drug courts in New York abhor methadone and maintenance treatment in general , " he noted .
" This is troubling because the state 's recent Rockefeller law reforms have a major focus on treatment in lieu of prison , suggesting that more and more hapless people will be forced to enter treatment they may not need or want .
Then the judge decides what type of treatment they must have , and when they do n't achieve the therapeutic goals set for them they 'll be hauled off to serve their time . "
Still , said Heimer , " Such courts can work if appropriate treatment options are available , but if the treatment programs are bad , then it is unlikely that courts will work .
In such cases , if the only alternative is then incarceration , there is little reason for drug courts .
If drug court personnel think their program is valuable , they should be consistently lobbying for better drug treatment in their community .
If they are not doing this , then they are contributing to the circumstances of their own failure , and again , the drug user becomes the victim if the drug court personnel are not doing this . "
Even within the coerced treatment model , there are more effective approaches than drug courts , said Naidoo .
" Drug courts basically have a zero tolerance policy , and many judges just do n't understand addiction as a chronic relapsing condition , so if there is a failed drug test , the court comes in with a hammer imposing a whole series of sanctions .
A more effective model would be to look at the overall context , " she argued .
" If the guy has a dirty urine , but has found a job , has gotten housing , and is reunited with his family , maybe he should n't be punished for the relapse .
The drug court would punish him . "
Other harm reductionists were just plain cynical about drug courts .
" I guess they work in reducing the drug - related harm of going to prison by keeping people out of prison -- except when they 're sending people to prison , " said Delaney Ellison , a veteran Michigan harm reductionist and activist .
" And that 's exactly what drug courts do if you 're resistant to treatment or broke .
Poor , minority people can't afford to complete a time - consuming drug court regime .
If a participant finds he can't pay the fines , go to four hours a day of outpatient treatment , and pay rent and buy food while trapped in the system , he finds a way to prioritize and abandons the drug court . "
An adequate health care system that provided treatment on demand is what is needed , Ellison said .
" And most importantly , when are we going to stop letting cops and lawyers -- and this includes judges -- regulate drugs ? " he asked .
" These people do n't know anything about pharmacology .
When do we lobby to let doctors and pharmacists regulate drugs ? "
Drug courts are also under attack on the grounds they deny due process rights to defendants .
In Maryland , the state 's public defender last week argued that drug courts were unconstitutional , complaining that judges should not be allowed to send someone to jail repeatedly without a full judicial hearing .
" There is no due process in drug treatment court , " Public Defender Nancy Foster told the Maryland Court of Appeals in a case that is yet to be decided .
Foster 's argument aroused some interest from the appeals court judges .
One of them , Judge Joseph Murphy , noted that a judge talking to one party in a case without the other party being present , which sometimes happens in drug courts , has raised due process concerns in other criminal proceedings .
" Can you do that without violating the defendant 's rights ? " he asked .
A leading advocate of the position that drug courts interfere with due process rights is Williams College sociologist James Nolan .
In an interview last year , Nolan summarized his problem with drug courts .
" My concern is that if we make the law so concerned with being therapeutic , you forget about notions of justice such as proportionality of punishment , due process and the protection of individual rights , " Nolan said .
" Even though problem - solving advocates would n't want to do away with these things , they tend to fade into the background in terms of importance . "
In that interview , Nolan cited a Miami - Dade County drug court participant forced to remain in the program for seven years .
" So here , the goal is not about justice , " he said .
" The goal is to make someone well , and the consequences can be unjust because they are getting more of a punishment than they deserve . "
Deutsch said he was " hesitant " to comment on criticisms of the drug court model , " but the fact of the matter is that when it comes to keeping drug addicted offenders out of the criminal justice system and in treatment , drug courts are the best option available . "
For the Sentencing Project 's King , drug courts are a step up from the depths of the punitive prohibitionist approach , but not much of one .
" With the drug courts , we 're in a better place now than we were 20 years ago , but it 's not the place we want to be 20 years from now , " he said .
" The idea that somebody needs to enter the criminal justice system to access public drug treatment is a real tragedy . "

" It 's always a crime when the potential of any kid is wasted away because a school system did n't provide the services they should be , " said Jane E. Lopez , a staff attorney with Multicultural Education , Training , and Advocacy Inc. , a national probilingual education group with offices in Massachusetts .
" It 's a huge problem and it should be an embarrassment to Boston public schools . "
The findings could also provide insight into what is happening in other school districts statewide .
Boston , the state 's largest school district , represents 29 percent of students who require English language learning support in the state .
The report looks specifically at languages most often spoken by them : Spanish , Chinese dialects , Vietnamese , Haitian Creole , and Cape Verdean Creole .
The report , which included a review of standardized test scores , attendance data , and suspension rates , steered clear of the contentious issue of whether the change in law was appropriate , and instead highlighted solutions that Boston should adopt to conform with the law .
" I think everybody recognizes we need to move with a sense of urgency , " said Johnson , who received a briefing from the report 's authors yesterday afternoon and was reviewing the findings .
" Children need help and we need to help them now . "
In an interview yesterday , Carol R. Johnson , superintendent of Boston schools , acknowledged shortcomings in the district 's programs but emphasized that she is committed to improving the performance of English language learners .
She said the district intends to revamp the way it tests students for those services , provide more comprehensive information to parents about services , and is expanding programs for those students .
Overall , the statistics show that the law - hailed as a quicker way to teach students English - has not helped them gain ground on their English - speaking peers , and in many cases may have left them even further behind .
In many cases , the district is failing to evaluate properly and subsequently identify hundreds of students for special language instruction , while also failing to provide parents with enough information to make sound decisions about program choices , according to the report , which analyzed data between 2003 and 2006 .
The report - considered the most comprehensive look at the law 's impact on any school district in the state - paints a picture of a system ill - prepared to serve nonnative English speakers , who make up about 38 percent of the district 's 56,000students .
In one of the most striking findings , the study found that the high school dropout rate nearly doubled for students still learning to speak and write in English , according to the report by the Mauricio Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and the Center for Collaborative Education .
Students not fluent in English have floundered in Boston schools since voters approved a law change six years ago requiring school districts to teach them all subjects in English rather than their native tongue , according to a report being released tomorrow .
Ron Unz , chairman of English for the Children , a California advocacy group that pushed for the change in Massachusetts law , said yesterday that he had not seen a copy of the report but noted that probilingual groups in California have released similar reports about that state .
He said he was skeptical of the findings .
" It could be a case that Boston is not doing a good job of implementing the program , " Unz said .
Voters approved the law change in fall 2002 against the backdrop of a contentious national debate over immigration ; school districts had nine months to implement the dramatic change .
The ballot question ended the state 's three - decade - old transitional bilingual education program , which promoted the practice of teaching English language learners subjects in their native languages while they learned to speak English fluently .
Under the new law , districts must teach all subjects in English even as students learn the language .
In most cases , students are taught as a group in a separate classroom , where a teacher uses more simplified English and pictures and graphics in teaching subjects such as science and geometry .
The goal is to merge students into regular education classes within a year or two .
Students can still be taught academic subjects in their native languages under the new law , typically when a critical mass of students who speak that language exist and parents want the program .
But many education advocates say school districts are unaware of that provision or do not generally let parents know of this right .
In one finding , the report found that a number of parents declined to enroll their children into English language learning programs , even though Boston officials had identified their children as needing extra help .
According to the report , the high school dropout rate for students whose parents declined such services tripled over the period studied .
One parent advocate said yesterday that many parents , particularly those who do not speak English , do not understand the consequences of declining services because school staff has failed to explain program offerings and the law properly .
" There is a lot of misinformation and miscommunication , " said Myriam Ortiz , acting director of the Boston Parent Organizing Network , an advocacy group .
" Parents go to the [ district 's ] family resource centers and feel lost .
They do n't always know what the options are or what 's the best options for their children . "
The report follows a state review of the district 's program last year that found thousands of students identified as English language learners did not receive support for the past four years , and ordered the district to develop a remedy .
Boston schools submitted their plan to the state this winter .
Boston has been without a permanent director for English language learning programs for nearly a year .
The report , which will be the subject of a forum tomorrow , also urged the state to undertake a study examining progress in all the school districts across the state .
" Once it 's the law of the land , it has to be done well , " said Miren Uriarte , a senior research associate at the Gastón Institute and a coauthor of the report .
" It 's a challenge for [ Boston ] and the state as a whole [ to make the changes ] , but they have to realize these kids are here to stay and it behooves us to educate them well . "

InfoWorld and Mr. Stephens
Sue Over Fictitious Supernerd
By DON CLARK
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Robert X. Cringely and the Public Broadcasting Service told viewers a lot
about the history of the personal - computer industry Wednesday night .
They left
out one interesting fact , though .
Robert X. Cringely does n't exist .
The host of the three - hour documentary , " Triumph of the Nerds , " is really
Mark C. Stephens , one of several authors of a popular gossip column in
InfoWorld magazine written under the Cringely pseudonym .
Mr. Stephens , 43
years old , penned the column between 1987 and last December , when InfoWorld
cut him loose .
But in a case with enough twists to give anybody an identity
crisis , the magazine and its parent , International Data Group Inc. , sued Mr.
Stephens in March for trademark infringement to block his continued use of the
Cringely name .
So far , they have n't had much luck .
In April , San Francisco Federal Judge
Robert Keeton denied IDG 's request to bar Mr. Stephens from using the Cringely
name while the case is in court .
The judge also granted Mr. Stephens's
request to have the case moved from Boston , headquarters of IDG , to San
Francisco , where Mr. Stephens filed his own suit .
It charges IDG with
copyright infringement for using his Cringely work outside InfoWorld without
authorization .
He claims IDG owes him as much as $ 735,000 and vows not to
settle without at least joint rights to use of the name .
That he even has a chance illustrates some murky nooks in
intellectual - property law , as well as apparent slip - ups by IDG , a closely held
company with $ 1.4 billion in sales but no lawyers on its payroll .
Above all ,
the tale is testimony to the opportunistic traits of Mr. Stephens , who came to
realize that the Cringely persona was more valuable than his own , to the
point that some people wonder where Cringely ends and Stephens begins .
" I chose to promote Bob rather than Mark , " Mr. Stephens says .
" It made sense
to keep my eggs in the most profitable basket . "
Cringely , the Series ?
In the magazine columns , Mr. Stephens , the third Cringely author , transformed
the character from a Sam Spade knockoff into an oversexed magazine editor who
trades racy repartee with Pammy , a fictional flame .
Mr. Stephens has used
Cringely as a platform for a lucrative career outside InfoWorld as an author
and pundit .
" Triumph of the Nerds , " the PBS show , was based on " Accidental
Empires , " a successful 1991 book Mr. Stephens wrote under the Cringely name .
He is working on another Cringely book and a possible TV series , and commands
up to $ 5,000 for Cringely speeches .
But few outside of InfoWorld know of the ruse .
In " Nerds , " Mr. Stephens , in
Cringely mode , tooled around Silicon Valley in his red Thunderbird
convertible , interviewing dozens of tech luminaries such as Bill Gates , Paul
Allen and Steve Jobs .
Most of them did n't know Cringely is just a pen name .
" It was months before I learned that he was n't named Bob , " says Stephen
Segaller , who co-produced the show for Oregon Public Broadcasting .
Blindsided
by the IDG lawsuit , OPB executives told Judge Keeton that reshooting the show
to expunge the Cringely name would expose them to claims from distributors and
broadcasters who had put up money for the show .
" The timing was
excruciating , " Mr. Segaller says .
Cringely has been an affliction to computer companies since 1986 .
The popular
column is rife with leaks about products , defects and consumer gripes .
But in
the hands of Mr. Stephens , the line between author and alter ego blurred .
Old
girlfriends of Mr. Stephens , for example , appeared in the column as
Cringely 's old girlfriends - and continued to appear after his ouster .
Mr .
Stephens introduces himself as " Bob Cringely , " has a credit card in Cringely 's
name and sometimes ponders real - life options by wondering what Cringely would
do .
Mr. Stephens 's real life , meanwhile , at times reads almost like a novel .
He
says he began writing obituaries for an Ohio newspaper at the age of 14 and
freelanced from Lebanon and other hot spots in his 20s .
He claims a doctorate
in communications from Stanford University ; it says its records show only a
master 's degree .
An accomplished stunt pilot , Mr. Stephens once blew his
savings on a propeller company .

" Accidental Empires , " which helped make Cringely a high - priced pundit , argues
that the industry was shaped by lucky nerds out to impress their friends .
That thesis grates on executives like Mr. Gates , chief of Microsoft Corp. , who
also disputes an anecdote in the book that describes the billionaire as
scrounging in his pockets for coupons at a checkout counter .
Mr. Stephens
stands by Cringely 's account .
InfoWorld initially thought Mr. Stephens 's outside activities were good
publicity .
The magazine signed a 1989 contract that allowed him to write the
book , while reserving its rights to the Cringely name .
But relations soured
between the writer and Stewart Alsop , an industry analyst and InfoWorld
executive vice president .
In December 1994 , Mr. Alsop fired Mr. Stephens , but
asked him to keep freelancing for $ 1,500 per Cringely column .
InfoWorld , however , neglected to get Mr. Stephens 's approval to use his
articles outside of the magazine .
After negotiations over a license to his
copyrights stalled , InfoWorld in December 1995 dumped Mr. Stephens altogether
and demanded that he stop using the Cringely name .
Mr. Stephens refused ,
demanding that IDG pay him $ 250,000 for violating his copyrights by publishing
his Cringely articles on the Internet 's World Wide Web and elsewhere .
That
was when InfoWorld and IDG sued him for trademark infringement .
" The issue is the confusion , " explains Patrick McGovern , IDG 's chief
executive officer .
" We have a terrific column coming out as Cringely , and Mark
Stephens has nothing to do with that at all . "
Character Issue
Courts usually side with trademark holders in such disputes .
Actor Clayton
Moore , the Lone Ranger in the old television series , was blocked from
appearing in his Lone Ranger mask for five years by a company that was
promoting a movie using a different actor .
But in the Cringely case , Mr.
Stephens makes the novel claim that his years of molding the Cringely
character entitle him to joint trademark rights .
( The column is still running
under the Cringely name , under at least two different writers since Mr .
Stephens left . )
Judge Keeton mused in an April opinion that Cringely had indeed become a
jointly created fiction , raising " fundamental " legal questions that might
trouble even a legal Solomon .
" The Robert X. Cringely of this litigation , " he
said , " is indivisible . "
Claude Stern , Mr. Stephens 's lawyer , says IDG abandoned the Cringely
trademark by not adequately supervising Mr. Stephens 's use of it .
Veronica
Devitt , a San Francisco trademark expert , thinks such a defense wo n't work but
agrees that IDG erred in failing to get a copyright license from him .
Says
Mr. Alsop : " We will not disagree with our opposition that we are human and
we 've made mistakes . "
To some , the case mainly points out the way the telephone and electronic mail
make it easy to sustain a fictional identity , in a way that perhaps can fool
even its creator .
" It 's a tale of Narcissus for the digital age , " says Paul
Saffo , an analyst at the Institute for the Future , a think tank in Menlo Park ,
Calif .
Insists Mr. Stephens : " I am Bob . "
H.R. 676 ( 111th ) was a bill in the United States Congress .
A bill must be passed by both the House and Senate in identical form and then be signed by the President to become law .
Bills numbers restart every two years .
That means there are other bills with the number H.R. 676 .
This is the one from the 111th Congress .
This bill was introduced in the 111th Congress , which met from Jan 6 , 2009 to Dec 22 , 2010 .
Legislation not enacted by the end of a Congress is cleared from the books .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - The U.S. company that has arranged for six tourists to fly in space said on Friday it is staying open for business despite the economic crisis and a lack of confirmed flight opportunities .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Space Adventures has been setting up flights aboard Russian Soyuz capsules when there are spare seats available .
The tourists have paid up to $ 35 million for the trip .
Charles Simonyi , 60 , who made a fortune as Microsoft ’s lead software developer , is now on his second voyage to the International Space Station .
But he is expected to be the last space tourist for the foreseeable future , as all Soyuz seats have now been booked for astronauts and cosmonauts representing the 16 countries working on the $ 100 billion orbital outpost .
Beginning next month , the station ’s resident crew is due to double from three to six , all of whom will fly on Soyuz capsules .
NASA and its partners will be solely dependent on Russia for crew transport due to the retirement of the U.S. space agency ’s shuttle fleet next year .
In a conference call with reporters on Friday , Space Adventures President Eric Anderson said his company would continue to prepare people for spaceflight on the chance that seats will free up on future Soyuz missions .
There was a possibility a cosmonaut from Kazakhstan , due to fly later this year , may not make the trip , Anderson said -- although a NASA spokesman said he had not heard of any changes to the crew .
Space Adventures , based in Alexandria , Virginia , is also pursuing dedicated commercial Soyuz missions , the first of which could be ready to fly as early as 2012 , Anderson said .
While Space Adventures ’ high - flying leisure business has been hit by the economic downturn , potential clients are still coming forward , he said .
“ The kind of person who has indicated an interest in going to space is a long - term thinker , ” Anderson said .
“ Someone who has had a life dream of going to space is not going to let an economic downturn -- even if it ’s a longer one than we would have hoped -- change their objective . ”
If you are following the recent updates about Windows 7 , I believe you have heard about Windows 7 XP Mode .
The Windows XP Mode is a virtual desktop environment running inside Windows 7 that will allow users to run Windows XP applications seamlessly with other applications on the desktop .
The XP Mode is indeed an exciting feature and it has generated quite a buzz in the blogosphere .
As more and more information about this secret Microsoft technology began leaking , it was revealed that not all processor will support the XP Mode .
Apart from the minimum requirement of 2GB of memory , the system should have a processor that supports hardware level virtualization from either Intel or AMD .
So how to tell if your processor supports hardware virtualization ?
Easy .
Both Intel and AMD offer free tools that allow you to check whether your processor supports hardware virtualization .
Intel Processor Identification Utility
AMD Virtualization Technology Check Utility
Unfortunately it has been told that the Intel tool is not one hundred percent reliable .
So here is a better tool that works with all Intel as well as AMD processors .
SecurAble is a standalone application that probes the system ’s processor to determine the presence , absence and operational status of three modern processor features :
64 - bit instruction extensions Hardware support for detecting and preventing the execution of code in program data areas Hardware support for system resource virtualization
We are interested with the 3rd result .
As you can see , the CPU tested in this screenshot supports hardware virtualization and hence can run XP Mode .
Zdnet blogger Ed Bott has prepared an extensive list of Intel processors that support or does not support hardware virtualization .
Checkout from the list below whether your CPU is lucky enough to run XP Mode .
( Thanks Ed )

A couple months ago I wrote that my Internet Computing column , “ Toward Integration , ” was going to end .
Indeed it did , but I ’m very pleased to report that I ’ve replaced it with a whole new column entitled “ The Functional Web . ”
The inaugural column is imaginatively titled “ Welcome to ‘ The Functional Web ' ” and it provides the background for what I plan to cover in the column going forward .
All signs indicate that functional languages are garnering significant interest these days .
At QCon last week , for example , it seemed like everyone was talking about them , and Real World Haskell did n’t just win a Jolt Award for nothing .
Most of my work these days involves web development with Erlang , and given my general interest in functional programming , the combination of these two areas seemed like the perfect direction for a new column .
If you ’re a functional programmer working in the web space and have a knack for writing , drop me an email .
If you ’ve got a good proposal , I ’d be happy to either co-author something with you or have you serve as a guest columnist for an issue .
Finally , I ’d like to thank the readers of “ Toward Integration ” very much for sticking with me for the past seven years .
That ’s a long time , but rest assured your many positive comments and your feedback kept me going — I deeply appreciate it .
I really hope you ’ll join me for “ The Functional Web ” and that you ’ll keep that excellent feedback coming — it ’s going to be interesting and I guarantee we ’re all going to learn a few things along the way .
Another leaf shot from this fall , this leaf was floating in a little pool in the creek I was working , I liked the blue reflections from the sky and the golden reflection along the bottom part of the image was from a limb filled with yellow leaves directly above the leaf .

Correcting 5 Misconceptions About AI Last updated on 07 Apr 2009
For the longest time , I have been interested in artificial intelligence .
The idea of computers that could make decisions and think independently fascinated me .
Of course , I knew that AI was n’t quite that advanced , but the idea still captivated me .
However , the barrier to learning AI was too high .
It was too complex and too academic .
Just looking at the mathematical notation involved made my head spin .
I eventually took the plunge and convinced my family to buy me Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach for Christmas , and 12 months later , I actually started reading it .
I ’m still reading it , and will be the first to admit I do n’t understand everything that is discussed , however there are a few things that I ’m realising about AI .
It ’s All About Searching
Searching is a constant in AI techniques .
Problems are defined and solution spaces are created .
Problems can be represented in a number of ways ( graphs , trees , logic knowledge bases ) , however in the end , it always comes back to searching .
This is important because searching is easy .
Searching is something that a lot of programmers already know , even if it ’s only at a most basic , brute force level .
We do searching all the time .
We loop through arrays searching for values , we use regular expressions to match string patterns , we retrieve records from databases .
We search .
At it ’s simplest , you can search using brute force searching , iterating over all combinations and permutations of solutions looking for one that satisfies the problem , but beyond that , you can involve tricky heuristics to make optimal decisions about how to search .
You can have local searches , which will pick a solution space and search it for local maximums , such as hill climbing , and searches that will find global minimums , such as simulated annealing .
But it ’s still search .
It ’s still something you can do .
It ’s More Common Than You Think
AI is a hell of a lot more prevalent than most people realise .
I did n’t think AI had much commercial application before I started learning about it , but luckily that did n’t dim my interest .
For those who are interested , but holding back because they do n’t see how it would benefit them , here ’s some good news .
AI techniques are used everywhere .
That international 4 city flight you booked used AI techniques .
A constraint satisfaction problem solver took all the constraints about needing to be at this city by that time , flying on this airline for that much , and creating a plan for you .
When Amazon recommends products you might be interested in , it calculates this with Bayesian networks and classifiers , a method of probabilistically linking a set of variables .
Circuit design , product manufacturing , supply chain optimisation , all of these things use techniques that AI use .
They ’re not the sole domain of AI , but learning AI will cause you to learn these too .
You Can Use It Today
Whatever you ’re working on , you can probably use AI techniques in it .
Even some of the more exotic sounding techniques like neural networks can be of use to you .
Self healing databases ?
Hell yeah .
Even Bayesian classifiers to catalog and categorise products , heuristic searches to mine data in databases , hierarchical task planners to plan that holiday or manage that Gantt chart .
Can you use it anywhere ?
No .
Your simple CRUD app probably wo n’t benefit from a wizz - bang heuristic search .
But if you ’re doing anything that involves large amounts of data , interacting with people , predicting trends and recognising patterns , you can use it .
It ’s In Demand
You may have heard of the Netflix Prize .
Guess what ?
That ’s AI .
Google is the biggest search engine around , and index billions upon billions of pages on the internet , and can get you relevant results to a question in a matter of seconds .
That ’s one hell of a big knowledge base , and one smart search algorithm .
Amazon sell products all over the world , and aggressively upsell and cross sell .
I get emails about related products I might like based on my wishlist and purchase history , and they ’re actually pretty accurate .
Also , computer games .
Enough said .
AI skills are in demand .
Not huge demand , but probably more that you would have guessed .
These skills are hugely profitable in the right hands , and big companies want to extract every single little morsel of useful information about your browsing , shopping , eating , travelling , viewing and reading habits in order to market to you more effectively .
Now that sounds a little creepy to me , but if that does n’t bug you , more power .
There ’s a Lot of Information Out There
AI is n’t some weirdo niche science topic .
There ’s actually quite a lot of information out there , once you start going down the rabbit hole .
“ AI : A Modern Approach ” cites hundreds of papers and books .
There ’s thousands of websites out there on the subject .
There are many academic papers that are made available for free online .
There are communities , like AIGameDev , dedicated to spreading that delicious knowledge .
I think the hardest part about finding information is getting the terminology .
It ’s pretty dense when you first get into it , especially when talking about acyclic directed graphs , and your idea of a graph was like mine was about a year ago , namely a few bars on a 2D Cartesian axis .
But once you ’ve got a foot in the door of the lingo , it can become pretty accessible , and information starts becoming more bountiful .
That foot in the door can be either a good , basic website , or in my case , a university level textbook designed to introduce people to AI .
AI is a big field , full of fascinating and interesting concepts and techniques , and it ’s a young field that ’s still full of potential .
It ’s not as complex or confusing as film and television would have you think .
That ’s not to say it ’s a walk in the park , as I stated earlier , I ’m probably running a 70 % rate of understanding what I ’m reading , but I ’m managing .
And if I can manage , so can you .
So if you ’re interested , there ’s no better time to start than now .
JRuby on Google AppEngine : First Impressions
Posted by Nick Sieger
I was surprised by Tuesday ’s announcements as much as anyone else .
Ola keeps secrets well .
He sent me a pull request for jruby - rack just last week mentioning “ some restrictive environments where you ca n’t start threads ” .
I did n’t blink , and instead just merged his patch .
Despite the surprise news , it turns out my timing was n’t bad .
Just a couple of weeks ago I was experimenting with the Python version of AppEngine , just to see what the fuss is all about .
Even though Google ’s had its share of criticism for building a platform that is difficult for developers to leave , the lock - in aspect did n’t bother me .
I ’m a pragmatist first , and I believe that we as developers are the only ones locking ourselves to a platform .
We have a choice , after all .
And look at all the developers willfully rushing to develop Cocoa applications for the iPhone .
The fact that their code is not useful on any other device is n’t stopping them .
The thing with AppEngine is that it ’s a unique platform all unto itself .
That may seem brutally obvious , but the point seems to be lost in all the frenzy surrounding the Run- Rails - Struts - Spring - Groovy - Grails - Lift - You - Name - It - Framework on AppEngine this week .
I ’m not saying it ’s a bad idea to try to run Rails on AppEngine ; quite the contrary .
I ’m saying you need to be honest about the trade - offs and constraints .
And in the case of Ruby and Rails , boy are there a bunch of them :
No regular net / http , restclient , ActiveResource usage .
Google has a URL fetch library , and has hooked up Java ’s HttpURLConnection to it , but none of the Ruby URL - fetching libraries use it .
, , usage .
Google has a URL fetch library , and has hooked up Java ’s to it , but none of the Ruby URL - fetching libraries use it .
No ActiveRecord .
‘ Nuff said .
For some folks , that ’s a welcome change , but wrapping your head around AppEngine ’s BigTable - backed data store takes some thought .
You just ca n’t view it like a SQL engine .
No RMagick / ImageScience/attachment_fu .
No ImageVoodoo even ( no javax.image APIs ) .
Google has it ’s own image manipulation API .
Startup / first request processing time is currently an issue .
It ’s not clear yet how long Google keeps JVMs warm , so if your application is idle , the first few hits to it return 500 errors .
I can only assume Google has a plan to address this .
Crypto .
Although java .security and javax.crypto
APIs are apparently whitelisted , I have n’t had time to figure out how to leverage them .
JRuby ’s jruby - openssl gem does not work , which means things like digest are n’t available .
That ’s currently a blocker for Rails ’ cookie session store .
are n’t available .
That ’s currently a blocker for Rails ’ cookie session store .
1000 - files limit per application .
In order to work around this , I ended up jarring up all the Rails gems when deploying a Rails application .
These are just a sampling of some of the problems you ’re dealing with on the AppEngine frontier .
They ’re all solvable ; it will take a little time and BST ( blood , sweat and tears ) .
The point is you ca n’t expect a Rails application on AppEngine to behave like all the Rails applications you ’ve written previously .
In return for your troubles , you get the AppEngine value proposition , which is actually attractive in a lot of ways : Google runs the platform .
You do n’t have to worry about it .
Transparent scaling , monitoring , logging , everything below your application code is taken care of .
Single - step deployment , with application versioning and rollback .
Scalable services : BigTable storage , memcached , scheduled tasks .
My friend Curt Thompson of Best Buy ’s Giftag.com talks about how they leverage AppEngine for a non -toy application .
( Curt also helped me get my Python AppEngine experiment up and running . )
In the end , I ’m still extremely excited about the prospect of using JRuby and Rails on AppEngine , and ca n’t wait to see what people build with these tools .
If you want a little head start , you can check out the first Rails application I deployed , jruby-rack.appspot.com .
The “ application environment ” page is the main dynamic action in the app , which just enumerates a bunch of request and system environment properties so you can get a feel for how things are set up in the AppEngine Java environment .
The source code for the application is linked from the front page .
Note that the app was deployed with JRuby trunk and JRuby - Rack 0.9.4 ; Warbler is not yet using these components but you can build them yourself , drop them in and try them .
We ’ll be updating JRuby , Warbler and other tools soon to make this process more seamless soon .
Stay tuned !

It 's hard to imagine any U.S. industry worse off than the automotive sector .
That is , until one considers the newspaper business .
Many have already started to shutter .
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer shifted to the Web .
The Minneapolis Star Tribune , San Francisco Chronicle , and Boston Globe - whose parent is the the New York Times Co. ( NYT ) - are under threat of closure .
Many newspaper publishers , like carmakers , suffer from too many liabilities , including debt and commitments to workers .
But auto companies have an edge that should allow them to restructure and survive , albeit through the bankruptcy process : Until someone invents an affordable version of George Jetson 's hovercraft , they can be assured of a minimum stream of revenue .
Not so the newspaper .
Even if some publishers wiped out all their debt they 'd still be stuck creating a product with high fixed costs and declining revenues , as readers and advertisers migrate to the Internet , where the economics are unappealing .
As a result , unlike say General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , closing the presses may be a more viable option than a Chapter 11 restructuring .
Take McClatchy ( MNI ) , the publisher of the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee , which reported losses last week .
McClatchy has $ 2 billion of debt , which it took on to buy Knight - Ridder , but sports a market cap of just $ 45 million .
Yet it is n't all that debt that 's making life hard at McClatchy .
Even if its creditors were to convert their loans to equity , cutting out interest payments entirely , McClatchy would still be losing money .
In the first quarter , advertising revenues at the chain plunged 29 % from the year before to $ 285 million .
Sure , costs have fallen too , but by only 12 % .
As a result , McClatchy has now reached a point where the price of paying its reporters and printing and delivering newspapers to its customers is $ 11 million greater than the income it generates .
And that 's before making the $ 34 million interest payments due to its creditors each quarter .
Sure , a portion of McClatchy 's troubles are cyclical .
The slowing economy has hit core advertisers of regional papers - local auto dealers , banks , department stores and real estate agencies - particularly hard .
But it 's impossible to know how much of the group 's woes reflect recession and how many are a result of the secular shift by advertisers away from the printed word towards the likes of Craigslist , job sites , Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and other platforms .
Without that information , it is difficult to figure out what kind of cost structure the business can support .
GM is in a different boat .
Consumers may have slowed car - buying for now .
But at some point they will need to replace their clunkers .
So , again , until the personal space ship is invented , there will be a viable automobile market , a piece of which General Motors is likely retain .
If only it were so for newspapers .

After 2.7.4 , the next major release of Scala will be 2.8 .
This version will make a rather bigger jump ahead than previous releases .
It will fix many outstanding tickets , and include several changes and additions .
Read below for more !
Features Included in Scala 2.8
At least the following new features will be included :
Redesigned collection libraries .
Scala 's collection class hierarchy has been redesigned to be more regular , expressive , and performant .
A snapshot of the new design is contained in the 2.8.0 x branch of Scala 's subversion repository .
A white paper explaining the new design is forthcoming .
The redesign is done so that most user code should be unaffected .
However , implementations of collections such as sequences , sets or maps will need to be re-adapted to the new framework to use its full functionality .
Named and default arguments .
Method arguments can be passed by names , and method parameters can have default values .
Package objects .
Packages can now be defined not just by files in some directory , but in addition by a special object that lists additional members of the package .
For instance , you could add a number of type aliases , which would then be visible as members of the package .
This functionality is used in the new collection libraries to ensure backwards compatibility .
For instance class
List in the new library will live in package scala.collection.immutable .
But code that accesses it as a scala .
List will still work , because there is a package object definition like this : package object scala type List [ + A ] = scala.collection.immutable.List [ A ] val List = scala.collection.immutable .
List ... }
Beefed up Scala Swing libraries .
There will be new functionality and better documentation in the scala . swing package .
Support for continuations .
A compiler plugin will support continuations as an optional feature of Scala , using a type - directed continuation passing transform .
Continuations are useful to implement advanced control constructs , for instance for asynchronous I/O , user interface event handling , or dataflow concurrency .
Type specialization .
A new @specialize annotation on a type parameter will produce specialized versions of the generic code for primitive types .
This makes it possible to avoid costly boxing and unboxing operations for higher - order functions or generic data structures such as arrays .
It can lead to important speedups .
Revamped REPL .
Scala 's interpreter loop will have a lot of new functionality .
In particular command completion will work .
Packrat parser combinators Scala 's combinator parser library will be upgraded to " packrat parsing " .
This helps efficiency and also permits more grammar styles to be expressed as parsers .
For instance , left - recursive productions can now be handled .
The 2.8 version will also drop most operations that were deprecated in earlier versions , and will no longer support the old version 1.4 of the Java Virtual Machine .
The class file format and compilation internals will be changed to some degree , so that programs compiled under 2.8 will not be compatible with binaries compiled earlier .
Source compatibility should be by and large assured , however .
Finally , concerning the timeframe , we want to have the first beta out at the beginning of June .
So that 's just 6 more weeks !
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico ordered schools and universities closed across the country , affecting some 33 million people , as the death toll from a swine flu epidemic that has terrified the nation rose to a suspected 149 , officials said on Monday .
The toll increased from 81 deaths early Sunday to 149 by midday Monday .
Twenty of the deaths have been conclusively tied to the flu , though officials say most of them are likely from the bug .
" We are in the most critical moment of the epidemic .
The number of cases will keep rising , " said José Ángel Córdova , the Mexican health minister .
Officials believe the virus has caused deaths in 10 Mexican states and probably spread through the entire country .
As of Monday some 2,000 people nationwide had been hospitalized with pneumonia , a respiratory disease that can be caused by the virus -- a jump of around 400 from Sunday .
Just over half the patients have already been treated and released , officials said .
On the 14th day of his vigil outside Mexico City 's main hospital for respiratory illnesses , José Luis Fuentes , a 50 - year - old auto - body shop worker , got some good news about his stepson .
Ricardo Jarquin , 33 , has been in intensive care since coming down with influenza .
i Tunes 8.1 adds lot of lovely features , like iTunes DJ , and apparently , a new passive - aggressive personality that 's in cahoots with the evil new iPod shuffle :
It completely screws up syncing with older gen iPod shuffles .

Apple forums are lit up with complaints about how iTunes 8.1 smacks around the older iPod shuffles :
It dupes existing files on the iPod , it copies podcasts out - of - order , does n't remove deleted podcasts , and wo n't play when connected to the computer are what 's documented ( and seconded and thirded ) by one user .
It seems to have issues with Smart playlists too .

Right now the only solution seems to be downgrading back to iTunes 8.0 until there 's a fix .
Oh , and is n't that photo Charlie found the best ?

The World From Berlin ' There Was No Reason to Accept The Risks of GM Corn '
The German government 's decision to ban the cultivation of genetically modified corn has been welcomed by most media commentators in Germany as an overdue step in response to fears that it poses unforeseeable risks .
One paper , however , scoffs that " progress has become a dirty word " in Germany .
If you were born in the eighties ( or did your retro homework ) , you may have have fond memories of a little Commodore 64 game by the name of Wizardry .
I was only four years old when it came out , but I managed to get my hands on it a few years later , and I clearly remember wandering through the game with a sense of awed fascination .
The game became famous for spearheading the dungeon - crawler genre ( although the first real dungeon crawler was Pedit5 , back in 1974 ) thanks to its dark atmosphere and brutal difficulty .
Twenty - eight years after Wizardry , Atlus has come to the table with The Dark Spire for the DS , a 3D dungeon crawler that clearly pays devout homage to the great crawlers of old .
Boasting a Shadowgate - turned - art deco aesthetic , the game places you in control of a party of adventurers who must ascend The Dark Spire and defeat the mad wizard Tyrhung .
Sounds like a good old fashioned adventure , indeed .
However , if dungeon crawlers are well known for anything , it 's the level of skill and tenacity required to successfully play one .
Atlus is never a company to back down from such a challenge , and The Dark Spire is difficult indeed .
But the big question is , will it appeal to more than just thirty - something gamers with a soft spot in their heart for the days of old ?
Follow me past the jump to learn the answer ...
The Dark Spire ( Nintendo DS )
Developer : Success
Publisher : Atlus
Released : April 14th , 2009
MSRP : $ 29.99
The Dark Spire begins simply and , like any good retro game , throws you more or less directly into the action .
You 'll find yourself face to face with the guildmaster , Eventail , who will ask you to create your party before heading into the training room .
This part of the game will be old hat to anyone who 's ever played a proper dungeon crawler before , but for those of you who have n't , the character creation allows you to choose a name , a race , an alignment , and then asks you press a button a few times to randomly set each character 's stats .
After creating a party ( or if you like , you can use the four characters already created ) , you 'll be shipped off to combat training .
This will be taught by Sir Garland , a knight with a strange sense of humor and a few weapons for your woefully underequipped motley crew .
Be smart and equip yourself with the goods he gives you and then get ready for a battle .
Your first fight is a good introduction to the basic menus .
For each action you take , there will be a little arrow to the right of it that will allow you to tweak it a bit .
For instance , when attacking , you can choose a swift , precision , lunge or rage attack , and when defending you can either choose to counter or hide .
In many games , what you choose in these types of battles does n't really make a vast difference , as you will probably be able to win anyway .
In The Dark Spire , making the wrong choice can cost you the death of the entire party , you included .
You 'll need to put your strategy cap on if you expect to get through this alive .
Defeating Sir Garland will also introduce you to your first treasure chest , as well as your first trap .
By inspecting a treasure chest , you can tell whether or not it has a trap on it .
To disarm the trap , you must choose a party member to do so ( your thief is always a good one to go with ) and then choose which parts to disarm in order .
Despite success or failure you still get the items within , but screwing it up means a nice dose of poison or some flying needles to go with them .
After returning to the guild and reporting your success , you 'll be given the main quest , which is to climb the tower and defeat the wizard .
Before leaving , you can prepare your characters by visiting the shop for items or the inn to rest and cure party members .
After leaving town , you 'll also notice that you can visit the Hall of Order or the Hall of Chaos .
Both halls will offer you services such as reviving dead party members , curing ailments and praying , which levels up your faith stats .
However , your ability to enter one or the other is alignment - specific , so you cannot enter the Hall of Chaos if your party members are all Lawful or Neutral , and vice - versa for the Hall of Order .
The training session is not too difficult , but once you enter the tower , things become truly hard .
After all , if you use the default party , your strongest warrior starts out with a whopping total of 13 hit points .
If you barrel forward without taking some time to level these guys right at the start , you 're destined to die and die fast .
Use a little patience though , and you 'll quickly learn the rewards of thinking before each move you make .
One thing that will help you out here will be to spend some time paying attention to your items and how they work with your party members .
For instance , you can equip your warrior with a wand if you so desire , but expect to see his status suffer for it .
There 's no guide that tells you what weapon is best on each type , except the tiny bit of info you can glean from pressing Y while in a shop , so it 's all about trial and error when it comes to equipping your characters properly .
Pay close attention , as it could save you a few dozen deaths .
Of course , if you 're all over the hardcore difficulty , you may enjoy a little lagniappe that the developers threw in called Classic Mode .
Hit start and select this from your menu , and the game will revert to wireframe mode , which ought to hurl you directly back into 1981 .
The average gamer is totally not going to get into this feature -- it is all about the hat tip to the dungeon crawlers of the past here .
So let 's say that you do persevere and manage to push your party past the first round of early deaths and actually advance a bit , you 'll really get a taste of what elevates The Dark Spire from being good to great : its personality .
For instance , while wandering about on the first floor of the dungeon you randomly encounter a guy who wants to sell you an " Important Item " .
No word on what it actually is , mind you , and he wo n't tell you anything about it , but you can either choose to take it or leave it .
During this encounter I actually found myself thinking of the Goriyas in The Legend of Zelda who says " grumble , grumble " to you -- something about the subtle humor of both encounters has a charm that too many games miss entirely .
That being said , The Dark Spire is simply not a game for everybody .
The patience it takes to level your characters up enough to even pass the first few levels of the dungeon is of a quality that many gamers will not possess .
However , for hardcore fans of dungeon crawlers and roguelikes , The Dark Spire will provide a stylish and enjoyable experience that will keep you busy for some time .
You have to hand it to Atlus and Success for taking on a project that 's aimed at such a niche audience -- their passion for giving gamers a hardcore title obviously ranked above any need to dumb the game down .
Bravo !
Score : 7.5 -- Good ( 7s are solid games that definitely have an audience .
Might lack replay value , could be too short or there are some hard - to - ignore faults , but the experience is fun . )

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration will ask Congress for another $ 83.4 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of September , Democratic congressional sources said Thursday .
President Obama 's spending measure is likely to be the last supplemental request submitted to pay for the wars .
The request is expected to pay for those conflicts for the rest of the 2009 budget year , two Democratic congressional sources said .
The money would bring the running tab for both conflicts to about $ 947 billion , according to figures from the Congressional Research Service .
More than three - quarters of the $ 864 billion appropriated so far has gone to the war in Iraq , the agency estimated .
Since taking office in January , President Obama has announced plans to shift troops out of Iraq and beef up U.S. forces in Afghanistan , where American troops have been battling al Qaeda and Taliban fighters since al Qaeda 's 2001 attacks .
In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Obama said the situation in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan " demands urgent attention . "
" The Taliban is resurgent , and al Qaeda threatens America from its safe haven along the Afghan - Pakistan border , " Obama wrote in submitting the funding request .
" There is no question of the resolve of our military women and men .
Yet , in Afghanistan , that resolve has not been matched by a comprehensive strategy and sufficient resources , " Obama wrote .
About $ 75 billion of the latest request would pay for military operations , including $ 9.8 billion for body armor and protective vehicles and $ 11.6 billion to replace worn - out equipment .
The rest would go to diplomatic programs and development aid -- including $ 1.6 billion for Afghanistan , $ 1.4 billion for Pakistan and $ 700 million for Iraq .
The request would also provide about $ 800 million for the Palestinian Authority , including humanitarian aid for Gaza , the Hamas - ruled territory that was heavily bombarded by Israel in December and January ; $ 800 million to support U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa ; and $ 30 million to the Department of Justice to manage the closure of the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The supplemental spending bill is likely to be the last such request submitted to Congress to pay for the wars , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
While the Bush administration relied on supplemental spending bills to fund the conflicts , Obama began including war spending in his 2010 budget .
The president urged Congress to move quickly on the request " and not to use the supplemental to pursue unnecessary spending . "
But Rep. Lynn Woolsey , a prominent anti-war Democrat , said the requested funding would " prolong our occupation of Iraq through at least the end of 2011 , " when U.S. troops are scheduled to leave the country , " and it will deepen and expand our military presence in Afghanistan indefinitely . "
" Instead of attempting to find military solutions to the problems we face in Iraq and Afghanistan , President Obama must fundamentally change the mission in both countries to focus on promoting reconciliation , economic development , humanitarian aid , and regional diplomatic efforts . "
Last month , Obama announced the United States plans to withdraw most of its troops from Iraq by the end of August 2010 .
A residual force of between 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain until December 31 , 2011 .
There are 142,000 American troops in Iraq now .
Obama has ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to fight the Taliban in the south and east and 4,000 more to train Afghan troops .

Die Bundesregierung erhofft sich von dem geplanten Gesetz zur Bekämpfung der Kinderpornographie im Internet offenbar wesentlich weitergehende Überwachungsmöglichkeiten als bislang bekannt .
Gegenüber heise online erklärte jetzt Ulrich Staudigl , Sprecher im Bundesjustizministerium , dass man in der Regierung durchaus eine Überwachung der von den Providern gehosteten Stoppseiten - Server durch Strafverfolgungsbehörden in Betracht zieht .
Diese Planungen kommen überraschend , denn im Gesetzgebungsverfahren war bislang von keiner Seite die Rede davon , dass ein Echtzeitzugriff auf die von Providern geloggten Nutzer - IP - Adressen zu Strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen möglich sein soll .
Im Gegenteil versuchte Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen vor rund einem Monat noch die Wogen zu glätten , indem sie beispielsweise gegenüber der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung bezüglich des geplanten Gesetzes behauptet hatte : " Eine Auswertung der Internetkommunikation findet nicht statt . "
Justizministeriums - Pressesprecher Staudigl erläuterte heise online auf Nachfrage , was Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries am vergangenen Mittwoch nach dem Kabinettsbeschluss zum Gesetzgebungsverfahren lediglich angedeutet hatte : Laut Gesetzentwurf ist es Staudigl zufolge den Strafverfolgungsbehörden nicht immer möglich , " retrospektiv auf gespeicherte Daten zugreifen , sodass nur eine sogenannte Echtzeitüberwachung in Betracht kommt " .
Die funktioniere dann " ähnlich wie bei einer inhaltlichen Telekommunikationsüberwachung .
Die auf den Stopp - Server zulaufenden Anfragen , also zum Beispiel die IP - Adresse des Nutzers , werden als Kopie live an eine Überwachungsanlage der Strafverfolgungsbehörde ausgeleitet und dort verarbeitet " .
Eine solche Maßnahme könne aber nur durch richterlichen Beschluss angeordnet werden , betonte er .
Staudigl bestätigte in diesem Kontext , dass jeder Nutzer mit Strafverfolgung rechnen muss , wenn er dabei beobachtet wird , eine geblockte Webseite abzurufen : Ein " aufgrund der Umleitung zur Stoppseite erfolgloser Versuch , eine Internetseite mit kinderpornographischem Material aufzurufen , erfüllt die Voraussetzungen dieses Straftatbestands und begründet daher den für strafrechtliche Ermittlungen notwendigen Anfangsverdacht " .
Die Unschuldsvermutung gelte aber weiterhin , denn " den Nachweis des Vorsatzes müssen selbstverständlich die Strafverfolgungsbehörden führen " .
Falls das Gesetz wie geplant in Kraft tritt , sollte sich allerdings jeder Internetnutzer genau überlegen , ob er noch unbekannte Webadressen ansurft .
Geriete man etwa versehentlich oder durch böswillige Hinweise provoziert zu einem Stoppschild , würde dann de facto eine Hausdurchsuchung oder Schlimmeres drohen .
Auch dies bestätigte Staudigl : " Ob und gegebenenfalls wer sich strafbar gemacht hat , wird regelmäßig erst durch die sich daran anschließenden strafrechtlichen Ermittlungen geklärt werden können . "
Während Staudigl heise online am gestrigen Freitag Abend diese Klarstellung zukommen ließ , erklärte Familienministerin von der Leyen im Interview mit dem Berliner Sender radioeins die Folgen ihrer Gesetzesinitiative gänzlich anders : " Der zufällige Versuch , da machen Sie sich nicht strafbar .
Sonst müsste jeder , der eine Spam - Mail bekommt oder etwas Falsches eingibt , sich sofort strafbar machen . "
Auf die Nachfrage der Moderatorin , ob es denn geplant sei , IP - Adressen zu speichern und für die Strafverfolgung auszuwerten , erläuterte die Ministerin : " Es gibt eine DNS - Sperre , da wird nichts gespeichert . "
Nochmals fragte die Moderatorin nach , ob nicht IP - Adressen bei den Stoppschild - Servern gespeichert und von Strafverfolgungsbehörden verwendet würden .
Von der Leyen antwortete : " Das Gesetz , das jetzt im Bundestag ist , lässt grundsätzlich offen , dass , wenn kompliziertere Sperrtechniken verwendet werden , und die obersten Strafbehörden , zum Beispiel die Staatsanwaltschaft , das brauchen , grundsätzlich Spuren verfolgt werden könnten . "
Im vom Bundeskabinett verabschiedeten Gesetzentwurf ist von einer derartigen Einschränkung auf " komplizierte Sperrtechniken " allerdings nichts zu lesen .
Ganz im Gegenteil bezieht sich die Befugnis für die Provider , Zugriffs - IP - Adressen am Stoppschild - Server zu speichern und zu Ermittlungszwecken weiterzugeben , unmissverständlich auch auf die nach von-der - Leyen - Lesart unkomplizierte DNS - Sperre .
Die aktuellen Äußerungen der Bundesfamilienministerin führen folglich gleich in mehreren Punkten in die Irre .

Mazda China wo n't be jumping on the bash Michael Phelps bandwagon , choosing to retain Phelps even after the bong photos as long as he focuses on the zoom zoom and not the puff puff .

Imagine a country where people are sensible enough to believe smoking a little pot does n't erase your life 's accomplishments .
Where taking a bong hit at a party does n't make sponsors scream " Wo n't someone think of the children ? "
Where it 's OK to be human .
Who would 've thought that country would be China ?

Just last month Phelps signed the most lucrative sponsorship deal in Chinese history , promoting the struggling Mazda brand there .
The swimmer won eight gold medals at last summer 's Beijing games , rocketing him to instant celebrity in the country .
Since the bong photo emerged on January 31 , Phelps has lost sponsorship deals with Kellogg 's and Subway .
Apparently neither brand saw the lucrative munchies potential of a pot - fueled image .
Now , DMG Entertainment , which inked the Mazda deal , has said the scandal " does not affect the deal .
We do n't condone what he has done , but this is not the time to turn our back on him .
Ultimately it's what Michael does in the pool that counts . "
Wow , that makes a lot of sense .
We assume the Chinese will happily photoshop fireworks over any photos of Phelps with pot .

Less than three months after the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that there were major security vulnerabilities in two crucial Internal Revenue Service systems , the IRS 's security practices have been panned by another government entity .
This time , the criticism ( download pdf ) comes from the Government Accountability Office , which last week released a report highlighting several problems with how the IRS protects taxpayer data .
The 24 - page assessment examined existing policies and controls as well as IRS efforts to fix security issues reported in a previous GAO audit .
The report shows that taxpayer and other sensitive data continues to remain dangerously underprotected at the IRS .
According to the GAO , while the IRS has addressed 49 of 115 previously reported security issues , several critical areas remain vulnerable .
For example , the IRS still does not always enforce strong password management rules for identifying and authenticating users of its systems , nor does it encrypt certain types of sensitive data , the GAO said .
It also noted that the IRS has a tendency to allow sensitive information such as user IDs and passwords to be " readily available " to any user on its networks .
Weak passwords and excessive access on the network for authenticated users were also cited as potential threats to taxpayer data .
A lot of the issues are the result of a continued failure by the IRS to implement any agency - wide information security program or review risk assessments annually , the GAO said .
As a result , the agency remains " particularly vulnerable " to insider threats and malicious attacks that could expose financial and taxpayer data .
The GAO pointed to specific security problems , including the following : Exposed usernames and passwords on an IRS contractor - maintained Web site ; authenticated users on the IRS network with access to shared drives containing taxpayer information , performance appraisal data and sensitive data such as Social Security numbers for other IRS employees ; financial information and account data that was transmitted in the clear from the IRS 's financial accounting system ; inadequate logging of security events for Unix and Windows servers at a data center , and a similar lack of controls for logging changes to mainframe data sets at another data center ; a failure to maintain or enforce a baseline configuration for a mainframe system , which supports the revenue accounting operation of record and other critical applications .
The steps the IRS has taken to improve security include setting up better controls to prevent network access by unauthenticated users ; paying more attention to patching critical vulnerabilities ; and formulating better contingency plans for documenting critical business processes .
In a one - page response to the report , IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman said data security and privacy are of " utmost importance " to the IRS , and he pledged that the agency would provide a " detailed corrective action plan " that addresses the concerns raised by the GAO .
A spokesperson at the IRS could not be immediately reached for comment .
The GAO 's report follows one released last October by the inspector general for tax administration that was also critical of the IRS 's security controls for sensitive data .
That report focused specifically on security vulnerabilities in a new system the IRS is rolling out called the Customer Account Data Engine ( CADE ) , plus a related piece of technology called the Account Management Services ( AMS ) system .
The $ 1 billion CADE system is designed to eventually manage all taxpayer accounts and replace the agency 's existing Master File tax processing systems by 2012 .
The $ 700 million AMS system , meanwhile , is designed to provide faster access to the taxpayer information stored in the CADE database .
The October inspector general 's report ( download pdf ) identified several weaknesses with access control , system access monitoring , and disaster recovery involving the CADE and AMS systems .
Those weaknesses posed direct threats to taxpayer data , according to the report .
Just a week before that , the inspector general had issued a separate report detailing weaknesses in several other IRS systems .
This story , " IRS Taxpayer Data is Insecure " was originally published by Computerworld .
Most of us were introduced to the Moken last winter , when there was a brief flurry of stories on how the “ sea gypsies ” of Thailand and Burma managed to escape the tsunami by reading the language of the ocean — a language exceedingly familiar to a people who spend all of their lives in or very close to the water .
It was a heartening tale , in a context where those kinds of tales were hard to come by , and it gained intrigue from the other tidbits we learned about this remote tribe : how their four - year - olds can swim in waters 20 feet deep and adults can dive to 200 feet ( most of us conk out by 30 feet ) ; how throughout most of history they lived on boats , coming in to terra firma for only a few months each year ; how Moken children have learned to constrict their pupils to see 50 percent better under water than we can , enabling them to go harpooning without goggles and find tiny shells on the ocean floor .
All of which is true , and amazing .
But there ’s one more story that , perhaps , we should also have heard : how the Moken have been struggling to maintain their lives and livelihoods in a world that claims to admire them but has little room for their expansive relationship with the natural universe .
For starters , their ancestral fishing grounds are bisected by the tightly patrolled Thai - Burma border ; thus , after centuries of plying the ocean to find spouses or visit family , the Moken are now isolated from their relatives much as European families were divided by the Iron Curtain .
Little is known about the lives of Burma ’s Moken .
On the Thai side , the entire population has been forced to settle in the Surin Islands , a national park , where they are forbidden from cutting down large trees ( a conservation - minded rule that instantly put an end to their houseboat - building , and thus their lives at sea ) and collecting shells to trade .
Instead , they are marketed as a sightseeing attraction and encouraged to sell handicrafts to tourists .
All the usual curses of modernity have arrived on the islands , from junk food and booze to much worse .
One village elder told photographer Andrew Testa that no fewer than 10 Moken , out of a population of 200 , have come down with AIDS after trips to the mainland , and that his own son died of the disease .
All of which makes Testa ’s photographs all the more compelling — for what they document is a culture that , in the face of such challenges , has maintained a remarkable degree of self - reliance .
Like the Moken , Testa found himself spending much of his time in the water , following bands of kids as they swam , dove , and leaped off stilt - built houses into the ocean ( no fears here of sharks , octopi , and the other creepy - crawlies that keep Western kids marooned on the beach ) .
There ’s a joy in these photos that you do n’t often see in the land of the PlayStation 2 , a balance and sheer grace that seem both effortless and unshakable .
Maybe for a people who can outrun tsunamis , industrial civilization is no match either .
... and then I dreamt that I actually got somewhere in the wheel .
Do you think I 'm crazy , Doc ?
Does this all mean something ?

All enterprises must eventually accept that security is just one more part of software or system development lifecycle .
Both designs and implementations must be reviewed , developers need security training and infosec teams need the power to veto go - live dates .
Lots of businesses have arrived at this point .
But what often happens as a result is security gets siloed per project .
The project scope determines where security people will see , where there is budget , and critically , where the incentive to fix the problems lies .
This means that the way that project siloes interact -- the reefs between scope islands -- are never in scope .
And as we all know , scope is for project managers , auditors and security consultants .
Hackers do n't care about your scope .
Let 's look at how scoping can create some pretty peverse outcomes .
So I owned this bank system .
Hard .
Pentesting externally , I managed to go from no auth to complete customer account compromise .
I could reset passwords , transfer money , whatever .
Pretty bad as customer facing banking system deployment projects go , right ?
I head to the wrapup meeting , held in a typical bank meeting room .
You know the type -- poorly cleaned motorised - printy whiteboard that no longer motors , acoustic tiled ceiling the colour of institutional gravy , one glass wall out into the post - carpet - cubicle humanist refurbishment .
The cubicles are slightly curvy now , less beige , lower and more modular and hip , but still festooned with the trademark flotsam of the corporate slum ; a thousand colour laser printed pictures of funny cats , babies , daughters with ponies , movie posters with someone 's head photoshopped -- no hang on , MS paint .
exe'd -- on and captioned with some tepid project in - joke .
This is the meeting where I explain what 's going to be in the report , discuss the technical remediation options with the developers and the impact on project go - live signoff with the project manager .
Normally what you 're aiming for here is dismissive - defensive - disbelief - dawninghorror from the developers , and something approaching open weeping from the PM .
A grimace is good , but actual sobbing is better .
I lay it out for them .
A few technical details for the nerdy types , some screenshots on my laptop for the PM , then the chill starts to set in .
The PM is ashen , the developers in the final d-stage .
Beautifully orchestrated meeting - fu , Metl .
They 're weeping from the palm of my hand .
So much for that project deadline , now a zeppelin destined to miss its mooring post in the dark night sky .
" Oh , god , there 's no way we 're going to be able to go live Friday week , " the PM cries .
" This is a disaster ; Bob 's HVT project depends on , oh , and the entire New SSI project ...
How are we going to ... "
But I too am human and I misjudge my final salvo ; I let my guard down , falling for the anthropomorphism the marketing team work so hard to erect :
That the corporation is a caring , living organism , in verdant symbiosis with its adoring customers .
" I , uh , think this affects the live system too , " I say .
" Whaaaat ? "
" Yeah .
I did n't test it obviously , but this bug is due to the way your new system interacts with the backend DollaMasta2000 .
If anything , it 's a business rules bug , where your ... "
I trail off .
The project manager has a rictus grin on her face .
All of a sudden I feel unsure of myself , like I 've just made some awful faux pas .
I feel like a turd in a punchbowl .
" Are you saying , " she begins slowly , " that this affects the production system ?
That you could do this to anyone 's real accounts ?
My account ? "
Oh , phew , I think .
She does get it after all .
" Yes ! " I gush , enthusiasm at my own cleverness replacing the awkwardness of a moment before .
" I can own anyone 's account , this is pretty bad . "
" OH THANK CHRIST FOR THAT ! "
I blink .
" LEGACY ISSUE !
OUT OF SCOPE !
DOESNT AFFECT OUR GOLIVE !
NOT EVEN IN OUR BUDGET !
OOOOH YEAH ! "
There 's a big , shit - eating grin on her face .
You . have .
got. to . be. kidding , right Metl ?
No , I 'm not .
I 'm serious .
This is how it went down .
I 'm not making this up .
That 's what " scoping " is doing to your enterprise .
So here 's my one line take - away for this week :
Hackers do n't give a shit about your scope .
They could n't care less if that legacy HPUX box was n't in scope when you did the Northern - Data - Centre Refresh Project .
They do n't care that layer - 2 segregation is implemented by one team , but that layer - 3 filtering is implemented by another , and the two do n't talk .
They do n't care that all your corporate laptops are locked down as hell , because the CEO is surfin ' on his wireless toobs at the airport business class lounge and just got owned .
The fundamental asymmetry of this industry wins - the hacker only has to find one easy way in , and that , I guarantee you , will be in the place that was never in scope .
Project - based security is important for the long - term health of your business , but do n't let it starve out real , holistic , enterprise - wise security goals .
Do n't write off business - targeted , no -holds - barred pentesting as ' scaremongering ' ; do n't get hostile because the pen-testers waltzed around your network popping shells and illuminating your failings with all the stark horror of a blacklight in a Vegas hotel room .
It 's our job , and some of us are good at it .
Sometimes you need to let us own you , hard , brutally and for real .
To show you how easy it is , to gouge out real business impact , to shred all the garish crepe paper disguising the cracks around your delusional scoping .
You need to be re-focussed , brought back down to earth , out of your politics and scoping and business silo structure , because the truth here is that no one outside of your organisation gives a shit , and least of all the dude that just owned you .

My iPhone says I ’ve died of dysentery .
Though somehow , the fact that it comes from a cute little cartoon makes the blow a little easier to take than back in a computer lab twenty years ago with the green - and - black pixels of the original Oregon Trail .
Last week , Oregon Trail became available as an iPhone app for $ 5.99 .
Which , actually , is a bit on the pricey side for apps these days .
Is it worth the cash and the space ?
Well , to be honest , despite the joy of writing this article for you people , I do n’t think I ’ll be getting much use out of it .
Because the game has been pretty much completely overhauled , there ’s actually not that much nostalgia value .
And whereas it was pretty fun when ( a ) I was ten , and ( b ) it was the height of gaming technology , it ’s not really holding my attention anymore .
On the bright side , I think that it might appeal to kids as much as any other “ educational ” game ( and indeed , it ’s even more educational than the original since it ’s got a lot of fun facts about history mixed in ) .
Though how many ten - year - olds have iPhones ?
Some of the major changes ( besides the graphics ) are that there are mini - games – besides hunting as in the original , there ’s also fishing , telegraph sending , and fixing the wagon , for example – and “ quests ” ( which do n’t seem to involve any work or have any effect , but rather are just completed as a side - effect of going through the game ) .
Though it is kind of neat that you guide your wagon down rivers by tilting the iPhone .
The game logic is a little different , too ; for example , when you start out you choose banker , carpenter , or farmer , but it ’s based on more than just money – a carpenter can fix the wagon more easily , and a farmer requires less food .
Of course , there ’s one missing element that was particularly disappointing … remember how in the Apple version of the original you could write whatever you wanted on the tombstone of someone who died ?
This was , of course , the opportunity for kids to use all of the dirty words they knew .
All in all , it ’s a cute game .
But I still think I would rather just get a port of the original for $.99 – in my opinion , the appeal of Oregon Trail for most iPhone users would be the nostalgia , not the gameplay .
She got her start in porn and now she ’s thinking politics .
Stormy Daniels is considering running against Louisiana ’s Republican senator , David Vitter , in 2010 .
Vitter was linked to the D.C. Madame and her prostitution services in 2007 .
Daniels has launched what she is calling a listening tour in Louisiana .
She spoke to Kiran Chetry on CNN ’s “ American Morning ” Wednesday .
Kiran Chetry :
You are considering this possible Senate run in Louisiana against Senator David Vitter and he is infamous , I guess you could say , for his link to the D.C. Madame .
So as a former porn star , is there a little bit of irony here ?
Stormy Daniels : I think so .
I think that 's one the things that people find kind of entertaining about the whole thing but you 've got to remember what I do is legal and what he did is not .
So , yeah , I think that people find that very interesting .
I hear the word karma a lot .
Chetry :
You still have n’t filed the papers yet , right ?
How seriously are you considering this run for Senate ?
Daniels :
Well , I 'm seriously considering it .
That 's the whole reason why I 'm here this week doing the listening tour .
I think that before I can decide whether or not I 'm going to move forward with actually campaigning and undertaking a possible candidacy , I want to do the responsible thing and do a listening tour so I can get a better feel of what the people here really want me to do .
Chetry :
You had your first experience with that yesterday in Baton Rouge .
What was the reaction from people ?
Are they taking you seriously and do they hold your past in adult film against you ?
Daniels :
You know what , I was really , really overwhelmed by how positive and how good the turnout was yesterday .
Every seat in the place was taken .
There was tons of news there .
Everyone had very serious , positive questions for me .
I was expecting at least a little bit of controversy but surprisingly there was none .
And everyone 's questions seemed to be very serious .
Chetry :
And so what did you tell them when they were seeking answers about help with the foreclosure situation there , help with job losses ?
How are you telling them you 're going to be able to make their lives better ?
Daniels :
Well you have to remember this is n't the actual campaign , this is the listening tour .
So the whole idea of me going there yesterday was I was supposed to be asking the questions to them .
I wanted to get their feedback so that I could decide what my platform was going to be on each of those topics .
I was very impressed with the turnout .
I was very pleased with the turnout and the response but I was , quite honestly , I was a little disappointed that more people did n't speak up and let me know what their issues were .
I think they were very intimidated by the amount of television crews and cameras that were in the room .
Of course everybody wanted know to how I felt about taxes .
A couple of people wanted to know about David Vitter and the same thing that I said yesterday is I was n't there to talk about him .
I 've done enough of that .
If they had questions about David Vitter they needed to go and talk to David Vitter about that , but overall I mean I am here to listen to decide what their opinions are .
Chetry :
So your supporters have this website up , draftstormy.com .
They say it ’s a chance to start with a clean slate , to elect a representative we can be proud of , who will work tirelessly , who will change the status quo .
If people are saying okay maybe this is n't a joke , what are you saying to convince them that you would make a good Senator ?
Daniels :
The whole draft story came about , like I said before , I had nothing to do with it .
I largely ignored the situation in the beginning and the only reason why I am moving forward and I ’m sitting here talking to you guys today is because everyone is encouraging me and I 've gotten so much positive feedback .
And the only thing I have to say to people is you know , I do n't have a hidden personal agenda or political agenda .
This was n't my idea .
I 'm strictly doing it because I have been called to duty if for nothing else and I think that by taking the steps in this listening tour and really listening to what people have to say and what their concerns and their issues are and forming a way to help them with these things , I think that they are really beginning to take this seriously .
Anyone who knows me and has worked with me in any of the businesses that I 've been involved in before knows that I never take anything lightly .
I work extremely hard .
I 'm always up for a good fight .
And I do n't undertake anything that I do n't think that I can be the best at .

This story first appeared on AlterNet .
The media coverage of the auto bailouts has focused on the need for union autoworkers to take big pay cuts , causing them to once again miss the real story .
The Fiat - Chrysler deal shows that the pay problem is at the top , not the bottom .
At the end of the day , the new Chrysler is still likely to be producing most of its cars in the United States .
What the new company will be getting from abroad is technology and top management .
This big story was so easily missed because it runs against one of the main myths that our elites have cultivated about the US economy : that the country has a “ comparative advantage ” in highly skilled labor .
In this story , the United States will continue to lose manufacturing and other “ less - skilled ” jobs as its economy becomes more concentrated in highly skilled sectors .
This story was convenient for our elites because it meant that the decline of manufacturing was a necessary , if sometimes painful , part of a natural economic progression .
It also justified the growing inequality in US society that benefited not just Wall Street bankers and CEOs , but also millions of doctors , lawyers , economists , and other highly educated workers .
These people took their six - figure salaries as a birthright , even as the pay of less educated workers stagnated or declined .
While this story of the US becoming a high skills center in the world economy may have been comforting to the elites , and was widely promoted by economists and the news media , there was never much truth to it .
Highly skilled professionals did well in recent decades not because they succeeded in international competition , but rather because they were largely sheltered from it .
Trade agreements like NAFTA were explicitly designed to remove any barrier that made it difficult to export manufacturing goods to the United States , thereby placing US manufacturing workers directly in competition with their much lower paid counterparts in the developing world .
Most of these restrictions had nothing to do with tariffs .
Instead the key issues were rules protecting investment in the developing world along with limits on the ability of the US to exclude imports through safety or environmental regulations .
There has never been any similar effort to eliminate the barriers that prevent professionals from the developing world from coming to the United States and competing directly with their US counterparts as doctors or lawyers or in other highly paid professions .
The economists and the media somehow failed to notice that professionals were intentionally sheltered from international competition and instead just trumpeted them as the winners in the global economy .
We were just treated to a beautiful example of this double standard when the media and the economists got all huffy about the “ buy America ” provision in the stimulus bill that might have protected a few manufacturing jobs in steel and other industries .
While this provision was roundly condemned and eventually watered down , the buy America provision in the Treasury ’s latest bank bailout bill went completely unnoticed .
This provision requires that any investment manager taking part in the program be headquartered in the United States .
Even though the argument against protectionism in financial services is identical to the argument against protectionism in steel , no one bothered to make the argument when Wall Street was the beneficiary of protectionism .
The end result of this protectionism for those at the top is a bloated overpaid sector of top managers , which is what we saw at Chrysler .
If we compare wages for assembly - line workers in Europe and the United States , there would not be much difference between the pay of UAW members and their counterparts in Europe .
However , there would be a very large difference between the multi-million dollar pay packages of the top executives at the US companies and their European counterparts .
The pay gaps persist among the more highly paid engineers and management personnel .
Therefore , it was only logical that a bailout of Chrysler would seek to take advantage of the lower cost management and design skills available at a European car company like Fiat .
In Chrysler , as in other companies , the high pay packages for these people are like an anchor dragging them down in international competition .
If the US is to be competitive in the 21st century , we must either bring the pay of those at the top back down to earth or we should look to follow the lead of Chrysler and contract out for these services .

Techsnabexport , the Russian state company that exports low - enriched uranium , is expected to sign the contract in Moscow with a consortium of American nuclear companies .
Techsnabexport declined to identify its American partners or the size of the contract on Monday .
The new contract is separate from a program to dilute surplus weapons uranium into civilian fuel for use in American reactors .
Under that so - called megatons to megawatts program , begun in 1993 , Russia is already the largest supplier of enriched uranium to American utilities and provides about half of all uranium consumed in civilian reactors in the United States .
Yet Russia has been prohibited from selling directly to the utilities by provisions of American law to prevent dumping at below - market prices , and it was compelled to deal only through a monopoly importer , the United States Enrichment Corporation .
That company was originally part of the United States Department of Energy , and the megaton - to - megawatts deal was a government - to - government agreement .
When the United States sold off the enrichment corporation to a private company , the new entity was given a continuing monopoly on the sale of blended - down warhead materials from Russia .
The company , USEC , said it paid competitive prices for the material .
The Russians , meanwhile , complained that they were being underpaid .
In a negotiated settlement in February 2008 , the United States agreed to allow Russia to sell low - enriched uranium directly to domestic utilities without the involvement of the enrichment corporation .
But all sales of diluted weapons uranium will still go through the corporation .
A spokeswoman for the company said the initial direct Russian sales will be small and will not harm its business .
Nuclear reactors run on uranium that is composed of 3 to 5 percent uranium 235 .
In nature , uranium is only 0.7 percent uranium 235 .
Uranium used in weapons and in the reactors that power nuclear submarines use more than 90 percent uranium 235 .
“ Enrichment ” means raising the proportion of 235 compared with the dominant type , 238 , and the Russian industry was set up to provide large volumes of high - enriched uranium for weapons and marine reactors .
Russia is a major supplier to the developing world by tapping this cold war - era military industrial base .
It has provided 80 tons of low - enriched uranium manufactured into fuel assemblies to Iran for use in that country ’s Bushehr reactor , for a price of $ 46 million , according to Atomstroyexport , the Russian contractor building the reactor .
Video : Flash of light
Image of a pulse of light that is 2.5 billionths of a millionth of a second long ( Image : Science )
However hard you stare , you would still miss it .
Researchers have found a way to generate the shortest - ever flash of light – 80 attoseconds ( billionths of a billionth of a second ) long .
Such flashes have already been used to capture an image of a laser pulse too short to be “ photographed ” before ( see right ) .
The light pulses are produced by firing longer , but still very short laser pulses into a cloud of neon gas .
The laser gives a kick of energy to the neon atoms , which then release this energy in the form of brief pulses of extreme ultraviolet light .

The trigger pulses fired at the neon cloud are themselves only 2.5 femtoseconds , billionths of a millionth of a second , long , says team member Eleftherios Goulielmakis at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching , Germany .
Light punch
The trigger pulses contained only one or two oscillations of a light wave so that they packed a compact energy punch when they reached the neon cloud .
To do this , the researchers had to corral the trigger - pulse photons into a tightly packed bunch using a device called a chirped mirror .
These multilayered mirrors make the photons at the front of a pulse travel further than the slower photons at the rear do .
That gives the back markers time to catch up , in this case producing a tight pack of photons that hit the neon atoms at roughly the same time .
Photon finish
To find out how short the light flashes from the neon atoms were , Goulielmakis and colleagues directed them onto a second neon gas cloud .
As each flash is intense enough to completely ionise a neon atom and release an electron , the researchers could use those electrons like a flashgun , to illuminate some of the original 2.5 femtosecond trigger pulses of laser light .
“ Only sampling them with a “ sampler ” way shorter than that can render them visible , ” explains Goulielmakis .
Recording the energy of the electrons that passed through the pulse generates a crisp side - profile of the short laser beam , not unlike a sporting photo - finish image ( see right ) .
The image of the laser clearly shows the single oscillation of the trigger pulse .
Computer analysis of the image reveals that the flashes of light used to make the electrons lasted just 80 attoseconds – the shortest ever made .
Electron ‘ camera ’?
Jonathan Marangos at Imperial College London , UK , says the super - short flashes could let researchers image the movement of electrons around large atoms .
“ Any better understanding of the microscopic world is going to have an impact across all of science , ” he says .
The previous record for the shortest light pulse was 130 attoseconds , set in 2007 .
“ To go from 130 to 80 attoseconds is a major step , ” says Marangos .
In the future , Goulielmakis hopes to produce light pulses of 24 attoseconds , the atomic unit of time , defined as how long it takes an electron to travel from one side of a hydrogen atom to the other .
But Marangos thinks even shorter pulses are possible .
“ There ’s nothing magical about the atomic unit of time , ” he says , saying zeptosecond pulses of trillionths of a billionth of a second might be possible .
These would be capable of imaging the movement of nuclear particles like protons , says Marangos .

Shepard Smith brought that rarest of things to Fox News yesterday : amid the cacophony over the Tea Parties , he actually committed an act of journalism .
In the process , he also managed to also bring a voice of sanity to the nonstop right - wing shrieking at Fox over the recent Department of Homeland Security bulletin about the possible rise of right - wing extremism .
In fact , Smith confirms everything we 've reported here :
Not only is the report focused entirely on the very real problem of the lethally violent potential of extremist right - wing terrorism , but mainstream conservatives ' wailing and teeth - gnashing over it is -- besides being an egregious display of a persecution complex -- if anything a tacit admission of their own complicity in fueling extremist rhetoric .
Catherine Herridge looked into the claims of the Malkinites and essentially blew it all out of the water :
Herridge : Essentially , the driver in these intelligence assessments is the downturn in the economy .
What they say , essentially , is that when people have less money , that they 're out of work , they feel disenfranchised .
This is fertile ground for groups on the left as well as groups on the right .
And you remember , from reporting on this show , Shep , that even at the end of last year , prior to the inauguration , the Department of Homeland Security under the Bush administration was sounding the alarm about the potential for right - wing groups to act , specifically because of the economy , and also because America was going to have its first African - American president .
Smith :
So if this bulletin from April 7 looks at the right - wing groups , is there a bulletin that looks at left - wing groups as well ?
Herridge : Yeah , we were able to obtain that bulletin as well .
It came out in January , and did n't get -- there it is -- did n't get the same attention .
It looked specifically at groups like the Earth Liberation Front , or ELF , groups that in the opinion of Homeland Security , in the future will try and attack economic targets and specifically use cyber- attacks , because they see that is sympatico , or in concert with some of their other beliefs .
So there are two assessments .
The one on the left , the one on the right is the one that 's getting the attention because of the leak .
... I would point out that both of these assessments , Shep , were commissioned under the Bush administration .
It takes some time to do them .
They only came out after he left office .
Smith then featured an interview with intelligence specialist Mike Baker , who confirmed Herridge 's reporting further and suggested that conservatives were grasping at some self - revealing straws here .
Still , that did n't prevent Sean Hannity , only a few hours later , from pontificating at length with Joe the Plumber about how the mean DHS was targeting the tea parties :
They never learn .
Indeed , it seems the more wrong the wingnuts are , the more relentless they become .
This morning , Janet Napolitano went on Fox to try to explain , and apologized that it came out looking bad -- though that was more the fault of her critics .
Here 's DHS ' official statement .
﻿ Changing Your MAC Address In Window XP / Vista , Linux And Mac OS X ( Sometimes known as MAC spoofing ) Changing Your MAC Address In Window XP / Vista , Linux And Mac OS X
( Sometimes known as MAC spoofing )
First let me explain a few things about MAC addresses .
MAC stands for Media Access Control and in a sense the MAC address is a computer 's true name on a LAN .
An Ethernet MAC address is a six byte number , usually expressed as a twelve digit hexadecimal number ( Example : 1AB4C234AB1 F ) .
IPs are translated to MAC address by a protocol called ARP ( Address Resolution Protocol ) .
Let 's say a computer with and IP of 192.168.1.1 wants to send information to another computer on the LAN that has an IP of 192.168.1.2 .
First 192.168.1.1 will send out a broadcast to all stations on the LAN asking who has the IP 192.168.1.2 .
Then the box that has 192.168.1.2 will respond to 192.168.1.1 with it 's MAC address which is cached in 192.168.1.1's ARP table for later use .
To put this in Socratic Dialog form ( with just a touch of Stallone ) : Host 1 ( 192.168.1.1 ) :
Yo everyone on the LAN ( FF: FF : FF : FF : FF : FF ) , who has the IP 192.168.1.2 ?
My MAC is DE : AD :BE:EF : CA : FE so you can respond back to me .
Host 2 ( 192.168.1.2 ) : Hello DE : AD:BE:EF:CA : FE , I have IP 192.168.1.2 and my MAC address is 12:34:56:78:90:12 so you can send your IP packets to me .
You can see the ARP table of a box by dropping out to a command prompt and typing " arp –a " in Windows or just " arp " in Linux .
ARP can also work the other way by a host on the LAN sending its MAC address to another machine on the LAN for preemptive caching unless the host is configured to not accept un-requested ARP replies .
A person might want to change the MAC address of a NIC for many reasons :
To get past MAC address filtering on a router .
Valid MAC addresses can be found by sniffing them and then the deviant user could assume the MAC of a valid host .
Having two hosts on the same network can cause some network stability problems , but much of the time it 's workable .
This is one of the reasons why MIC Address filtering on a wireless router is pointless .
An attacker can just sniff the MAC address out of the air while in monitor mode and set his WiFi NIC to use it .
Interestingly , a lot of hotels use MAC filtering in their " pay to surf " schemes , so this method can be an instant in for cheap skate road warriors .
Sniffing other connections on the network .
By assuming another host 's MAC as their own they may receive packets not meant for them .
However , ARP poisoning is generally a better method than MAC spoofing to accomplish this task .
So as to keep their burned in MAC address out of IDS and security logs , thus keeping deviant behavior from being connected to their hardware .
For example , two of the main things a DHCP server logs when it leases an IP to a client is the MAC address and host name .
If you have a wireless router look around on it's web interface for where it logs this info .
Luckily there are tools to randomize this information ( MadMACs ) .
To pull off a denial of service attack , for instance assuming the MAC of the gateway to a sub net might cause traffic problems .
Also , a lot of WiFi routers will lock up if a client tries to connect with the same MAC as the router 's BSSID .
Linux
To change your MAC address in Linux ( and most * nix system ) is easy as pie .
All it takes is two easy to script commands : ifconfig eth0 down hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01 ifconfig eth0 up
These two little commands would set your eth0 interface to use the MAC 00:00:00:00:00:01 .
Just plug in the NIC you want to set and the MAC address you want to use into the commands above and your done .
Changing your MAC address is one of those things that is much easier to do in Linux then under Windows .
Mac OS X For versions of OS X before Tiger ( OS X 10.4 ) you will need this patch : http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/
Then you use a command like : sudo ifconfig en0 lladdr 00:00:00:00:00:01
I 'm not much of a Macintosh guy , so I pulled most of this info from :
http://www.macgeekery.com/gspot/2006-04/mac_address_spoofing
My understanding is that there are complications with some AirPort cards so you may also want to read : http://rgov.org/airport-spoof/
Apparently there are some problems changing your MAC address in versions of OS X 10.5.6 and latter .
Stefan Person sent me the following note that should help you get it to work :
Due to a bug in OS X 10.5.6 + , the built in mac - address spoofing
function requires the following work around :
To determine your old mac-address :
ifconfig en1 | grep ether
Do not ' Turn Airport Off ' , instead deactivate your wireless card by :
Click ' Join Other Network ... ' and enter a fake SSID .
Allow it to
attempt a connection and then go ahead and cancel the request .
Your
card is now deactivated allowing us to proceed with the following
command :
sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
Confirm using :
ifconfig en1 | grep ether Windows 2000 / XP / Vista : The Hard Way
In XP you can use the regedit to edit the registry from a GUI or the reg command to edit it from the console , I 'll be using regedit .
Information on all your NICs can be found the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE -BFC1-08002bE10318}\ .
Under this key you will find a bunch of sub keys labeled as 0000 , 00001 , 0002 and so forth .
We can assume any MAC address we want by finding the key that controls the NIC we want to change , putting in a string value called " NetworkAddress " and setting it to the MAC address we want to use formatted as a twelve digit hex number ( example : 000000000001 ) .
To find out which key is which we can search through them for the value " DriverDesc " until we find the one that matches the NIC we wish to alter .
After you set " NetworkAddress " to the address you want just restart the NIC by disabling it then enabling it ( or in the case of PCMCIA cards , just eject and reinsert ) .
You can confirm the MAC address change by using the " getmac " or " ipconfig /all " commands .
Windows 2000 / XP / Vista : The Easy Way Use Mac Makeup ( http://www.gorlani.com/publicprj/macmakeup/macmakeup.asp ) , MadMACs ( http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/madmacs-mac-spoofer), Smac ( http://www.klcconsulting.net/smac/ ) or Etherchange ( http://ntsecurity.nu/toolbox/etherchange/ ) .
Mac Makeup is a cool little GUI and Command line tool that 's freeware , the creator also offers a Plugin for Bart 's PE builder .
MadMACs is a tool to randomize your MAC address and host name on every reboot .
Smac has a nice GUI and was free but has since gone commercial , there 's no reason to bother with it as there are free tools that are just as good .
I use MadMACs since I wrote it and it lets me keep my host information randomized .
Have fun with your MAC addresses switching , but be careful not to cause network problems .
My favorite MAC address is DEADBEEFCAFE , for other interesting MACs see : http://www.binrev.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=15942
Enjoy .
After Notes : After I posted my article Benjamin E. Pratt emailed me some other notes on changing your MAC address on different platforms and in different ways : BSD
1 ) Bring down the interface : " ifconfig xl0 down "
2 ) Enter new MAC address : " ifconfig xl0 link 00:00:00 : AA : AA : AA "
3 ) Bring up the interface : " ifconfig xl0 up "
Linux
1 ) Bring down the interface : " ifconfig eth0 down "
2 ) Enter new MAC address : " ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:00:00 : AA : AA : AA "
3 ) Bring up the interface : " ifconfig eth0 up "
Windows 2000 /XP
Method 1 :
This is depending on the type of Network Interface Card ( NIC ) you have .
If you have a card that does n't support Clone MAC address , then you have to go to second method .
a) Go to Start -> Settings ->Control Panel and double click on Network and Dial - up Connections .
b) Right click on the NIC you want to change the MAC address and click on properties .
c ) Under " General " tab , click on the " Configure " button
d) Click on " Advanced " tab
e ) Under " Property section " , you should see an item called " Network Address " or " Locally Administered Address " , click on it .
f) On the right side , under " Value " , type in the New MAC address you want to assign to your NIC .
Usually this value is entered without the " - " between the MAC address numbers .
g ) Goto command prompt and type in " ipconfig /all " or " net config rdr " to verify the changes .
If the changes are not materialized , then use the second method .
h ) If successful , reboot your system .
Method 2 :
This should work on all Windows 2000 / XP systems
a) Go to Start ->
Run , type " regedt32 " to start registry editor .
Do not use " Regedit " .
b) Go to " HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\ Control \Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE -BFC1-08002BE10318} " .
Double click on it to expand the tree .
The subkeys are 4 - digit numbers , which represent particular network adapters .
You should see it starts with 0000 , then 0001 , 0002 , 0003 and so on .
c ) Find the interface you want by searching for the proper " DriverDesc " key .
d ) Edit , or add , the string key " NetworkAddress " ( has the data type " REG_SZ " ) to contain the new MAC address .
e ) Disable then re-enable the network interface that you changed ( or reboot the system ) .
Method 3 :
Use the program Etherchange from http://ntsecurity.nu/toolbox/etherchange/
Windows 9x
Use the same method as Windows 2000 / XP except for the registry key location is " HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \System\ CurrentControlSet\Services \Class \Net " and you must reboot your system .

The Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is accused today of undermining the principle of " innocent until proven guilty " by insisting on keeping DNA records of people cleared of crime .
Plans for a modified national database outlined by the Government today would allow the police to retain records of thousands of innocent people for up to six years .
In cases of serious violent or sexual crime , the time limit would be extended to 12 years .
Civil liberties campaigners say they will fight the Government in court over the plans .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " This well - spun proposal proves that the Home Secretary has yet to learn about the presumption of innocence and value of personal privacy in Britain .
Wholly innocent people , including children , will have their most intimate details stockpiled for years on a database that will remain massively out of step with the rest of the world .
With regret we shall be forced to see her in court once more . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said : " The Government just does n't get this .
People in Britain should be innocent until proven guilty .
Ministers are just trying to get away with as little as they possibly can instead of taking real action to remove innocent people from the DNA database .
It 's just not good enough . "
Current rules , under which everyone arrested has their genetic fingerprint stored indefinitely , were ruled unlawful by the European Court of Human Rights last year .
Judges in Strasbourg said the policy of retaining all suspects ' data was " blanket and indiscriminate " .
The Government 's response , published today , makes clear criminals convicted of " recordable " offences – those which can lead to a prison sentence – will stay on the database for life , as will under - 18s who commit sexual or violent crimes .
But youngsters convicted of only one minor offence will be deleted from the database when they turn 18 .
Police will also track down about 30,000 criminals who committed serious sex or violent crimes before the database was built so their profiles can be added .
All genetic material taken from suspects , such as blood or swab samples , will be destroyed .
Ms Smith said : " The DNA database plays a vital role in helping us do that and will help ensure that a great many criminals are behind bars where they belong .
These new proposals will ensure that the right people are on it , as well as considering where people should come off .
We will ensure that the most serious offenders are added to the database no matter when or where they were convicted .
" We also know that the database has provided matches for a significant number of serious crimes as well as providing thousands of matches for less serious crimes that cause great concern to victims , such as burglary , which is why we are proposing to keep some profiles for six years . "
The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Once again , the Home Office is fighting an undignified rearguard action designed to give as little as possible in response to the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights .
Today 's announcement is nowhere near good enough .
Jacqui Smith must not be allowed to get away with anything short of immediately removing all innocent people from the database , except those accused of a violent or sexual offence . "
Counter - intuitive proposition of the day : Anyone who considers himself a deficit hawk  or fiscal conservative and gets worked up over earmarks is either clueless or disingenuous .
We re hearing a lot lately about earmarks  DC - speak for pork - barrel spending .
Whether its the stimulus bill signed into law last month , or the $ 410 billion spending bill that s supposed to tide over Uncle Sam for the rest of fiscal ' 09 , it seems we cant get away from them .
Nor can we get away from complaints about some of the more ludicrous - sounding pet projects for individual lawmakers  like research into malodorous hogs .
In fact theres so much caterwauling about such line - items , youd think that if it werent for earmarks , wed have a balanced budget .
Heck , wed have had a balanced budget for years .
Not so .
Earmarks typically make up about 1 % of the federal budget .
In the spending bill being debated right now , its a little under 2 % .
Yes , its a great opportunity for certain politicians to posture about their colleagues setting aside money for golf courses and leashless dog parks .
John McCain has put this to great use in crafting his political identity .
But really , were talking about a pittance in the big scheme of the federal budget .
Slaughter all the earmarks , and it would barely put a dent in runaway spending .
Well actually , it wouldnt even do that .
That s because earmarks come out of a total amount of federal spending that s carved in stone before the earmarks are ever doled out to the lawmakers .
In other words , the moneys going to get spent anyway .
The only difference is that with earmarks , individual lawmakers get a little bit of say in how it gets spent .
Take earmarks out of the equation , and the decisions get made within the executive branch , or at best , among the Congressional leadership  whose primary concern would be rewarding friends and punishing enemies among the back - benchers .
From a sheer separation - of - powers standpoint , earmarks are actually a good thing : Remember , the moneys going to get spent anyway .
The new president talks about earmark reform ,  but leaders in his own party promise to resist .
 I dont think the White House has the ability to tell us what to do ,  says Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D - Maryland ) , the House Majority Leader .
Hoyer is about as hacktastic as they come , but hes got it right here .
So why is there so much screeching about earmarks ?
Well , it serves a very useful purpose for our political masters :
If you get the public in a lather over golf courses and dog parks , they re less likely to ask questions about bailing out failed bankers , or mega - deals for defense contractors , or even wider questions about the proper role and size of government .
Next time you hear a politician or a pundit railing against earmarks , you might want to ask yourself :
Does this person have a clue how little difference earmarks make in the big picture ?
Or does this person know full well how little difference it would make , and wants to create a distraction ?

The Best of Dave Gonigam
This article has been corrected in this online archive .
Originally , due to a mistake by the Associated Press , the marker ’s location was incorrectly reported as being 2.5 miles off the correct spot .
According to Dave Doyle of the National Geodetic Survey , the monument marking the intersection of Arizona , Colorado , New Mexico and Utah is about 1,807 feet east of where it should have been placed in 1875 .
Doyle says the monument ’s location has been legally
adopted by all the states as the official corner .
SALT LAKE CITY — Tourists who want to put a hand or foot in each of four states at the Four Corners area are apparently off the mark &mdash .
According to readings by the National Geodetic Survey , the Four Corners marker showing the intersection of Arizona , Colorado , New Mexico and Utah is in the wrong location .
The only place in the United States where four state boundaries come together was first surveyed by the U.S. government in 1868 during the initial survey of Colorado ’s southern boundary line .
The intended location was 109 degrees west longitude and 37 degrees north latitude .
But , because of surveying errors , the popular tourist spot is actually just a bit off .
The accurate location would be downhill to the east of U.S. 160 in Colorado and northeast of the San Juan River as it flows into New Mexico .
“ That ’s a long ways to be off , ” said David Bronson , surveyor of San Juan County , Utah .
Still , he said the monument ’s present location is the accepted one .
Bronson said that given the crude equipment of the era , it ’s amazing surveyors were as accurate as they were around the time the marker was established .

This article has been corrected in this online archive .
Originally , due to a mistake by the Associated Press , the marker ’s location was incorrectly reported as being 2.5 miles off the correct spot .
According to Dave Doyle of the National Geodetic Survey , the monument marking the intersection of Arizona , Colorado , New Mexico and Utah is about 1,807 feet east of where it should have been placed in 1875 .
Doyle says the monument ’s location has been legally
adopted by all the states as the official corner .

The Economist recently published an article on the growing problem of water shortages and , calls for a system of tradable usage rights to allocate water resources to more productive use .
â€ œGlobally there is no shortage of water ; the central problem is that so much water is wasted , mainly through agriculture .
But farmers reject scarcity pricing for the reason that water falls from the skies .
No government owns it , so no government should charge for it , â€ explains John Parker , author of the article .

Parker credits rainfall and snow as being the source of an endless supply of water , of which less than one - tenth is actually used .
But while rainwater harvesting has recently started gaining popularity , one has to think about the implications of doing this in polluted cities .
Â
At this point , most water harvested from rainfall is recycled back into the ground rather than being used as a source of drinking water .
However if the ground that receives it is growing food , then it raises the question as to whether the rainwater might actually toxify the plants .
Perhaps in the same way that factory wastes toxify river water and oceans , resulting in high seafood mercury levels .
Water should be priced to reflect its value
The Economist maintains that in order achieve water efficiency , we must price water to reflect its value .
But this idea has historically received powerful resistance from farmers .
Water has always been free .
As Parker says , no government owns it , so no government should charge for it .
It is the very idea behind Article 31 .
The Economist supports the Australian system that allows farmers the right to use a certain amount of water free .
They can sell that right or buy it from a neighbor if in fact they want more .
Australian farmers have responded by switching to less thirsty crops and water productivity has doubled as a result .
But the fact that water is so closely related to the food crisis makes the issue particularly debatable .
Â
Farmers in aridÂ regions in India have successfully been able to transform deserts into fertile and productive land , something that they would never be able to do if water was not free .
In fact the , the ‘ watering ’ of desert lands has facilitated a gradual change in soil conditions , enabling a state of water efficiency over a period of time .
What if an economist ’s opinion influences policy makers to actually put in place a cap and trade system for water ?
It would certainly make for a lively Economists vs. Activists debate .
Read the complete story ‘ Awash in Waste ’ from The Economist , here .
Internal Security Minister Avi Dichter blocked the Palestinian Authority 's attempt to hold a series of events in Jerusalem that would declare the city the " Arab culture capital . "
Acting on Dichter 's orders , police shuttered eight planned events , and have so far detained at least 20 organizers and participants for questioning .
According to interim agreements it has signed with Israel , the Palestinian Authority is prohibited from organizing events within Israel 's territory .
But under the banner of Jerusalem as the capital of Arab culture , the PA has planned a number of events across Israel .
In line with the injunctions , police detained two female employees at the Al - Quds University – situated near the gates of Jerusalem 's Old City - for planning to distribute paraphernalia advertizing the events .
Students were blocked from entering the university .
A soccer match scheduled to be held at a school on Nablus Road and a conference for young women at the Al - Hiya 'la Center , also organized by the PA , were both shut down on Dichter 's orders .
Police also blocked attempts to organize marches in the Wadi Juz and Sheikh Jarrah neighborhoods .
Forces also prevented a group of Arab students from rallying at the Temple Mount with PLO flags .
A similar ceremony was blocked on the Haroun el - Rashid road .
On Friday , Dichter instructed the police to " suppress any attempts by the PA to hold events in Jerusalem and throughout the rest of the country , " and signed injunctions to this effect .
He stressed the prohibition of PA - sponsored or organized events in Israel under the existing agreements .
Reinforced police and Border Guard troops were deployed throughout the city to enforce Dichter 's orders .
MK Ahmad Tibi ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) slammed Dichter 's policy , saying : " I guess the Occupation feels threatened by the Palestinian culture and narrative .
This is a struggle between occupying police and the song of freedom and the song will win in the end . "
Breakfast is the eternal return of the everyday .
It must be both familiar and eccentric , both broad and precise .
It would be mathematically possible to eat a different breakfast every morning of your life , simply by rejiggering the elemental combinations — egg , grain , fruit , juice , meat — or by angling through the various styles — sunny - side , runny , burnt , crispy , smothered , covered , buttered , dry , with syrup , without , with cheese , scratch the cheese .
But it must be acknowledged that breakfast is a devotional act , built both on the bedrock of routine — yes , you like two eggs over - easy , rye toast , Canadian bacon , hash browns extra crisp — and the expectation of surprise — sure , you 'll try the world - famous red - eye gravy with that .
And so here we celebrate breakfast in its two essential forms : the breakfast you make at home , with care but not fuss , and the breakfast you eat out , having made breakfast a destination .
And after trying some of the quick recipes from chefs who love breakfast — recipes for breakfasts they make at home — and after quibbling with our list of the best breakfasts in the country , you 'll sense the bite - by - bite challenge of the meal that is both a simple comfort ritual and a culinary invitation to the day .

You know
who that guy is ?
That ’s Joseph Cassano .
As far as we know this is the only commercially available photo of him .
AIG was actually a decently run and profitable insurance company .
The problem was a small shop in London , AIG ’s the ‘ financial products ’ division .
Cassano ran it .
And that ’s where they wrote more than $ 400 billion of credit default swaps , mainly on crap mortgage debt .
That means about $ 400 billion of de facto insurance policies he wrote that his company had no assets to cover .
Great idea , right ?
But do n’t worry : that ’s where your money is going now .
Cassano is the guy at the center of the AIG implosion .
But of course he could n’t bring down the global economy alone .

The Oxford English Dictionary is constantly updating , adding new words to reflect the vibrant changes in language and culture .
Of course , that also means that as said culture spirals toward a frightening and retarded oblivion , the good people at Oxford have to be there to chronicle it .
Here are some recent additions that make us fear for our future .

Hence in allusive and extended uses : a person who lacks a particular skill or skills , or who is regarded as inferior in some way .

The people at the Oxford English Dictionary acknowledge that the work of an author entering the dictionary is rare , but the use of " muggle " had become so widespread they had to include it , ensuring that the future will remember us for standing in line at Borders in wizard costumes .
Wait , does this mean if we invent a new word right now they 'll be forced to include it in a few years , as long as enough readers use it ?
Good .
Guys , the word is " dongtacular . "
14 Blamestorming Continue Reading Below Advertisement n. A method of collectively finding one to blame for a mistake no one is willing to confess to .

There already is a word for when a group of people blame someone for a mistake .
It 's called blaming .
Blamestorming , however , cutely mimics " brainstorming " and office politics dictates the more cringe - inducingly " clever " a word sounds , the more often in needs to be used .
" We 're so witty !
Just like the people on The Office !
Somebody should make a sitcom about us ! "

Thus we had to invent this word to represent the rush of personal pride felt by the perceived ability to instinctively tell if someone prefers sausage to tacos , whether they wanted you to know it or not .

While the TSA introduced whole body scanners as a means to search passengers posing a greater security risk ( like those who set off metal detectors ) , they now plan to use the invasive technology on everyone .
Advertisement
Apparently the trials at 6 airports have gone so well that the TSA would like to have all passengers " go through the whole - body imager instead of the walk - through metal detector . "
In other words , everyone who gets on a plane will be seen quasi-naked .
Advertisement
The TSA is quick to remind the public that the technician is " off - site " and unable to associate your grey naked body with your real , grey naked body .
Swapping all metal detectors to whole body scanners should make that 3 oz liquid rule a thing of the past , but with each scanner running $ 100,000 to $ 170,000 apiece , the upgrade wo n't exactly be free .
And really , I think the TSA should be paying me if they expect to see my naked behind .
At least then I 'd know the money was worth it .

Via Brad Plumer , I see Cato ’s Jerry Taylor is riled at responses to an open letter ad the Institute published in which a group of scientists signed off on a statement questioning the strength of the case for catastrophic climate change .
I ’m broadly sympathetic with his irritation at the proportion of ad hominem attacks in debates like these , but I ’m not sure I agree with his bottom line in context :
An argument ’s merit has nothing to do with the motives of the arguer , the credentials of the arguer , or the popularity of the argument .
Full stop .
No exceptions .
As a matter of logic , of course , that ’s true , but I ’m not sure it ’s to the point when the proximate cause of the tussle is a single - page ad consisting mostly of signatures followed by credentials .
We ’re accustomed to calling the “ argument from authority ” a fallacy , but in fact , that ’s what the vast majority of us have to go on most of the time .
Provided you ensure that authority ’s authority actually applies to the field in question , it ’s as good a strategy as any .
Obviously , when it comes to an argument between trained scientific specialists , they ought to ignore the consensus and deal directly with the argument on its merits .
But most of us are not actually in any position to deal with the arguments on the merits .
Which , of course , is why the ad itself makes only a gesture in the direction of an argument and then proceeds to the long list of names .
Sometimes the arguments are such that the specialists can develop and summarize them to the point that an intelligent layman can evaluate them .
But often — and I feel pretty sure here — that ’s just not the case .
Give me a topic I know fairly intimately , and I can often make a convincing case for absolute horseshit .
Convincing , at any rate , to an ordinary educated person with only passing acquaintance with the topic .
A specialist would surely see through it , but in an argument between us , the lay observer would n’t necessarily be able to tell which of us really had the better case on the basis of the arguments alone — at least not without putting in the time to become something of a specialist himself .
Actually , I have a possible advantage here as a peddler of horseshit : I need only worry about what sounds plausible .
If my opponent is trying to explain what ’s true , he may be constrained to introduce concepts that take a while to explain and are hard to follow , trying the patience ( and perhaps wounding the ego ) of the audience .
Come to think of it , there ’s a certain class of rhetoric I ’m going to call the “ one way hash ” argument .
Most modern cryptographic systems in wide use are based on a certain mathematical asymmetry :
You can multiply a couple of large prime numbers much ( much , much , much , much ) more quickly than you can factor the product back into primes .
A one - way hash is a kind of “ fingerprint ” for messages based on the same mathematical idea :
It ’s really easy to run the algorithm in one direction , but much harder and more time consuming to undo .
Certain bad arguments work the same way — skim online debates between biologists and earnest ID afficionados armed with talking points if you want a few examples :
The talking point on one side is just complex enough that it ’s both intelligible — even somewhat intuitive — to the layman and sounds as though it might qualify as some kind of insight .
( If it seems too obvious , perhaps paradoxically , we ’ll tend to assume everyone on the other side thought of it themselves and had some good reason to reject it . )
The rebuttal , by contrast , may require explaining a whole series of preliminary concepts before it ’s really possible to explain why the talking point is wrong .
So the setup is “ snappy , intuitively appealing argument without obvious problems ” vs. “ rebuttal I probably do n’t have time to read , let alone analyze closely . ”
If we do n’t sometimes defer to the expert consensus , we ’ll systematically tend to go wrong in the face of one - way - hash arguments , at least outside our own necessarily limited domains of knowledge .
Indeed , in such cases , trying to evaluate the arguments on their merits will tend to lead to an erroneous conclusion more often than simply trying to gauge the credibility of the various disputants .
The problem , of course , is gauging your own competence level well enough to know when to assess arguments and when to assess arguers .
Thanks to the perverse phenomenon psychologists have dubbed the Dunning - Kruger effect , those who are least competent tend to have the most wildly inflated estimates of their own knowledge and competence .
They do n’t know enough to know that they do n’t know , as it were .
That said , a side point about this from Ryan Avent :
That is to say , confronted by a problem demanding solutions inimical to libertarian beliefs , libertarians were faced with the choice of reneging on their beliefs or turning their back on science .
Tellingly , they chose the latter .
One might think that ’s a rather drastic decision , given the role scientific endeavors have played in delivering the material prosperity so dear to the hearts of the libertarian world , and one would be right .
At a higher level of abstraction , a purist libertarian position is arguably quite radically green .
That is , assuming the harm from climate change is demonstrable , every affected property owner gets a veto over “ aggression ” by carbon emitters , at least on a strict Rothbardian type of view .
That ’s rather too strict for my taste , but I just mean to point out that the conflict with “ libertarian beliefs ” here is n’t really at the level of principle or theory .
If climate change is actually going to be profoundly harmful , then it ’s precisely the sort of problem libertarian principles say the state ought to be trying to solve .
Addendum : Perhaps
I should ’ve made this clearer , but I do n’t mean to deny that as a sociological matter , a general aversion to regulatory solutions has left libertarians too prone to hope the problem can be wished away as long as someone out there with a Ph.D. remains unconvinced .
But it also seems as though , at least in recent years , they ’ve grown out of that a bit and we ’re starting to see more useful debates about exactly how bad it ’s going to be , exactly how much cost is worth bearing to ameliorate or delay it to such and such an extent , and so on .
Addendum II : In the comments Pithlord lives up to his moniker :
Regulators to Save Us from Loud TV Ads and Product Placements
Couch potatoes of America , have no fear …
Your friendly neighborhood super - regulators are about to swoop in and save you from the scourge of loud TV ads and “ illegal ” product placements !
As we all learned in our high school Civics 101 classes , this is why the American Revolution was fought :
We Americans have an unambiguous constitutional birthright to be free of the tyranny of “ excessive loudness ” during commercial breaks and pesky product promos during our favorite network dramas .
( Seriously , it ’s right there in the footnotes to the Bill of Rights ; you probably just missed it before . )
Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) has the first problem covered .
She and her House colleague Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D - Calif. ) are proposing H.R. 6209 , the “ Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act . ”
( Oh , is n’t that so cute !
The “ C.A.L.M. Act ” !
How very , very witty . )
The CALM Act would address “ volume manipulation ” in TV ads by making sure that TV ads are not “ excessively noisy or strident . ” ( Strident !
We Americans hate “ strident ” ads . )
The bill would empower regulators at the Federal Communications Commission to take steps to ensure that “ such advertisements shall not be presented at modulation levels substantially higher than the program material that such advertisements accompany ; and , the average maximum loudness of such advertisements shall not be substantially higher than the average maximum loudness of the program material that such advertisements accompany . ”
Clearly , this is valuable use of our regulators ’ time .
I look forward to the day when I can visit the FCC and see my tax dollars at work as teams of bureaucrats closely monitor each episode of “ Desperate Housewives ” and “ Swingtown ” in search of such malicious volume manipulation during the commercial breaks .
( Incidentally , where is the form I need to fill out to get that job ?
Heck , I ’ll take minimum wage pay to do this all day long . )
So , we can rest easier now know that lawmakers will take care of this egregious violation of our human rights .
But what about the potential product placements in various TV dramas or comedies ?
Luckily , the folks at the FCC are on it .
According to Reuters :
U.S. regulators are expected to take the first step this week that could rein in advertisers ’ growing use of product placements on television shows , two sources close to the agency told Reuters on Monday .
The Federal Communications Commission will vote to study whether TV shows should carry more conspicuous notices informing viewers when advertisers paid to have food , automobiles and other products prominently displayed during programs , the sources said .
Thank God , our long national nightmare is over !
Never again will we have to see another “ Seinfeld ” rerun where Jerry just stands there mocking our sensibilities with a Coca - Cola can in his hand !
And thank God our regulators will be freeing us from the frightful sight of a Ford Mustang in the staring role of the remake of “ Knight Rider . ”
I mean , what an insult to the original K.I.T.T.!
Have they no shame !
Apparently , the anti-product placement movement is a true “ baptist and bootleggers ” affair .
This righteous crusade features a strange bedfellows coalition of Lefties and social conservatives who all hell - bent on saving us from the evils of commercial advertising .
“ We must not allow television programs to become Trojan horses , carrying messages that would otherwise be criticized by the public or even deemed illegal , ” wrote members of this coalition , which includes Public Citizen and the Parents Television Council .
( Thank you Public Citizen and PTC for forcing us to spend our taxpayer money on this regulatory effort !
I ’m glad you ’re looking out for our best interests since most of us are not capable of doing so on our own . )
What remains unclear about both the CALM
Act and the effort to regulate product placement , however , is how it conflicts with our other unambiguous constitutional right to all the free or cheap TV that we please !
Someone needs to pay for all that content , after all , but it sure in hell ai n’t going to be us , right ?
I mean , how dare they subject to us to loud ads or product placements in an attempt to get us to pay attention to the ads we are busy skipping with our TiVos !
Evil , evil people in the media business , I tell you !
Our benevolent leaders on high must save us from this scourge and put a stop to all this .
And do n’t worry about the availability of free or cheap TV .
It will continue to just fall like manna from heaven in our laps , without any commercial interruption .
Or , if not , I guess we could always just watch commercial - free public television all day long .
Yeah , that ’s the ticket …
Bring on a 24/7 lineup of “ Antiques Roadshow ” and “ Victory Garden , ” all gloriously free of the evils of commercialism that is corrupting of our fragile little minds !
We are so repressed .
Down with commercialism !
Down with capitalism !
Down with THE MAN !
One Great Big Neon Festering Distraction
Once again the idiotic citizens of Portland are all up in arms over the giant , “ historic ” neon sign that sits on the west side of the river over the Burnside bridge .
Around 10 years ago everyone freaked out and shit themselves when it was changed from saying “ White Stag ” ( an old outdoor clothing company ) to say “ Made in Oregon ” ( a company that sells things only made in the state ) .
Now the University of Oregon owns it and wants to change it to say “ University of Oregon . ”
Honestly , why the fuck are we even talking about an ugly neon sign ?
I hate to use the old “ rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic ” saying but come on people .
The salmon are rapidly going extinct right in front of us .
Street names ?
Neon Signs ?
Really ?
This is what you ’re spending your time talking about while land that gives us life withers under the destructive , imperialistic agricultural regime ?
This is what you ’re choosing to emotionally invest in while dams , logging , commercial fishing and pollution are wreaking havoc on the innocent lives of plants and animals with which we depend ?
Oh wait , I ’m sorry .
No , let ’s sit around and debate what we should name a street .
Grand Avenue or Cesar Chavez Ave ?
Oh and if you say Grand you ’re a fucking racist !
If we are looking towards quality of life , I see no way in which a neon sign adds more quality to my life .
I see that sign every once and a while and it leaves no impression on me , anymore than any other grotesque Clear Channel billboard , only it ’s a vintage advertisement so it ’s like , totally cool or something .
What the fuck is wrong with you people ?
You know what leaves an impression on me ?
Stands of Black Cottonwood that stood 200 feet tall with a width of 7 feet , lining the shores of the Willamette river .
Camas fields so dense that the valley looked like a great sea of purple .
Land that was so rich from indigenous , sustainable land management that it baffled the agrarian fundamentalists who first encountered it .
While my family does not belong to the Native American populations who tended the lands here for 8,000 years , we have lived here longer than Grand Avenue , longer than that disgusting neon sign .
As a fourth generation Portlander , and a recovering agrarian fundamentalist , I can tell you that I would rather have that funding go to life - giving historic monuments , like say , salmon runs so thick you ca n’t wade through the river than old energy consuming advertisements .
As the climate crisis heats up , as economic collapse melts our society down , we need to restore the local , sustainable food systems that humans had in place here for thousands and thousands of years .
Shame on you Multnomah county , with your so - called “ green technology ” and “ sustainable development . ”
You ’re supposed to be the most liberal , environmentally conscious , eco -forward county in this country and yet you quibble over the most meaningless bullshit , spending tons of money , time and energy , distracting yourselves from doing something sincere for the future generations .
Here is an idea , let ’s just change the sign to say “ Fuck the Planet . ”
That way you ’ll be able to clearly remember every time you look at the sign where your priorities lie .
Either way , it will be very clear to the generations of people that come after us , that the people of this land cared more about pretty little bright lights than rewilding our ravaged lands .
If you use Last.fm and do n't live in the US , UK , or Germany , you might need to get your wallet out .
The online radio service has announced that users outside of those countries ( their 3 most popular ) will need to start paying € 3.00 ( about $ 4.40 USD ) per month to continue streaming music on Last.fm .
Last.fm does n’t offer much of a reason as to the change , other than writing on their blog that “ There will be a 30 track free trial , and we hope this will convince people to subscribe and keep listening to the radio , ” and the to - be - expected “ In order to keep providing the best radio service on the web , we need to ask our listeners from countries other than USA , UK and Germany to subscribe for € 3.00 per month . ”
The real reason is likely international licensing fees , which led Pandora to pull the plug on international users back in 2007 .
It ’s unfortunate for users outside of Last . fm ’s top countries , but likely a necessary move to continue to provide sustainable service , even though the outfit is now owned by media conglomerate CBS .
Update :
As a point of clarification , Last.fm users outside of the US , UK , and Germany will still be able to use Last . fm 's other features .
Last.fm explains , " Everything else on Last.fm ( scrobbling , recommendations , charts , biographies , events , videos etc. ) will remain free in all countries , like it is now . "

sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get upgrade
Update :
As you may know , there were some issues with Intel Graphic Card drivers ( 965 : x3000 or x3100 ) in Ubuntu after the upgrade to Jaunty - desktop effects could not be enabled - so you could not use Compiz and other applications that needed it .
Well , it seems that after today 's or yesterday 's updates ( or something like that ) , Compiz works again with some Intel video cards .
My girlfriend has a Dell Inspiron 1525 which comes with a Intel Graphic Card X3100 on which Compiz now runs ok .
So you can try updating and see if yours works too ( if so , I would appreciate some comments with your computer 's specs , so other people will know it will work for them too ) :

A few years ago , the idea of hackers bringing the world to the brink of catastrophe was just a fun Hollywood plotline .
Now , cyber- attacks are on the rise and Nato 's top computer experts have gathered in a military base in Estonia to prepare cyberwar defences
Back in 1983 , the world was a simpler place .
The economy looked healthy , there were only four channels on the TV - and , if you believed Hollywood at least , the biggest threat to world security was a pimply teenager with a computer .
Matthew Broderick 's turn in the film WarGames , as a nerdy kid who accidentally blunders into a highly classified computer system that controls the US nuclear arsenal and proceeds to take the world to the brink of nuclear war , did n't win many awards .
But it made its mark on millions of people around the world - and introduced us to the stereotype of the precocious young hacker .
The film plugged into every paranoid star - wars fantasy from the Reagan era but now it is unlikely to elicit more than a snigger .
The prospect of a cyberwar launched by someone too young to drink is , frankly , ridiculous .
Is n't it ?
In fact , the implications of a cyberwar are , right now , being carefully considered by intelligence chiefs in Britain and around the western world .
Their nightmare ?
A co-ordinated strike that targets businesses , public services , central government , the financial sector and communication systems .
In the worst - case scenario , what might start slowly - a few propaganda messages here , a hacked website there - could quickly spread .
The already hammered British economy might soon be crippled as the nation 's bank accounts are drained of their funds - stripping billions out of people 's hands in seconds - and major online shops including eBay and Amazon fail .
Elsewhere , communications networks could come under fire , with phone , internet and mobile systems quickly collapsing .
The transport network might fail , too , causing air - traffic control computers to go haywire , rail systems to break down , traffic light systems to be reprogrammed .
The ensuing chaos would create panic around the country , with airports from Heathrow to Glasgow on high alert , facing the horrifying prospect of midair collisions as the aircraft above them are fed wrong information .
While the emergency services struggle to cope with the confusion , they could fall victim to attacks themselves .
A stream of fake messages and alerts might send fire engines to the wrong locations , and ambulances to hospitals already filled with patients .
And the coup de grace ?
Hidden programs inside the country 's electricity grid might then jump to life , shutting down power supplies , creating targeted blackouts , even sending nuclear reactors into freefall .
Such a doomsday scenario might sound drastic - more of a cyber - apocalypse than a cyber - attack - but it is one that has been outlined many times by the Metropolitan Police , MI5 and the Joint Intelligence Committee .
The US Navy investigator and cybercrime specialist Kenneth Geers characterises the typical response of powerful individuals as they hear this doomsday scenario outlined as a sort of unbridled terror inspired by technology .
" More than one senior official said they 've had so many cyber - briefings now that they do n't want to turn their computers on any more , " he says .
Geers identifies a number of potential weak spots in the system , including websites of " pure economic value " ( such as banks and online shops ) as well as telecommunications systems and the electricity grid .
" In the worst case ?
[ Someone ] invading your own infrastructure and using your own tools against you , " he says .
" Tell your troops to move in the wrong direction , or your missiles to fire on your own cities ... anything in your imagination . "
Hidden in the shadow of crumbling Soviet tower blocks on the outskirts of the Estonian capital Tallinn sits a compact military post that looks pretty much like any other .
The base carries the official name of Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence , but is usually referred to by the code name K5 .
Soldiers march across the small parade ground , passing a selection of camouflaged vehicles as they troop to and fro .
Heavy weaponry is dotted around the buildings , while on one side of the plot a discreet armoury holds a stock of emergency weapons .
Behind the security gates and razor wire , however , this is a different kind of military operation - the unlikely frontline in Nato 's attempt to prevent a global cyberwar .
K5 is where the alliance 's top computer experts - high - ranking researchers , academics and security specialists - work in teams to analyse potential cyberthreats , and predict exactly how Nato will fight virtual wars in the future .
Since the centre opened last year , few people have been granted a glimpse inside - but I am being given the chance to see exactly what takes place here .
And so I find myself standing opposite Rain Ottis , a stout , serious - looking Estonian computer scientist who speaks flawless English , in the corner of K5 's mess room .
It would be easy to forget that this is a military station were it not for the fact he is wearing fatigues .
I 'm holding a cup of weak coffee in a Nato mug , and watching as a light rain starts falling on the barracks next door .
Ottis speaks with a calm voice , but is forceful about how we might need to respond to a future cyber - strike .
His solution ?
Overwhelming response : a single , gigantic counter - strike that cripples the target and warns anyone else off launching a future cyberwar .
He is n't sure what it would look like , but the show of force he envisages is so severe that the only thing he can compare it to is a nuclear attack - meaning , of course , that K5 could be the virtual equivalent of the Manhattan Project , the US - led secret programme to develop the atomic bomb .
" Obviously nuclear weapons do a lot more damage than a cyber - weapon would do in a physical sense - but a single cyber - weapon could have global consequences , " he says .
It feels as if we have come full circle from the contrived Hollywood paranoia of WarGames .
Fears over computerised warfare stretch back many years , but it was only in the early 1990s - when the internet started to become a more widely accepted technology - that researchers at Rand , the Pentagon thinktank , first coined the term " cyberwar " .
In a prescient 1993 paper , " Cyberwar is coming ! " , the analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt argued that an online battle waged between two nations was almost inevitable - but that at least it would be less destructive than full - blown conflict .
Many of the cyber - attacks that have been identified in recent years have been linked back to China , which now has more internet users than anywhere in the world , and Russia .
The growing animosity surrounding these reported strikes is developing into a new sort of cold war , played out by teams of cyber - spies sitting at computers in opposite corners of the globe .
Recent examples that have raised the tension include a hi-tech spy group known as Titan Rain , which successfully infected government computers in Britain , America and Germany , and GhostNet , a cyber - espionage network which targeted supporters of a free Tibet .
Both were said to come from China , and possibly be directly linked to the People 's Liberation Army - although researchers could n't agree on the evidence .
University of Cambridge researchers claim it was definitely the product of " agents of the Chinese government " , while their colleagues at the University of Toronto say that it is too easy to presume guilt .
" Certainly Chinese cyber - espionage is a major global concern , " the Canadian experts wrote in a report on GhostNet .
" But attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence - gathering operations by the Chinese state is wrong and misleading . "
Then , last week , it was widely reported that the US 's power grid had succumbed to hackers .
Given that America 's security services are scrabbling for the attention of their new president , there 's plenty of reason to be sceptical about these unsubstantiated and largely anonymous reports ( American security whizz Kevin Poulsen says the timing of this uncheckable story is " unusually opportune " ) .
Regardless , such stories are enough to convince the powers - that - be to take action : last week it emerged that the US Congress is considering legislation to massively increase the country 's cyber - defences - including , potentially , a single official who is in charge of keeping civil systems , military networks and public utilities safe .
Inside Nato's own cyber - defence HQ in Estonia , the day - to - day business at K5 largely involves people staring at computer screens .
Those expecting a vast , hi-tech control centre worthy of Nasa would probably be disappointed by the austere surroundings , which look more like they were lifted from a university hall than MI5 headquarters .
Essentially , the centre is a hybrid of a global listening post and a thinktank .
The 30 experts stationed here are tasked with gathering and processing intelligence and information , then giving scientists the information to simulate possible responses to cyber - attack .
The group is drawn from a range of Nato countries , and they spend their days analysing data that streams in from around the internet .
One of those stationed at K5 is Geers , the author of a book called Cyber Jihad and the Globalisation of Warfare .
Tall , slim , dark - haired and wearing civilian clothes , he tells me that we are paying the price for a headlong rush into using technologies without thinking through the potential consequences .
" In certain ways , this is a golden age for attackers , " he says , in a careful voice .
" Over the past 15 years , the world has rushed to connect networks together because they want to use their power .
But the rush to connect everything to the internet was ahead of security . "
With so much of the world now connected to the internet - billions of computers and mobile phones across a multitude of homes , banks , schools , shops and elsewhere - it is ripe for attackers to exploit the gaps in security .
" It 's a very big challenge for us to be able to leverage networks and the power of computers , while at the same time securing them . "
In a side room , Geers ' colleague Ottis tells me : " Espionage is something that countries and governments accept - it 's always been there , and always will .
But if we see attacks that target the citizen ?
That 's different . "
There is a particular reason for Ottis and his fellow Estonians to be concerned about the threat of cyberwar : in 2007 , Estonia itself was the target of a massive internet assault , allegedly sparked by a political disagreement with Russia .
Over the course of several weeks , Estonia 's government , banking and commercial sectors endured a sustained barrage of online attacks that brought parts of the system - one of the most advanced and internet - friendly in the world - grinding to a halt .
Although the Estonians imply that the campaign was sponsored by the Kremlin , K5 officials admit they can offer no proof .
But whoever was ultimately responsible , the strikes highlighted fears that technology is the weapon at the forefront of a new sort of cold war .
" This is definitely not science fiction any more , " says Ottis .
" We have plenty of examples where nation states have actually been involved - both on the offensive and the defensive side .
Cyber - attacks are very efficient .
You do n't have to fly to the country you 're attacking , you do n't need a cell somewhere .
All you need is a connection .
What happens if your country gets targeted by 25,000 well - equipped , well - trained people who work to achieve the same goal ?
No country is ready for that . "
The first step towards a proper cyber - defence is understanding who the actors behind a potential attack might be .
But doing that requires information which , for the most part , is impossible to find .
" Defence against cyberwarfare is extremely difficult , " explains Peter Sommer , a computer security specialist and visiting professor at the London School of Economics .
" Only the very unskilled leave pointers to their identities and locations . "
Skilled hackers can implant targeted viruses inside their victim 's computers and leave them to gestate for weeks , months or even years before activating them at a later date .
There are numerous examples of such vast , destructive virus strikes - most notably the Conficker worm , which has infected more than 9 m PCs worldwide in recent months .
Right now nobody knows who created Conficker , or what its target might be .
It has yet to fully activate , leaving security groups and antivirus companies on high alert .
Some have suggested it is part of a criminal plan to steal identities by the million , or a dangerous cyber - weapon , or that it could simply be a gigantic prank .
But even if the worm does prove the spark that ignites a full - blown cyber - conflict , its author would remain almost untraceable .
Just as any hard evidence to suggest the Russian military approved the Estonian cyberattack in 2007 is largely missing , so proving that China or Russia are directly responsible for other attacks is almost impossible .
And , experts admit , it would be politically smart for a truly destructive organisation to mask their attacks and make them seem like they originated from a country already under scrutiny .
In truth , it could be almost anybody , almost anywhere .
Rudimentary hackers ' toolkits are available to buy cheaply online , while an illicit black - market trade in more complex tools takes would - be attackers out of the reach of the authorities on the so - called " darknet " .
And while a highly intelligent virus such as Conficker may have required some skill to program , other hackers may succeed simply by having the time to experiment rather than any great raw ability .
( Gary McKinnon , the Briton accused of hacking into Pentagon computers , bumbled his way into supposedly secure networks by guessing that the password had not been changed from the default " password " ) .
There is also an increasingly blurred line between what action the state sponsors ( which would qualify as full - blown international conflict ) and what is being done in the name of the state - a sort of guerrilla warfare played out on virtual battlefields .
With China 's growing power leading to widespread suspicion and criticism in the western media , these groups - a mixture of roguish hackers , disaffected teens and intellectuals frustrated by stereotypes about their culture - see part of their job as defending the homeland , even while they reserve the right to criticise it from the inside .
Rebecca MacKinnon , a Hong Kong - based journalist and academic , has identified this burgeoning ideology as " cyber- tarianism " - where highly connected citizens are critical of government repression but fiercely nationalistic at the same time .
" A lot of people do n't want a western - style democracy , " she told a conference in California last month .
" Before the Olympics last year , Chinese students protested all over the world at what they saw as biased western media accounts . "
These protests included a series of large - scale hacking attacks - on large targets such as the news channel CNN , and small ones such as pro-Tibet websites , which temporarily disabled them .
In China and Russia , this cyberforce is reckoned to be becoming more powerful - and more destructive .
Dissident Russian nationalists have also been blamed for the Estonia attacks , while similar groups are appearing in other countries around the globe as internet connectivity spreads .
Armed with technical know - how and a passionate cause , these ad hoc groups of individuals would seem increasingly important in the way these conflicts are playing out .
But it 's still difficult to imagine what would actually happen if a full - blown cyberwar ever did take place .
After all , movies like WarGames - stuffed with Hollywood exaggerations - surely stretch the limits of what can happen .
Do n't they ?
A Colorado man who says he bludgeoned his date to death out of rage and shock after discovering she was biologically male was convicted Wednesday of first - degree murder and a hate crime .
Jurors deliberated about two hours before finding Allen Ray Andrade , 32 , guilty of killing Angie Zapata , 18 , of Greeley last July .
District Judge Marcelo Kopcow swiftly sentenced him to life in prison without possibility of parole -- the state ’s mandatory sentence for first - degree murder .
Zapata , a transsexual , had dressed as female for much of her life , her family said .
The case was among the first uses of a hate - crimes statute that protects transgendered people .
The victim ’s mother , Maria Zapata , told the judge before sentencing : “ It ’s been so hard , so hard for my family and myself .
. . .
I lost something , somebody so precious . ”

But she said Andrade could never take away “ the love and the memories my family and I have of my baby -- my beautiful , beautiful baby . ”
Gay , lesbian and transsexual groups hailed the jury ’s decision .
“ Today ’s verdict was about justice for Angie Zapata , although no verdict will ever be able to heal the tragic loss experienced by Angie ’s family , ” said Neil G. Giuliano , president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation .
“ The past few months have offered Greeley residents , as well as people throughout Colorado and across the nation , an opportunity to better understand transgender lives and the horrifying reality of anti-transgender violence . ”
Activists noted that the conviction occurred in a conservative , largely rural county .

“ Finally , a rural county sheriff and prosecutor step up to the plate , ” said Kate Bowman of the Gender Identity Center of Colorado .
“ That ’s got to make people think it ’s time to do something . ”
Bowman is among those who advocate a federal hate - crimes statute .
A bill introduced in Congress this year would give the federal government the power to investigate and prosecute bias - motivated crimes in which the victim was selected because of race , religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation or gender identity .
Colorado is one of 11 states with hate - crimes laws that protect transgendered people .
In California , a similar high - profile case involved Gwen Araujo , 17 , of Newark , who was beaten and strangled in 2002 after two men with whom she ’d had sex learned she was biologically male .
They were convicted of second - degree murder , but not of a hate crime .
Zapata met Andrade , a convicted felon from Thornton , on a social - networking website in July , according to the arrest affidavit .
On July 16 , they went on a date , Andrade said , and Zapata performed oral sex on him but would not permit him to touch her .
According to the affidavit , Andrade said he became suspicious about Zapata ’s gender , grabbed her crotch and learned the truth .
In a rage , he said , he beat her to death with a fire extinguisher .

Andrade ’s attorneys referred to Zapata by her given name , Justin , and contended that their client had reacted due to shock at the sexual deceit .
But prosecutors , who referred to the deceased as “ she ” and “ Angie , ” said that the two had met via a website that catered to gay and transgendered people and that the couple had known each other for three days -- plenty of time for Andrade to understand Angie ’s biological gender .
They noted that Andrade had accompanied her to traffic court , where clerks called her Justin .
Prosecutors said Andrade was a homophobe who preyed on Zapata and pointed to recorded calls he made from jail in which he called the victim “ it ” and said : “ Someone living like that needs to be held accountable . ”
Defense attorney Annette Kundelius did not return a call for comment .
During the trial , she told jurors that Andrade had been joking .

“ Was it in poor taste ?
Was it a smart thing to say ? ” Kundelius said .
“ No .
But it does n’t mean he committed murder . ”
Andrade did not testify .
When the judge asked if he had anything to say before sentencing , he responded , “ No . ”

Marilyn Chambers , the legendary adult movie queen who was the wholesome model on Ivory Snow detergent boxes in the early 1970s when she made her adult movie debut in the X - rated classic “ Behind the Green Door , ” has died .
She was 56 .
Chambers was found unconscious Sunday evening at her home in Canyon Country , said Los Angeles County coroner ’s spokesman Ed Winter .
The cause of death is under investigation , but foul play is not suspected and an autopsy is pending .
Throughout the ‘ 70s and ‘ 80s , Chambers was one of the biggest names in the porn industry , ranked by Playboy magazine as one of the top 100 sex stars of the 20th century and named one of the top 10 adult film stars of all time by Adult Video News .
“ She certainly was one of the first famous porn stars , ” said Mark Kernes , senior editor of Adult Video News .
“ In her day , there was really Linda Lovelace , obviously for ‘ Deep Throat , ’ and Marilyn Chambers , ” he said .
Chambers ’ “ Behind the Green Door , ” Kernes said , “ was made all the more exotic , I think , for some people because she had been on that Ivory Snow box .
So here ’s the Ivory Snow beauty queen having hard - core interracial sex . ”
A fledgling actress , Chambers was living in San Francisco and making ends meet working as an exotic dancer when she saw a newspaper ad seeking actresses for what was described as a “ major ” motion picture .
It was n’t until she filled out an application that she discovered the movie was pornographic .
The producers -- Jim and Artie Mitchell -- offered her the starring role .
“ I thought I ’d take a shot , ” she explained in a 1977 interview with the Los Angeles Times .
“ I was intrigued by the story .
I really liked the fantasy involved .
And I figured it might be my last chance at something really big . ”
Chambers had some conditions , however :
She insisted that all the actors be tested for sexually transmitted diseases , and she demanded a percentage of the movie ’s gross receipts .
The low - budget “ Behind the Green Door ” became one of the biggest adult movie hits of the ‘ 70s , having received an unexpected publicity boost shortly after it was released in 1972 .
Procter & Gamble , unaware of Chambers ’ role in the X - rated film , used one of her photos that had been taken during her New York modeling days on its laundry detergent box -- she ’s shown cuddling a laughing baby .
“ Timing is essential for someone ’s career , ” Chambers said in a 2007 interview with Rhode Island ’s Providence Journal .
“ That ’s what did it for me .
The controversy of both those things happening at the same time , ” she said .
Procter & Gamble , whose Ivory products were “ 99 44/100 % pure , ” quickly pulled the boxes from store shelves .
“ The media attention of the whole controversy was insane , ” Chambers said in a 2003 interview with the Philadelphia Daily News .
“ This was the first time attention was being paid to erotic films . ”
Out of that , she said in a 2004 interview with the Montreal newspaper the Gazette , “ came a Marilyn Chambers clause in all modeling contracts , saying that you can never have posed topless or nude or been in any kind of adult film or Playboy or anything like that . ”
Chambers followed up “ Behind the Green Door ” with another hit produced by the Mitchell brothers , “ Resurrection of Eve . ”
And in 1975 , Artie Mitchell produced a semi-documentary , “ Inside Marilyn Chambers . ”
Chambers reportedly longed for mainstream movie stardom , and she starred in director David Cronenberg ’s R-rated 1977 horror movie “ Rabid . ”
But by 1980 , after appearing in a cabaret act as a singer and dancer and cutting a disco- flavored record , she returned to adult films , including “ Insatiable ” and the film series “ Marilyn Chambers ’ Private Fantasies . ”
“ I would have loved to move on , ” she said in a 2004 interview .
“ I ’ve been stigmatized , and it ’s something that ’s very difficult to get out of . ”
Chambers stopped making hard - core movies in the mid-'80s , but returned again in the late ‘ 90s with “ Still Insatiable , ” Kernes said .
“ In between , ” he said , “ she was doing soft - core late - night cable movies . ”
Her last screen appearance was in filmmaker Victor Franko ’s low - budget independent movie “ Solitaire , ” which was filmed in Rhode Island in 2007 .
In the PG - rated film , which has yet to be released , she plays a Providence police officer in pursuit of a group of teenage petty thieves .
Chambers was born Marilyn Ann Briggs on April 22 , 1952 , in Providence , R.I. , and grew up in Westport , Conn .
She became interested in acting as a teenager and began working as a model , appearing in print ads for Clairol shampoo and other products .
After retiring from adult films , Chambers remained a popular draw at memorabilia and autograph shows .
Chambers was married and divorced three times , including a marriage to Chuck Traynor , who had previously been married to Lovelace .
Chambers had a daughter , McKenna , from her marriage to Tom Taylor .
A complete list of surviving family members was not immediately available .

Times staff writer Andrew Blankstein contributed to this report .
It seems that every new political moment brings in its train a new menagerie of Republican pseudo - facts and finely drawn nonsense meant to confuse and obscure any actual discussion of the public policy issues of the day .
So it ’s time to start cataloguing them .
A week or so back I heard Jonah Goldberg yakking on about how Herbert Hoover was actually a Progressive .
( Which may constitute some modest advance from his earlier confusion of do - gooder grade school teachers with Nazi prison guards and SA paramilitaries . )
And then today this little nugget has transmogrified through the GOP sound machine into Herbert Hoover as a closet Keynesian who apparently started the whole New Deal before Franklin Roosevelt was even elected .
Like most sophistries , there ’s an element of truth in this one — but much of it is based on semantic evolution .
Hoover was part of the 1912 Progressive party and he was in key respects a Republican Progressive in the early 20th century meaning of the term — which is to say he was a technocrat who believed in scientific management and things like that .
It is also true that as the Depression deepened Hoover did take some very limited steps in the direction of government intervention in the economy , though ones that were dwarfed by Roosevelt ’s subsequent spending programs and regulatory innovations .
Fundamentally , Hoover was captive to the economic orthodoxy of the day which was hostile to government intervention and relied on volunteerism and placed a great deal of emphasis on balanced budgets .
The straw - man version of Hoover ’s presidency , in which he sat back and did nothing for four years , waiting on the market to correct itself is a caricature .
But broadly speaking , he was unwilling to take decisive action on virtually every front , though some of the efforts he began on a very small scale were expanded dramatically to great effect under Roosevelt .
History is always complex .
But to the degree public policy discussions do n’t leave room for extended detours into historiography , the broad brush outlines have to suffice .
And once again , the Republicans are peddling the standard up - is - downism meant to confuse the discussion and fight for the eventual triumph of absurdity and nonsense .

Fox has become the first network to turn down President Barack Obama ’s request to show his prime time news conference on Wednesday night .
Fox News and Fox Business will be carrying the event in its entirety .
“ The Fox Broadcasting Company will not air the Presidential News Conference on Wednesday , April 29 at 8:00 PM ( ET ) , ” Fox said in a statement .
“ Fox ’s sister networks , Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network , will air the press conference in its entirety .
Fox will be alerting viewers with an onscreen graphic at the top of the 8:00 PM ( ET ) hour that the press conference is available on Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network . ”
This really is n’t much of a surprise .
The broadcast networks lose millions of dollars in advertising every time that they carry one of these events .
From a programming point of view , Fox is hoping that the people who do n’t watch to watch Obama tune in to their alternative instead .
Fox News has a huge audience , but broadcast Fox always fares poorly when they cover these things .
Advertisements
It does n’t make much sense for Fox to cover this , because unless something breaks with the swine flu , there will be no breaking news discussed at this press conference .
Broadcast
Fox does n’t have a news division of its own , so they would be showing the Fox News coverage anyway , so why not direct viewers to FNC if they want to watch it ?
I do n’t think that it is a big deal that Fox passed on this one .
It would be a much bigger deal if any of the other broadcast or cable news networks passed , but to me this is no big deal .
I 've been wondering this for some time .
As the title say , which is faster , the actual function or simply raising to the half power ?
UPDATE
This is not a matter of premature optimization .
This is simply a question of how the underlying code actually works .
What is the theory of how Python code works ?
I sent Guido van Rossum an email cause I really wanted to know the differences in these methods .
My email :
There are at least 3 ways to do a square root in Python : math.sqrt , the '**' operator and pow ( x , .5 ) .
I 'm just curious as to the differences in the implementation of each of these .
When it comes to efficiency which is better ?
His response :
Computer hard drive sold on eBay ' had details of top secret U.S. missile defence system '
Highly sensitive details of a US military missile air defence system were found on a second - hand hard drive bought on eBay .
The test launch procedures were found on a hard disk for the THAAD ( Terminal High Altitude Area Defence ) ground to air missile defence system , used to shoot down Scud missiles in Iraq .
The disk also contained security policies , blueprints of facilities and personal information on employees including social security numbers , belonging to technology company Lockheed Martin - who designed and built the system .
A missile launch in California : Details of the ground - to - air defence system were found on a computer hard drive
British researchers found the data while studying more than 300 hard disks bought at computer auctions , computer fairs and eBay .
The experts also uncovered other sensitive information including bank account details , medical records , confidential business plans , financial company data , personal id numbers , and job descriptions .
The drives were bought from the UK , America , Germany , France and Australia by BT 's Security Research Centre in collaboration with the University of Glamorgan in Wales , Edith Cowan University in Australia and Longwood University in the US .
A spokesman for BT said they found 34 per cent of the hard disks scrutinised contained ' information of either personal data that could be identified to an individual or commercial data identifying a company or organisation . '
And researchers said a ' surprisingly large range and quantity of information that could have a potentially commercially damaging impact or pose a threat to the identity and privacy of the individuals involved was recovered as a result of the survey . '
Two disks appear to have been formerly used by Lanarkshire NHS Trust to hold information from the Monklands and Hairmyres hospitals including patient medical records , images of x-rays , medical staff shifts and sensitive and confidential staff letters .
In Australia , one disk came from a nursing home and contained pictures of patients and their wounds .
Confidential material including network data and security logs from the German Embassy in Paris were also discovered on a disk from France .
And the trading performances and budgets of a UK - based fashion company , corporate data from a major motor manufacturing company were discovered along with details of a proposed 50 billion currency exchange through Spain involving a US - based consultant .
Dr Andy Jones , head of information security research at BT , who led the survey , said : ' This is the fourth time we have carried out this research and it is clear that a majority of organisations and private individuals still have no idea about the potential volume and type of information that is stored on computer hard disks .
' For a very large proportion of the disks we looked at we found enough information to expose both individuals and companies to a range of potential crimes such as fraud , blackmail and identity theft .
' Businesses also need to be aware that they could also be acting illegally by not disposing of this kind of data properly . '
Dr Iain Sutherland of the University of Glamorgan said : ' Of significant concern is the number of large organisations that are still not disposing of confidential information in a secure manner .
In the current financial climate they risk losing highly valuable propriety data . '
A spokesman for Lockheed Martin , who make the THADD launch system , said : ' Lockheed Martin is not aware of any compromise of data related to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence programme .
' Until Lockheed Martin can evaluate the hard drive in question , it is not possible to comment further on its potential contents or source . '
A spokesman for NHS Lanarkshire said : ' This study refers to hard disks which were disposed of in 2006 .
At that time NHS Lanarkshire had a contractual agreement with an external company for the disposal of computer equipment .
' In this instance the hard drives had been subjected to a basic level of data removal by the company and had then been disposed of inappropriately .
This was clearly in breach of contract and was wholly unacceptable . '
The spokesman said the trust now destroy equipment containing data on the premises , so no longer use external companies to dispose of IT equipment .
The unmanned mini-helicopter has been dubbed the " Canna Chopper , " and has been put to use sniffing out illegal grow operations in the Netherlands .

The U.S. Department of Justice ( US DOJ ) and several states have requested an extension of restrictive antitrust oversight of Microsoft Corp .
An 18 month extension was requested by the DOJ and 17 U.S. states , including New York and California , in order to ' thoroughly scrub ' technical documentation Microsoft is producing to comply with antitrust law .
The DOJ 's restrictive oversight of Microsoft was first implemented in 2002 as part of an antitrust settlement that required Microsoft to produce reams of technical documentation designed for enabling rivals to design compatible products with Microsoft 's Windows software .

A recent court filing by the Department of Justice said that production of the documentation is proceeding well but more time is needed for them to thoroughly review it .
Last year , following a similar DOJ request , oversight was extended and scheduled to expire in November of this year .
Extension Requested Through May 2011
The lengthy extension was requested by the Department of Justice because they believe it would make additional extensions unnecessary .
The DOJ and the states involved requested an extension of the oversight through May , 2011 .
Possibly in response to antitrust concerns , Microsoft is adding control panel options to Windows 7 that will allow users to turn off Internet Explorer , Windows Media Player and Microsoft 's hard - drive search software .
Microsoft agreed to the extension request .
Microsoft and the DOJ also agreed that when the extension is up , the government wo n't be able to ask for more time to review an operating system that has n't gone on sale , meaning if Windows 7 has n't been released by May 2011 , it wo n't be subject to the antitrust scrutiny under the 2002 agreement .

$ 1.5 m anti-gay marriage campaign slammed for ' half - truths ' Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday April 9 , 2009

This A new television ad against same - sex marriage is being slammed as deceptive and full of " half - truths " by gay rights groups .
According to one report , $ 1.5 million will be spent to air the ads in four Northeastern states , which are considering gay marriage bills .
The National Organization for Marriage 's ad depicts individuals , from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds , standing against a backdrop of stormy clouds .
With lines like ---
 The clouds are dark and the winds are strong  and  They want to bring the issue into my life ,  and  My freedom will be taken away 
--- the ad is filled with ominous hints that gay marriage advocates seek to impose their values on others .
Freedom to Marry Director Evan Wolfson told RAW STORY the ads were nothing more than  the same kinds of scare tactics and half - truths that theyve trotted out before but obviously , produced in a slick , deceptive wrapping . 
Another prominent gay rights organization , Human Rights Campaign , dissected the assertions made in the ad which include : ( 1 ) A California doctor who was forced to choose between her religion and her job , ( 2 ) a New Jersey church group that was punished by the state for not supporting gay marriage and ( 3 ) a Massachusetts parent upset that her son's school is teaching that same - sex marriage is alright .
" All three examples involve religious people who enter the public sphere , but dont want to abide by the general non-discriminatory rules everyone else does , " HRC fired back in a release .
" Both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are really about state laws against sexual orientation discrimination , rather than specifically about marriage .
And ( 3 ) is about two pairs of religious parents trying to impose their beliefs on all children in public schools . "
Freedom to Marry 's Wolfson , author of Why Marriage Matters : America , Equality and Gay People 's Right to Marry , said ,  What they re really saying is that laws that ensure people have the opportunity to participate in society without discrimination based on sexual orientation that those laws somehow interfere with their ability to discriminate and shouldnt be allowed . "
After suffering a serious setback in November with California voters  passage of Proposition 8 , gay rights advocates have enjoyed a slew of victories in the last week .
The victories include an Iowa Supreme Court verdict in favor of gay marriage , the Vermont legislatures legalization of gay marriage and a vote by the District of Columbia city council to recognize other states  same - sex marriages .
Coming so soon after the gay marriage setback in California , the anti-gay marriage movement has been surprised by these gay rights victories .
Brian Brown , executive director of the National Organization for Marriage , told The New York Times that his organization was caught of guard by the court ruling in Iowa .
With legislatures in New York , New Jersey , Maine and New Hampshire set to consider gay marriage bills this year , Brown said his group decided to move up the start date of its multi-million dollar ad campaign .
The New Hampshire House of Representatives has already approved a gay marriage bill that is now awaiting consideration in the state 's Senate .
Maines legislature is set to begin committee hearings on its gay marriage bill this month and the governors of New York and New Jersey have both said they will sign gay marriage bills if their legislatures pass them .
 It s a bad day for the country , " Brown told The Times .
" There is a palpable sense that something has changed and people need to get active . "
On the other side , Wolfson believes the gay rights community has found new reserves of motivation in the wake of Proposition 8 .
 Proposition 8 was very much a wake - up call ,  Wolfson said .
 I think a lot of people , both gay and not gay , woke up after election day shocked that the freedom to marry had been temporarily stripped away in California and they vowed that they werent going to sit on the sidelines the next time . 
Just because the gay marriage movement has enjoyed some victories does not mean that there wont be more losses down the road , warned Wolfson .
The most important thing that supporters of gay marriage can do now , according to Wolfson , is to actively reach out to their friends and family members and explain to them why gay marriage is important .
 The recipe for social change is information plus time .
We have to give fair - minded - reachable - but - not - yet - reached - people , who are wrestling with this question , the information they need to rise to fairness and that information is the truth about how the denial of marriage harms gay [ couples ] ,  Wolfson said .
 We have to talk about the legal and economic consequences of being excluded from marriage . 

A " completely new kind of wave power machine " which resembles a giant swimming sea - snake could be generating energy off the coast of the UK within five years , its developers said today .
Each " anaconda " , a device which could be up to 200 metres long and made almost entirely of a rubber tube , could be capable of producing 1MW ( megawatt ) of power .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The plan is to have " shoals " or " schools " of the devices around the coast , where they would be harnessed to " swim " just below the surface .
Groups of 50 anacondas could each generate enough electricity to power 50,000 homes at an " excitingly low " cost , the developers Checkmate Group said .
A nine - metre version of the anaconda is currently in the final stage of " proof of concept " testing at a 270 metre wave test tank run by QinetiQ in Gosport , Hampshire .
The test tank is the largest in the UK and can simulate the strength and frequency of the ocean waves the device would encounter in the sea .
Checkmate hopes to be testing full - scale devices in the ocean within three years , with the first anacondas in commercial production and deployed off the coast by 2014 .
The anaconda is harnessed to the sea floor , and unlike other wave energy machines " swims " head - on to the waves , like a ship in a storm , according to Professor Rod Rainey who came up with the original idea .
The waves in the sea stimulate a " bulge wave " which passes down the tube like a pulse of blood in an artery , gathering energy to drive a turbine in its tail .
The electricity generated by the turbine would be captured and carried to shore by cables .
Smaller versions of the device could be located alongside offshore wind farms where they could use existing grid connections to transmit electricity back to land .
Prof Rainey , a chief engineer with engineering design consultants Atkins , said : " It 's a completely new kind of wave power machine . "
And he said : " The beauty of wave energy is its consistency .
However , the problem holding back wave energy machines is they tend to deteriorate over time in the harsh marine environment .
" Anaconda is non-mechanical : it is mainly rubber , a natural material with a natural resilience and so it has very few moving parts to maintain . "
He added that the design was " tremendously survivable " .
" If the worst comes to the worst it 'll only be washed up on the beach , and you can patch it up and put it back out there , " he said .
Checkmate 's chairman Paul Auston said the anaconda could help to meet EU targets to source 15 % of all the UK 's energy needs from renewables by 2020 - the lion 's share of which is currently expected to be met by wind power .
He said : " I think wave power has always been as the poor relation of wind energy , but a lot of people are resentful of wind turbines on their doorstep , or in vast tracts of coastal waters .
" What we 're offering through Checkmate is a new technology which you can't see , it 's under the water so it 's not as intrusive and it's made of a natural material .
" It has major benefits to the environment and , we think , to people generally , " he said .
While he said it was too early to put a price on the anaconda , he said the company was confident that they would be able to develop the technology so that it was affordable and competitive with other renewable resources such as wind .
And he said Checkmate wanted to deliver a device that was not dependent on subsidy , and was continuing to " narrow the gap " in costs .
Early stage development was backed by the Carbon Trust which said the anaconda had the potential to deliver breakthrough reductions in the cost of energy , and be much cheaper than the current best renewable energy devices .
The developers also hope the scheme could create a sizeable number of British jobs in the renewables sector and provide export opportunities to other countries in the world where wave energy could be harnessed along the coast , such as the US and Australia .

In the end , when writing software , you have to choose which goals you pursue , and in this case , there is an opposition between principles and user experience .
Sure , I 've done nothing wrong and I should n't have to code in workarounds for broken AVs , but this does nothing to help the user who is having trouble running my software .
Just because the problem is n't your fault does n't mean you do n't have to implement a solution .
This is n't to say that I 'm against antivirus software entirely .
I 've seen havoc caused by viruses back in my Amiga days , and I 've seen how AV can affect the spread of Conflicker through a network .
What bothers me is the way that antivirus programs now regularly make false accusations against third parties without recourse .
VirtualDub 's only been flagged a few times , as far as I know , but some vendors have had their software marked so many times that they have a frighteningly long list of false AV detections on their website .
It 's also wonderful dealing with bugs that turn out to be because of AV interference , such as files being locked in ways that are impossible according to Win32 semantics .
Guess who gets blamed for the problems .
The frustrating part about this is that I do n't actually have a way to tell the AV vendors that their software is screwing up .
I 'm not their customer and do n't have one of every AV installed , and they do n't exactly put an easy to find " tell us we &# * $ed up " link on their website .
About the best I can do , then , is request that the user click the quarantine or " send us a sample " button in their AV .
Unfortunately , that assumes they have the ability to do so .
Locked down corporate setups are especially frustrating because they 're often locked down and set to delete on sight .
The result is that I have an annoyed user who can't run my program at all , and there 's nothing I can do about it .
The antivirus vendor might not even be able to anything , because they may have already fixed the problem and the installation may be old !
Here 's the problem :
It 's in the interests of the antivirus vendors to have their products as visible as possible to the user .
To the extent this means a higher chance of detecting threats , that 's good .
The problem is in the rise in false positives , fueled by the increasing difficulty of detecting malware , as well as the addition of detection heuristics .
Some of these are pretty sketchy .
In addition to the lousy Registry check for Software / Freeware , some AVs used to flag VirtualDub as a trojan simply because it used the UPX executable compressor .
The result is that I get complaints from users asking me why VirtualDub is a virus .

You could sum it all up with the Israeli saying - do n't be smart , be right .
It 's usually applied to things like driving a car .
For example , if a mad driver tries to bypass you , it might be better to let him / her through than risk an accident just because the law is on your side .
With that said , what you should have done - like other programmers do - is put a big " If your antivirus detects Virtualdub , than know it 's just a false positive " message .
I know it does n't really prove anything , but it is reassuring to know you do n't have a bad / fake version of the program on your system .

I meant a message not in the program itself , of course , but in the front page of your site .
Lior - 29 03 09 - 05:07
That s just one more reason not to use UPX in particular and executable packers in general .
Yuri Khan - 29 03 09 - 05:19
Why whould i refuse to use UPX just because some AV suck .
UPX is wonderfull piece of software and support more platforms , then any antivirus .
Ca n't see why not use one high quality program ( VirtualDub ) with another one ( UPX )
chornobyl - 29 03 09 - 07:00
FWIW you can use http://www.virustotal.com/ to upload files and get back a list of scan results from almost 40 different AV programs .
I usually use it when someone posts something I 'm not sure about to a forum I help run , just in case there 's malware in it which my personal AV program did n't detect .
Of course , with 40 AV programs you almost always seem to get false positives .
Some of the AV programs are really crap but at least VirusTotal will let you know what to expect ( and it includes non-crap AV programs as well ) .
With UPX files you always get a lot of false positives , too .
Leo Davidson ( link ) - 29 03 09 - 09:23
Antivirus vendors that do this have size of the brain equal to those malware writers who thought they can hide in UPX . :)
GrofLuigi - 29 03 09 - 14:24
Using UPX to pack executables is often not as helpful as it may seem at first .
If you pack the executable with UPX ( or any other executable packer ) , you have the advantage that the file uses less space on disk .
Which is a good thing , right ?
Well not always , because when you run an UPX 'ed executable , it has to be loaded into memory completely , to be correctly uncompressed .
So you do n't get the cool benefits of demand - paging that you normally have with EXE files ( i.e. windows only loads the parts into memory that are actually used ) .
That is probably not noticeable on a rather small EXE file like VirtualDub , but it is one of the reasons why projects with larger EXE files do n't compress it ( take MAME for an extreme example ) - Darkstar
Darkstar - 29 03 09 - 18:53
Honestly , I have n't seen a UPX - related issue in a long time , since I think at this point all major AVs now have logic to unpack UPX executables .
UPX does make the final archive smaller than just .zip alone , so it has n't been worth removing .
Arranging the executable so that it can be demand paged is n't a benefit for memory consumption -- Windows will trim your code pages to the working set whether it can page directly from the EXE or not .
The main benefit of doing so is allowing Windows to use the EXE directly instead of the page file .
You 're correct in implying that VirtualDub is n't optimized for low memory conditions .
If it were , then I probably would compile the entire application with / Os , optimize the link order , and use memory mapping for I /O .
As it is , though , it 's a bit silly to do so when VirtualDub 's entire code segment fits in two video frames ( and it 's not very fun work ) .
One thing that enlarges VirtualDub 's code segment is all of the padding that the VC ++ compiler puts between functions , which is due to / Ot ( optimize for speed ) .
For small functions it can contribute as much as 30 - 40 % of the raw footprint , and it 's useless if you have an optimized core that does n't call functions in critical paths .
Unfortunately , there 's no option to turn off only this padding .
I used to compile some portions of VirtualDub as / O1 to reduce this , and it shrunk the raw executable by almost one - third , but I stopped doing it because it was a pain to maintain at the project level and UPX compressed it all out anyway .

Use Linux guys ... ;)
( Ok I still am not happy that Linux has its own share of problems ...
I still want Avisynth 3.0 ... but as far as Viruses is concerned , I never had any problem whatsoever on Linux with viruses .
Sure , other problems ... but no viruses anywhere . )
mark - 29 03 09 - 21:12
Personally I think that packing the executable was convenient back in times when you needed your code to fit onto one floppy disk or you needed to count every byte on your hard drive .
Currently a lot of VirtualDub copies fit onto a DVD and I think I have low disk space when there 's less than 10 gigabytes free so I think I would n't mind at all if VirtualDub ceased to stop using UPX just to reduce number of false positives .
Size of the zip archive or VirtualDub load time seem to be quite unimportant factors to me .
Kasuha - 30 03 09 - 08:13
@ Kasuha : a 500 Kb .EXE is fast to read , and is unlikely to fragment .
Due to the way UPX works , it is also very fast at unpacking said binary ( CPU - wise ) .
This , in turn , allows VirtualDub to be included in stuff like free software compilations on a USB key , to load instantly no matter what the PC is doing or how badly fragmented the system hard disk drive is ( loading 1.8
Mb of data from a HDD , when fragmented AND busy , can be incredibly long ; something like a few dozen seconds - while loading 500 Kb is fast , no matter what ) , and also is much less costly bandwidth - wise , as UPX can compress executable binaries much better than , say , ZIP .
As such , using UPX should be pretty much mandatory , and not the exception ; " smart " AVs are able to recognize UPX as it is , and indeed scan the unpacked binary ; lousy ones do n't , and assume only virii authors use UPX ; since UPX ' signs ' the binaries packed with it , it is seen as much less time consuming .
For the sake of testing , I once packed the Mozilla Firefox 2 main EXE : it disallowed small automatic patches .
But damn , did it load faster !

You can read the detailed arguments on my blog : http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2006/11/to..
But the gist of it is : it is ( almost ) never useful to pack executables .
Any speedup you get from it is purely imaginary :-) , since ( as the blogpost describes in details ) you actually have to read more from the disk , not less , during application startup .

I 've had my own share of problems with lousy antivirus programs - I use Inno Setup as the installer for GIMP , and for a while I 'd be receiving at least one report per month that the uninstaller is infected .
I 'd put a warning on the download page every time it happened , and last year I decided to start doing a hall of shame of all AV products that did this - except that since I started that , it only happened once more ( and that time , it was one of the plugins that was triggering the false alarm instead ) .

The startup time issue is too vague to make a decision just based on the compression .
While it is possible that the OS faults in fewer pages when starting an uncompressed executable , the fault pattern will be less efficient than UPX 's decompression .
Note that for the main distribution , I only use .zip because that 's the only archive that everyone 's basically guaranteed to be able to open .
I do use 7 - zip for the source archive , and it does compress significantly better .
Phaeron - 30 03 09 - 14:26
Two comments regarding the antiviruses : 1 . Yes , most antiviruses are able to unpack UPX and scan the inner content .
However , it means that the compressed data have to be unpacked twice - first by the antivirus ( which has to use slower code , with lots of range checking , to prevent possible security problems ) , second by the loader itself .
So , startup of the executable is certainly slowed down .2 . The [ in ] ability to unpack UPX in an antivirus engine does n't have anything to do with false alarms on UPX .
The antivirus may be able to unpack this format , but a ( unrelated ) virus signature in its database may have been chosen ( incorrectly ) such that it detects part of the UPX unpacking stub .
Or , it detects a common compressed snippet ( e.g. MS CRT or Borland VCL , packed by LZO - even that happens ) .
The companies receive thousands of packed samples every day , many of them are packed by UPX - but not just pure UPX , but further scrambled / crippled with custom UPX scramblers - so mistakes like that can easily happen .
And , the truth is that since the biggest companies ( Microsoft , Adobe , ... ) do n't pack their executables ( where false alarms would be very serious ) , so false alarms on packed executables have somehow lower priority to solve .

You just reiterated my point : Valid programming techniques are being invalidated due to interference from third parties that are largely unaccountable if you are a small - time developer .
Phaeron - 30 03 09 - 14:53
a whole post for little old me ?
I 'm still very much for a change from registry to .ini , it might be a old api , but its not going away , Vista still uses desktop.ini files all over the place .
ini files are not only good for portable apps , but they reduce registry bloat ( I do n't run VDub 24/7 )
On some systems ( w2 k IIRC ) the registry is in the nonpaged pool so keeping the size down is a good thing , not that VDub is the big problem , its more the stupid stuff stored in there , mostly by MS .
I 'm looking at you .NET and MSI ! , you also have stuff like ... Windows \CurrentVersion \SharedDlls that should have an API to modify the list , and that list should not be in the registry etc ...

More false positives : I think anti-virus vendors need to tread carefully - too many false positives and people may just go " The Boy Who Cried Wolf " - style and stop believing them all together .
yawnmoth - 31 03 09 - 11:42
I would characterize that last ZSNES case as particularly irresponsible .
Instead of putting up a dialog saying that a program is using Microsoft DirectInput and asking the user to confirm , the AV just put up a cryptic warning about dinput8.dll and a keylogger , leaving it to the software vendor to explain : 1 ) What dinput8.dll is2 ) What DirectInput is3 )
Why the AV is mentioning dinput8 / DirectInput instead of the applicationDirectInput is used by so many full - screen games it 's not even funny .
Phaeron - 31 03 09 - 14:30

Maybe a good point to think about using the users applicationdata folder files instead of the registry .
You once said it is about database - like features - not that there is so much concurrent access to VirtualDubs config file ...

Avery is right as usual : 1. UPX packing is completely legit2 .
AV vendors are jerkwads3 .
Too many false positives as of late ( some stuff like keygens is even being added on purpose and I believe that AV vendors are getting a nice profit for allowing arbitrary entries to their blacklists ) 4 .
That said , if VirtualDub were digitally signed it could have stayed compressed by whatever means .
It seems almost magical that signature from trusted CA practically means " lower the shields and let me in " 5 .
Once everyone starts using trusted CAs , we will again have no way to distinguish the good guys from the bad ones .
Ouch , back to square one .
Needless to say , that will have the largest impact on small independent vendors .
I never use AV because I do n't want to support them -- they are selling snake oil , not protection .
There is always a time window between virus outbreak and updated signature database during which you are vulnerable like everyone else and you are paying for that privilege .
Ah , what to say , sheeps are for fleecing .
Igor Levicki ( link ) - 04 04 09 - 16:20
I 'm not opposed to signing the VirtualDub executable , but I am opposed to paying a yearly fee to be able to do it , and more opposed to the apparent requirement that you need to be a company to be able to sign code .
Antivirus software was more effective , I think , in the days when people wrote viruses for fun .
The viruses still did a lot of damage , but in that case the AVs were frequently able to stay far enough ahead , especially when people still managed to get infected with OLD viruses , mainly out of carelessness .
Now that malware is being often exploited for gain , I think we 're seeing more sudden outbreaks .
To clarify , I 'm not totally opposed to the idea of antivirus software , especially where they are able to fill gaps in application or operating system security models or where they can catch previously unknown threats through heuristics .
What I 'm opposed to is the lack of checks and balances where third parties can be improperly accused of wrongdoing and there are no established procedures for getting mistakes resolved .

> 4 . That said , if VirtualDub were digitally signed it could have stayed compressed by whatever means .
It seems almost magical that signature from trusted CA practically means " lower the shields and let me in " It does n't actually .
All my installers for GIMP for Windows , and all binaries in the installer are signed by a certificate donated by Certum , but that never prevented random antiviruses from flagging it as malware at random times .
ender - 05 04 09 - 16:30
@ Igor : as someone who worked for years in the AV industry , the statement " some stuff like keygens is even being added on purpose and I believe that AV vendors are getting a nice profit for allowing arbitrary entries to their blacklists " is completely without foundation .
The real reasons for keygens being detected is :- some of them are fake and actually are malware - some of the them are bundled with malware ( thing SFX which extracts two executables - a trojan and the keygen - and runs them both ) .
This is actually quite common - quite a lot of keygen writers have the impression that packing is " cool " , and many of them use packers mainly used by malware .
For the AV it is easy to blacklist the packer , since it catches a large amount of malware and does n't give FPs on legitimate software .
So let me repeat it again : I never ever seen any AV companies signing cracks or keygens on purpose or because some vendor asked for it ( also , it would be a bad financial decision from the vendors part : if there are N AV companies and M crack versions , you have to convince each AV company to blacklist all cracks to be effective - and also you need to stay on top of the new cracks appearing ) .

> For the AV it is easy to blacklist the packer , since it catches a large amount of malware and does n't give FPs on legitimate software .... and that 's the main problem with AVs nowadays : they do the easy thing , and do n't care about collateral damage .
How many times have NSIS and Inno - based installs been flagged as malware because somebody did the easy thing , and blacklisted all files that came with the malware , even if they were completely innocent 3rd party installers , or the program was simply packed with a free executable compression tool ?
ender - 06 04 09 - 05:52
" For the AV it is easy to blacklist the packer , since it catches a large amount of malware and does n't give FPs on legitimate software .
" I'm not sure what message you 're sending here .
Are you trying to say that any packed executables are n't legitimate software , or are you trying to say that software is only legitimate if it 's digitally signed ?
Bandwidth is fairly cheap these days , but still not free .
There are plenty of people out there still stuck with dial - up connections .
Sites like SourceForge may be free for projects like this , however they still have hosting costs that increase with bandwidth consumption .
As for the second possible message , there are countless OSS ( or free closed - source ) projects out there that are much more legitimate than their commercial counterparts .
The day that AV software starts flagging apps like the Google Toolbar as Malware is they day I start having even a small amount of faith in them .
subhuman - 09 04 09 - 17:46
The message here is that packed executables are suspicious .
If I have an executable I am uncertain about ( which is most of the files you download from web these days , considering the number of sites hacked every day ) and want to check what it 's about , I simply open it in a hex editor and quickly browse through it .
Usually , it 's possible to get a pretty good idea according to the strings inside ( yes , I know this is nothing really conclusive , bad stuff can be hidden , but it 's just a quick check ) .
Now , if the file is packed ... it looks like it 's trying to hide something - for no good reason .
Yes , digital signatures certainly help - but it still depends on who issued the certificates ( I 'd say you can trust Verisign certificates , but there is quite some malware signed with Comodo certificates , for example ) .
So , except for very special cases , packing your product will do more harm than good , both for you and your users .>... and that 's the main problem with AVs nowadays : they do the easy thing , and do n't care about collateral damage .
Depends on the point of view ; AVs care about their users .
So , the question is what damage is bigger - having a FP ( which affects the particular AV users as well , of course , so it 's not something to ignore ) or allowing their users to get infected because of undetected malware .
I do n't believe an AV simply blacklists the whole NSIS / Inno installer on purpose ( which I 'm not sure you 're suggesting , but it sounds that way ) - when it happens , it 's a mistake caused by the incredible number of malware samples that have to be processed each day .
Hard to do much about it , I 'm afraid . >
Bandwidth is fairly cheap these days , but still not free .
There are plenty of people out there still stuck with dial - up connections .
If you want to save bandwidth , you pack the file with ZIP / RAR /7 - ZIP , possibly self - extracting , before you put it on web - not with an executable packer .

So I 'm supposed to anticipate third party interference with a version of my program that did n't have any problems when I released it a year ago , with rules that deliberately are n't published and change with each version of AV signatures ?
I 'm sorry , but that does n't scale on my end .
You got it correct when you said that AVs care about their users .
They do n't care about MY users .
False positives do n't hurt them unless their users know that they 're occurring , which is almost never the case because the user is depending on the AV 's expertise .
If you personally do n't want to run my executable just because it 's packed , that 's fine .
I 'd hope that if you wrote some software that monitored other executables that you 'd take a little more care before firing false accusations .
Phaeron - 10 04 09 - 15:21
I was n't talking about VirtualDub in particular and I am not making any accusations .
All I 'm saying is that packing does n't bring any advantage these days - and since , on the other hand , it brings quite a few problems with false alarms ( which is not your fault , of course , but that 's how it is and I do n't think there 's any way out ) , I find it simply a bad idea to do so .
Btw , it 's not really true that false positives do n't hurt the companies ; if the false positive occured before the user attempts to download / install the program , then maybe ( they 'll think it 's a real warning and do n't even try to get the program ) - but if it occurs later , after the program is installed for a long time , quite a few users notice that something strange is happening and report the problem .
Of course , the situation in corporate environment ( where the AV is usually set - up to remove the " infected " stuff automatically ) is even worse - the customers are not very happy when the antivirus interferes with the tools they need for their job .
But , as Cd - MaN was trying to say when speaking about " legitimate software " - software you normally find in corporate environment is not packed , i.e. the risk of similar incidents is significantly smaller .
i_g - 10 04 09 - 18:32
[..] software you normally find in corporate environment is not packed , i.e. the risk of similar incidents is significantly smaller .
[..]
Well , it may not be packed as often - but on the other hand most of the time business or expensive corporate software uses something much worse ( I think ) -> copy protection of some sort .
For example scrambled / crypted executables etc. .. nowadays there 's quite some " evil " stuff out there that relies on so many OS / driver specifics etc.pp .
it 's not much fun any more .
Something like UPX is a god sent in comparison .
;) Sorry for ranting ..
I just downloaded / installed the Cineform NeoHD trial and I am quite nerved out by there strange " ensure that 14 days trial really means 14 days and not one more " protection mechanism .
It relies on several cryptic strange registry keys ( some under HKCR \CLSID , some as subkeys under other legit regkeys , some obviosly " fake " etc.etc . ) - it basically gobbled much of the registry with it's " trial protection " keys which obviously wo n't be removed when I uninstall it to ensure I wo n't use it again for another 14 days .
( add to that a challange / response like combination of invisbly - called - by - the - installer activation / deactivation programs and whatnot - I 'm not a hacker so I will never fully know what else it did to my OS installation ) What that means for me personally : a simple _CODEC_ that is as expensive as Cineform and obviously had so much work put into their stupid protection system (s ) ( which perhaps adds to the price ?
;o ) is just to unreliable for my low / middle budget production work .. when I quickly need it on another computer or my OS installation / registry gets somehow corrupted I risk getting stuck with a non-working codec that cost me several hundred $ $ $... The strange thing is ( to bring this post slightly on topic again ; o ) ... all this " hidden " modifications the program did , and not once did the antivirus complain !
However , when I used sysinternals Tools for tracking what this codec / it 's installer did .. yeah .. suddenly my AV woke up again and bombarded me with warnings that I was using evil hacker tools from hell .. great !

Phaeron obviously puts a lot of effort into making Virtualdub easy for people to use , even beginners .
So I applaud his pragmatism in making a ( relatively ) minor change to try and avoid potential false positives from AV , which naive computer users ( i.e. most users ) would n't be able to tell from a real positive .
It 's all very well being pigheaded and insisting AV vendors do something about the problem , or that his audience somehow become less naive about false positives , but all that would do is hurt his users .
The goal is n't to be a purist , it 's to make sure people can keep using Virtualdub with as few hassles as possible .
Re the comment about packed executables being suspicious ... it would be a pretty poor virus or malware that was able to be detected through looking at plain text strings in the executable .
Using that method , virtually every piece of software with any copy protection at all would be deemed suspicious since they use much more determined methods to obfuscate executables than simply packing them .
If you 're that worried about what downloaded programs are going to do , it would be much quicker to just run them in a sandbox and track what they do with simple tools like those from sysinternals .
If it is something that you just want to run once then never again , use sandboxie .
ElTorqiro - 14 04 09 - 10:44
> it would be a pretty poor virus or malware that was able to be detected through looking at plain text strings in the executable .
That 's indeed the case for a vast majority of malware .
Do n't expect most of the malware authors to be very bright ; they take an existing module , possibly do some small changes , repack it with a few packers ( sometimes not even noticing that the combination of packers they had used resulted in an executable that cannot even be started ) - and start to spread their " creation " on web .
Malware that is interesting / good from a programming point of view - is quite rare .
Today 's malware world is much more about quantity than quality , so to say .
i_g - 14 04 09 - 14:33
" The day that AV software starts flagging apps like the Google Toolbar as Malware is they day I start having even a small amount of faith in them .
" Are you joking ?
IMO , this is so ridiculous that I misread this at first .

Hi , Comming back in a few word to your original post .
I 'm in mind that you took too much care of your users :-) if even one percent of them would have take care of you as much as you do for them ; you would have been very rich since now .
By the way , you should n't consider some isolated cases as a problem , it 's just some natural error that arise .
Considere that for each complaint you receive , there are all around the world another 20 or even more guys that heapilly use virtualdub without any issue .
And if there remains some lazy AV users , just tell them to turn it off while they use virtualdub .
If they really want to use it , do n't worry , they will find a way to do so .
regards
bork - 17 04 09 - 15:51
You 're assuming they have the option of turning it off .
In a corporate environment , IT often has settings locked down so that this is not possible .
Phaeron - 17 04 09 - 16:01
If you have problems with packed executable - just unpack it !
Millions like VirtualDub and hundreds can't launch it .
Hundreds have to use The Utility ( UPX ) to play with this great program .
I think , it 's fair .
Yorik.sar - 19 04 09 - 08:12
I agree with " i_g - 10 04 09 - 08:11 " .
Packing in UPX these days is a sign of suspicious behavior .
Download sizes and disk usage are hardly prime concerns for anyone , rendering the primary purpose of UPX a moot point .
I consider EXE packers to be a gimmick ( when not being used to obfuscate malicious code , obviously . )
One must ask :
Does the benefit outweigh the risk ?
What exactly is the benefit ?
Josh Straub ( link ) - 05 12 09 - 09:28
> Download sizes and disk usage are hardly prime concerns for anyone , rendering the primary purpose of UPX a moot point .
This is simply not true .
Program size is a concern anytime you 're dealing in either a small storage ( think netbook or USB stick ) , or in a quick bootstrap scenario ( installers , particularly web - based ) .
Just because you do n't have this problem does n't mean that no one does . >
Packing in UPX these days is a sign of suspicious behavior .
That 's self - reinforcing thanks to the false positive problem .
When I and others started using it , there was no such problem , and such UPX - packed programs are now retroactively affected .
Phaeron - 05 12 09 - 10:01
I am a small - time developer , I use UPX to pack my executables .
My most popular download is 928KB unpacked , 436KB packed .
That 's a 53 % saving ; once upon a time I was getting an 80 % saving , though at that time it was ~ 800 KB unpacked .
With several thousand downloads per day , it adds up .
I think it is worth using UPX to save bandwidth and to provide an EXE that does n't have to be unpacked with winzip or winrar .
When I first started using it 1 or 2 AV's would flag it purely because it was using UPX , this is no longer a problem .
I still have false positives , but they are unrelated to UPX and more related to the type of software and what it does .
The diplomatic challenges facing President Obama during his overseas trip this week include this one :
What gift to give his host in Britain , the queen ?
Gift giving , when mishandled , can cause a kerfuffle , as Obama has already discovered .
When British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited the White House in March , the British press panned Obama ’s presentation of DVDs of Hollywood films as declasse .
It did n’t help that the DVDs did n’t work in European players .
On Wednesday , Obama stuck with a technology gift in paying a formal visit to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace .
But this time he added a more personal touch .

The president , who was accompanied by the first lady , gave Her Majesty an iPod loaded with video and photographs of the queen ’s 2007 visit to Jamestown , Richmond and Williamsburg , Va .
He also gave her a songbook signed by composer Richard Rodgers .
In return , the queen gave the president a silver - framed , signed photograph of her and her husband , Prince Philip , which is reported to be a standard present for visiting dignitaries .
British journalists have reported that the queen may already own an iPod -- a 6 - gigabyte silver Mini , which she is said to have bought at the suggestion of Prince Andrew , one of her sons .

It is unknown whether she will find anything , beyond reminders of her Virginia visit , if she hits the “ shuffle ” feature on the iPod .
Queen ’s greatest hits , perhaps ?

” is a film that tells the story of two children ( and ) with psychic abilities whose search for their origins gets them caught up in an adventure with a cab driver ( ) and a UFO specialist ( ) .
The original 1975 picture “ ” was followed by the sequel “ ” , as well as a 1995 made - for - TV remake .

ONCE the fastest - growing economies in Europe , the three Baltic countries are now the opposite .
Latvia , which in December received a € 7.5 billion ( $ 10 billion ) bail - out led by the International Monetary Fund , is basing its budget on a 13 % decline in GDP .
Estonia and Lithuania expect a decline of a tenth .
A conventional response might be devaluation and fiscal stimulus .
But the Baltics ' currency pegs to the euro are a matter of national pride .
Moreover , most private borrowing is in euros , so devaluation would mean beggary for many .
Instead , the response has been wage cuts meant to regain competitiveness .
Fiscal stimulus is tricky too .
Estonia ran a budget surplus during the boom , so has some room for manoeuvre , but even it can risk only a deficit of 3 % of GDP permitted by the rules for joining the euro .
All three countries want to adopt the single currency as soon as possible , though not by bending the rules : the whole point is to gain credibility , not to enter the club “ on a stretcher ” , as one official puts it .
But as economies shrink , it gets harder to meet deficit targets .
Latvia 's new government has been haggling over a 5 % ceiling agreed with the IMF , missing last month 's € 200 m instalment of the bail - out as a result .
The Baltics have no shortage of external support .
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development this week agreed to bail out Parex , a Latvian bank .
The IMF has more money to help .
But the economic adjustments are still unimaginable in old Europe .
Having soft - pedalled reform after joining the European Union , the Baltics now have to make up for lost time , in a climate where they are perilously exposed to the global downturn .
Belatedly , some progress is visible .
Inflation and current - account deficits are falling .
Latvia has begun unpicking a network of sinecures in nationalised industries .
But overdue reforms such as simplifying local government in Estonia are still on hold .
Yet compared with the polarised politics and debt - soaked economy of Hungary , the Baltics ' outlook is not bad .
None of the three is much exposed to the international financial markets .
Their stocks , bonds and currencies are thinly traded .
Most of their external debt is owed by local bank branches of Swedish parents .
Bits of those loan books have soured , particularly in property and construction .
But other parts are still sound .
So long as the Scandinavian banks stand by their investments , the Baltics should be all right .
Public protests have been muted and peaceful except for two bust - ups in Lithuania and Latvia .
Estonia 's politics look the most solid , with a well - regarded coalition government .
Latvia 's government , in office for just a month , is more broadly based than its predecessor and has shed some incompetent figures .
Lithuania faces a presidential election in which the front - runner is the EU budget commissioner , Dalia Grybauskaite .
Her financial skills may soon be tested , since after the election Lithuania may well turn to the IMF for help .
APRIL 13 -- Meet John Scott Kincaid and Christopher Ray Fitzgerald .
The Texas men were arrested this morning after they allegedly stuck up an adult video store and made off with 50 pornographic movies .
According to police , Kincaid , 21 , and Fitzgerald , 20 , were nabbed shortly after the 12:20 AM robbery of Adult Video and DVD in Kilgore .
After their vehicle was pulled over , officers recovered the 50 X - rated films , along with a Ruger automatic handgun , and a face mask , according to a Kilgore Police Department press release .
Kincaid ( top ) and Fitzgerald are pictured in mug shots snapped this morning at the Kilgore City Jail , where they were each booked on a felony aggravated robbery count .
The men are suspects in two armed robberies last week , one of which occurred at the same video store robbed today .

Sure , the short commute from bedroom to basement ca n’t be beat in terms of reducing your carbon slipper print .
And who does n’t want to watch reruns of The Office on their own living room sofa during the lunch hour ?
Heck , you can watch the show naked and no one would complain .
Those insulting corporate performance reviews are a thing of the past , baby .
When you ’re working at home , anything goes …or does it ?
Well , it ’s clear there are lots of pitfalls .
Just Google “ pitfalls for working from home ” and take a memo .
Some people cite as negatives the inability to separate homework from paid work , a painful feeling of isolation , and too many snack breaks allowed by the boss , a.k.a.
EMOTIONAL EATER , YOU .
But I like to accentuate the positives : saving rent and earning a tax deduction , total freedom from middle managerial scrutiny , and the gift that keeps on giving – taking adorable pets to work .
My pug , Smokey , says , “ Hi . ” He ’s waving .
Can you see him ?
These positives are important .
Gloomy economists predict our jobless rate , now at 8.5 % , will rise to 10 percent by the second half of this year , meaning those who ca n’t find new jobs will likely be setting up a spare bedroom with computer stations , a fax , phone , and perhaps , mini-bar .
If you ’ve failed landing a job hitting the pavement , the alternative is to surf for something on the home turf .
More of our friends will be in that spot as their job losses outlast their unemployment benefits .
Here are 10 inspired tips on making it work from someone who is managing a home - based writing career and getting out of her pajamas at least four out of five work days a week .
Get Dressed in the Morning and Go to Work
Consider yourself a professional once the lunches are packed and the children are off to school ( if you have kids ) .
Make your bed , brush your hair , eat a good breakfast , then grab your mug of coffee or tea and put yourself in work mode .
It does n’t matter if you are telemarketing , writing the great American novel or creating a new website from your house .
Put on your face , slip into those pants , and get to work on time .
Let the Sunshine In
Location is important in real estate and in setting up a home office that you will use effectively .
The more natural light , the better , as it saves on energy and lifts your mood .
According to home office feng shui experts , if your body does n’t get enough natural light , you will not enjoy working no matter how much you love your job .
They also suggest bringing in a couple of air - purifying plants into your work space to up your blood oxygen .
My recent post on this plant subject introduced research showing that plants also increase human productivity .
Also , as a designer , I urge you to decorate your sunny spot in a pleasant way that makes you feel blissful when you sit down to work .
Hit me up for office design tips , any time .
Stay out of the Fridge !
You did n’t have a fridge and pantry stocked with snacks at your old job , so why give your self total access to them now ?
If you do , you will pack on the pounds while you work at home , which will just make you frustrated and unhealthy .
Eat a good breakfast and give yourself a snack and lunch break .
You can cut up healthy snacks to keep by the computer ( chopped veggies , raw almonds , fresh fruit ) .
Otherwise , you might resort to stress eating .
Also , postpone the happy hour to the happy hour .
Take Stretch and Stray Breaks
You ca n’t sit at the computer or phone all day without moving your body and expect to stay healthy and in good shape .
You have to stand up and stretch your neck , arms and back .
And even take a break to walk the dog or mail some letters in the neighborhood .
If you can keep to your schedule , walk down to a nearby cafe for lunch once a week .
Or walk with a friend who also is working from home or at a nearby office .
It burns fat , relieves stress and it ’s free !
Schedule Your Work Goals for Each Day
Today I will finish a post and write two more .
Plan ahead what you want to accomplish and use the extra time to brainstorm , pay bills , do tax work , download some photos on your Facebook page .
There ’s more time to play when you have finished your work .
It is very rewarding to get the job done and lightens your load considerably .
Also , if you can write down your targeted goals , it will spare you the agony of tossing and turning at night as you plant it all out in your head .
Type it on your home page , or jot it down in a good recycled daily planner , like the ones from At a Glance .
Investigate Your Home Office Tax Benefits
Taxpayers who use part of their residence for work purposes can take a home office deduction if they meet requirements such as using their place exclusively for business or meeting regularly at the house with clients or patients .
The IRS says expenses that you can deduct include the business portion of real estate taxes , mortgage interest , rent , utilities , insurance , painting , repairs and depreciation .
Check with the IRS for more information and contact your accountant to follow through .
We all need those breaks !
Do House Work Before and After Your Work Hours
Sure , it ’s okay to multi-task , but there are so many distractions in a home , you could get pulled away from your work and never meet deadlines or stick to a schedule .
I remember my mom scolding me : “ You ’re down in that basement working , why are n’t you washing the clothes at the same time ? ”
The truth is , sometimes I do toss in a load while I work , but it ’s not on my mind .
Also , it saves more energy to do the wash at night when fewer homes are running their machines .
I would never write if I started cleaning up the kids ’ rooms ( a never - ending battle ) or cleaning up the kitchen .
I do what I can before I sit down to work and finish once I ’m done .
Hang Up the Closed Sign When Your Family Gets Home
Just as it can be challenging to stay on task at home , it also can be hard to know when the work day is done .
You can always run back to the computer to polish your work or send another email , but it ’s important to give your children your time and attention when they come home after school and have done their homework .
There ’s really a small window of time that you can connect with them before bed , and people are right when they say it flies by fast .
Make dinner together , get them to set the table , eat together as a family , assist with homework if they need it .
Share quality time together tucking them into bed .
You can always go back to the computer once they are asleep , if necessary .
Do n’t forget , your spouse needs you , too .
If you do n’t cultivate your relationship now , what will you have once the kids leave the nest ?
Will the computer keep you warm at night ?
Stay Connected with Your Colleagues and Friends
The adjustment to a home work environment can be tough if you ’re a social animal used to chatting it up by the water cooler or doing coffee runs for your pals .
There ’s no reason to lose your connection just because your digs have changed .
Share your work with friends in a medium that is comfortable for you .
I often post my stories and successes on Facebook .
I ’m in a book club with other mothers that meets once a month .
I like to attend design events , from showcase houses to lectures at the design center .
And I get out and meet people after filing my work .
There ’s no reason to feel isolated just because you work at home .
Let Your Hair Down Once a Week
I have to say that at least once a week , I stay in my pajamas until it ’s time to pick the kids up from school .
At our school , people talk if you show up in a robe and fluffy slippers .
Snobs !
Meantime , what an advantage to working at home .
I never got to work in a nightgown at CNN .
Ted would n’t have minded but those middle manager types were so unimaginative .
Staying in the flannels reminds us of those days when we stayed home from school and our moms gave us soup and let us watch TV in bed .
That ’s exactly how I perform all day on my lounge day , typing away at the computer in my PJ ’s , having a nice lunch on the sofa , sitting on the glider in the sun outside with Smoky during a coffee break and listening to the wind chimes – miles and miles away from road rage , carpet fumes and the fluorescent lights of the work world .
I get just as much work done , if not more , but without being dressed to impress and stuck in someone ’s else ’s idea of an efficient work environment .

From the Upcoming ueue , submitted by pax .
Bright lightsthat suddenly streak across the night sky with an accompanying boom tend to elicita flurry of phone calls to local police departments .
These rareevents are n't typically wayward missiles , or satellitedebris ( as was thought when one such streak recently lit up the skies over Texas ) , or alien invasions .
But they do come from outer space .
Scientistsaptly call the objects fireballsbecause they are the brightest meteors , or " shooting stars , " thatfall to Earth .
A fireballas bright as the full moon raced across the Spanish skies on July 11 , 2008 , andwas tracked by the Spanish Fireball Network ( SPMN ) .
Researchers used thetracking data to trace the path of the comet backwards through the sky andspace ; they think the boulder may be a chunk of a comet that broke up nearly 90 years ago .
Their conclusions are detailed in the Feb. 11 online issue of thejournal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
It 'spossible that chunks of the fireball made it to the ground and are waiting tobe picked up , the researchers said , which would give scientists a rare glimpseinto the heartof a comet .
Meteorsand fireballs
Earth and the other planets of the solar system are under constant bombardment fromparticles that range in size from a sand grain to a boulder and arecollectively knownas meteoroids .
Many meteoroids are the detritus left over from collisionsof asteroids and comets and impacts to other planets .
If ameteoroid enters Earth 's atmosphere , it starts to burn up , forming a brightstreak in the sky , called a meteor .
Meteors can come from asteroid or cometfragments .
If that meteor is brighter than any of the planets in the sky , it isdeemed a fireball ( also called a bolide ) .
A blazingbolide can also create a sonic boom that can be heard up to 30 miles away ?
these explosive noises were heard over Kentucky on Friday , Feb. 13 , and over Texas on Sunday , Feb. 15 , causing a number of startled citizens to call local lawenforcement .
Initialspeculation that these streaks of light and accompanying boom were caused bydebris from the Feb. 10 collision of two satellites was later refuted byastronomers , who said it was likely a meteor .
Preston Starr , theobservatory manager at the University of North Texas , told the Associated Pressthat the object would have been about the size of a truck and that somewherebetween eight and 10 such objects burn up in the atmosphere every year .
Spanishsighting
The bolidethat shot across the Spanish skies in July was also seen in Portugal and southern France .
At maximumintensity , it was 150 times brighter than the full moon .
It was first picked upby the SPMN above Bejar in the western part of Spain at a height of about 61 miles ( 98 kilometers ) and disappeared from view at about 13 miles ( 21 kilometers ) above the surface of the Earth .
Aprofessional photographer also snapped a picture of the streak from the northof Madrid .
From theseimages , astronomers Josep Trigo - Rodr?guez of the Institute of Space Studies , CSIC - IEEC in Spain , Jos ?
Madiedo of the University of Huelva - CIECEM in Spain and Iwan Williams of the University of London were able to deduce the trajectory andproperties of the incoming fireball .
Their workwas funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation , the NationalInstitute of Aerospatial Technique , and the Junta de Andaluc ?a .
The teamthinks the bolide was a dense object , about 3 feet ( about 1 meter ) across witha mass of about 4,000 pounds ( 1.8 tonnes ) .
This would be like squeezing anadult elephant down to the size of an armchair .
The rockwould have been big enough that chunks of it may have survived the fierypassage through the atmosphere and hit the ground as meteorites .
Finding thesepieces would be a boon to science if they are , as the team suspects , remnantsof a comet breakup .
The bolidetraveled an unusual orbit around the sun , as determined by the astronomers , following a path that took it from beyond the orbit of Jupiter to the vicinityof Earth .
This orbit is similar to that of a cloud of dust particles known asthe Omicron Draconids , which on rare occasions produce a minor meteor shower onEarth .
Thiscollection of meteoroids is thought to originate from the breakup of CometC / 1919 Q2 Metcalf in 1920 .
It has beenproposed that comets consist of large boulders glued together by a mixture ofsmaller particles and ice .
If the nucleus of the comet disintegrates , the bouldersare set loose in space .
Finding chunks of the Bejar bolide could help confirmthis theory .
" Handlingpieces of comet would fulfill the long - held ambitions of scientists ?
it wouldeffectively give us a look inside some of the most enigmatic objects in thesolar system , " Trigo - Rodr ? guez said .
I wrote back in 2007 how Hollywood was outsourcing legal research , legal analysis , legal opinion and legal contract drafting services to India to lower the high costs of litigation .
One of the cases I cited was how the India arm of UK Channel 4 ’s American counsel was outsourcing to rebut a defamation action against Da Ali G Show .
Now those Indian lawyers have won the high - profile libel litigation in Los Angeles .
The lawsuit was filed against Sacha Baron Cohen , Channel 4 Television network , and HBO ’s Da Ali G Show .
Seems a woman ( aka “ Jane Doe ” ) who once knew the comedian claimed that Cohen , while playing the role of “ Ali G ” , libeled her by name during a spoof interview with historian Gore Vidal by claiming to have had sex with her .
I ’m told this was the first high profile U.S. media litigation in which the legal research and first drafts of the motion papers for the defense were completed entirely off - shore by Indian attorneys at a legal outsourcing company supervised by New York - based SmithDehn LLP .
Today ’s LA Superior Court victory on the Ali G motion threw out the lawsuit .
“ No reasonable person could consider the statements made by Ali G on the program to be factual .
To the contrary , it is obvious that the Ali G character is absurd , and all his statements are gibberish and intended as comedy …
Altogether , the program is obviously a spoof of a serious interview program .
No reasonable person could think otherwise . ”
As one of the defense lawyers noted : “ As so often happens in cases like this , the ‘ chilling effect ’ of the threat of substantial damages and significant legal costs , forces defendants to settle with plaintiffs who have no justifiable claim .
However combining the skills and expertise of U.S. attorneys with U.S. law - trained Indian attorneys has proved to be an innovative and cost - effective way to fight and win the suit . ”
We got our first look at the game last week , but today , we 've got a lot more information on Rebellion 's upcoming reboot of their classic Aliens vs Predator shooter .
Most exciting is that the Predator class is now no longer just a Marine that can turn invisible .
More in line with the species ' abilities in the movies , you can now jump and glide between ledges and branches .

The aliens have also been tweaked , and will now move more slowly than they did the original PC game ( which is fine by me , as they were too fast in that game ) .
They will , however , retain the ability to scale any surface , meaning you can still run all over the walls and roof .
The game is also being pitched squarely at an adult audience .

Once off , the head will continue to blink and gasp , and ... well , yes , you get the idea .

The Eiffel Tower is the world 's most photographed landmark ... but London 's Trafalgar Square comes a close second
Showing off your holiday snaps is part and parcel of a trip away .
Now scientists have revealed the world 's most photographed landmarks by studying millions of images using a supercomputer .
Experts at Cornell University analysed nearly 35 million images posted by 300,000 users on the photo - sharing website Flickr .
The most photographed landmark in the top 20 most photographed European cities .
London 's Trafalgar Square , Manchester 's Exchange Square , Bath Abbey and Edinburgh Castle were included
They discovered that while the Eiffel Tower in Paris was the most popular landmark , four of the top seven were in London .
Trafalgar Square , the Tate Modern and Big Ben managed second , third and fourth place , while the London Eye was sixth .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most photographed landmarks according to Flickr :
1. Eiffel Tower , Paris
2. Trafalgar Square , London
3. The Tate Modern , London
4. Big Ben , London
5. Notre Dame , Paris
6. London Eye , London
7. Empire State Building , New York
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notre Dame in Paris was awarded fifth while the Empire States Building in New York was seventh .
Britain 's capital city was the second most photographed city in the world after New York .
San Francisco and Paris were third and fourth .
The researchers developed their technique using a supercomputer that crawled through a huge selection of photographs over a six - month period .
The most popular 20 landmarks in the British Isles
The image database was created after the computer picked a photographer on Flickr at random .
It downloaded any photos that were geotagged along with textual tags and geolocation .
The photographers contact list was scanned and the process started again .
Popular landmarks were chosen by how many different photographers snapped them rather than by the total number of images in the database .
' It raises the intriguing possibility of an online travel guidebook that could automatically identify the best sites to visit on a vacation , as judged by the collective wisdom of the world 's photographers , ' a university spokesman said .

10 most photographed cities according to Flickr :
1 : New York , U.S
2 : London , England
3 : San Francisco , U.S
4 : Paris , France
5 : Los Angeles , U.S
6 : Chicago , U.S
7 : Washington , U.S
8 : Seattle , U.S
9 : Rome , Italy
10 : Amsterdam , Holland
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They were able to breakdown the results to a regional level , revealing the 20 most popular photo stops in the British Isles .
The research , which was presented at the International World Wide Web Conference in Madrid , provides a new and practical way to automatically organize , label and summarize large - scale collections of digital images .
Director of the Cornell Centre for Advanced Computing David Lifka said : ' As the creation of digital data accelerates , supercomputers and high - performance storage systems will be essential in order to quickly store , archive , preserve and retrieve large - scale data collections . '
Children with attention deficit problems make bigger academic gains if they are taking stimulant medications compared to similar kids who are n’t receiving drug therapy , a new study shows .
The findings , from a five year study of nearly 600 schoolchildren from across the country , are believed to be the first to offer an objective measure of the effect of drug therapy on a child ’s long - term academic achievement .
Earlier studies have shown that children who receive medication for attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder behave better in class and can complete more homework .
But it has n’t been clear whether treating A.D.H.D. results in any measurable improvement in long - term academic gains .
The latest study , conducted by researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , and published in Pediatrics , tracked standardized math and reading scores among a nationally - representative sample of 600 children from kindergarten through the fifth grade , all of whom had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D.
The researchers compared the scores of the students who were on A.D.H.D. medications with similarly diagnosed students who were n’t receiving drug therapy .
In the study , taking A.D.H.D. medication was associated with gains in math scores that equated to about a fifth of a school year in extra learning .
In reading , the gains were even greater , equating to progress of about a third of a school year .
“ I think the findings are important because this is the first time that we ’ve had objective educational performance measures , to look at whether kids who are taking medications for A.D.H.D. compared to kids who are not , that actually show that they are doing better , ” said Richard Scheffler , distinguished professor of health economics and public policy at the University of California , Berkeley ’s School of Public Health .
“ There are 4.4 million A.D.H.D. kids , so this is a huge improvement quantitatively in their school year . ”
While the study is not a randomized trial measuring the effect of drug treatment versus a placebo , the researchers said the association between medication and academic gains is strong .
The study controlled for numerous variables , such as parent ’s educational level and other changes that could have influenced test scores .
However , A.D.H.D. medication could be a proxy for some other factor influencing a child ’s academic performance .
For instance , it may be that children whose parents seek out drug therapy for A.D.H.D. are more accepting of the condition and more involved in helping the child achieve at school .
The researchers also noted that medication may not be an option for some children who experience side effects like loss of appetite or sleep problems .
A broad approach that includes doctors , parents and school officials is needed to help kids with A.D.H.D. close the educational gap , they said .
“ Medications may not be right for every kid , ” Dr. Scheffler said .
“ But you need to treat A.D.H.D. as a team sport that includes heavy parent involvement , particularly at young ages , and school involvement with individual tutoring and organizational help . ”
AP : GOP predicts doomsday if Obama budget passes Associated Press
Published : Monday March 23 , 2009
Print This Email This Congressional Republicans on Sunday predicted a doomsday scenario of crushing debt and eventual federal bankruptcy if President Barack Obama 's massive spending blueprint wins passage .
But a White House adviser dismissed the negative assessments , saying she is '' incredibly confident ' ' that the president 's policies will '' do the job ' ' for the economy .
White House Council of Economic Advisers chairwoman Christina Romer insisted that the nation 's flailing economy will be rebounding by 2010 .

Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
There 's nothing majorly wrong with Apple 's MobileMe service .
All of its subsidiary pieces and parts — the email , the syncable calendar and contacts , the photo gallery , the online storage — do fine .
So why does n't it make sense ?
Advertisement
Apple has every right to be proud of the fact that it got its act together , and everything that was all herky jerky back in July 2008 , when the $ 99 - per- year MobileMe launched , is now working as billed .
The push email shows up immediately , if you use your me.com account .
Ditto for the push contacts and the push calendar , though you can't use web cals like Google 's or Yahoo's if you want to be super synced .
The gallery works great ; as a dad I upload tons of pictures and videos to the MobileMe gallery right from iPhoto , but with iPhoto ' 09 , I can upload them to my free accounts at Facebook and Flickr too .
There 's even iDisk , a smoothly integrated 20 GB cloud storage service , which now has a public drop box for file sharing , just like YouSendIt .
And if you have a time capsule NAS / wireless access point , you can remotely access your disk using mobile me , as well as use back to my mac remote desktop control .
( The service tracks the dynamic IPs of all your machines , so each machine can always keep track of the others . )

Maybe you 're catching on to the real problem here .
It 's not just that you " free " junkies who read Gizmodo would n't be caught dead paying $ 100 for anything but a 50 " flat - panel TV .
It 's that the service itself is made up of many pieces you already have .
This presents a complicated economic argument :
If you already have an online photo gallery and a free or company - given email account that you like and use , why would you pay to have those things twice , just to get contact syncing for your phone and a decent online storage system .
Would n't you go find a less elegant online storage system for a lot less money , and content yourself with syncing your phone to your computer 's address book every couple of days ?
I said that the service worked as billed , and it does .
My favorite component is the contact syncing , because anytime I add anything on my phone or my computer , the two are instantly in sync .
But I 'd achieve the same result , with less magic , if I remembered to sync my iPhone every so often .
I did have one problem with contact syncing , but I bring it up mainly to tell how easy it was to fix : I had imported a bunch of contacts from email accounts online , and some contacts got corrupted along the way .
I had 18 contacts , out of 250 or so , that would n't sync from Mac to iPhone or MobileMe web portal .
The fix was easy :
Go in and change something about the entry , like adding the person 's company name or a fax line , even their kid 's name .
As soon as you tweak the entry , boom , it gets uploaded .
Most other exchanges in MobileMe have been without incident , even exporting my Google Cals in a big bunch , then manually importing them into iCal from time to time .
But the very fact that I use MobileMe for some services and free web apps for others , and the fact that I am in many cases the one making sure everything talks to everything else , underscores the point I 'm making , that MobileMe is a confederacy of programs that have nothing to do with each other .

In the end , even after it 's working well , it 's difficult to recommend for two reasons :
The money , which I 've sufficiently covered above — a hefty sum when contrasted to free web - based simulacra — and the compatibility , not with your device " ecosystem " but with everybody else .
Who uses iCal or Me.com mail ?
Google wins those battles for sure .
Even though I swear by MobileMe Gallery , most people I know prefer Flickr , or just Facebook .
There 's a solution .
Apple could offer some things for free , and some things cheap .
Just bought iLife '09 or a new Mac ?
Guess what , you get to upload your photos to a MobileMe Gallery .
Buying an iPhone ?
Syncing your contacts and calendar is a $ 2 / month add - on .
I think iDisk could easily be a success at $ 25 / year , all by itself , as long capacity goes up each year automatically based on capability .
It 's not like these component parts have anything to do with one another anyway .

My mother - in - law recently switched to a Mac after eons on a PC .
I looked over her shoulder as she was placing the order , and when we came to the part where she could get MobileMe at the low introductory price of $ 70 , she asked me if she should .
I thought for a second , and realized the answer was no .
I may keep her grandkid 's pics on MobileMe Gallery , but she 's perfectly happy with Picasa , and there 's a beta version of that for the Mac out now .
For free .

In what must rank as the mother of all unintended consequences , and in a finding certain to have effects on international policy , NASA scientists have found that a decrease in airborne sulfates–dirty smokestack particles caused by burning coal and regulated by the Clean Air Act since the 1970s to prevent acid rain and air pollution–may account for as much as 45 % of Arctic warming .
Dr. Drew Shindell of NASA ’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies reports :
“ Sulfates , which come primarily from the burning of coal and oil , scatter incoming solar radiation and have a net cooling effect on climate .
Over the past three decades , the United States and European countries have passed a series of laws that have reduced sulfate emissions by 50 % .
While improving air quality and aiding public health , the result has been less atmospheric cooling from sulfates . ”
Besides being catnip for climate - deniers everywhere , these findings may be cause for a real rethinking of climate - change policies .
Dr. Shindell works for Dr. James Hansen , a star of Al Gore ’s Inconvenient Truth and the world ’s leading voice making the demon Carbon Dioxide synonymous with all of society ’s ills .
But Dr. Shindell is recommending that focusing on the effects of aerosols rather than carbon dioxide emissions may be the more effective strategy against climate change and especially the melting of arctic ice .
Aerosols –sources range from dirty coal plants to hairspray–include both the cooling sulfates and the ultra - warming , sunlight - absorbing black soot .
They appear and dissolve in the atmosphere much more quickly than greenhouse gases , which hang around for centuries , making them an effective target for short - term “ geoengineering ” type interventions .

The Institute for Politics , Democracy , and the Internet is giving out its Golden Dot awards today and tomorrow at the Politics Online Conference .
The awards recognize the best intersections between politics and technology .
Barack Obama and Ron Paul were named the Democratic and Republican online politicians of the year .
Barack Obama ’s was voted the best candidate website , while Ron Paul ’s was voted the most networked Republican campaign , and Obama ’s was its Democratic counterpart .
Obama also won for awards for best online campaign and the best online get out the vote campaign .
Obama ’s Yes We Can video won for the best supporter created web video , and Obama won the Democrat Technology Impact Moment of the year for his announcement of Sen.
Joe Biden as his running mate .
The big Republican winner was the Prop 8 movement , which was voted the Republican Technology Moment of the Year , and the Best Online Advertising Campaign .
Prop 8 was also named the Republican Outstanding State and Local Campaign .
2008 Republican nominee John McCain won the award for Best Campaign Video for “ The One . ” The only Sarah Palin related award was for Best Online Game for Dress Like a Palin .

There were no upsets in these awards .
Obama and Paul dominated the Internet in 2008 .
Obama ’s campaign website was not like anything we have seen before .
It was the perfect mix of online activism and information resource .
Ron Paul has turned social networking into an art form .
The GOP may think that they are catching up through Facebook and Twitter , but their efforts on those two platforms are still light years behind the way Rep .
Paul organized .
McCain ’s campaign website suffered for the same reason that Hillary Clinton ’s did .
They both were fine until the money ran out .
One of the areas that each of these campaigns cut back was their websites .
It was noticeable for Clinton after Super Tuesday , and McCain ’s website started off with bells and whistles , but was never updated enough .
People forget that when Hillary Clinton had the fundraising advantage , she was churning out net videos on her site , but Obama was better at using his site as a community and an organizing tool .
I visited these sites on a daily basis , so I have my own opinions on the subject .
In general Democrats are ahead of Republicans in this area .
Republicans , except for Ron Paul , do n’t get that their sites should be used , not only for fund raising , but for information and networking .
Supporters go to these sites to get news , and meet other people who share their views .
Too many Republicans still are n’t using their sites to their full potential .
The website should be a destination point for multiple reasons .
Republican websites also tend to be less attractive , and not as easy to navigate , which to me points towards the candidates ’ lack of emphasis on the web .
I think that Obama and Paul have shown what the Internet can do , so I expect that candidates from both parties will become much more aggressive with their Internet strategies .

New cooling method dissipates heat by overcoming low rate of thermal coupling between carbon nanotubes and substrate
Our modern age has become accustomed to regular improvements in information technology , says Slava Rotkin , but these advances do not come without a cost .
Take the laptop , for example .
Its components , especially its billions of semiconductor electronic circuits , are growing ever tinier while the instrument 's power and capacity increase .
But heat generated by electric current can cause the circuits to melt and the laptop hardware to fail .
Indeed , says Rotkin , an assistant professor of physics , a laptop in use can generate heat faster than an everyday hotplate and almost as fast as a small nuclear reactor .
Developing better methods to dissipate this heat has been listed as a " grand challenge " for modern electronics by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ( ITRS ) , a consortium of semiconductor manufacturers .
Rotkin and his colleagues at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center and at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg , Russia , have developed a heat - dissipation method that cools carbon nanotube electronics by utilizing nonconventional radiation in a " near - field zone " just above the substrate , or surface , on which the nanotubes rest .
The new cooling method requires that the nanotubes ' substrate be composed of a polar material such as silicon - dioxide ( SiO2 ) , says Rotkin .
The method channels excess heat from the nanotubes into the substrate which , being much larger , can be more effectively cooled by the vents that push cool air through laptops .
" Other methods of heat dissipation do not succeed at discharging heat from within the channel of the nanotube or nanowire , " says Rotkin .
" Our method enables the heat to leave the channel and move to the substrate , while also scattering the hot electrons .
This constitutes a novel cooling mechanism without any moving parts or cooling agents . "
Rotkin and his colleagues described the results of their research in an article published in March in Nano Letters , one of the premier international journals in the field of nanotechnology .
The article , titled " An Essential Mechanism of Heat Dissipation in Carbon Nanotube Electronics , " was coauthored by Rotkin , who is a primary faculty member with Lehigh 's Center for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology ; Vasilii Perebeinos and Phaedon Avouris of IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center ; and Alexey G. Petrov of the Ioffe Institute .
Rotkin and his colleagues have been studying the heat - dissipation problems associated with carbon nanotube electronics for three years .
Their current article is the fifth coauthored by Rotkin that Nano Letters has published in the past year .
Because the nanotubes and substrate are made of heterogeneous materials , says Rotkin , their rate of thermal coupling , or heat release , is relatively low , similar to that of dry wood .
This makes it difficult to dissipate heat from the nanotubes to the substrate through classical thermal conduction .
Rotkin and his colleagues instead utilize what they call surface phonon - polariton ( SPP ) thermal coupling by exploiting the high level of electron scattering that occurs in non-suspended carbon nanotube transistors .
A wave called a surface polariton is caused by this electron scattering , says Rotkin .
This polariton is particularly strong in the near field zone just above the substrate on which the carbon nanotubes rest .
" If you put a graphene monolayer , or layer of carbon nanotubes , in a near field zone , " says Rotkin , " this enables the hot electrons to be scattered by the surface polariton and to give out energy to the substrate .
Heat is dissipated into the substrate as radiation tunnels from the nanotube through the near field zone to the substrate .
" If you move the nanotube away from the substrate , the near field tunneling ceases and the mechanism is absent .
" We achieve all of our coupling through surface polariton scattering because of a large enhancement of the electrical field of the polariton in the near field zone .
" Most semiconductor devices fabricated now have the nanotube or nanowire placed directly on a silica substrate , which is polar .
With this mechanism , if the substrate is polar and if there 's a small van der Waals gap , our new near - field channel totally dominates thermal coupling . "
A change advocated by ITRS - from a silica substrate to one made of dielectric materials with a higher dielectric constant - would give the substrate material an even stronger surface polariton , says Rotkin .
Rotkin's group used microscopic quantum models to calculate heat dissipation as a function of electric field , doping and temperature .
" Most of the energy losses are dissipated directly into the polar substrate and do not contribute to the field - effect transistor temperature rise , " the group wrote in the most recent Nano Letters article .
" We have shown that SPP thermal coupling increases the effective thermal conductance over the interface between nanotube and [ polar substrate ] by an order of magnitude . "
Rotkin will summarize his research in an invited talk titled " Thermal Moore 's law and near - field thermal conductance in carbon - based electronics " to be presented in August at SPIE 's Optics +
Photonics conference in San Diego , Calif .
SPIE is an international organization devoted to light - based research .

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - Sweden will allow homosexuals to legally marry from May this year after parliament on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the move .
The change in the law , which currently allows gay couples to register unions but not formal marriage , comes into force on May 1 this year under the timetable set out in the bill .
Scandinavian countries , known for their liberal attitudes toward gays and lesbians , were among the first countries in Europe to grant same - sex partners the same rights as married couples .
Sweden gave same - sex couples the right to form a union via registered partnerships in the mid-nineties and made it legal for them to adopt in 2002 .
The passage of the bill was widely expected and the final tally was 261 votes in favor of the bill and 22 opposed .
“ The decision means that gender no longer has an impact on the ability to marry and that the law on registered partnership is repealed , ” the government said on its website .
The Christian Democrats , part of the four - party coalition government , refused to back the bill .
The new legislation eliminates legal distinctions between heterosexual and homosexual spouses , but does not force dissenting clergy to wed gay couples .
The Swedish Lutheran church , which split from the state in 2000 , has said it was open to celebrating and registering same - sex unions , although it wanted to reserve the term matrimony for heterosexual marriages .
One of Ireland 's most senior clergyman admitted yesterday that an imminent report on the sexual abuse of children by clergy will shock the country and reveal that thousands of children were abused by priests .
In an unprecedented homily for Holy Thursday , Diarmuid Martin , the Archbishop of Dublin , warned that the depth of the abuse " will shock us all " .
The report from the commission on child sexual abuse will be published in May , and according to Martin it will throw up challenges to the Catholic church in Ireland it has never experienced before .
At a mass in Dublin 's Pro-Cathedral , Martin said : " It is likely that thousands of children or young people across Ireland were abused by priests in the period under investigation and the horror of that abuse was not recognised for what it is .
The report will make each of us and the entire church in Dublin a humbler church . "
Organisations representing the victims of clerical sex abuse in Ireland last night welcomed the archbishop 's words .
Martin is seen as a reformer sent in by the Vatican to clean up a church rocked by a decade and a half of scandals .
One of the most notorious , in the mid-1990s , involved priest Brendan Smyth and indirectly led to the collapse of Albert Reynolds 's government .
Accusations that the Irish attorney general 's office blocked moves to extradite Smyth to Northern Ireland led to the Irish Labour party pulling out of coalition with Reynolds 's Fianna Fáil and the government falling .
" We have no time to waste , " Martin said yesterday .
" There is a dramatic and growing rift between the church and our younger generations , and the blame does not lie principally with young people .
Our young people are generous and idealistic but such generosity and idealism does not seem to find a home in the church . "
He also illuminated the recruitment crisis in Irish Catholicism , in a country that once used to export its priests and nuns all over the world .
" In the [ Dublin ] diocese there are 10 times more priests over 70 than under 40 .
In just a few years we will only have a little over 200 diocesan priests to minister to our almost 200 parishes . "
Maeve Lewis , executive director of the One in Four organisation , which campaigns for the victims of clerical sex abuse , welcomed Martin 's remarks , saying he " has been at the forefront of addressing the issue of sexual abuse within the Catholic church .
He has drawn up models for child care and protection in Dublin that can be followed anywhere in the world .
" From the viewpoint of those who have experienced clerical sexual violence I think his statement and his recognition of their abuse will probably be of some comfort .
For the first time , a member of the hierarchy has accepted the depth of the abuse that took place over the years " .
The following is an interview I did in early February with a student from Eastern Kentucky University who was looking for an alternative , common sense viewpoint for the average person for approaching personal finance issues during the Depression , amid all the pro-stock market propaganda .
It is not an investment advice article or a survivalist ’s guide .
Is this a good time to start investing ?
There are two good answers to that : yes and no .
It all depends on your current financial firepower , your age , level of financial sophistication , retirement plans , and options for a 401k , just to name a few factors .
Most of us need a return on our savings .
Sticking money under the mattress will not put your money to work for you .
Traditional , bull - era investing advice looks at your return timeline — if it ’s short because you have n’t saved , more aggressive investments with higher returns are recommended .
But if your timeline is long , less risky investments are the standard advice .
However , this mainstream view is completely dependent upon a reliable bull market .
The standard line is that “ the market will always go up . ”
Always .
Even with the current stock market collapse , the perma - bulls still do n’t have a clue .
They believe the market fallout is due to a “ lack of investor confidence ” or a “ bear - market raid . ”
The same went with housing — “ the price can onnly go up ” was the standard pronouncement .
The underlying assumption is that there are no rogue factors driving up asset prices and therefore the high prices of the boom period were true market prices that reflected reality .
To them , the boom was n’t an aberration — the current bust , or correction , is an anomaly .
People forget that Japan ’s Nikkei , the index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange , hit an all - time high of almost 39,000 in 1989 , and it has trended steadily downward since that time .
The index value is below 8,000 today .
These assumptions that are representative of the mainstream are not supported by the fundamentals of economics .
Interventionist central planning on the part of government centers on manipulating the money supply , thus distorting asset prices and the financial markets .
So when a house sold for $ 500 k during the housing bubble , and gets appraised for $ 270 k two years later , the market , in spite of the countless interventions , has moved to a correction mode .
That ’s because inflated asset pricing is unsustainable in the long run .
So with the current market collapse and the incredible uncertainty ahead of us , it ’s a tough time to be investing your money .
Throwing money at the stock market is like wearing a blindfold and throwing darts at a board twelve feet away .
You may hit or you may miss .
A hit does n’t mean you can make the next speculation work in your favor .
In fact , the uncertainty is even greater now because we do not know the precise direction that government intervention is going to take .
More intervention will further skew market prices , causing people to make erroneous decisions based on the price distortion that will be the result .
The trillion - dollar stimulus package will cascade throughout the economy , benefiting some and robbing others at different points in time , and thus we will see a major redistributionist effect and the impact of what and where will be impossible to accurately predict .
For those who tend toward Austrian Economics , the stock market holds little hope for romance .
There are the more benign investments , such as insured deposits , and there are the commodities that are favored by Austrians — gold , silver , platinum , palladium , gold coins , etc .
There ’s one major point to think about , however , in terms of " investing . "
I cannot help but quote from this excellent 2005 article that appeared on LewRockwell.com , written by Eric Englund .
Mr. Englund , who is often my writing partner , stresses that there is a clear difference between an investor and a speculator , and that is the financial literacy factor .
To be an investor requires an understanding of the underlying value of the equities you are purchasing .
Accordingly , thorough analysis of a company ’s financial statements is an essential step in the investment process .
If you cannot read and understand the company ’s financial statements , how can you be an " investor ? "
The answer is that you ’re not an investor — you are throwing a dart .
People throwing darts at equities on a board in the back of some barroom are not investing their money — they are speculating .
The investor , on the other hand , understands the balance sheet , the income statement , and the statement of cash flows , as well as the disclosures in the company ’s financial report .
Only through careful analysis of the aforementioned components , along with other insights regarding leverage , debt servicing , inventory turnover , working capital , etc. , can one make a reasoned analysis , thereby distinguishing himself as an investor as opposed to a speculative fool who hopes to get lucky .
People have been brainwashed with the promotion of a speculator society , and the boom years made things seem like a piece of cake because almost every move they made got some upside .
They all became financial geniuses overnight .
Wealth did n’t require long - term planning , as they were told — all it took was a few well - placed darts and the fortitude to ride the tide to stock - picker heaven .
But heaven only produced paper profits , hell is now here , and it has to be dealt with through prudence and patience .
Throw the darts away and start anew .
The question of financial illiteracy , then , is not a condemnation of individuals who cannot understand these matters , but rather it is simply a fact that makes him or her a speculator , not an investor .
So that begs the question : should financially illiterate people be speculating in stocks , right now , in the midst of all of this turmoil , uncertainty , and interventionist mania ?
Probably not .
Self - education is the key , and that should start with Benjamin Graham ’s Intelligent Investor .
Sure , it can be a very cumbersome and difficult process to learn all of this , so if that ’s not your bag I would think that throwing dice in the stock market is probably not your best bet either .
The alternative would be to pay someone to make those decisions for you .
Consult some professionals who hold your own philosophy and understand your particular needs .
Interview more than one prospect to determine if you are dealing with amateurs or pros .
On a different note , since this current crisis is a Depression and many people are in hock because of years of unchecked spending , an alternative to “ investing ” extra cash is to pay down debt .
Currently , debt is costing some people a lot more than they can earn on investments , so paying down debt may be the best option for them .
People need to get rid of revolving debt , car loans , and personal loans — anything that is crushing their cash flow and creating a monthly financial burden .
This includes the mortgage as well .
With the rapid downturn in housing prices , paying off principal is especially important .
401 k plans are also becoming a problem .
401 k accounts tend to offer few , if any , safe investing alternatives .
People use them because a company match is essentially free money .
But now , companies everywhere are canceling their match program , and everyone is losing ground on their 401 ks with negative returns .
So why keep throwing money into the 401k when you can put money to work paying down cumbersome debt ?
Should people be spending or saving ?
That deserves the standard tax question answer : it depends .
We ’re in a Depression : a crashing stock market ; the collapse of housing prices ; a foreclosure epidemic ; a tidal wave of unemployment ; massive bank bailouts and / or failures ; an unprecedented number of corporate — especially retail — bankruptcies ; and the disintegration ( and bailout ) of the domestic auto industry .
The federal government has quasi - controllership of many facets of the economy by way of the nationalization of the banking system and the bailouts of Wall Street and the domestic auto industry .
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve is pumping money into every nook and cranny of the economy and the Treasury has been granted extraordinary ( and unconstitutional ) powers to spend billions of taxpayer dollars without congressional oversight .
Still , it ’s ludicrous to say that no one should be spending and that saving is the only means of surviving a Depression .
In this Depression there are people who are hurt because of job loss , wage cut , unmanageable debt , foreclosure , or even the erosion of their investments and retirement plan .
Those are the people who need to save , and they need to be uncompromising about managing their budgets and cutting back all unnecessary spending .
Then there are those who still have their job , have little or no debt , and enjoy a healthy cash flow .
For those people , a Depression is a great time to buy .
The availability of bargains is very high right now , especially in retail , where business is hurting most .
Deals on automobiles right now are spectacular , including a 0 % interest rate for people with a solid credit history .
Someone who has a real need for a new car right now should buy it .
In fact , people should buy stuff they need if they can get a Depression deal .
They should be a little more conservative regarding all of the other tempting bargains that are not necessary for their survival , productivity , or overall well being .
Should people be trying to pay down debt ?
See question # 1 .
Should people be taking out new loans ?
People with good credit will get terrific interest rates , so if they need an important item and it ’s a Depression bargain , that ’s when they should get a loan .
People should borrow for a car if they need one .
Not everyone can save and pay cash for a car .
If you can , great , but that ’s unrealistic for most people in the current times .
Free money — 0 % rates — is available for people with great credit scores .
People should be more wary of buying a house .
No one should be moving to a new house unless they have to — the days of buying a bigger and better house every few years are over .
People who move for a job should think about renting in the short term .
The mass of foreclosures has made housing rentals attractive .
First - time buyers may get what seems like a bargain compared to bubble prices , but most likely the house will be worth less after they buy it , and perhaps well into the future .
Student loans of massive amounts are going to go away , too .
People cannot expect to borrow heavily in the present and burden their future with excessive debt payments , especially since the job market for entry - level workers with huge loans to pay back will be extremely competitive .
As far as taking out loans for furniture , electronics , trips , and assorted other " goodies , " it ’s not only unwise but it may be impossible for those people who have abused this in the past and now suffer the consequences of big debt piles and / or injured credit scores .
The " easy credit " days of want - and - ye - shall - have are past us , and instead we will usher in a new era of frugality and long - term planning .
The Best of Karen De Coster
Eleven instructors of the Junior Reserve Officers ' Training Corps shuffled into the school board meeting in late March like men on death row who might be handed an 11th - hour pardon .
Hopeful skeptics .
Just two weeks before , the San Francisco Unified School District had sent them pink slips — proof that the school board was making good on its three - year threat to kick them to the curb .
The message , passed by a 4 - 3 school board vote in 2006 , was this :
Hell , no , you can't have a program run by retired sergeants and colonels in the peacenik capital of the Left Coast .
Sorry , our kids will not goose - step around the courtyard in uniforms .
As things stand now , the instructors must dismantle their programs at seven high schools in June .
It 's the first time anywhere in the country that JROTC has been kicked out of a school district solely on ideological grounds , according to Paul Kotakis , the program 's national spokesman .
It has been a quintessential only - in - San Francisco battle — the military ambassadors playing the rogues , and the lefty progressives as the establishment — and one that will not die .
At that March board meeting , two commissioners ( both of whom have taken pains to reassert their liberal antiwar credentials despite supporting the program ) introduced a resolution to bring JROTC coughing back up on shore .
That day 's Examiner had indicated that the new post-election lineup on the school board might provide the four votes needed to do just that .
The combatants set up camp for the re-enactment of so many previous battles .
Armed with their " I love JROTC " and " JROTC keeps me off the streets " posters , the clean - cut high schoolers scribbled last - minute changes to their speeches .
One instructor saved a seat for Assemblywoman Fiona Ma , who introduced a bill in February to force the school board to save the program .
Graying antiwar activists filed in , wearing the regalia of the left : a " Give Bush the Boot " T - shirt , " Military Out of Our Schools Now " pins , a camouflage combat jacket of a Marine who said he was out of jail for refusing to go to Iraq .
It would be a long wait .
The meeting started 45 minutes late because of the tardy arrival of board president Kim - Shree Maufas , the mother of a former JROTC cadet and a skeptic of the program .
With the JROTC measure scheduled for a first reading — no vote — far down in the agenda , Maufas denied a commissioner 's request to move the public comment earlier in the meeting to let the kids get home , as has been done at nearly every meeting they 've attended .
( Ma had also requested earlier that day that the item be taken out of order , a courtesy for high - ranking officials . )
With the JROTC instructors in the lobby on edge and grumbling about " disrespect " and " delay tactics , " even school district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe interpreted Maufas ' move as a political statement : " I do n't think this is so much a message to the kids , but to the other commissioners about whether this should have been brought up again . "
Maufas finally called public comment at 9:55 p.m. , three hours into the meeting .
And the circus began .
Cutting in front of the dozen students lined up behind the lectern , the pinstripe - suited president of the San Francisco NAACP , Amos Brown , and Robert Powell , the head of the city 's JROTC , ate up four of the allotted five minutes spitting fire at the commissioners for making the kids wait .
" This is democracy ?
We 're not in Zimbab - we ! " the usually affable Powell barked .
Maufas simply raised her eyebrows .
Teenagers from HOMEY ( Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth ) , an antigang group in the Mission , offered a rebuttal : " We need people to teach us right from wrong , not to shoot for our government .
... What is the JROTC doing for my community ?
Not nothing , " one said to loud applause from the activists in the room .
After the testimony , Commissioner Jane Kim , a critic of JROTC , stated that the five - minute limit was a rule , not an insult : " I think the adults knew this , and you organized folks to come out knowing there was five minutes total , " she said .
JROTC instructor Greg Bullard later shot back : " Does she think we 're going to let the first reading go forth without us showing our support ?
It 's an arrogant comment , and you can print that . "
Well past midnight , Maufas referred the resolution to save JROTC to three committees that will recommend how the board should vote , supposedly in May .
The instructors fear this is " death by committee " ( two of the committees , one of which has decided not to meet in April , have a majority of presumed opponents ) or a delay tactic to let the clock run out till June and then claim there 's nothing they can do .
Maufas says it 's just normal procedure .
In the lobby , buzzing with emotion after public comment , a JROTC cadet broke into tears : " That was so not five minutes ! " A JROTC dad - turned - activist snapped at a Military Out of Our Schools activist making a beeline for the pizza ordered by Assemblywoman Ma : " That pizza is for the JROTC students ! "
That 's what all this is about , right — who cares more about the kids ?
Yet in what JROTC - supporting board member Jill Wynns calls " the most blatant example of politics that are n't really about students , " the high schoolers have become pawns in a political showdown between two factions so polarized they each dismiss the other 's arguments as lies .
The anti-JROTC contingent is convinced the program is a rotten tool of recruitment into a homophobic military that , if not creating cannon fodder for America 's wars of imperialism , pumps out " yes sir " automatons who do n't question the military like they do .
The JROTC folks insist they take misfits and brainiacs , the straight and the queer , and turn them into leaders who respect themselves , each other , and their country .
And as the issue gets mulled by school board committees this month , only one outcome is assured .
Someone will lose .
On a basketball court behind Lowell High School , the members of the JROTC flag team counted to 20 , whipping flag poles in sharp movements like so many ninja samurai .
The props themselves are ingrained with San Francisco values :
In the mid-'90s , the school board banned the air rifles used in target practice and the decoy ones used in drill competition , leaving the cadets to twirl the politically safer poles instead .
In the absence of a unified television recycling program , options for conscientious consumers are little more than a patchwork of local government initiatives , says http://www.reborn.org.au, production and consumption campaigner at Environment Victoria .
" I get so many calls per week from people saying ' I have got all these TVs to get rid of ' .
If there does happen to be a recycling collection point near them they generally have to pay to offload them " .
On Friday , Australia 's state and federal environment ministers agreed to set up a national electronic waste recycling scheme .
Details of the scheme wo n't be in place for another six months but it is expected to involved a levy of about $ 35 on new TVs to help pay for the cost of collecting and recycling the old ones .
Product Stewardship Australia , an organisation representing TV manufacturers , has been working with Government to develop the framework for such a scheme since 2006 .
Executive officer John Gertsakis , says : " Australia is a laggard in the area of television recycling .
" In spite of the whole switch over to digital there seems to be this resistance and indifference to deal with a recycling scheme that would support it " .
Instead of the cost of recycling falling to the television manufacturers as it does in other countries , the financial and logistical burden rests largely on local governments who must either transport the thousands of discarded or dumped televisions to landfill or , in rare cases , take matters into their own hands by establishing expensive recycling schemes .
Melbourne 's Boroondara council has recycled 19 tonnes of electronic waste for local residents since establishing a central drop - off point , and a spokesman says residents now demand the service .
The City of Sydney council recently set up its own quarterly e-waste collection day where 95 - 98 per cent of the raw material in electronic items are recovered and reused in manufacturing .
But such initiatives are still thin on the ground , especially in regional areas where there are no electronics recycling companies nearby to deal with collected waste .
" There are only a handful of councils running recycling programs and it is a hell of an operation for any individual organisation to get up and going .
What we need is a Federal scheme that funds local collection points across the country or at the point of sale , " says Mr Brindley .
To lessen the burden on the environment , the City of Sydney recommends looking at other options before throwing equipment away such as passing it on to friends or family , or hosting a garage sale .
" There are also a range of reuse organisations such as The Bower Bird and Reverse Garbage and charity organisations who accept second hand goods , " a spokesman says .
Both the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul say they will accept used televisions which are working and meet certain criteria , and a number of websites such as freecycle.org and ozrecycle.com have also sprung up in recent years for passing unwanted household items to others who desire them .
Consumers also have the option of taking old equipment to e-waste recycling operations such as SIMS and MRI , however these centres are only based in larger metropolitan areas , and will charge a small fee for recycling old CRT televisions .
What you can do :
:: Pass on old equipment on to family or friends , or even strangers through an online recycling group such as http://www.freecycle.org. ::
Give old equipment to a charity shop or host a garage sale . ::
Check out whether your local council is running an e-waste recycling program at : http://www.recyclingnearyou.com.au/
:: Take your computer directly to an e-waste recycling depot such as SIMS , MRI or TIC Group for a small fee :: Ask the Federal Government to set up a national TV recycling scheme at http://www.reborn.org.au
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Ice crystals plucked from clouds and quickly analyzed in flight show bits of biological material -- bacteria , spores and plants -- play a role in the formation of clouds , U.S. researchers said on Sunday .

The finding , reported in the journal Nature Geoscience , offers the first direct evidence of airborne bacteria in clouds , they said .
Climate scientists typically rely on computer models to predict climate change , but until now it has been difficult to directly measure the composition of ice crystals in clouds , which are the very seeds that form clouds .
“ By sampling clouds in real time from an aircraft , these investigators were able to get information about ice particles in clouds at an unprecedented level of detail , ” Anne-Marie Schmoltner of the National Science Foundation ’s Division of Atmospheric sciences , said in a statement .
“ By determining the chemical composition of the very cores of individual ice particles , they discovered that both mineral dust and , surprisingly , biological particles play a major role in the formation of clouds . ”
For this study , Kim Prather of Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California San Diego loaded up an aircraft with a specially designed lab instrument called a mass spectrometer .
The team made a series of flights over the skies of Wyoming to analyze the chemical composition of ice - forming particles in clouds .
“ The key to cloud formation is these little seeds that feed the clouds , ” Prather said in a telephone interview .
“ We are basically trying to understand what is forming clouds . ”
The team , lead by Prather ’s graduate student Kerri Pratt , found that biological matter accounted for 33 percent of the particles in ice crystals , and mineral dust accounted for 50 percent .
“ The big deal was to be able to measure the chemistry of each particle one at a time , ” Prather said .
Other teams have captured ice crystals and examined their contents on the ground , she said , but by that time they had melted , and it was impossible to know for sure what they were analyzing .
She said the ice pocket they measured contained Asian dust .
The findings suggest biological particles that get swept up in dust storms help induce cloud formation .
It was impossible to tell whether bits of plant matter , fungal spores and bacteria they detected had been alive because the instrument they used “ smashed them to bits ” and analyzed their composition , she said ..
“ They were potentially living .
We ca n’t say for sure . ”
But other teams have found living bacteria in studies of cloud water , she said .
And some scientists suspect clouds may be capable of transporting viruses and bacteria and depositing them long distances in the form of rain and snow .
“ It ’s almost like the biological material is hitching a ride along with the dust , ” she said .
Prather said understanding the exact composition of clouds will help climate scientists better predict climate change , and may even lead to new ways of forming rain clouds to alleviate drought .
The study was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
A recent Psychological Science article describes experiments where subjects were randomly induced into either an proud or a neutral mental state , and then worked with a group on solving a problem :
Proud individuals not only took on a dominant role within the group problem - solving task , but also were perceived as the most likeable interaction partners .
These findings suggest that pride , when representing an appropriate response to actual performance ( as opposed to overgeneralized hubris ) , constitutes a functional social emotion with important implications for leadership and the building of social capital .
This seems a somewhat odd conclusion to draw , since in this experiment the pride was not an appropriate response to actual performance ; it was randomly induced !
Nevertheless , this does seem to confirm pride as a signal of social status .
We like folks who signal high status , except if they are a rival or we think they are bidding for more status than they can support .

A 58 - year - old Wal - Mart employee who said he “ could n’t take it anymore ” lit himself on fire outside the Bloomingdale store where he worked late Thursday night and was later pronounced dead at a hospital , authorities said this morning .
In an interview , his son said his father went to work last night with nothing seeming out of the ordinary .
“ This had nothing to do with the economy .
I want to make that clear , ” he said , adding that the family may never know the reason for the public suicide .
When one of the first officers tried to speak to the man , who by that time was severely burned , he responded , “ I just could n’t take it anymore , ” a man said , citing the officer ’s report .
The man “ enjoyed his job and living in the ‘ burbs , ” his son said .
“ We were getting ready to redo the front lawn . ”
He added that his father had no health problems .
“ You try not to ask yourself the question [ why he did it ] because there ’s no answer , ” the son said .
I 've never seen it personally , but I 've heard that chickens can be housebroken and trained to use a litterbox like a cat .
As animals go , some of them are quite intelligent , and some of ours even respond individually to their own names in the same way that a trained cat or dog might .
They realize when one of their own is missing , and if they see another chicken eaten or killed , they remember what did the deed and how , so if you eat your chickens , make sure to take out their buddies where they can't see you .
Yeah , they 'll miss the one that 's gone for a little while ( especially if it's a particular rooster 's favorite hen ) but they wo n't be psychologically scarred and distrustful of you if they do n't catch you in the act .
In all honesty , there 's really nothing wrong with eating the pet chickens that you 've named and loved .
In America , we tend to think that eating something that you 've handled , talked to , and treated like a pet is a barbaric practice , but in truth it is the most humane thing you can possibly do .
After all , when you eat a chicken , whether it be your own or one diced into a burger or a taco you pick up at a fast food joint , you 're asking an animal to give up its life in order to nourish you .
There 's nothing wrong with that -- chickens and other livestock have been feeding humans ( and other animals ) in some form or another for thousands , if not millions of years , and if you 're going to be grateful for that substantial contribution to humanity as a whole , why not embrace the animals that you 're going to eat , give them a good life , and let them live happy and free until the time comes ( as it does for all of us ) to fulfill their most profound duty in the greater scheme of things .
After all , if you were a chicken , would you rather be raised commercially , in the vicious and cruel system that produces most of the meat we eat in America today , or would you rather be treated like a pet , cared for and loved , handled and fed as much as you can eat with the freedom to go wherever you want ?
You 're going to get eaten either way .
It just makes more sense to love your chickens !
According to the National Cancer Institute , there were more than 2.5 million women in 2006 who had a history of any type of breast cancer , and have managed to survive the ordeal .
To give you an idea about just how serious this disease is , take a look at some other facts about breast cancer :
– Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer ( next to lung cancer ) in both men and women .
– It is the 5th most common cause of cancer - related deaths .
– It is 100 times more frequent in women than in men – although the survival rate is equal in both sexes .
As you may already know , breast cancer is a type of cancer which starts in the cells of the breasts in both men and women .
Although it does occur more frequently in women , the severity of the illness is just as serious where men are concerned .
Here , few breast cancer facts are explained that you may not necessarily have known about .
How do these facts about women ’s breasts affect the probability of having breast cancer ?
Read on to find out .
7 Facts About Breast Cancer You Probably Didn’t Know
As mentioned earlier , what we will provide you with is a list of the top 7 things that you probably did n’t know about breasts .
Half of these facts do not necessarily have anything to do with breast cancer , but half of them are related to the incidence of this serious disease .
Take a look at the following list of facts about breast cancer :
1 . A woman ’s breasts swell during sex .
Traditionally , a woman ’s breasts represent her femininity and it ’s also a symbol of motherhood .
Now , if you are tangling the sheets with your significant other , do you feel as if your breasts are swelling when you are already sexually aroused ?
There is a basis to this and it actually does in fact physically swell .
According to the British Medical Journal , women do experience up to 25 % of swelling in their breasts when they are indulging in sexual activity .
This is caused by the feeling of arousal and the hormonal surge in a woman ’s body .
In addition , swollen breasts become the body ’s natural way of boosting its seductive powers from a man ’s point of view .
2. Breastfeeding can actually help you lose weight .
Whether you ’re a first - time , second - time or third - time mom , you will notice significant changes in your body during your entire pregnancy – especially when it comes to your breasts .
During the pregnancy stage , the breasts become larger in size due to lactation .
But did you know that if you do go for breastfeeding over feeding your baby with formula milk , it can actually help you lose weight ?
[ Breastfeeding benefits ]
According to the studies conducted by Dewey , Heinig and Nommsen of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , women who breastfeed from about three to six months have experienced a significant amount of fat loss in their own bodies .
The weight loss may continue six months after your baby is born .
3. Women who are 50 years and up have a higher risk of developing breast cancer .
Perhaps the number one reason why there are fewer and fewer deaths associated with breast cancer is awareness on the part of the general women ’s population .
[ Breast cancer awareness ]
Early diagnosis is actually the number one preventive measure that can be taken to fight death caused by breast cancer .
So the earlier the condition is detected , the better the chances of survival rate .
But did you know that as you age , you would have a higher risk of developing the big C on your breasts ?
This is due to the fact that as women age , cellular mutation is on an increasing pattern .
Whether or not you have a family history of breast cancer , you should be more concerned about the possibility of developing the disease by the time that you hit your 50s .
4. Consuming milk may actually lead to breast cancer .
Sure , giving your milk to your baby when you are lactating may help you lose weight – but did you know that consuming milk yourself may actually lead to breast cancer ?
The types of milk which are on the safe side include rice milk , goat ’s milk and almond milk .
On the other hand , those which are highly suspected of causing breast cancer include soy milk which contains isoflavones .
This is a plant - like estrogen which imitates the estrogen in humans – so drinking a lot of soy milk is not recommended by the experts .
If you have breast cancer , the goal is to keep the estrogen level low , and the recommended intake of isoflavones is only about 100 milligrams a day .
5 . The healthier you are , the better it would be for the health of your breasts .
These days , it is quite easy to succumb into leading a sedentary lifestyle because everything seems to be easily within reach .
There seems to be a link between obesity and breast cancer – which is exactly the reason why you should try to remain as healthy as you can for the benefit of your breast health and also your overall health .
Eating a lot of fruits and veggies , foods with antioxidants and having a proper exercise and diet program are the preventive measures that you can apply to prevent having breast cancer in the future .
[ Breast cancer diet ]
Another way to live a cancer - free life is by avoiding alcohol as much as you can .
There may be just a tiny link connecting these two – but the link is there just the same .
6 . Women who religiously self - examine their breasts are no less likely to die of breast cancer , as compared to women who do not perform a breast self exam .
For the longest time now , women have been lead to believe that they should conduct a breast self exam every month .
A few years ago , the American Cancer Society has already tagged self - breast exams as being optional rather than a necessity .
A new way of doing things is with TLC or touch , look and check .
This is the new rule of thumb that you need to live by , according to the British breast cancer foundation called Breakthrough Breast Cancer .
What you need to do is be aware of how your breasts feel normally .
The minute that you feel a change , track it and if it does not go away , that is the time that you should seek the help of your doctor .
7 . Wearing an underwire bra may be one of the many causes of breast cancer .
Sure , there are a lot of myths about how carcinogens are highly suspected when it comes to being the reasons for developing breast cancer .
But the one thing which you may be doing on a regular basis that can actually cause such a disease to develop is wearing underwire bras .
Basically , in order for you to prevent cancer from happening , you do need to have a healthy lymphatic system .
When you wear bras which have underwire in them , the circulation of the blood in the armpit area gets cut off .
As a result , your lymph nodes cannot properly eliminate the cancer - causing waste materials accumulated in the body – and this could be one of the reasons why your underwire bra is highly suspected when it comes to breast cancer development .
Now that you already got to know some of the common and not - so - common breast cancer facts , you can take the precautionary measures in order to prevent breast cancer from developing in your body .
All in all , early detection of breast cancer , taking precautionary measures and being aware of the facts about breast cancer are the things that you need to be armed with , if you want to win the fight against breast cancer .

Conroe man dies after officers use Taser on him Conroe man dies after officers shock him with a Taser
Deputies say the 40 - year - old , who was found wearing no clothes , struggled with them
A man died shortly after sheriff 's deputies used a Taser on him at his Montgomery County home Saturday , authorities said .
Deputies received a call about 7 a.m. of a possible suicide attempt at a residence in the 6500 block of Golden Oaks Drive .
Robert Lee Welch , 40 , had been pushing people there and would not respond to family members , the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Office said .
Deputies approached and tried to talk to Welch , who was not wearing clothing , authorities said .
When Welch would n't respond , deputies tried to detain the man , who resisted and struggled , authorities said .
Deputies then used a Taser to help control the man , authorities said .
Paramedics at the scene began treating Welch , who was not breathing and did not have a pulse .
Welch was taken to a Conroe hospital , where he died .
An autopsy will be conducted at the Southeast Texas Forensic Center to determine the cause of death .
The incident is being investigated by the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Office Major Crimes Unit , Texas Rangers as well as the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office .
Tasers , which can deliver a 50,000 - volt electrical charge , have drawn controversy across the country .
Montgomery County added Tasers to its arsenal in 2006 through federal grants .
The Houston Police Department started using Tasers in 2004 .
A Houston Chronicle analysis showed that HPD officers deployed their Tasers 1,724 times between December 2004 and May 2008 , triggering 69 internal affairs investigations .
Critics worry that the weapons are often used on people who have not committed crimes .
Raw Milk is Most Widely Consumed Illegal Commodity Besides Drugs
Do you drink raw milk ?
If you live in one of the states where raw milk is illegal , you may be part of underground movement that is second in size only to illegal drugs .
It ’s legal to consume raw milk in all 50 states if you own your own dairy cow , but it is not legal to sell it if you live in one of the 46 states that have adopted the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance ( PMO ) .
The PMO states that only Grade “ A ” pasteurized , ultra - pasteurized or aseptically processed milk and milk products can be sold to the final consumer , and federal law makes it illegal to transport raw milk across state lines .
Such laws make raw milk drinkers underground consumers like illegal drug users .
In the United States , between 500,000 to 1,000,000 people drink raw milk ( remember , it ’s hard to get statistics on an underground market ) .
Raw milk has long been touted for its health benefits , and recently Chelsea Green and MSN have reported on the black market for raw milk .
After illegal drugs , raw milk — milk that ’s unpasteurized and unhomogenized , just as it comes out of the cow — may be the most briskly traded underground commodity in America .
To get raw milk , consumers jump through a variety of hoops .
From belonging to a herdshare ( similar to a CSA ) to meeting vans in the early morning , raw milk drinkers are finding ways around federal and state laws .
Some consumers buy raw milk in neighboring states where it is is legal and transport it home themselves .
Other people drive several hours to a raw milk pick up site as part of a raw milk club .
MSN reports :
There ’s good reason for these clubs to be cautious .
While state authorities rarely go after raw milk buyers , distributors have gotten in trouble — late last year an Ohio raw milk co-op was raided at gunpoint by sheriffs ’ deputies .
And state officials regularly try to shut down dairies that sell raw milk .
The Farm - to - Consumer Legal Defense Fund , which defends farmers ’ right to sell raw milk , has a dozen cases on its docket right now .
“ People have the legal right to drink it , ” says Pete Kennedy , interim president .
“ The problem is finding ways to enable them to exercise their right . ”
Ron Paul wants to make drinking raw milk a personal choice and remove federal regulation .
There is no doubt pasteurization has prevented illnesses , but when consumers are locavores that know the sources of their dairy products , the risk is minimized .
Personally , I have never experienced negative consequences of consuming raw milk or raw milk products .

While the Wii is the console in Nintendo 's lineup that gets most of the attention for its sales , the DS is always # 2 on the US sales charts , month after month .
In fact , last December , the Nintendo DS was the first system to sell 3 million units of hardware in one month .
With the DS , Nintendo has proven itself the undisputed king of portable gaming , and the company 's secret to dominance is simple : constant hardware updates .
Look at how many different variants of the GameBoy there were — like the Advance and the micro— well before the DS grabbed the throne .
Then there was the DS Lite , and the various special editions .
A serious Nintendo fan might purchase and / or trade in multiple units of each piece of hardware , and Nintendo is hoping that trend continues with its newest update .
The DSi is the new iteration of the DS that drops the GBA slot , adds stronger wireless functions , and carries a $ 40 price increase .
This is n't a new system , and DS Lites will still be sold , but Nintendo clearly wants gamers to get used to the idea of the gaming system itself being a one - stop shop for new content .
So do n't worry about the cameras or the music features : the DSi is all about buying your games online .
Title Nintendo DSi Manufacturer Nintendo Price $ 169.99 Buy it now Shop.ars
Thinner , blacker , more productive
On pulling the DSi out of the box , the first thing you 'll notice ( aside from the massive manual ) , is that the hardware has gone through a number of cosmetic changes .
The plastic is now matte , and the whole unit feels much more solid and heavy in your hand .
This new handheld feels like a serious piece of equipment and less like a toy than the previous DS Lite hardware .
The DSi is now 12 percent thinner as well , and frankly the whole thing just feels better than its predecessor .
The power button has been moved to the face of the DSi , so you have to open the unit to turn it on or off .
The DSi's volume control is now two buttons instead of a slider , and you can adjust the brightness on - the - fly by holding down Select and hitting volume up or down at any time , which is perfect for conserving battery life or adjusting to changing conditions .
The DSi's buttons look and feel very similar to those of my older DS system , and any difference could be chalked up to the DSi being new and the older system being broken - in by a few years of play .
The DSi's d-pad is much " clickier , " and feels very nice .
The new unit 's screen is a quarter of an inch larger than that of the older DS , but unless you hold the two systems together you likely wo n't notice any change .
The DSi has a light that shows if you 're connected to the Internet , and it sports an SD card slot where the power button used to be .
Luckily , the door to the SD slot sits perfectly flush with the side of the hardware , so it 's not uncomfortable in your hand .
Unlike the Wii , which until recently was limited to 2GB SD cards , the DSi supports SDHC cards out - of - the - box , so you 're free to jam in as big a card as you can find .
Very good news .
But be aware that games backed up on SD cards wo n't be playable on other systems , nor will save - game files .
The included charging cable has some cosmetic differences from the DS Lite charging cable , and the connection to the system is different ; so the two cables are not compatible in any way .
The DSi will take you through the expected menus and screens when you set things up for the first time , and our advice is to get online first to grab the free Web browser — courtesy of Opera — and get your free 1,000 points for being an early adopter .
A few notes on online connectivity : the DSi supports WPA2 , which is a very welcome addition , but your old games wo n't work with the new protocol .
So if you want to jump online with an older title , you 'll still need to keep that router setup for WEP .
Yes , this is a pain in the ass , but hopefully upcoming games wo n't have this issue .
Through it all , she smiled .
Gertrude Baines , who holds the record as the world ’s oldest living person , celebrated her 115th birthday Monday , as a crowd of well - wishers that included President Obama and the Dodgers sent their regards .
Plaques , certificates and flowers were presented to the longtime Western Convalescent Hospital resident from high - ranking politicians , including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sen. Dianne Feinstein .
But it was a cooler packed with one of her all - time favorite treats -- Dodger dogs -- that got her most excited .
“ Ha ! ” she exclaimed as her beloved caretaker , Cynthia Thompson , told her about the frankfurters .
It was a day like no other for Baines , who has already endured a year of unprecedented attention .
The Shellman , Ga. , native became the world ’s oldest living person on Jan. 2 after a 115 - year - old Portuguese woman died , according to the Gerontology Research Group , which validates claims of extreme old age .
Baines has taken the title in stride , humoring admirers and not quite understanding what all the fuss is about .
Such was the case Monday as more than 100 guests poured into the West Adams hospital to honor yet another one of her birthday milestones .
Center officials spent months planning the event , which was expected to make headlines worldwide .
As Baines was dolled up in her room , bow - tied valets greeted guests at the entrance to the modest hospital .
Laminated programs bearing Baines ’ image , along with congratulatory wishes from local businesses , were handed out to visitors .
Guests crammed elbow - to - elbow inside a small reception room , with some sitting on the floor .
Politicos and their aides crowded in the hallway to await the birthday girl .
When Baines ’ roommate , Mattie Zittle , 94 , was wheeled into the room , everyone clapped and hollered , thinking she was Baines .
“ It ’s a decoy ! ” one journalist shouted as the paparazzi - like pool of photographers snapped away .
Then the real Baines rolled in .
A vision in pink and pearl earrings , Baines was propped up in bed by a flowery pillow .
Baines smiled and looked around the room , now and then closing her eyes as her pastor , followed by a succession of elected officials , took the microphone .
In a letter , Schwarzenegger called her a “ national treasure ” and Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Los Angeles ) called her “ a beacon of hope and joy . ”
The former maid outlived every one of her relatives , including her daughter , who died of typhoid at the age of 18 .
When Baines was born , Grover Cleveland was president and the U.S. flag had only 44 stars .
Next in line for the world title is 113 - year - old Kama Chinen of Japan .
“ All of us can only hope to reach that pinnacle , ” L.A. City Councilman Bernard C. Parks said .
Many praised Baines ’ health and promised to return for her 116th birthday .
Though Baines has enjoyed stable health in recent years , lately she has struggled with her appetite and shed a few pounds .
“ We ’ve seen her health decline a bit , but she ’s a very strong woman , ” said hospital administrator Emma Camanay .
After a two - tiered , lemon - flavored birthday cake was wheeled in , and everyone sang to Baines , the guest of honor bid everyone farewell with a smile .
Then she was off to her room to do what she does best : nap .

In this week 's Spooning column , culinary Don Juan Colin Redding explores the virtues of perhaps the tastiest thing to ever come out of a pig : bacon .
When this turf meets surf , you get bacon - wrapped jewels of deliciousness we call scallops .
Check out the recipe after the jump .
Bacon - Wrapped Scallop Love
1/2 dozen wild sea scallops
6 strips bacon
toothpicks
Pre -heat oven to 350 .
Line a large backing pan with foil and line the 6 strips on the foil .
Bake at 350 for approx .
10 minutes or until bacon is close to done , just starting to brown and shrink .
Remove bacon from pan and set on paper towels .
Let bacon get warm to the touch then wrap it around each scallop tightly and fasten with a toothpick all the way through to the other side of the scallop .
Place bacon wrapped scallops on a hot grill for 4 minutes per side , turning once .
Scallops should have nice brown marks from the grill .
There is nothing more disappointing then overcooked scallops so when in doubt pull them off early !
You can always throw back on the grill if not done .
Scallops should be slightly firm to the touch and opalescent in the middle !

G20 In London : Who 's Protesting Where ?
2007 Climate Camp at Heathrow / courtesy of Andrew * under a Creative Commons licence Right then !
We 've seen what the G20 is and what people are mad at them about .
Or just mad about in general .
Now for the fun bit : what 's actually happening on these streets of ours ?
Saturday 28 March
The Put People First march starts at Victoria Embankment by Temple station , at noon .
Anyone wanting to join in should start to gather from 11 am ( the earlier the better , really ) .
It 's going to go past Parliament and Trafalgar Square , down Piccadilly and finish up in Hyde Park , where you 'll be able to listen to Susan George , Tony Woodley , Brendan Barber , Tony Robinson , Mark Thomas , Daby Toure and Luke Pritchard of Kooks fame .
Wednesday 1 April
It 's Financial Fools Day , everyone !
The first ( scheduled ) protest is the G - 20 Meltdown march on the Bank of England , kicking off ( hopefully not literally ) at 11 am with a four - pronged procession representing the Horsemen of the Apocalypse :
* The red horse against war starts from Moorgate
* The green horse against climate change starts from Liverpool Street
* The silver horse against financial crimes starts from London Bridge
* The black horse against land enclosures and borders ( honouring the " 360th full circle anniversary of the Diggers " ) starts from Cannon Street
There 's a big party planned when the processions meet at the Bank .
This is billed as a very English protest , and they 're recommending you bring food and water to share ( especially cake : " you ca n't have a revolution without cake " ) , flags and musical instruments .
Climate Camp is setting up at exactly 12.30 pm outside the European Climate Exchange at 62 Bishopsgate .
If you want to go camp , take your own tent and sleeping bags , food and water , and anything to decorate the area .
Campaign Against Climate Change is holding a Fossil Fools Day protest outside the ExCel centre 12.30 - 7.30 pm with a rally at 6.30 pm .
They 'll have a big ' iceberg ' and they invite you to bring your own 'ice blocks ' and dress in white .
People and Planet are planning action against RBS - NatWest as part of their Ditch Dirty Development campaign , against funding of fossil fuels .
There 's not much detail about times and places , which is quite possibly deliberate .
Stop the War Coaltition are meeting at 2 pm outside the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square to protest against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Alternative London Summit takes place at the University of East London 's Docklands Campus 4 - 9 pm .
It 's a teach - in , with keynote speakers including Ken Loach , Tony Benn , Tariq Ali and Caroline Lucas .
Fossil Fools
Day will also be outside the British Museum 's Great Russell Street entrance from 6 pm , where BP are ( kind of stupidly ) celebrating their centenary .
Protesters plan their own party ( bring banners , instruments and " a sense of climate justice " ) .
Thursday 2 April
This is the day the serious G20 meetings actually happen , so Stop the War are taking the opportunity to march on the ExCel centre .
Be at Canning Town station by 6am .
We can't quite work out who 's supposed to be making sandpits in the streets , and there 's bound to be smaller actions happening all over the city .
We would say this though : although the events detailed above are all fluffy protests , all police leave has been cancelled and there will be a very , very heavy presence .
We 've already questioned whether the Met have been ramping up the expectation of violence to justify harsh tactics , so do n't do anything we would n't do .
Did we miss anything ?
Let us know in the comments , and do n't forget to send us your photos .

Yesterday ’s reports of a foiled “ terrorist plot ” in relation to the G20 protests in London have been scaled back after it was revealed that the house raided by police contained only plastic guns and fireworks .
“ The three men , aged 25 , 19 and 16 , and two women , both 20 , all live in Plymouth and the surrounding area , ” reported The Guardian .
“ They are political activists unaffiliated to any terrorist organisation , and were arrested at addresses in Plymouth .
They are being held under terrorism legislation .
The explosive devices were made from simple fireworks , police said . ”
[ efoods ]
Nevertheless , police have called in Royal Navy bomb disposal experts to deal with the weapons .
The police have also said that they recovered “ allegedly extremist materials ” , without further expanding on what they might be .
“ At a press conference at Crownhill police station in Plymouth , Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton said the investigation was sparked when a 25 - year - old man was arrested for spray - painting on a wall in Plymouth city centre – but would not comment on the nature of the graffiti , ” reported the Press Association .
It has since come to light that the graffiti read ‘ Antifa ’ , which is the name of an anti-racist movement that advocates the use of violence against extreme right - wing groups .
The youths , who were initially arrested on drug charges , are now being held under the terrorism act .
Meanwhile , fresh reports have emerged alleging that anarchists are planning to pose as peaceful protesters as a cover to seed chaos in the capital .
Hundreds of activists are hoping to fool police by pretending to be part of legitimate demonstrations , before breaking off and storming city banks , according to the London Evening Standard which says it infiltrated an anarchist leaders meeting yesterday .
Other reports have revealed that the SAS is being readied to react to any “ terrorist ” activity .
Rather bizarrely , it has also been revealed an entire network of central London ’s wireless CCTV cameras will be turned off during the protests because they have been deemed to be illegal .

Avalanche Studios thinks big .
Their namesake engine is n’t concerned with making things pretty , although it ’s no slouch in that area either , but its main goal is to spit out gargantuan worlds , filled with life and substance , bristling with realistic trees and submerged in yawning oceans .
Take Just Cause 2 , one of the studio’s slew of upcoming games which features an immeasurable mass of land , hundreds of vehicles , different terrains and settlements , cities and villages .
Just Cause 2 ’s lead designer , Peter Johansson , explained that “ something we worked a lot with getting right with Just Cause 2 is creating a world that is filled with stuff to do ; that ’s probably the most important thing , the element we worked hardest on getting to work ” .
But alongside Just Cause 2 , the Stockholm based developers are hard at work on multiple titles , each offering massive worlds , free - roaming exploration and unstructured freedom .
“ The games we ’ve talked about so far have used our engine to create very big worlds , and if we do this big world , we should give the player a lot of freedom to play around with his environment , and get a lot of content in there ” .
Just Cause launched on Xbox 360 , PC and last generation consoles to little fanfare in 2006 .
At the recent Eidos preview event I was the only card carrying Just Cause fanatic ; most of the other journalists had n’t even played it , let alone grabbed all 1000 Gamerscore .
Since the original ’s debut however , the Playstation 3 has entered the space , developers are more comfortable with Xbox 360 tech and last generation development is off the cards .
“ That ’s helped a lot , not being held back by last generation consoles , ” explains Johansson , “ we have developed the engine a lot , since Just Cause 1 , with different climate zones , a lot more interactivity and destructibility in the game ” .
During the demonstration , technical jargon easily impressed , including “ about four times the terrain resolution in terms of polygons , and a huge amount of smaller , subtle details that makes it look so much better ” .
But also during the three year gap , the consoles have exploded with free - roaming games and sandbox experiences .
As Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto fight for turf in the urban space , Just Cause sees a worthy adversary in Mercenaries 2 ; sharing elements of Pandemic ’s destructible world , luscious jungle and penchant for brazen lunacy .
“ We ’re not really comparing ourselves to many of those titles , because JC offers such a unique experience in itself ” clarifies Johansson .
“ It ’s important for each game in this free roaming genre to find its own identity ” .
So what is Just Cause ’s identity ?
“ The game is all about these crazy stunts and a lot of freedom ” .
Just Cause was lauded for its madcap antics and unbelievable stunts , but as Johansson explains , the series has no plans for moderation or sobriety , “ Just Cause 2 is definitely more insane ” !
The final act of our demonstration was shockingly punctuated by smoke - bombing , katana wielding enemies , as I scribbled “ Ninjas ? ! ” in my notebook .
Without a moment to exhale an atomic submarine crashes through the ice and Rico gives chase .
“ It ’s all about having loads of fun and a really good time ” , he describes , as if the team nonchalantly throw any idea into production to see what sticks .
This time round , the game takes place on the tropical island of Panau , a fictionalised collage of Hawaii and New Zealand .
Tracking down his rogue former - mentor , protagonist Rico Rodriguez is back to ruffle up unstable factions , steal every vehicle in sight and base jump off ridiculously high mountains .
The game is centred on chaos and mayhem , doling out points and progressing the game through unadulterated destruction , murder and demolition .
Vehicles and weaponry are more potent tools of annihilation than ever with fighter jets , attack helicopters , rocket launchers , grenade launchers and satchel charges .
While the first game collapsed into repetition , Johansson is certain that the sequel wo n’t endure the same fate .
“ That ’s what we ’ve done with this chaos system ; instead of separate boring and repetitive side missions , you can cause this mayhem in any way you want ” .
That ’s not to say the game lacks structure and direction , there is an enormous number of key missions , faction based assignments , races , stunt challenges , colonel assassinations , hostage rescues and stronghold takeovers , “ but if you just cause chaos , you will provoke reactions in the game world , and work towards achieving your goals ” .
“ We have three rogue factions , and when you enter the game world it ’s a pressure cooker ready to explode ” .
With the chaos caused by toppling buildings and killing gang members , Rico pushes and prods the factions for a reaction , or works with them “ not because he likes them , but because it gives him new opportunities to cause mayhem and reach his agenda ” .
“ In Just Cause 2 if you can see something interesting , you can be sure that you can get there , and when you do , there will be something meaningful to do there ” .
The game ’s map screen is a testament to the team ’s work , where the island ’s cartography can hardly be seen behind the fog of challenges , settlements , military bases and places of interest .
“ All the different settlements that you can visit are just playgrounds for to cause chaos in , and every location has something of value in ” ; the world is littered with collectibles which , with the help of a handy radar , will let you upgrade your vehicles , weapons and armour .
Just Cause 2 is looking to be an incredible game , surpassing the first by leaps and bounds .
The Avalanche engine spits out icy mountain tops and vast deserts , while the game ’s designers present opportunities for destruction and fun .
Rico ’s grappling hook , for example , can be used to tether a helpless goon to the back of a jeep , or to create a wrecking ball with a car and a helicopter : absolute chaos is ensured .
“ We have at least one secret project , ” finished Johansson , “ we have a lot of things in the works at Avalanche ” .
With multiple open world games in production , a massively capable engine and all this for a studio open for a scant six years , Avalanche is thinking a lot bigger than most developers .
Special thanks to Avalanche Studio ’s Peter Johansson for sitting down with Ready - Up , and Eidos for the fantastic event , which produced coverage of Mini Ninjas and Batman : Arkham Aslyum .
BBC correspondent Matthew Price continues his journey across America , and reports from Chicago , Barack Obama 's home town , where African American community leaders fear the recession is dragging down their communities more than most .

On the South Side of Chicago , in the back room of a house , on an old hospital bed , an elderly woman lies sound asleep .
Her head is to one side on the pillow .
Her mouth is slightly open as she breathes .
BBC correspondent Matthew Price is travelling across the US , reporting from a new city every day , to assess the state of the economy as President Obama approaches 100 days in office .
See the Beyond Wall Street route here .
Enlarge Map
The woman 's name is Bernice Williams .
In the 1960s Bernice was part of an emerging black middle class .
She had a steady job with the Chicago Water Department for 30 years .
Then , 47 years ago , she made a little bit of music history .
She wrote a song that spent three weeks at the top of the US Hot 100 Billboard chart .
The song was called the Duke of Earl .
Now , it all seems to have counted for so little .
Eaten alive
The future that Bernice Williams envisaged for herself , for her daughter , for her grandchildren , has not materialised .
Her daughter , Roxanne , has a good job as a nurse , but hers is the only salary supporting this family .
Her son - in - law , Don Burnett , is an unemployed computer programmer who is struggling to help the family make ends meet .
Her grandson , Joron , is a talented rap artist who goes by the name of Jnan , and who had to leave the prestigious Columbia University as his parents could no longer afford the fees .
" At one point we had savings , " Don explains .
He speaks of holidays the family once took .
" I do n't know when that will ever happen again . "
After Don lost his job , " we had to cash things in and delete bank accounts to make end meet " he says .
" We had to cash in our [ assets ] to pay off the mortgage and get the utilities paid .
It sounds simple .
It 's not that simple .
We just got eaten alive . "
Disproportionately hit This is the story of one family , but it is also the story - in some ways - of the US economy today .
Food aid is needed to feed the poor in the world 's wealthiest country .
" We are an average middle class family , " says Don .
" It 's unheralded .
We lived in this neighbourhood for 20 years .
Now I 'm watching my neighbours struggle just to keep their house . "
Poverty is growing across the United States .
Many communities are affected .
Yet a number of studies suggest that African Americans in general have been hit harder than others .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , black unemployment has risen to 13.4 % since the recession began in December 2007 .
The national unemployment rate is 8.5 % .
One of the largely untold stories of America 's economic decline is the disproportionate effect it appears to be having on African Americans .
Food aid
You get a sense of the problems in this part of Chicago , even before the lorry turns up at St Columbanus church .
It is miserably cold and wet , and yet around the back of the car park there is a queue forming .
They stand patiently , faces screwed up against the wind .
The lorry arrives and the volunteers get to work , unloading the food .
Then they allow the queue of people to come in .
It looks like a farmers ' market , but this is food aid , in the world 's wealthiest country .
Frightening prospect LaVerne Morris runs the food bank , and she has been watching things get worse every week .
For the first time in our history the people do n't have the feeling that they are turning over a better future for their children than the one that they received from their parents
Reverend Alvin Love
Some here are chronically poor , but others are this country 's emerging poor .
" These people are the mainstream Americans who are working jobs for salaries every week , " she says .
" They have been the ones who lost their jobs first . "
A few miles away , the Reverend Alvin Love , sharp and smart in a suit and a crisp white shirt , points to the rear of his church .
His gold wedding ring gleams in the subdued light .
Barack Obama used to sit in the pews towards the back .
That was when the now president was a community organiser here .
Reverend Love is worried - like many local leaders .
He can see this recession affecting the African American community particularly badly .
" For the first time in our history the people do n't have the feeling that they are turning over a better future for their children than the one that they received from their parents , " he says .
" I think that 's a frightening prospect . "
Fading dream
In the community centre down the road they hold a joint prayer before getting down to business .
The talk is not just of rising unemployment - the local jobless rate is estimated to be over 60 % - but crime too , and recently murder .
Gang shootings appear to be coming back .
" In just a month we 're probably at five , " says community leader Georgette Greenlee - Finney .
" We 've had Tommy , Marshaan , this man who just died . "
Community leaders such as Georgette can see the recession pulling the area backwards .
She believes the rising crime rate is directly related to the deteriorating economy .
As for the billions that the White House has set aside to boost the economy , she can not see that filtering down to her community .
" There is a fear that lot of dollars are going to be put into construction jobs and into places where blacks have historically been for want of a better term red- lined out , through racism . "
There is another fear .
That this recession is pushing African - Americans further from the dream of economic equality .

I read with horror that Hillary Clinton , posing as the Secretary of State , has been in Mexico talking with Felipe Calderon , Mexico ’s president , about  the problem of drugs . 
Horror is the reasonable response whenever an American official is allowed to pass beyond the beltway .
Or stay within it .
They never know what they are doing .
Oh god .
In fairness , I have to concede that Ms. Clinton is well qualified to talk to Calderon , since he speaks English .
Further , I concede that she does have a grasp of things Latin American , engendered by many years in Arkansas .
Aaagh .
May I suggest that the former First Basilisk had no idea where she was or what she was doing ?
Oh god , oh god .
Oh god .
To show that utter futility can , if not be fun , at least serve to pass an idle hour , let me express the common Mexican and indeed South American view of the , oh god , War on Drugs .
It goes thusly :
Latin America does not have a drug problem .
It has a United States problem .
The problem is that Americans want drugs .
The US is a huge , voracious , insatiable market for drugs .
Americans very much want their brain candy .
They will pay whatever they need to pay to get it .
All the world knows this .
Why , Mexicans wonder , is America ’s drug habit Mexico ’s problem ?
If Americans do n’t want drugs , they can stop buying them .
Nobody forces anyone to use the stuff .
Ah , the rub is that Washington does n’t want Americans to have drugs .
All right , say Mexicans , that is a problem between the American government and the American people .
Let America solve it .
Why , Mexican ’s ask — read this sentence carefully — should Mexico tear itself in pieces , lose thousands of dead annually , and turn into a war zone to solve a problem that America refuses to solve ?
Think .
Why does n’t the American government run sting operations at , say , Berkeley and Stanford , and Rice and George Washington U. , and put those students caught using drugs in the slam for two years per ?
How about a sting at your daughter ’s high school , with a year in some nasty reformatory , which is to say any reformatory , for those caught ?
It could be a family sort of thing .
You could visit her and hear what fascinating things she had learned about compulsory Lesbian sex .
The reason of course is that any effort to punish large classes of politically influential people would result in a revolution .
You ca n’t jail Harvard .
So Washington does n’t .
Instead it expects Mexico to do something about drugs .
Now , on the off - chance that you live in an impermeable bubble , and do n’t know who uses drugs , I will tell you .
I note that I am not speculating about this .
I spent eight years working as a police reporter from Anacostia to South Central , and know whereof I speak .
Blue - collar people use drugs — crack , for example .
I ’ve spent whole days arresting down - scale beauticians in rattletrap Chevys as they bought the stuff from black dealers in the grubby satellite towns outside Chicago .
High rollers in Houston use as much powder as they ski in ( and it happens to my certain knowledge on Capitol Hill ) .
White professionals have bags of grass in the garage .
So , most likely , do their children :
In the suburban high schools of metro Washington , e.g. , Yorktown and Washington and Lee , kids have easy access to Mary Jane , acid , shrooms , nitrous , Ecstasy , crystal .
Good ol ’ boys in Texas make , grow , and use drugs .
Country kids in Virginia have a few plants out in the woods .
And so on .
Do n’t I remember that Hillary ’s husband used to smoke chunky interns — marijuana , I meant to say , marijuana — but did n’t inhale ?
Which is to say , as Mexicans know , drugs are about as illegal in the US as is the downloading of music .
It is punished by very light sentences for first - time users ( which of course means first - time caughters ) .
High - school kids get a week of community service ,  perhaps , which they regard as both amusing and a badge of honor .
In general , little real effort is made to apprehend respectable white transgressors .
In short , the WOD is a fraud .
In America the drug racket is a mildly disreputable business , tightly integrated into the economy , running smoothly , employing countless federal cops , prison guards , ineffectual rehab centers and equally ineffectual psychotherapists , and providing bribes to officials and huge deposits of laundered money to banks .
Narcos in the US do not engage in pitched battles with the army because they have no reason to .
The government barely inconveniences them .
So why should Mexico fight this war for Washington ?
In a column , Pat Buchanan addresses the violence in Mexico , and asks :  Which is the greater evil ?
Legalized narcotics for America ’s young or a failed state of 110,000 million on our southern border ?
Some choice .
Some country we ’ve become .
Some country indeed , on many grounds .
And the WOD might be a good idea if it did anything beyond keeping the price of drugs up .
But it does n’t .
I suggest two things to Pat :
First , Mexico suffers narco - violence only because Washington expects Mexico to do what Washington wo n’t .
Failed state ?
Take away the narco wars and Mexico is a reasonably successful upper - third - world nation .
If it fails , it will be because we pushed it into failure .
Second , America ’s young already have almost unlimited access to drugs .
Many students experiment with them .
Few become addicts .
Why ?
Because they do n’t want to .
How is that for simple ?
It is common sense ( the young actually do have some of it ) and not the DEA that prevents addiction .
Do you think that few kids become alcoholics because they need an ID to buy booze ?
( Wild thought : Maybe we ought to give America ’s young credit for not being complete morons .
Nah , never fly . )
Mexicans know all of the foregoing .
Remember that there is a steady flow of Mexican nationals in both directions across the border .
Americans are out of touch with Mexico , but Mexicans are not out of touch with America .
They also know , as Americans seem not to , that corruption runs wide and deep north of the Rio Bravo .
( A common story : when you cross the border illegally with the coyote , you wait behind a bush until the Border Patrol guy who has been bribed comes on duty . )
They know that when narcos can offer bribes running into the millions , American officials will accept them as readily as anyone else .
Would you refuse a million inflating green ones to unobserve a truck crossing the border ?
I would .
A business with that much money is n’t going to be shut down , obviously , which is why fifty years on , the WOD has accomplished exactly nothing .
And South America knows it .
The Latin American attitude toward the largely imaginary War on Drugs could be summed up thusly :  Solve your own problems , gringo .
We are n’t your mother .
Leave us alone .
Fat chance .

The Israeli military attacked civilians and medics and delayed - sometimes for hours - the evacuation of the injured during the January war in Gaza , according to an independent fact - finding mission commissioned by Israeli and Palestinian medical human rights groups .
Physicians for Human Rights - Israel and the Palestinian Medical Relief Society yesterday said their findings showed Israel 's military committed serious violations of international humanitarian law .
In their 92 - page report , compiled by five senior health experts from across the world , they documented several specific attacks , with interviews from 44 separate witnesses .
Human rights groups have accused Israel 's military , as well as Palestinian militants in Gaza , of war crimes .
" The underlying meaning of the attack on the Gaza Strip , or at least its final consequence , appears to be one of creating terror without mercy to anyone , " the report said .
In one incident , the researchers found a Palestinian , Muhammad Shurrab , 64 , and his sons Qassab , 28 , and Ibrahim , 18 , were shot by Israeli troops at close range without warning on 16 January during a ceasefire .
Qassab was hit in the face and died soon after .
Ibrahim was hit in the leg .
The soldiers refused to give medical aid , and only after 23 hours was an ambulance allowed to approach , by which time Ibrahim was also dead .
Yohanna Lerman , a lawyer with the medical rights groups , said although their report was a preliminary investigation this one case alone was enough to indict Israel 's political and military leaders .
The Israeli military has said it does not target civilians and is conducting its own investigations into some cases arising from the war .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
After about 30 hours of deliberation , a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second - degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago .
Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing .
Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square , Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced .
Now 69 , he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29 .
Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date , Spector quietly answered , " Yes . "
Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict , and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson 's family .
But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector 's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal .
" We do n't believe justice was done , " Weinberg said .
Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing , citing Spector 's years - long " pattern of violence " involving firearms .
Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict »
" This was not an isolated incident , " Fidler said , noting Spector 's two previous firearm - related convictions from the 1970s .
" The taking of an innocent human life , it does n't get any more serious than that . "
Spector 's wife , Rachelle , was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday , as was Clarkson 's mother , Donna .
Clarkson , 40 , was found dead , slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector 's Alhambra , California , mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003 .
A mistrial was declared in Spector 's first trial in September 2007 .
After deliberating 15 days , jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict .
Spector was also charged with second - degree murder in that trial .
Jurors deadlocked 10 - 2 in favor of conviction .
In closing arguments at the retrial , prosecutor Truc Do called Spector " a very dangerous man " who " has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women .
Lana just happened to be the sixth . "
Weinberg argued that the prosecution 's case hinged on circumstantial evidence .
He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out .
Do pointed out , however , to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done , the prosecutor said .
A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict .
" This entire jury took this so seriously , " she said with tears in her eyes , before adding that " it 's tough to be in a jury , " because another person 's life is in the jury 's hands .
Clarkson starred in the 1985 B - movie " Barbarian Queen " and appeared in many other films , including " DeathStalker , " " Blind Date , " " Scarface , " " Fast Times at Ridgemont High " and the spoof " Amazon Women on the Moon . "
She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood 's House of Blues at the time of her death .
In the 2007 trial , Spector 's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38 - caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector 's home .
But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace .
Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms .
His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home , pistol in hand , saying , " I think I killed somebody . "
Spector 's retrial began in October .
Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector .
Spector 's professional trademark was the " Wall of Sound , " the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner , Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s .

What do you think of this verdict ?
The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called " little symphonies for the kids " -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes ' " Be My Baby " and the Righteous Brothers ' " You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' . "
Spector co-produced the Beatles ' final album , " Let It Be , " and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up .
His recording of Harrison 's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year .
Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 , but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson 's death .

* Morales says World Bank demanded free - market reforms
* He says he would only accept unconditional aid
( Morales cancels appearance for health reasons in ninth paragraph )
UNITED NATIONS , April 22 ( Reuters ) - Bolivian President Evo Morales on Wednesday accused the World Bank of trying to " blackmail " his country several years ago by demanding free - market reforms in exchange for aid loans .
" In the first year of my government some World Bank representatives came to Bolivia and they tried to blackmail me , " Morales told reporters at U.N. headquarters , where he attended a General Assembly session that voted to establish an " International Mother Earth Day . "
" I said -- OK , if it 's unconditional help , fine , " he said through an interpreter .
" But if it 's conditioned on privatization of basic services , privatization of natural resources , then no . "
Morales , the country 's first Indian president and a fierce critic of the United States , said the World Bank has improved since that time by dropping such conditions on aid lending .
He also expressed his support for a thorough reform of the International Monetary Fund .
" I welcome Brazil and Argentina 's proposal to radically reform the IMF and I also welcome the World Bank 's change of attitude , " he said .
Morales , who attended last weekend 's Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago , gave no details of the Brazilian and Argentine proposal for reforming the IMF .
Brazil has called for emerging markets to have a greater voice inside the organization .
APPEARANCE CANCELED - HEALTH CITED
The Bolivian leader recalled a series of violent demonstrations that broke out in 2003 in South America 's poorest country after the government had raised taxes on gasoline and other items at the recommendation of the IMF in order to reduce its fiscal deficit .
" Our fiscal deficit did not improve and now ... without this huge tax on petrol , we 're doing better , " he said .
Morales was to have spoken at a church in New York 's Harlem neighborhood after his U.N. appearance but canceled a few minutes before he was to speak due to health reasons , said Carla Esposito , a counselor to Bolivia 's U.N. Mission .
She gave no details .
Morales , a socialist , has nationalized energy and telecommunications companies and has increased social spending , using some of the extra revenues the state now has to fund social programs .
The cornerstone of his pro-indigenous and leftist policies is a new constitution , which was approved in a referendum in January with more than 60 percent support .
Speaking about the global financial crisis , Morales voiced skepticism about the efficacy of stimulus plans the United States and other members of the so - called Group of 20 large developed and developing economies have proposed .
" The culprits of this financial crisis , this crisis of capitalism , will not solve it just by injecting money , because there has to be real support ( for economies ) , " he said .
" Many countries , many of us do not really believe in these stimulus packages with the G20 for example , " Morales said .

An 18 year - old mother killer whale Sharkan ( R ) swims along with her recently born baby in the Antibes Marineland amusement park near Nice , on the French riviera February 27 .
EG / CLH /
VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s killer whale population on the Pacific Coast remains at risk of extinction as its main food source continues to decline , a government panel said on Monday .
The resident killer whales living along the U.S. border south of Vancouver Island are considered endangered and the population that has dropped to 48 adult animals is expected to decline further , the panel said .
A separate group of resident killer whales found on the northern end of Vancouver Island is doing slightly better , but they are also considered threatened , according the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife .
The panel responsible for tracking the status of wildlife across Canada gave the whales the same designations when it last reviewed their condition in 2001 .
The whales .
also known as orcas , have suffered because of declining stocks of chinook salmon , their principal prey , as well as pollution and acoustical disturbance in the busy waterways .
Oscar - winning director to receive lifetime achievement award at UC Berkeley
Publishers Weekly journalist Kai-Ming Cha reports in her personal blog that Hayao Miyazaki , the director of the only feature - length Japanese animated film ( Spirited Away ) to have won an Oscar , will visit the United States in late July .
Miyazaki is making the rare American trip to receive the second annual Berkeley Japan Prize for lifetime achievement , presented by the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of California , Berkeley .
He will be presented with the award on July 25 , and will participate in a talk hosted by Japanese popular culture scholar Roland Kelts ( Japanimerica ) .
According to Cha , Miyazaki's contract with Disney requires him to make a U.S. appearance .
Japanese writer Haruki Murakami received the first Berkeley Japan Prize in October .
Miyazaki will receive his prize during the same weekend that Comic - Con International takes place in San Diego ( 500 miles or 800 kilometers south of Berkeley ) from July 23 to July 26 .
German car tuning company G - Power delivered the power with this BMW M6 , breaking the world record for fastest sedan at a top speed of 370 km/h or 231 mph .
Naming it the Hurricane CS , this is the fastest BMW coupe in the world with a powerful twin supercharged V10 engine delivering 750 hp and 590 ft-lbs of torque .
To get these astounding numbers out of a BMW , the engineers at G - Power had to install belt driven ASA T1 - 316 superchargers , and forged pistons from Mahle were used to reduce compression .
The pistons from Mahle are exactly the same weight as the stock pistons , however significantly stronger to handle the extra boost from the superchargers .
To optimize the V10 engine , a remapping of the ECU was needed for the superchargers .
To handle world record speeds for a production BMW M6 coupe , Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires in sizes 255/35 ZR19 are used in the front and 305/30 ZR19 tires in the rear .
If you plan on using the Hurricane CS for daily use , 21 ″ Silverstone Diamond wheels with tires that fit them respectively are used , however these wheels are only stable up to 211 mph .
A completely new titanium exhaust system was installed that weighs 53 lbs less than the stock unit , and carbon fiber seats were also added to reduce the weight by 26 lbs for each seat .
With the huge power gains and extra weight savings , this BMW M6 is able to reach 62 mph in 4.4 seconds , 124 mph in 9.6 seconds , and 187 mph in just 26 seconds .
With those kinds of speeds , G - Power needed to ensure the BMW would be able stop on a dime if the end of the track approached too soon .
So they switched the stock brakes with a 50 % lighter Carbon - Ceramic system , with 6 - piston calippers and large 380 mm brake discs .
A G-Power adjustable coilover suspension was added as well , and it has nine different settings the owner can use to set their desired comfort .
Exterior modifications include a multipart widebody aerodynamic kit which holds the new fenders , redesigned bumpers , vents in the hood , carbon fiber diffuser and wing package .
Now to own the worlds fastest production coupe , be ready to empty your pockets at $ 477,500 .
It 's a well - known story by now : Europe , the US , and plenty of other countries have made it generally illegal to circumvent DRM , even when users want to do something legal with the content .
Sure , it sounds bad and Ars complains about it all the time , but come on — do anticircumvention laws really prevent real people in the real world from doing real things with their content ?
Or are the complaints largely dreamed up by copyleft activists who would like nothing more than to see the term " intellectual property " disappear into the tentacled maw of Cthulhu ?
According to the first empirical study of its kind in the UK , by Cambridge law professor Patricia Akester , it 's the former .
DRM is so rage - inducing , even to ordinary , legal users of content , that it can even drive the blind to download illegal electronic Bibles .
Problems , problems everywhere
Akester 's new paper , " Technological accommodation of conflicts between freedom of expression and DRM : the first empirical assessment , " does pretty much what its title implies .
Akester spent the last few years interviewing dozens of lecturers , end users , government officials , rightsholders , and DRM developers to find how DRM and anticircumvention laws affected actual use .
Problems were not hard to find .
When Akester spoke with the UK's Royal National Institute of Blind People , Head of Accessibility Richard Orme told her that those with sight problem have the right " to create accessible copies of works " by using screen reading software , for instance , but these rights can be blocked be restrictive e-book DRM .
Analog " equivalents " are n't often equivalent in any meaningful sense of the word
" The RNIB is very watchful of the issues around DRM , " said Orme , " because it can see evidence of DRM preventing access to content in a world where digital technology actually makes information more accessible rather than less . "
As an example , take the case of Lynn Holdsworth , who bought an electronic copy of the Bible from Amazon .
It refused to allow text - to - speech , which Holdsworth required .
She contacted Amazon , which has a policy of not refunding e-books after a successful download .
" On Amazon ’s advice , Lynn Holdsworth contacted the publisher , but the publisher referred her back to Amazon , " writes Akester .
" Neither Amazon nor the publisher were able to assist her and she ended up obtaining an illegal copy of the work ( which her screen reader application could access ) . "
Rightsholders will always point out that fair use and other exemptions to copyright do n't necessarily allow access to any format the user wants .
Professors who need film clips can just camcord off the screen !
The blind can use Braille versions !
But analog " equivalents " are n't often equivalent in any meaningful sense of the word .
Holdsworth noted that " it is not always possible to resort to non-digital [ books ] because of their size .
She supplied an example : the standard version of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince contains about 600 pages , the large print version is only slightly bigger ( at 998 pages ) , but the Braille version actually entails ten large volumes of text . "
Libraries and lecturers
The British Library runs into issues with DRM on a daily basis — especially when it needs to transfer materials to new formats for storage or preservation .
Everybody that Akester spoke with had some problem of their own .
Film lecturers , who are allowed to put together clip compilations under UK law , still can't ( legally ) bypass the CSS encryption on DVDs .
Lecturers who do n't know how to bypass the DRM are faced with an unappealing choice : those " unable to extract a clip from a commercial DVD lodged in their library collection are forced to tailor the content of their lectures to the VHS materials at their disposal .
They contend that this happens frequently , given that most commercial DVDs are DRM protected . "
End users are allowed to time - shift programs , but Jill Johnstone of the National Consumer Council notes that " the way DRM is being used is causing serious problems for consumers , including unreasonable limitations on the use of digital products and infringement of consumer rights . "
And the British Library runs into issues with DRM on a daily basis — especially when it needs to transfer materials to new formats for storage or preservation .
Akester interviewed Ars Technica 's own Peter Bright , a British Library specialist on digital archiving , who pointed out just how ridiculous the whole situation has become , especially involving DVDs .
" For these duplicates and migrations to be useful , the DRM protection must necessarily be defeated .
The reality is that this is generally easy to do — for all the time and money spent on trying to protect optical discs , software workarounds are cheap , abundant and fairly reliable . ”
Edge cases
To DRM developers and rightsholders , though , these are just edge cases , not worth coding into DRM schemes .
Creating DRM that has any sort of security while still accommodating every legal use in every possible market is simply infeasible — though this does lead rightsholders to question the wisdom of DRM .
Shira Perlmutter of global music trade group IFPI told Akester in an interview , " You are not going to get a one size fits all DRM that will deal both with the consumer and the special interests exceptions and , in any case , you do not want to give up a system that works for 99 percent of cases because there is a particular issue with a particular kind of user when you can let the system work and then deal with that user . "
Are rightsholders willing to " deal with users " who experience problems ?
Some are , but Akester found that many require a legislative prod before taking any action .
The study confirms what anyone who has ever wanted to rip a DVD to their computer or iPod could have told you : DRM , coupled with anticircumvention laws , makes pirates of us all .
Akester offers some possible solutions to the problem .
They are worth reading , but they are also unlikely to be implemented for years .
In the meantime , copyright exceptions for the blind , libraries , teachers , and for fair use will continue to be limited by a crafty mixture of code and law .
Of course , as Bright points out , the massive lobbying , legislative , legal , and technical effort that underlies all these DRM regimes does so little to stop piracy that we'd be tempted to laugh at the folly of it all if we were n't already weeping .

Rick Santelli is a chump .
It pains me to say so .
I wanted so much to watch his infamous  Rant video on CNBC and say ,  Hear !
Hear !
But I cant bring myself to do it .
It s not that I take issue with his opposition to the Obama housing plan :
Absolutely , responsible homeowners who kicked in a hefty down payment on a 30 - year fixed mortgage should not have to bail out those who bought more house than they could afford .
But I wont be taking part in any  Chicago Tea Party  he might plan for this summer .
Santelli has walked straight into a trap , one I daresay Obama aides David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel cleverly set .
For all the popular support The Rant has garnered for Santelli , a backlash has developed .
 Watching Rick Santellis embarrassing diatribe at the expense of the American people made me realize that these Wall Street frat boys still dont get it ,  writes John Amato at the Huffington Post , echoing much of the left blogosphere .
 America is sick and tired of the riches they have manipulated out of the system and then be lectured by people who make more money than 100 middle class workers put together . 
That s pretty hard to respond to  unless you actually opposed the Wall Street bailouts , thus proving your laissez - faire bona fides .
But as near as I can tell , Santelli comes up way short on this measure .
Where are the YouTubes of him calling for a taxpayer revolt when the banks were getting bailed out ?
Hes a colorful enough speaker , hed surely have eclipsed the guys we know did criticize the bank bailouts like Peter Schiff , Jim Rogers , and Marc Faber .
And so , Santelli finds himself boxed in  billions for bankers , but not one cent for homeowners .
That s an impossible box to get out of .
Then Chris Matthews gets Santelli to fess up he voted for McCain ( who like Obama , voted for TARP I ) .
So The Rant now looks less like a courageous stand for personal responsibility and more like a petty partisan thing , red meat for the red states .
That s exactly how the White House planned it .
Obama didnt announce his housing program until more than a week after Tim Geithner released the TARP II turkey .
The banksters got theirs first .
Anyone who then turned around and opposed help for  the little people  without having first opposed help for the big boyz could be portrayed as cruel and heartless .
( Never mind that by cutting monthly payments , all the housing plan will accomplish is putting homeowners in further hock to their lenders .
So the banksters get theirs on this one too .
They always do . )
 Chicago Tea Party  ?
Please .
Santelli insults the memory of Samuel Adams .
The Best of Dave Gonigam
Sen .
Grassley is peeved over AIG bonuses ; a spokeswoman says he was speaking rhetorically .
Grassley on AIG execs : Quit or suicide
Sen .
Charles Grassley is so angry over AIG bonuses that he says the executives should resign or kill themselves .
In a comment aired this afternoon on WMT , an Iowa radio station , Grassley ( R - Iowa ) said : “ The first thing that would make me feel a little bit better towards them if they ’d follow the Japanese model and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say I ’m sorry , and then either do one of two things — resign , or go commit suicide . ”

The radio clip was also aired on WTOP , a news radio station in Washington .
In response to a POLITICO inquiry , Grassley spokeswoman Jill Gerber clarified Grassley ’s comments , saying “ clearly he was speaking rhetorically – he meant there ’s no culture of shame and acceptance of responsibility for driving a company into the dirt in this country .
If you asked him whether he really wants AIG executives to commit suicide , he ’d say of course not . ”
“ Point being , U.S. corporate executives are unapologetic about running their companies adrift , accepting billions of tax dollars to help , and then spending those tax dollars on travel , huge bonuses , etc , ” Gerber said .
Grassley ’s statement was the most over the top among the many expressions of outrage Monday , as the White House and Congress struggle to figure out how to recoup $ 165 million in bonuses from AIG , which has received more than $ 170 billion in federal bailout funds .
“ With millions of Americans out of work , staying up nights trying to figure out how to make this week ’s paycheck last until the next , wondering how they ’ll make the next mortgage payment or pay the overdue tuition bill , these executive bonuses are beyond outrageous , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Monday .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell joined the chorus , saying the bonuses were “ appalling . ”
Trashing AIG has become a no brainer for campaigners .
Jim Tedisco , a candidate in the special election for New York ’s 20th congressional district , says AIG “ poster child for Wall Street greed ” and wants a state investigation .
Rep. Phil Hare ( D - Ill . ) went for a play on words , saying : “ Clearly , the ‘ G ’ in AIG stands for greed .
It is outrageous that taxpayers are subsidizing bonuses as much as $ 6.5 million at a time when working families are struggling to make ends meet . ”
Nobody else has suggested hara kiri for AIG executives , and Grassley ’s spokeswoman tried to make clear the senator did n’t really mean it .

The upcoming Smart Memory Bra by Lisca lingerie senses a woman 's arousal through her body 's heat , then squeezes her boobs together accordingly .
We ask , does a pushup bra really need an off switch ?
The integrated memory foam bra reshapes under the influence of heat to enhance cleavage , making a woman more desirable when she 'd like to be desirable .
Or , you know , when she 's just a little sweaty .
There are , of course , a million ways this plan can backfire .
Imagine talking to your attractive boss at a party , feeling your breasts balloon into your chin and then realizing that , right beside him , stands his loving wife and children .
Her breasts , activated with the heat of rage instead of desire , swell as well .

Soon , every woman 's breasts in the company have enlarged to personal flotation device territory with the eligible bachelors in attendance having no clue which set of breasts is an invitation and which is but a coyly disguised land mine .
If you 're ready for this quasi- arousing social experiment that is Man 's future , the bra will be available in the UK this summer for about $ 40 .

A reason that so many lawyers are needed is that the reorganization , as envisioned by the automaker with support from the federal government , is complex .
The plan is to split G.M. ’s good assets from the bad assets , with the idea that the part owning the good assets would be a viable company because it would not be burdened with the other businesses .
G.M. would sell desirable brands like Chevrolet and Cadillac to a new company , which would emerge from bankruptcy protection in a few months ’ time .
Less - attractive assets and liabilities would remain with the old G.M. , and eventually be liquidated .
For the last several months , G.M. had retained the services of two of the biggest bankruptcy players to help guide it into Chapter 11 : Harvey R. Miller of Weil , Gotshal & Manges and Martin Bienenstock of Dewey & LeBoeuf .
Mr. Miller and his team are the company ’s principal legal counsel for its bankruptcy filing ; but it will not represent the new version of G.M. once that is created , as there is a potential conflict between parties with an interest in the existing company and those with interests in the new company .
Mr. Bienenstock , a former partner of Mr. Miller ’s at Weil , was brought in last fall to help create the company ’s restructuring plan .
He may end up representing the new G.M. , although the decision has not been made .
The law firm Cravath , Swaine & Moore , meanwhile , is representing G.M. ’s board .
The restructuring also will provide work for many professional groups other than lawyers .
G.M. , for example , has retained the services of Jay Alix , the co-founder of AlixPartners , the consulting firm .
Mr. Alix , who came out of retirement to help G.M. , worked with Mr. Bienenstock on the plan for a new G.M. , according to people briefed on the matter .
For financial and restructuring advice , the carmaker has turned to investment bankers at Evercore Partners , led by a cofounder , Roger Altman , and the restructuring co-head , William Repko , and to Morgan Stanley .

The government ’s auto task force has its own advisers , led by the former investment bankers Steven Rattner and Ron Bloom .
The team also has brought in several restructuring veterans , notably Matthew Feldman , formerly a partner at the law firm Willkie , Farr & Gallagher , and Harry Wilson , formerly an executive at the distressed - debt - focused hedge fund Silver Point Capital .

Court declares Franken winner but Coleman refuses to concede Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday April 14 , 2009
Print This Email This UPDATE ( at bottom ) : Scarborough tells Coleman , " You lost ... It is over "
Al Franken moved one step closer to being seated in the U.S. Senate after a Minnesota court unanimously ruled in his favor late Monday that he was the victor in the November election .
Norm Coleman , though has already given strong indications that he will appeal the ruling , which could drag out the matter for several months more .
The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the three judge panel " soundly defeated " incumbent Coleman 's argument that " the election and its aftermath were fraught with systemic errors that made the results invalid . "
" The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the Nov. 4 , 2008 , election was conducted fairly , impartially and accurately , " the panel wrote in its unanimous decision , which can be read here .
Franken emerged from the statewide recount , which Coleman asked for , ahead by a greater number of votes ( 312 ) than before the recount .
" I am honored and humbled by this close victory , " Franken said after the rulilng .
" And it 's long past time we got to work . "
Despite a Coleman pledge to appeal the ruling , the three Minnesota judges ' careful and deliberate rejection of Coleman 's legal arguments does not leave him much room to go on in an appeal , speculate legal experts .
" It is the kind of opinion that is unlikely to be disturbed on appeal by either the Minnesota Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court , " said Richard Hasen , an expert on election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles to The Star Tribune .
" The opinion considers the major arguments made by Coleman and rejects them in a detailed and measured way . "
" This is judicial speak for ' nothing here , ' and it is most definitely aimed at the appeals process , " said University of Minnesota political scientist Lawrence Jacobs to The Star Tribune .
" It 's a signal that they are supremely unimpressed by the Coleman case . "
Whatever Coleman 's legal arguments might be , he is still receiving considerable support from his Republican brethren , including Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty , who has said that he would n't sign Franken 's election certificate until Coleman has had a chance to go through the appeals process .
" It s worth remarking a bit on the incredible solidarity the Minnesota GOP is showing with their colleagues  broader interest in obstructing the inevitable here , " writes Think Progress ' Matthew Yglesias .
" Representatives John Kline , Erik Paulsen , and Michele Bachmann , along with Governor Tim Pawlenty , are all seeing their quest to get Minnesotas fair share of pork and other parochial interests undermined by the fact that their state only has one Senator .
UPDATE : Scarborough tells Coleman , " You lost ... It is over "
From Huffington Post's Sam Stein :
" In the wake of a three - judge panel declaring that Al Franken was the leading vote - getter of the U.S. Senate election , MSNBC's Joe Scarborough offered a preemptive and withering criticism of Coleman 's likely appeal of that decision to the state Supreme Court .
" ' Seriously .
Norm , I like you .
You lost .
Okay , ' he said .
' Can we seat a senator so Amy [ Klobuchar ] does n't have to do the job of two Senators ?
It is seriously not fair to constituents in Minnesota to drag this out any longer .
It is over Norm , okay .
It is over . '
" Ouch .
Somewhere in the halls of the DSCC , people are cheering . "

This is the seventh in our series of FrontlineSMS guest posts .
Here , Anthony Papillion – Founder of OpenEMR HQ – discusses his initial thoughts on being introduced to the software , and outlines his plans for its use in his Oklahoma home town to help women suffering domestic violence
“ I only recently became involved with the FrontlineSMS project as an addition to a national project my company , OpenEMR HQ , is doing with a small African country .
But , since discovering the software , I ’ve been busily thinking of good ways it could be put to use by organizations in my own community and I ’ve come up with a few I believe are viable .
Today , I want to share one of those ideas and how we ’re going to use FrontlineSMS as a tool to help combat violence against women in the United States , specifically , in the small community of Miami , Oklahoma .
Cause for concern
Every year , millions of American women face domestic violence at the hands of those that are supposed to love and protect them .
These women often feel powerless and suffer continued abuse without ever reaching out because they either do n’t know the resources are out there or because they ’re scared nothing will be done to their abusers if they do come forward thereby encouraging even more abuse .
Community crisis centers serve as a front line of defense in these situations often shuttling abused women out of dangerous situations and into safe houses , interfacing with police to make sure victims get the services and protection they need , and providing the much needed emotional support those who ’ve escaped violent situations are so desperately in need of .
Unfortunately , none of those things can be offered until the victim reaches out and getting abused women to take the first step can be a large part of the battle .
Many women do n’t think or have a safe way to catalog the abuse , do n’t know how to report it , and do n’t want calls to crisis numbers showing up on the mobile phone bill .
The end result is the complete isolation of these women from any help at all .
Seeking solutions
As I ’ve been playing around with FrontlineSMS , I ’ve been thinking about ways it could be used to address these situations and I ’m slowly starting to piece together a system called CPR that I hope to soon have deployed locally as a test bed for a larger , maybe statewide system .
The basic idea is to give women a quick , easy , and safe way to report and catalog abuse , and reach out for either police or crisis worker help , all without ever making a traceable phone call .
Piecing together a system that consists of a laptop running FrontlineSMS , a mobile phone , and a few PHP scripts sitting on an Internet connection , I ’m creating a system where women can send messages to various help authorities or just record instances of abuse for later use in court .
For example :
C <A message that she wants to send to a crisis counselor >
P < A message she wants to send to a police officer >
R < A message she wants to be recorded for later use in court detailing an abusive incident >
Using the CPR system , women in dangerous situations can quietly and safely reach out for help when a phone call simply is n’t possible .
Using FrontlineSMS will allow both police and crisis agencies to have two way communication with the victim thereby ensuring the communication loop is never broken .
Building the vision
Since I ’m still developing the system , I ’ve not deployed an installation of it yet but I ’ve been getting great feedback from various agencies I ’ve spoken to .
Eventually , I ’d like to implement a way for victims to send pictures , video , and audio , and have it automatically attached to their case file within the CPR system for later use in court .
That will come later and probably with some community help .
None of this would be possible without FrontlineSMS .
While I am a professional software developer , I probably would never have developed a system like FrontlineSMS and the fact that it ’s available as open source makes it incredibly accessible .
I ’ll be sure to keep everyone up to date on how this project is coming along as it progresses .
I ’ll also be sure to blog about how we ’re using FrontlineSMS in our Vision Africa project being launched very soon .
Until then , feel free to send your feedback or make comments to this post .
Thank you ” .

The Cocktail Party Effect
• Next article in this series : The Attentional Spotlight • Previous article :
For psychologists the ‘ cocktail party effect ’ is our impressive and under - appreciated ability to tune our attention to just one voice from a multitude .
At a party when bored with our current conversational partner — and for the compulsive eavesdropper — allowing the aural attention to wander around the room is a handy trick .
Perhaps only the most recidivist eavesdroppers are aware how special this ability is .
But even they might be surprised — and worried — by just how much we can miss in the voices we decide to tune out .
Close your eyes and concentrate
Our ability to separate one conversation from another is beautifully demonstrated in a classic study carried out by Colin Cherry , then at Imperial College London ( Cherry , 1953 ) .
Cherry used the simple method of playing back two different messages at the same time to people , under a variety of conditions .
In doing so he discovered just how good we are at filtering what we hear .
In the first set of experiments he played back two different messages voiced by the same person through both ears of a pair of headphones and asked participants to ‘ shadow ’ one of the two messages they were hearing by speaking it out loud , and later by writing it down .
To accomplish this task , Cherry reports , participants had to close their eyes and concentrate hard .
When doing this they could , with effort , and while hearing the clips over and over again , separate one of the messages from the other .
With the two voice presented together , as though the same person were standing in front of you saying two completely different things at the same time , this task appears to be very hard , but still possible .
Pushing participants further Cherry found he could confuse listeners , but only by having both messages consist entirely of nonsensical platitudes .
Only then were participants unable to pick apart one message from the other .
Receiving you loud and clear
The real surprise , though , came in the second set of experiments .
For these Cherry fed one message to the left ear and one to the right ear — and once again both messages were voiced by the same speaker .
Suddenly participants found the task incredibly easy .
Indeed many were surprised how easily and accurately they could tune in to either one of the messages , and even shift their attention back and forth between the two .
No longer did they have to close their eyes and furrow their brows – this was much easier .
What participants were experiencing here seems much closer to most people ’s experience of picking out one conversation from a multitude .
At a party people are arrayed all around us and their conversations come from various different directions .
We seem to be able to use this information to reject all but the one in which we are interested .
I ’m sorry , what were you saying ?
Although we are fantastically good at tuning in to one conversation over all the others , we seem to absorb very little information from the conversations we reject .
That ’s where it can get embarrassing .
Cherry found his participants picked up surprisingly little information presented to the other , ‘ rejected ear ’ , often failing to notice blatant changes to the unattended message .
When asked afterwards , participants :
could not identify a single phrase from the speech presented to the rejected ear .
were n’t sure the language in the rejected ear was even English .
failed to notice when it changed to German .
mostly did n’t notice when the speech to the rejected ear was being played backwards ( though some did report that it sounded a bit strange ) .
Across all the different conditions tried there were only two aspects of the speech to the rejected ear the participants could reliably identify .
The first was that it was speech compared to a tone , the second was when the speaker suddenly changed from male to female .
This does n’t bode at all well for people with a habit of tuning out of conversations when they lose interest ( you know who you are ! ) .
If you really are listening to someone else it ’s likely you wo n’t hear a word of what ’s being said to you directly .
One study has found that two - thirds of people do n’t even notice when their own name is slipped into the unattended speech , while those who do notice are likely to be of the extremely distractable variety ( Conway , Cowan & Bunting , 2001 ) .
You have been warned !

Dog 's killing reopens old wounds for former Navy SEAL Survivor of war loses dog to random violence
Beloved pet 's killing reopens old wounds for former Navy SEAL
Dasy , a Lab , was shot April 1 at age 4 . ﻿

All it took was the gunshot fired outside his Walker County home to trigger training ingrained in former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell , the lone survivor of a dramatic battle in Afghanistan in 2005 .
He did a sweep through the house .
Checked on his mother .
And bolted out the door , where he found dead his beloved Labrador retriever , Dasy , a dog given to him to help him recover from his own wounds and the loss of his fellow Navy comrades .
“ I could tell she tried to get away because there was a blood trail , ” Luttrell recalled in a phone interview Wednesday .
“ When I saw she was dead , the only thing that popped into my head was , ‘ I ’ve got to take these guys out . ’ ”
Shrouded in darkness , Luttrell , who ’d just been released from the hospital after another round of surgery , crawled under a fence , skirted a ditch and sneaked up on four strangers in a sedan who apparently killed the dog on a whim .
Luttrell said they were oblivious as he raised a 9 mm pistol from about 25 yards away and had one of them dead to rights .
But as the car pulled away , he did n’t fire .
Instead , he scrambled back to his pickup and launched what became a wild 40 - mile chase that reached speeds of over 100 mph and crossed three counties .
“ I did everything right ; I did n’t do anything wrong , ” he told the Houston Chronicle of the April 1 incident .
“ Make sure everyone knows they cold - bloodily murdered . ”
Luttrell stayed on the line with a 911 emergency operator as he tried to catch the car , which was just a bit too fast for his four - door truck to overtake .
“ I told them , ‘ You need to get somebody out here because if I catch them I ’m going to kill them , ’ ” Luttrell recalled telling the operator .
Wounds still deep
The nighttime killing of a such a special dog played right into Luttrell ’s deep wounds .
The 4 - year - old yellow Lab was given to him upon his return from the war to help him heal .
He named it Dasy as an acronym for his SEAL team members lost in a mighty fight in which they were isolated and far outnumbered by Taliban fighters .
He wrote a book , The Lone Survivor , about the experience .
Luttrell said he still wrestles with what he went through .
He does n’t sleep at night , usually keeping his guard up until sunrise , just in case .
“ I do n’t talk about it much .
I just do n’t sleep at night , ” he said .
“ I am in and out of the house all night , going , moving around . ”
Luttrell and the men he was chasing were finally stopped by Onalaska Police Department .
Luttrell said he confronted the men .
“ I was like , ‘ Which one of you guys killed my dog ? ’ ” he said .
“ They started talking smack . ”
The police sent Luttrell home , and the Texas Rangers have been working with the Walker County Sheriff ’s Department .
So far , two men have been charged with felonies that could land them in state jail for at least six months .
Michael John Edmonds II , 21 , and Alfonzo Hernandez , 24 , both of New Waverly , are charged with cruelty to nonlivestock animals .
The driver of the vehicle was arrested on suspicion of not having a license .
Other dog killings linked
There are at least five area dog killings in recent months that could be linked to the case , said Texas Ranger Steven Jeter .
“ It could have been worse for both parties involved , ” he said .
“ I would n’t advocate to the general public to do what he has done — to follow them at that rate of speed . ”
“ Marcus is trained to do certain things ; he fell back on his training , ” Jeter said .
Luttrell said he ’s left town for now and wants to stay as far away as he can .
Talking from a place he described as “ the middle of nowhere , ” Luttrell said he knows the attack on Dasy pushed him to a place where he does n’t want to be .
“ I was trying to talk myself out of being who I am , ” he said .
“ Talking to myself about not doing the one thing I am good at . ”

How is Amazon Profiting Every Quarter from a Dying Industry ?
Amazon 's profits are up 30 % this quarter from last year , and everybody wants to know what is it they are doing right , considering the fact that publishers are going out of business left and right and so Amazon CAN 'T be selling books .
So what is it ?
Why is Amazon so goddamned successful right now , when everybody else is tanking ?
If the bookstore is n't selling books , what are they selling ?
From Publisher 's Weekly " Amazon continued to roar along despite the recession , reporting an increase in total revenue of 18 % , to $ 4.89 billion , in the first quarter ended March 31 , and net income rose to $ 177 million from $ 143 million .
Gains would have been higher if the impact of currency translations is excluded .
Unfortunately for publishers , however , the gains were driven by the retailer 's electronics and other general merchandise segment in both North America and abroad , which had gains of 42 % and 34 % , respectively .
" So it turns out that all of their profits are coming from their " electronics " department , which includes their 400 dollar Kindle , and all of its fun accessories , like full price ebooks .
But this does n't even make sense .
Sure , the Kindle is selling well , but it is hardly flying off the shelves like an Apple product , especially in this economy where people can barely afford vehicles to get them to their jobs , where paying half a grand for a " book machine " is the sort of joke that a man with a bowler hat and curly mustache would tell on stage before blowing into a kazoo .
There IS one way it all adds up , however , without assuming that Amazon is dealing cocaine on the side ( if you like " WEED , " here are some other selections you may enjoy : " GLUE , " " HEROIN , " " TWILIGHT , " by Stephenie Meyer ) : it all adds up if you know that Amazon 's Kindle 2 only costs $ 185 to make , meaning that Amazon is turning a 51 % profit on each unit , in addition to strong - arming publishing companies into accepting full DEE - ARGH - RIM jobs for their Kindle books , meaning that any people with any sense are reluctant to buy them .
Dang , man , so that means that unlike video game systems where companies take a huge loss on the console in order to sell cartridges ( you know , so developers will make cartridges for their machines and people will have enough money leftover in their pockets to buy them ( you know , so the profits are spread around between video game manufacturers and software companies ( you know , so that the whole industry does n't crap out completely ) ) )
Amazon is actually charging DOUBLE for the Kindle 2 , as if they know that it is all a big con , as if they know that if they do n't profit from ebook madness now , no one ever will .
Dang , man , what if bookstores charged admission at the door ?

NEW YORK , May 28 ( Reuters ) -
One of eight U.S. households with a mortgage ended the first quarter late on loan payments or in the foreclosure process in a crisis that will persist for at least another year until unemployment peaks , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Thursday .
U.S. unemployment in April reached its highest rate in more than a quarter century and is still rising , helping propel mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures to record highs .
Such economic weakness drove up foreclosures of prime fixed - rate loans , which are made to the most creditworthy borrowers .
The foreclosure rate on those loans doubled in the last year and represented the largest share of new foreclosures in the first three months of this year .
“ We clearly have n’t hit the top yet in terms of delinquencies or the bottom of the housing market , ” Jay Brinkmann , the association ’s chief economist , said in an interview .
The pace of defaulting mortgages jumped despite various moratoriums and government steps to cut home loan rates .
Rates on 30 - year mortgages averaged 5.00 percent in March , 5.13 percent in February and 5.05 percent in January , according to home funding company Freddie Mac .
A year earlier , the average monthly rates were bumping up closer to 6 percent .
“ The housing market depends on the employment situation , ” Brinkmann said , “ and we do n’t expect unemployment to bottom out until the middle of next year , so then normally housing would not recover until after employment recovers . ”
A record 12.07 percent of loans on one - to - four unit residences were at least one payment late or in the foreclosure process , on a non-seasonally adjusted basis .
Prime fixed - rate loans comprise 65 percent of the $ 9.9 trillion in outstanding first mortgages , according to the industry group .
Foreclosure actions were started on an all - time high 1.37 percent of first mortgages in the quarter , a record increase from 1.08 percent the prior quarter .
“ It ’s an important reminder that just because the housing market was one of the causes of recession ... it wo n’t be the first sector of the economy to return to normal , ” said Jed Kolko , associate director of research at the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco .
Federal mortgage modification and refinance programs will keep delinquencies and foreclosures from spiking even more than they would otherwise , housing analysts said .
“ Even if the recession officially ended soon , in the sense of GDP turning positive again , the continued rising unemployment rate and the re-set of existing adjustable - rate mortgages would continue to aggravate both foreclosures and delinquencies , ” Kolko said .
The share of loans in the foreclosure process rose to a record 3.85 percent from 3.30 percent in the fourth quarter and 2.47 percent a year earlier .
California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada accounted for nearly half of the new foreclosure activity in the quarter and half of the increase in prime fixed - rate foreclosure starts .
Those severely hit states , the biggest winners in the five - year housing boom earlier this decade , continue to worsen as recession overtakes problems spawned by lax lending standards .
“ Every job loss , every divorce , every incident like that is going to be turning into a foreclosure because they are so far under water with the homes already , ” Brinkmann said .
When a house is “ under water , ” its price has fallen below the size of the mortgage .
Average U.S. home prices swooned more than 32 percent in March from the 2006 peak , according to Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller indexes .
Foreclosures mounted in the first quarter even though various temporary moratoriums were in place to delay the failure of distressed loans .
The freezes artificially tempered new foreclosures before federal loan modification programs took root .
But loans that had already been modified often re-defaulted in the quarter , Brinkmann said .
Foreclosure actions also were taken on vacant homes , which make up as much as 40 percent of the properties with failing mortgages , he added .
Some loan servicers also began the foreclosure process on borrowers who clearly did not qualify under the various mortgage fixes , he said .
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis , the delinquency rate dipped to 8.22 percent from 8.63 percent .
The bankers ’ group noted that the late payment rate always declines in the first quarter due to seasonal factors and said that after such adjustments , the rate jumped to a record 9.12 percent .
STI rates have been increasing among people over 45 Many middle - aged people are continuing to take an irresponsible attitude to their sexual health , say experts .
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain polled over 2,000 adults .
Nearly a fifth of those polled aged 45 to 54 said they had had unprotected sex with someone other than a long - term partner in the past five years .
There is a misconception that their risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) is " next to nothing " , says the RPSGB .
Sexually transmitted infections have doubled in under a decade in people over 45 and have been rising at a faster rate than in the young , recent figures from the Health Protection Agency show .
Infections do n't discriminate on the basis of age
Heidi Wright , RPSGB spokeswoman
Older people are increasingly likely to be single or undergoing relationship changes and are less likely to consistently use condoms , perhaps because the risk of pregnancy no longer exists , experts have observed .
The RPSGB 's survey of 2,258 UK adults - half who were aged 45 plus - found older generations were flippant about the risks of catching an STI .
Naughty 40s
A quarter of the 45 - 54 - year - olds surveyed said they did not use contraception as they trusted the person they were sleeping with not to have an STI , with one in 10 saying they did not like the feeling of condoms .
Nearly a third surveyed described their risk of getting an STI when having unprotected sex with a new partner or someone other than their current partner as unlikely or very unlikely .
A further 20 % believed that their chances of picking up an infection were " next to nothing " .
Double the number of over 55s ( 25 % ) believed their chances of acquiring an STI from unprotected sex were next to nothing , compared to 13 % of those aged 18 - 24 .
RPSGB spokeswoman Heidi Wright said : " The majority of safe sex messages are targeted at teenagers , but as more adults begin new relationships later in life , they quite clearly need advice too .
" You can't always tell who has an STI and infections do n't discriminate on the basis of age . "
She said local pharmacies were an excellent source of sexual health advice and support .
Lisa Power of the Terrence Higgins Trust said : " Teenagers are n't the only people who think they 're immune from harm .
" Whatever your age , if you have a new sexual partner or more than one , condoms should be a basic part of ensuring your sexual health and theirs .
" It 's more embarrassing to get an infection than to use a condom . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said : " The message is the same for everyone - anyone having unprotected sex potentially puts themselves at risk of an STI .
" Infections rates have risen in all age groups , including older people .
" Older people also need to be aware of the need to use condoms consistently , particularly those who are newly single and entering relationships with new partners . "

Mexican authorities have detained 27 high - ranking officials — including 10 mayors , a judge and an aide to the governor of Michoacan — on suspicion of corruption and cooperation with infamous drug cartels .
These latest arrests come just a few short days after members of the Mihoacan drug cartel known as La Familia were detained .
La Familia is largely considered to be one of the most violent drug gangs in Mexico .
President Felipe Calderón began his war against the drug cartels in this very same state in 2006 , when he launched his first offensive against the narcotraffickers .
Although authorities are no stranger to the high - level corruption and penetration of the drug cartels ( even Mexico 's former drug czar was arrested last year ) , this roundup marks the largest arrest of mayors in the country 's history .
Among those arrested included the mayor of Uruapan , a town that became infamous when hit men dumped five human heads on the dance floor of a local bar back in 2006 .

Lewis Hamilton has been stripped of his third place finish in the season - opening Australian Grand Prix after the world champion and his team were judged to have provided ' misleading ' evidence during a post - race stewards ' hearing .
The British driver had finished fourth on the road , but was moved up a position when original third place finisher Jarno Trulli was handed a 25 - second penalty for having overtaken Hamilton behind the safety car .
However , following the discovery of new evidence , believed to be radio transmissions from the Toyota and McLaren teams , the race stewards convened a fresh hearing in Malaysia this afternoon to discuss the matter .
It is believed the radio transmissions contradicted the original statements presented to the stewards by Hamilton and McLaren .
A statement issued by the stewards said : " The Stewards having considered the new elements presented to them from the 2009 Australian Formula One Grand Prix , consider that driver No 1 Lewis Hamilton and the competitor Vodafone McLaren Mercedes acted in a manner prejudicial to the conduct of the event by providing evidence deliberately misleading to the Stewards at the hearing on Sunday 29th March 2009 , a breach of Article 151c of the International Sporting Code .
" Under Article 158 of the International Sporting Code the driver No 1 Lewis Hamilton and the competitor Vodafone McLaren Mercedes are excluded from the race classification for the 2009 Australian Grand Prix and the classification is amended accordingly . "
Further to the Hamilton decision , the race stewards have scrapped the penalty against Trulli and he has now been awarded third place for the Australian Grand Prix .

Have you heard the news ?
Kevin Smith is working with Netflix to bring Masters of the Universe back !
That got us thinking about our old He - Man toys .
Unlike my Star Wars toys and Legos , somehow my Masters of the Universe toys did n’t make it past my childhood .
I seem to remember a lot of them breaking at the limbs .
Since top ten lists are popular and generate a lot of controversy on social media among Internet geeks who take this stuff seriously , lets take a trip back to 1982 at the very earliest and look at the best , and the worst , He - Man toys .
By the power of Grayskull , I have the power !
10 . Snake Mountain
Skeletor ’s home had an awesome facade and plenty of fun features , but was n’t a must - have playset .
Regardless , I was jealous of anyone who had it .
9. Teela
Teela was cool because she was a hot chick with a snake staff .
Since She - Ra was n’t around yet , He - Man had to get it on with someone , and I do n’t think Man - At - Arms swung that way ( although I had my suspicions about Ram Man ) .
8. Man-E-Faces
Human , robot , monster !
Man-E -Faces was three different guys in one .
7. Wind Raider
There were n’t too many cool vehicles released , and the Wind Raider was about as good as it got , considering it was He - Man ’s main vehicle .
There were a couple others released years later that were okay , like the Roton , but not nearly as popular .
6. Man-At-Arms
Man -At - Arms was He - Man ’s right - hand man .
5. Trap Jaw
Trap Jaw was cool because he had so many moving parts .
While he was n’t as popular as other villains , like Beast Man , there was more to do with him .
4. Battle Cat
If you had He - Man , you had to have his trusty feline friend , Battle Cat .
Skeletor also had a cat called Panthor , and his skin was purple felt , which was kind of strange to play with .
3. Skeletor
The second most essential character to have .
2. He -Man
The original He - Man was the best and obviously the essential character .
Not having this guy would be like having Star Wars toys without Luke Skywalker .
1. Castle Grayskull
This was the only cool playset that they released .
Of course , it ’s utterly pointless without the action figures , but that front facade makes it the most awesome of these toys ( the trap door inside kind of got boring after a while , though ) .
Bonus : Three Worst He -Man Toys
3. Battle Armor He -Man/ Skeletor
How dumb was this ?
You punched them in the chest , and that part of the armor got ‘ damaged . ’
Some people will say this is the best toy , but to me it was nothing short of a gimmick that fell flat .
I had it .
It sucked .
2. Orko
This character made the Master of the Universe franchise not cool , and the toy was even worse .
It had one of those zipper - like thingies where you pulled it and he randomly moved around .
1. Prince Adam
Who in the hell would want to own Prince Adam ?
That ’s like wanting a Bruce Banner toy , or a Clark Kent doll .
… and , of course , we ’ve gotta conclude with the cartoon intro :
Microsoft's Patch Tuesday came and went yesterday , bringing 23 fixes for a number of issues with its popular Office programs Excel and Word .
At least several of these have been marked critical and most users should certainly consider the download .
( Source : theregister.co.uk )
The most critical of the patches fixes an Excel flaw that could potentially allow a hacker to take remote control of an unpatched system .
If an unprotected user opens a malicious and specially crafted Excel file , they could find their computer controlled by someone else effectively exploiting something called an Unspecified Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Excel .
Those PC users employing Microsoft Office editions for the years 2002 , 2003 , and 2007 should apply the fix .
Even Mac users online with Microsoft Office 2004 and 2008 are vulnerable , an MS bulletin suggests .
( Source : cnet.com )
Remote Code Execution Threatens Office , Explorer
Similar remote execution flaws in WordPad and other Office utilities are also being patched with this most recent download .
Word users running 2000 or 2002 editions of the popular word processing tool are most encouraged to update .
Given that this is exam time at most universities across North America , it might be a good idea for students to follow the advice .
Windows 2000 , XP , XP Professional , and Windows Server 2003 users are also informed that they are vulnerable to a remote attack .
The patch hardly stops there , however .
Microsoft 's ubiquitous Internet Explorer browser is also vulnerable to a series of four critical issues , which collectively could lead to a remote code execution .
This time the problem is n't linked to a malicious file , but a specially constructed web site that has the potential to attack a server through HTTP .
Internet Explorer 5 through 7 are affected .
" We were astonished ... "
Say Security Experts
Other remote code execution fixes have been included addressing issues in DirectX 8 and 9 .
A less likely hack for Windows OS versions from 2000 to Vista and Server 2003 and 2008 have also been fixed ; although the issue requires a hacker to log onto a system themselves before running a malicious application , it 's still worth updating just in case your computer is lost , stolen , or misplaced .
( Source : pcmag.com )

Strip steak recipe
A perfectly cooked steak at home is n't as hard as it sounds .
In fact it can be a lot easier than trying to get one at a restaurant ( especially if you do n't want to pay north of $ 40 for the hunk of cow ) .
We first saw this technique on America 's Test Kitchen and have only had success with it .
It 's not the only way to cook a steak , but if you do n't have access to a grill or a restaurant grade broiler it 's your best bet .
This technique works well for other cuts besides strip steaks , but this is your best place to start .
The bone in cuts like a porterhouse can make cooking tricky ( meat on either side of the bone cooks at different speeds ) .
A strip steak has great beef flavor and is fairly light on the wallet which are two big things we look for .
The general concept with this technique is to gently heat the beef through to an almost - done temperature and then quickly sear the outside for a nice crust .
You 've probably heard you should take a steak ( or really any meat ) out for a while before you cook it to " get the chill off " .
This is that concept on steroids -- instead of slapping a 38 º piece of muscle into a hot pan we will end up putting a 95 º piece of meat into a hot pan .
Since it cooks so shortly on the stove top the resulting steak is almost your desired doneness ( in our case on the cool side of the medium rare fence ) without the outside being overdone and the inside still raw .
We do n't use a thermometer for steak anymore ( all that 's needed is a quick jab with an index finger ) , but there 's no shame in it and it 's certainly better than ruining a nice cut of meat .
If you 'd like to learn how to tell doneness by touch , Men 's Health has some great illustrations that should get you started .
Recipe
Ingredients 1 or more NY strip steaks at least an inch thick , if cooking more than one steak try to get them as close to the same thickness as you can
Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon of a neutral oil ( such as peanut ) Instructions Remove steak from refrigerator and season it liberally with kosher salt and pepper , place on a cooling rack inside of a half sheet pan
Pre-heat the oven to 275 º
Cook steak in oven until its internal temperature is around 90 - 95 º , approximately 20 - 25 minutes but it will vary based on the thickness of your steak .
The end product will appear somewhat dried out and brown but should not appear cooked ( or all that appetizing quite frankly ) .
Heat a heavy bottomed skillet on high - heat , use enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan
Once oil just begins to smoke , cook steak on each side for a couple minutes without moving it ( this allows a crust to form ) .
If your steak is extra thick add time to cook steak on the side .
Place the steak on a cutting board and tent with foil , let stand 10 minutes and serve Variations
If you 'd like to cook your steak to a higher degree of doneness , just add some oven time .
While the steak is resting is a great time to make a quick pan sauce .
Simply deglaze the pan with a liquid ( water , stock , wine , etc ) , add some fat ( butter or cream ) , and seasoning .
Maybe some shallots too .
Finish with a pat of butter and your sauce will have a gloss just like the pros .
Just be careful that if you use alcohol it has the tendency to flame up -- many eye brows have been lost during a pan sauce .

Suppose you have been sub - contracted by a video game company , say Nintendo , to come up with an low power , low - memory , implementation of a popular video game , say , an installment of the infamous Pokémon series .
The envisaged device is very slow ( it has a 2MHz processor ) but has a 220 ×176 pixels color screen capable of displaying 32768 different colors .
It also has a hardware sprite mode , but sprites are limited to 4 distinct colors .
You have to encode the complete database of Pokémons , which are several hundreds , in as little space as possible .
Each image vary somewhat in size , but can only have 4 distinct colors from the possible palette of 32768 colors .
A typical Pokémon would look like :
Since the artists put a lot of efforts into drawing the critters in 4 colors , and because of the hardware requirements , you cannot use a compression algorithm that modifies or creates more colors than the original image had , therefore excluding JPEG .
Moreover , the JPEG codec would be too complex to port to the platform considered .
You must therefore use a simple lossless codec .
We will be comparing 5 codecs for the Pokémon image database .
We will be looking at a “ block ” codec , which will serve as a comparison for a non-RLE codec .
We will be looking at 5 variations on the theme of run length encoding , or RLE , namely , the All Counts , the Bit Select , and Auto - Trigger RLE .
The last variant will help Auto - Trigger RLE by using predictors , transforming the input image into one that is easier to compress using RLE .
First , let us describe the physical properties of the images .
In the images , there are only four colors drawn from a possible set of 32768 .
For each image , still assuming lossless coding , we will have 45 bits dedicated for the color palette .
One could think that four 15 - bits color would mean 60 bits total , but one can be removed ( coded implicitly ) since one of the colors is always white ; therefore only 45 bits are necessary .
The physical dimensions of the images vary but never exceeds 64×64 .
Assuming a - 1 bias ( so that sizes 1 to 64 are encoded using 0 to 63 ) , only 12 bits are necessary to encode the image sizes .
So , whatever the compression used , we have 12+45=57 bits of overhead before encoding the image itself .
The Block Compressor .
Let us suppose we ’re just starting to tackle problem of compressing the Pokémon images .
We look at the images and see that there are either long runs of repeating pixels ( same colors ) , or runs of pixels of different values because more colors are simulated by the use of hand - crafted dithering .
You also notice that around the Pokémon ’s edges , you have similar transitions .
So after thinking a while , you devise the following code :
Code Pixels 0 00 --> 00 00 00 00 0 01 --> 01 01 01 01 0 10 --> 10 10 10 10 0 11 --> 11 11 11 11 10 --> repeats the last seen pixel 2 times 11 + xx yy zz ww -> copy the 4 pixels ( xx , yy , zz , ww )
So runs of 4 repeating pixels gets encoded into 3 bits instead of 8 , two repeating pixels are encoded in two , and finally , a random set of 4 pixels gets encoded onto 10 bits .
This scheme will serve as the reference naïve codec .
RLE .
The reference codec is n’t very good at capturing arbitrary lengths of repeating pixels .
Maybe we can do better .
What could we do ?
Could n’t we rather encode arbitrary repetitions ?
Oh .
Wait .
That ’s what Run Length Encoding , or RLE , is about !
But there are many possible flavors of RLE .
All counts RLE .
The simplest , and unsurprisingly the least efficient variant , encodes just any pixel using a count and pixel pair .
If there ’s a run of exactly one pixel long , we encode the pair ( 1 , p ) , where p is the pixel value .
If we have 5 pixels with the same value in a row , we encode the pair ( 5 , p ) , and so on .
We can introduce a - 1 bias to encode one repetition on 0 , 2 on 1 , 3 on 2 , etc .
If we use a fixed number of bits to encode the run length , that allows to encode the range to on the range to .
The Bit Select RLE .
Since it is inefficient to encode a long series of different pixels by as many pairs as there are pixels , one can consider an encoding where a bit indicates whether the pair encodes a repeat or a string of literal pixels .
A series of literal pixels is simply a series of pixels to be copied as is .
The encoding would then take the form ( 1, rep , p ) for pixels repeated rep+1 times , and ( 0 , rep , p1 , p2 , …pn ) for rep different pixels .
The Auto - Trigger RLE .
Rather than allocating bits to repetitions on every pixels , we might be better off to detect repetitions in another way .
Let ’s say we rather encode pixels one by one until a repetition is detected .
A repetition is detected whenever consecutive pixels are the same .
The optimal value of is determined by the source to encode .
For the Pokémon image database , the optimal .
So after two repeating pixels , a repeat code is emitted .
If the repetitions continue , the number of remaining pixels in that run is encoded , otherwise it ’s 0 .
It ’s “ 0 more repetitions ” if the next pixel breaks the repeating sequence .
Variable Length Codes .
Fixed - length codes are probably not very efficient to encode run lengths .
After looking that the distribution of runs , I found that the following variable length code ( or VLC ) is nearly optimal :
Code Lengths 00 0 01 1 100 + 1 bit 2,3 101 + 2 bits 4 , ...,7 110 + 3 bits 8 , ...,15 1110 + 4 bits 16 , ...,31 1111 + 5 bits 32 , ...,63
And those will be the variable length codes for the run encoding in all implementations of RLE ( except for the Block coder , which is n’t RLE at all ) .
However , the results from the first four variants are n’t all that impressive .
Starting at 2 bits per pixels in the original image , the block coder yields a 1.38:1 compression ratio , the All Counts fares similarly with a 1.34:1 compression ratio , the Bit Select is an absolute catastrophe with an insignificant compression ratio of 1.02:1 .
Finally , the Auto - Trigger RLE yields 1.71:1 compression , which is by far the best amongst the more naïve methods .
Predictive RLE .
This method is considerably more complex than the methods presented so far ( while being still rather simple in absolute terms ) .
The previous methods are limited by the repetitions found in the pixels .
If there ’s a regular pattern ( as there is often in dithering ) , the RLE compressor cannot take advantage of it .
However , we can transform the original image so that the RLE compressor is able to form much longer runs and therefore yield much better compression .
To do so , we will use prediction .
In order to guess what will be the next pixel in the image , we will form contexts and accumulate frequencies of occurrence of pixels given the contexts .
The context is defined as the pixel right above and the pixel to the immediate left of the pixel we want to predict , as the following illustrates :
For the sake of bootstrapping the process , the pixels that fall outside the image are considered as the color 0 .
For each context ( which are numbered 16 ) , we will maintain four counts , one for each color .
While we scan the entire image , we form the contexts ( c1, c2 ) and we increment the count corresponding to the color observed in the ‘?’ pixel .
Once the image is scanned , we have all context populated and we proceed to the second phase .
In the second phase , we establish , for each context , color ranking .
Color ranking assigns , to each color in a given context , a rank : the most frequent color receives rank 1 , the second most frequent rank 2 , and so on .
Once rankings are assigned for each colors in each context , we discard the frequency information as we wo n’t be needing it again .
In the third phase , we will rescan the image and replace the pixels by their ranking given their context .
This will help RLE compress longer series of pixels as , even they were different in the original image , their rank might be the same given their contexts .
Once all pixels are replaced by their ranking , we apply Auto - Trigger RLE with an auto - repeat length of 2 .
This method requires the coding of the rankings , at a cost of 10 bytes ( we have 16 context , with 4 rankings , which can be encoded in at most 5 bits per permutation , since there are 24 possible permutations of 1,2,3,4 ) .
The decompression proceeds in reverse : the data is decompressed using Auto - trigger RLE , then one by one the rankings are replaced by colors , by using the ranking to color mapping encoded in the contexts .
Comparing Results .
It is finally the predicted values that will be encoded using Auto - Trigger RLE , yielding a much better compression ratio of 1.9:1 , a gain of about 12 % on the unaided Auto - Trigger RLE which yields a 1.7:1 compression ratio .
Bit Select , All Counts , and Block perform so much worse than they can be discarded from the list of potential compression algorithms .
Comparing relative performances yields :
which clearly indicates the predictive codec as a winner .
The results are averaged over the 746 test set Pokémon bitmaps .
*
* *
In this post , we have seen two things .
First , we have seen that Auto - Trigger RLE is the best variant of RLE as it does not use special codes for strings of non-repeating pixels , and only for pixels that do actually repeat .
The optimal value of repetitions after which a repetition code is emitted depends on the source to code .
In the case of the Pokémon database , gave the best results ( it was determined by exhaustive testing ) .
Second , we have seen that transforming the data before compression can actually yield much better results .
In this example , we transformed from pixel - space to ranking - space , which yielded longer repetitions than the original data , with very little extra processing cost .
*
* *
On compression ratio fairness .
The compression ratio presented are relative to the original image at two bits per pixels .
However , if I had measured the compression ratio according to the original pnm files , I could have claimed a much higher ratio .
Indeed , in the original pnm file , each pixel is 24 bits long ( 3 components , R , G , B , each 8 bits wide ) , therefore I could easily have claimed a 22.8:1 compression ratio using predictive RLE coding !
Which would be dishonnest , I think , even though it would give better compression ratios that Zip on that particular series of files .
Compression ratios should always be expressed relative to the smallest non-compressed representation of the data .
In our case , the Pokémons are in fact palette bitmaps , and each pixel has a natural representation on two bits , relative to a four entry palette of 15 bits colors .
Therefore , all compression ratios are reported relative to the original bitmap at two bits per pixels .
*
* *
This also raises the question of the original dimensionality of the data .
Not only one has to ask himself how many bits are necessary for the minimal natural representation of the data ( in our example , 2 bits per pixels plus a palette describe adequately the data ) but also how much it “ fills ” its possible space .
Speaking of fractal dimension may be exagerated , and not quite applicable , but one has to figure out what patterns are possible ( and then merely likely ) in the data and how this influences the possible compression algorithms and obtained compression ratios .
In our case , the Pokémon images share numerous properties : vast blocks of uniform colors ; edges formed by white pixels followed by a single dark pixel followed by the fill color , simulated colors by regular dithering ( checkboards patterns of two colors ) , etc .
Clearly , the Pokémons do not occupy a large portion of all possible bitmaps of 4 colors .
Unless there ’s a Whitenoisamon , the images have a high degree of structuration , and that is clearly exploitable for compression .

The Best Ways to Prevent Foreclosures - Tips and Suggestions
Instruction Manual
Preventing foreclosures is something that can be done , provided that you know the right steps to take .
It might seem obvious that paying your mortgage on time would be a great solution to avoiding foreclosure , but most people who are seeking foreclosure solutions are already beyond the point where this is a feasible solution .
There are many other ways that you can work with lenders to stop the foreclosure process or prevent it from happening , though .
Do Something - The First Step in Prevention
Too many people feel overwhelmed , frightened , or hopeless about their situation .
This leaves them with little room to actually do anything to prevent foreclosures from happening because they often choose to do nothing .
This is the WORST thing you can do .
You need to take a proactive role in your situation and work with the people who are trying to help you , instead of doing nothing .
Banks do n't want homes back .
They just want their money .
Therefore , they 're often more willing to work with you than you think .
Delay the Game - Preventing Foreclosures Temporarily
Sometimes , if you cannot work with the solutions that lenders are offering , you can utilize tactics of delaying the process .
You can seek legal advice , which will give you all the assistance that you need to help delay lenders in the filing process so that you can find a solution .
Once you 've delayed the process , you can check out your options for refinancing , mortgage assistance programs , bankruptcy filing , and other solutions to stopping foreclosure .
This will not necessarily prevent the foreclosure process , but it will buy you some time to work out a different solution .
Other Ways to Prevent Foreclosures
Some professionals will suggest that the best ways to prevent foreclosures are through bankruptcy filings .
This can be a successful way to keep your home because you will enter into a repayment plan through bankruptcy court , which will nullify or prevent the foreclosure process from taking your home .
You 'll be able to keep your home and save your financial situation .
However , this should be seen as a last resort , and not taken for granted .
Both Panasonic and Canon announced their first water - and shock - proof compact toughcams earlier this year , and we 've taken them underwater for a test .
Which is better for capturing your summertime antics both wet AND wild ?

Let me say first that I did not use either of these cameras in their ideal conditions — namely , outside , underwater while swimming .
For some reason , Canon and Panasonic did not tailor the release dates of these cameras to coincide with my trip to Egypt a few months ago , which is where I wanted to test them out ( why not guys ? ? ) .
Back here in New York , any outdoor body of water is way too frigid right now , and there 's something pretty creepy and ultimately unacceptable about taking an underwater camera to the YMCA for test shots .
So , instead of the verdant coral reefs of the Red Sea off the Sinai coast , which were straight out of Planet Earth , our test shots are of me playing with a Kraken Attackin ' Lego Pirates playset in my kitchen sink .
Which is a cool playset , but , you know , not the same .

But still , we 've gathered enough data I think to inform your decision , if you 're thinking of picking up a waterproof toughcam for this summer .
Here are the main points of differentiation I see :
Form Factor / Interface
Both cameras are waterproof , but the Canon D10 is protected up to 10 meters ( around 32 feet ) , where the Panasonic TS1 is only protected up to three meters ( around 10 feet ) .
And that 's immediately apparent in their shapes :
The D10 looks like it was designed by Ringo on the set of Yellow Submarine — its bulbous shell and porthole - like screws drive home the fact that this baby is going underwater .
But on land , it 'll be tough to fit it into a pants pocket without some serious bulging .
Advertisement
It does have some nice , easy - to - press buttons for changing into video mode , for instance , and the icons on the LCD screen are nice and big , easily spotted through a snorkeling mask .
There are some superfluous button presses to lock in settings which could be tedious underwater , but the UI is not horrible , and you 'll easily get used to it .
The D10 also has come big screw - mounts on each corner for mounting various underwater grips and other accessories that you can buy from Canon .
The TS1 takes a totally different approach , with a sleek rectangular slab shape that at first glance is hard to distinguish from regular non-tough weeniecams .
The buttons are a bit smaller , but not prohibitively so , and shootings modes are selected with a thumb dial instead of dedicated buttons — I did n't see anything I could n't operate with a bit of practice while snorkeling .
A basic locking wrist - strap comes in the box .
Advertisement
The important thing is that the TS1 is not at all out of place in non -toughcam situations , where the D10 may be .
But if you 're a deep snorkeler , three meters may not be enough for you compared to the D10's 10 meters ( I imagine if you 're a serious SCUBA diver , you 'll need something beefier than either of these ) , but where you lose usability under water with the TS1 you will gain it on land .
Consider that .
Video
Another big difference , if not the biggest , is that the Panasonic TS1 shoots 720 p in the AVCHD format , where the Canon only does 640x480 VGA vids .
The TS1 video recording mode is n't the most polished — there 's a good two to three second delay from when you hit the dedicated video button to when recording actually starts and stops , and it 's unclear exactly when everything does start , but if you 're OK with that , the HD video mode is awesome .
I mean , underwater HD in such a tiny package — that 's a no - brainer right ?
I would kill to have some HD clips of my friends and I swimming around in crazy schools of neon fish in Egypt .

Here are some sample clips from the sink :
TS1 720P Clip :

Note :
There is a current bug with the TS1 that makes video imported into iMovie '08 and '09 play at double speed .
I had to do some conversion to avoid this , which is a pain .
Panasonic says they 're working with Apple on this to include a fix in future versions of iMovie .
Canon D10 VGA Clip :

Keep in mind that the AVCHD format is kind of annoying , in that you might have to install special codecs and import video straight into your video editing software of choice and then export it in friendlier formats , rather than just grabbing an AVI or MOV clip from the memory card and uploading it to YouTube .
And yeah , the quality of these videos is pretty bad , but the difference in the actual output is clear : 720 p underwater rules .

Shooting
Both cameras are 12 - megapixels , for full - res shots at 4000x3000 .
Both have the same size CCD sensor , but the TS1's ISO goes up to 6400 where the Canon D10's only to 1600 .
I did n't do a thorough sensitivity test with either camera , but I would imagine you do n't want to go much higher than 800 on either one , so the difference is probably fairly moot .
A difference that does matter is the TS1's wider - angle lens : it 's a 28 mm - 128 mm f/3.3-f/5.9 effective focal length zoom , compared to the D10's 35 mm - 105 mm f/2.8-f/4.9 .

As you can see , color reproduction via the TS1's Leica lens is far better than the D10s , which has to fight through a bit more protective plastic .
Also , the TS1 tends to autofocus underwater with much greater ease — important , because you wo n't always be able to look at the LCD when composing shots while snorkeling .
Conclusion
Like I said , I only played with these cameras in the sink , so I did n't push their waterproof capabilities to their max .
But having a waterproof and shockproof camera around the house is kind of cool in its own right — imagine taking bath time photos of your kid without having to worry about getting the camera wet , or taking shots with dirty hands while you 're barbecuing , or anything like that .
You can always dunk these cameras underwater to clean them off .
It 's nice .
You do n't have to be a snorkeler to use them and have fun with them .

Which is why for me , the balance shifts heavily toward the Panasonic TS1 .
Its form factor makes using it on land a lot more convenient , and the added HD video option is a huge plus .
And my ears hurt if I go down much further than three meters underwater anyway .
At a premium of only $ 70 ( $ 400 list vs. $ 330 for the D10 ) , I 'd say it 's well worth spending up for .

In particular 90 % of use of self types I ’ve seen appear to exist solely because people do not know this .

Bar is not a subclass of the superclass Foo of the mixin trait Stuff new Bar with Stuff ; ^
You can basically view this as putting a constraint on the trait , saying that all classes that implement this trait must extend this superclass .
This can be particularly useful for adding various sorts of behaviour to classes .

One might forgive Manitobans if they seem slightly smug these days .
With job losses in Ontario , falling house prices in Vancouver and disappointing retail sales across the country , Manitoba seems to be bucking the recession with its " steady - as - she - goes " incremental growth .
The province 's unemployment rate in February was at 4.8 per cent -- three percentage points below the national numbers and the second - lowest rate in the country , surpassed only by Saskatchewan .
While retail sales fell more than five per cent across Canada in December , they only dropped half a percentage point in Manitoba .
And as shops close in other parts of the country , Manitoba is actually seeing new stores move in ; from its first sprawling Ikea store which will anchor a $ 400 - million retail development to the opening of its first Sephora beauty store .
The housing market has dipped slightly , but about one - third of Winnipeg 's homes are still selling for at or above asking price .
Because of its " even keel " economy , the Conference Board of Canada recently found Manitoba is one of only four provinces expected to experience economic growth this year .
The " momentum " generated in the past few years will carry it forward into 2010 , the board said .
That momentum has n't been anywhere as dizzying as it has in other provinces .
But many say that 's why Manitoba is poised to weather this recession better than most -- it never climbed to the same heights and therefore does n't have as far to fall .
" We feel we 're holding our own and steady as she goes , " said Premier Gary Doer , whose NDP government is tabling its budget March 25 .
" We do n't like to have our economy lurch forward and lurch backward .
We want to keep going in a steady way .
Manitoba relies more on what 's in our heads -- our brains -- than we rely on what 's in the ground . "
The province is n't as dependent on the auto sector and its manufacturers are faring better than those in neighbouring Ontario , said Marie - Christine Bernard with the Conference Board of Canada .
Major hydro construction projects are going ahead and there is a backlog of orders in the aerospace and transit industries , which should keep Manitoba humming for the coming year , she said .
" The domestic economy in Manitoba is in pretty good shape , " said Bernard , associate director of provincial economic trends at the Conference Board of Canada .
" We 're forecasting some job growth for 2009 , contrary to most of the provinces , where they will see job losses . "
Since Manitobans seem to be holding on to their jobs , they also have n't cut down as heavily on their spending .
That makes the province an attractive place for retailers looking to expand , said Lanny McInnes with the Retail Council of Canada .
" While we do n't have the peaks that other provinces may have -- like Saskatchewan and Alberta -- we also do n't have the correspondent valleys when other provinces are running into difficulty , " he said .
" Manitobans are still going to be shopping so ( retailers ) look at the province in times like this as an area where they can grow their business . "
The province has also seen an influx of people moving to Manitoba , keeping the demand for housing steady .
Jeff Powell , senior market analyst with Canada Mortgage and Housing , said Manitoba never saw the same speculative buying as other provinces , which protected it from the drop other cities are now experiencing .
As employment remains steady , so too does the demand for housing , he said .
" The forecast for prices in Manitoba is really quite stable , " he said .
But despite the relatively sunny forecasts , Doer said Manitoba can't afford to get comfortable .
The world is in a recession and Manitoba is n't immune , he said .
" There are challenges because Manitoba is in the centre of the country .
We trade east of us , west of us , south of us and north of us through the port of Churchill , " Doer said .
" Canada is relatively better off than the United States .
Manitoba and Saskatchewan are doing relatively better than other provinces .
But it 's still lower than it was a year ago . "
ABC News has a segment where they recreated the famous 1940s experiment by Mamie and Kenneth Clark , in which African American children overwhelmingly preferred to play with a lighter - skinned doll than a darker - skinned one , saying the white doll was prettier .
The ABC News experiment results were very different , with the vast majority of African American kids preferring the darker - skinned doll .
On the other hand , in Kiri Davis ’s 2006 documentary “ A Girl Like Me , ” Black teen girls indicate that they still feel that “ White ” features ( such as straight hair ) are seen as more attractive and that even other African Americans reinforce the idea that lighter skin and straight hair are preferable ( notice the girl talking about her mom ’s comments about her hair starting at about a minute in ) :

This might lead to an interesting discussion about beauty standards and the idea of internalized racism –that is , that minority groups in the U.S. ( as well as many other nations ) are socialized into a set of cultural beauty standards that often depict their physical features as unattractive , or at least less attractive , than Whites , and that non-Whites may apply those beauty standards among themselves ( for example , see this post about an African American club promoter who planned a party to which light - skinned girls would get in free ) .
Of course , there is also evidence that beauty standards among some U.S. racial and ethnic groups may differ from the general standard seen in fashion magazines , on TV , etc .
So that brings up an interesting inconsistency : how do we explain the existence of different beauty standards ( such as less emphasis on women being very thin ) and internal racism ?
It would be a great topic to open up for discussion –how can both co-exist at the same time ?
Is it that different sub - groups hold each of those positions , with some groups having more varied beauty standards and others upholding mainstream standards ?
Or do individuals often express both positions at various times , perhaps finding a wider range of body sizes attractive but also preferring “ White ” hair and facial features ?
If you know of scholars that have specifically tried to explain this , I ’d love to know about them .
UPDATE : Commenter Dubi adds ,
In addition , it should be noted that the two dolls in the experiment were identical in all but skin colour , so things like hairstyle or facial features do n’t get factored it .
It is wholly possible that people do not judge people anymore by the colour of their skin , but things that are more “ changeable ” like hair colour and style are still seen as indicative of other qualities .
This , of course , requires further study .

Talk about a terror plot !
You got your faux jihad , you got your inadequate health insurance ( nothing single payer would n't fix ! ) and you got an FBI informant who supplied a motive .
Now , I wonder how they thought all of this would play in court ?
I mean , we were planning to try these people , yes ?
" My insurance was n't good enough , " said Lord McWilliams , 20 , who has a deadly liver disease .
His brother , David Williams , wanted money " to speed up the process , " McWilliams said .
" Medicaid only goes so far . "
He dismissed as " crazy " federal accusations that Williams was a Jew - hater who wanted to wage jihad .
McWilliams said the FBI informant who lured his brother and three other hapless petty criminals into a plot to blow up synagogues and shoot down a plane promised enough money to take care of his transplant .
" [ My brother ] told me , ' Do n't worry , when you go to the doctor , tell them you got money , ' " McWilliams said .
McWilliams , who has already had his spleen removed , said his brother told him he would have $ 20,000 for the operation .
Their mother , Elizabeth McWilliams , said her older son had told her he would be able to give her a wad of cash Thursday , which was the day after the terrorist plot was to have been carried out .
" He was a loving , sweet kid .
He took his brother 's illness worse than me , " she said .
Lord McWilliams said the informant , who often drove his brother to the hospital to visit , even promised to take him to Universal Studios when he was well again .
" He said I did n't have to pay for nothing , " McWilliams said .
Federal prosecutors say Williams , 28 ; James Cromitie , 44 ; Laguerre Payen , 27 , and Onta Williams , 32 , all of upstate Newburgh , were militant Muslims caught on tape railing against Jews and plotting to blow up Jewish temples .
They were arrested last Wednesday while planting what they thought were plastic explosives outside two Riverdale synagogues .
They also had a Stinger missile - phony , supplied by the FBI - with which they allegedly planned to shoot down a military plane .
Family and friends say the four were down - on - their luck ex-cons who apparently thought they would be paid by the FBI informant .
In dozens of interviews around Newburgh , no one can remember hearing any of the four talk of Jews or jihad .
They had converted to Islam in prison , but they drank beer , ate pork and rarely prayed , family members said .
On Glenn Beck 's radio show last week , I quipped in response to our wayward federal government , " I may run for president of Texas . "
That need may be a reality sooner than we think .
If not me , someone someday may again be running for president of the Lone Star state , if the state of the union continues to turn into the enemy of the state .
From the East Coast to the " Left Coast , " America seems to be moving further and further from its founders ' vision and government .
George Washington advised , " The great rule of conduct in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations [ and ] having with them as little political connection as possible . "
Yet the Obama administration just pledged $ 900 million in U.S. taxpayer - funded aid to Hamas - controlled Gaza and Mahmoud Abbas ' Palestinian Authority .
Thomas Jefferson counseled us , " We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt . "
Yet the Feds have just skyrocketed our national deficit and debt by trillions of dollars , and it plans much more fiscal expansion with few expectations of resistance .
Despite that George Washington admonished , " To contract new debts is not the way to pay for old ones , " we keep borrowing and bailing , while we watch the stock market plunge further every time we do .

Patrick
Henry taught that , " Our Constitution is … an instrument for its people to restrain the government . "
Yet our Congress and president stampede that founding document , overlook its explicitness and manipulate its words to abandon a balance of power and accommodate their own desires , partisan politics and runaway spending .
John Adams declared that , " Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people . "
Yet we 've bastardized the First Amendment , reinterpreted America 's religious history and secularized our society until we ooze skepticism and circumvent religion on every level of public and private life .
How much more will Americans take ?
When will enough be enough ?
And , when that time comes , will our leaders finally listen or will history need to record a second American Revolution ?
We the people have the authority according to America 's Declaration of Independence , which states :
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
When I appeared on Glenn Beck 's radio show , he told me that someone had asked him , " Do you really believe that there is going to be trouble in the future ? "
And he answered , " If this country starts to spiral out of control and Mexico melts down or whatever , if it really starts to spiral out of control , before America allows a country to become a totalitarian country ( which it would have under I think the Republicans as well in this situation ; they were taking us to the same place , just slower ) , Americans wo n't stand for it .
There will be parts of the country that will rise up . "
Then Glenn asked me and his listening audience , " And where 's that going to come from ? "
He answered his own question , " Texas , it 's going to come from Texas .
Do you agree with that Chuck ? "
I replied , " Oh yeah ! " Definitely .
It was these types of thoughts that led me to utter the tongue - n- cheek frustration on Glenn Beck 's radio show , " I may run for president of Texas ! "
I 'm not saying that other states wo n't muster the gumption to stand and secede , but Texas has the history to prove it .
As most know , Texas was its own country before it joined the Union as its 28th state .
From 1836 to 1846 , Texas was its own Republic .
Washington - on - the - Brazos ( river ) served as our Philadelphia , Pa .
It was there , on March 2 , 1836 , where a band of patriots forged the Texas Declaration of Independence .
( We just celebrated these dates last week . )
On March 1 , 1845 , then - President John Tyler signed a congressional bill annexing the Republic of Texas .
Though the annexation resolution never explicitly granted Texas the right to secede from the Union ( as is often reported ) , many ( including me ) hold that it is implied by its unique autonomy and history , as well as the unusual provision in the resolution that gave Texas the right to divide into as many as five states .
Both the original ( 1836 ) and the current ( 1876 ) Texas Constitutions also declare that " All political power is inherent in the people .
… they have at all times the inalienable right to alter their government in such manner as they might think proper . "
Anyone who has been around Texas for any length of time knows exactly what we'd do if the going got rough in America .
Let there be no doubt about that .
As Sam Houston once said , " Texas has yet to learn submission to any oppression , come from what source it may . "
Just last Friday , the Alamo celebrated its 173rd commemoration , when on March 6 , 1836 , Texans under Col. William B. Travis were overcome by the Mexican army after a two - week siege at the Alamo in San Antonio .
But they did n't go down without a hell - of - a- fight , as those roughly 145 Texans fought to their dying breaths against more than 2,000 Mexican forces under Gen. Santa Anna .
( Casualties in the battle were 189 Texans vs. about 1,600 Mexicans . )
They lost that battle , but would provide the inspiration to win the war .
Their fighting spirit rallied the new - found republic , and still does to this day .
So when you think all is lost in America , remember the Alamo !
For those losing hope , and others wanting to rekindle the patriotic fires of early America , I encourage you to join Fox News ' Glenn Beck , me and millions of people across the country in the live telecast , " We Surround Them , " on Friday afternoon ( March 13 at 5 p.m. ET , 4 p.m. CT and 2 p.m. PST ) .
Thousands of cell groups will be united around the country in solidarity over the concerns for our nation .
You can host or attend a viewing party by going to Glenn 's website .
My wife Gena and I will be hosting one from our Texas ranch , in which we 've invited many family members , friends and law enforcement to join us .
It 's our way of saying " We 're united , we 're tired of the corruption , and we 're not going to take it anymore ! "
Again , Sam Houston put it well when he gave the marching orders , " We view ourselves on the eve of battle .
We are nerved for the contest , and must conquer or perish .
It is vain to look for present aid : None is at hand .
We must now act or abandon all hope !
Rally to the standard , and be no longer the scoff of mercenary tongues !
Be men , be free men , that your children may bless their father 's name . "

EPOXI Team Develops New Method to Find Alien Oceans
Bill Steigerwald
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
Astronomers have found more than 300 alien ( extrasolar ) worlds so far .
Most of these are gas giants like Jupiter , and are either too hot ( too close to their star ) or too cold ( too far away ) to support life as we know it .
Sometime in the near future , however , astronomers will probably find one that 's just right – a planet with a solid surface that 's the right distance for a temperature that allows liquid water -- an essential ingredient in the recipe for life .
But the first picture of this world will be just a speck of light .
How can we find out if it might have liquid water on its surface ?
If it has lots of water – oceans – we are in luck .
NASA - sponsored scientists looking back at Earth with the Deep Impact / EPOXI mission have developed a method to indicate whether Earth - like extrasolar worlds have oceans .
" A ' pale blue dot ' is the best picture we will get of an Earth - like extrasolar world using even the most advanced telescopes planned for the next couple decades , " said Nicolas B. Cowan , of the University of Washington .
" So how do we find out if it is capable of supporting life ?
If we can determine that the planet has oceans of liquid water , it greatly increases the likelihood that it supports life .
We used the High Resolution Imager telescope on Deep Impact to look at Earth from tens of millions of miles away -- an ' alien ' point of view -- and developed a method to indicate the presence of oceans by analyzing how Earth 's light changes as the planet rotates .
This method can be used to identify extrasolar ocean - bearing Earths .
" Cowan is lead author of a paper on this research appearing in the August 2009 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
Our planet looks blue all the time because of Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere , the same reason that the sky appears blue to us down on the surface , points out Cowan .
" What we studied in this paper was how that blue color changes in time : oceans are bluer than continents , which appear red or orange because land is most reflective at red and near - infrared wavelengths of light .
Oceans only reflect much at blue ( short ) wavelengths , " said Cowan .
The maps that the team created are only sensitive to the longitudinal ( East - West ) positions of oceans and continents .
Furthermore , the observations only pick out what is going on near the equator of Earth : the equator gets more sunlight than higher latitudes , and the EPOXI spacecraft was above the equator when the observations were taken .
These limitations of viewing geometry could plague observations of extrasolar planets as well : " We could erroneously see the planet as a desert world if it had a nearly solid band of continents around its equator and oceans at its poles , " said Cowan .
Other things besides water can make a planet appear blue ; for example , in our solar system the planet Neptune is blue due in part to the presence of methane in its upper atmosphere .
" However , a Neptune - like world would appear as an unchanging blue using this technique , and again it 's the changes in the blue color that reveal oceans to us , " said Cowan .
" There are some weird scenarios you can dream up that do n't involve oceans but would lead to varying patches of blue on a planet , but these are not very plausible . "
" A spectrum of the planet 's light that reveals the presence of water is necessary to confirm the existence of oceans , " said Drake Deming , a co-author of the paper at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Instruments that produce a spectrum are attached to telescopes and spread out light into its component colors , like a prism separates white light into a rainbow .
Every element and molecule emits and absorbs light at specific colors .
These colors can be used like a fingerprint to identify them .
" Finding the water molecule in the spectrum of an extrasolar planet would indicate that there is water vapor in its atmosphere , making it likely that the blue patches we were seeing as it rotates were indeed oceans of liquid water .
However , it will take future large space telescopes to get a precise spectrum of such distant planets , while our technique can be used now as an indication that they could have oceans , " said Deming .
The technique only requires relatively crude spectra to get the intensity of light over broad color ranges , according to the team .
NASA 's Deep Impact made history when the mission team directed an impactor from the spacecraft into comet Tempel 1 on July 4 , 2005 .
NASA recently extended the mission , redirecting the spacecraft for a flyby of comet Hartley 2 on Nov. 4 , 2010 .
EPOXI is a combination of the names for the two extended mission components : a search for extrasolar planets during the cruise to Hartley 2 , called Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterization ( EPOCh ) , and the flyby of comet Hartley 2 , called the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation ( DIXI ) .
The University of Maryland is the Principal Investigator institution , leading the overall EPOXI mission and DIXI .
NASA Goddard leads the EPOCh investigation .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , manages EPOXI for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The spacecraft was built for NASA by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo .

Top Ten Viking Hoaxes
1. Vinland Map .
The so called Vinland Map is a medieval style map of the old world .
It is said to date to the 15th century , when it was purportedly redrawn from a 13th century original .
In the western Atlantic it has a large island identified as Vinland , which is the name given to an area in North America by Leif Eriksson who discovered it early in the 11th century .
The Vinland Map came to light in 1957 , when it was offered for sale to the British Museum , which turned it down because of its lack of provenance and non-original binding .
Later the Vinland Map was bought by Paul Mellon who donated it to Yale University .
In 1996 it was reported that insurers valued the map at $ 25 million .
Even though the authenticity of the Vinland Map has enthusiastic supporters , the most of the researchers believe it to be a modern hoax .
2. Kensington Runestone .
The runestone was found in 1898 in the township of Solem , Douglas County , Minnesota , and named after the nearest settlement , Kensington .
According to Swedish American farmer Olof Öhman , it was lying face down and tangled in the root system of a stunted poplar tree .
The stone is about 30 x 16 x 6 inches and weighs about 200 pounds .
It is covered with runes on its face and side .
The inscription suggests that the Vikings reached the middle of North America in the 14th century .
The Kensington Runestone was repeatedly analysed by runologists and linguists and dismissed as a hoax .
It is currently on display at the Runestone Museum in Alexandria , Minnesota .
3. Thorwald ’s Rock in Hampton .
Near the Tuck Museum on Park Avenue in Hampton , New Hampshire , there is a circular well covered by a metal grate .
Inside of the well there is a rather large rock covered with slashes , which is believed to once have marked the grave of Thorvald , brother of Viking explorer Leif Eriksson .
The Saga of Erik the Red says that Thorvald Eriksson , during his exploration of Vinland , stopped at a beautiful land .
Attacked by Indians , Thorvald was shot through the heart by an arrow and was buried there .
In 1902 Hampton district court judge Charles A. Lamprey wrote to the local newspaper claiming that a stone that had been on his family ’s land since 1600s marked Thorvald ’s death site .
Thorwald ’s
Rock is now considered to be a hoax .
4. Leif Eriksson Runestone from Nomans Land .
In November 1926 Joshua Crane , who then owned Nomans Land island , Massachusetts , spotted some lettering on a large rock near the water ’s edge .
The same inscription was noticed by Captain Wood , who worked as caretaker of the island .
It was photographed in 1927 by Edward F. Gray , a writer who researched Norse voyages to North America for a book , which appeared in 1930 .
Subsequent efforts to decipher the runes concluded that the first two lines read , “ Leif Eriksson , 1001 . ”
The inscription has grammatical anomalies and the mixture of runes from different periods .
The mixture of runes with Roman numerals seems no less suspect .
The consensus is that the stone is actually a hoax .
5. Viking Ship in Hawaii .
April 1st , 1936 , the Honolulu Star - Bulletin published a story about a Viking ship discovered in Hawaii , accompanied by a photo of the rare find ( see above ) .
However , no such thing has ever been discovered there .
It is doubtful whether Vikings could in fact reach Hawaii on their longships .
6. Wisconsin Viking Horse Skull .
In 1935 during excavations of mounds dating to 500 - 700 AD near Spencer Lake , in Burnett Country , along with many other finds archeologists discovered a horse skull .
This was something unheard of , since horses are not native to this hemisphere .
The find was believed to prove that Vikings both discovered North America and settled far inland at a very early date .
For many years the find was not challenged .
However , in 1962 one of the archeologists , Ralph Linton , published a confession of a certain “ Mr. P. ” who in 1928 , as a teenager , had buried the skull in the mound .
7. Frank Cowan Viking Literary Hoax .
In 1867 Frank Cowan , who was once a secretary to U. S. President Andrew Johnson , wrote and published a literary hoax that claimed the discovery of an Icelandic Christian woman , who had died in 1051 AD , below the Great Falls of the Potomac River .
The hoax was intended to raise sales of a Georgetown newspaper owned by Cowan ’s friend Thomas Birch Florence .
It indeed caused the sales to skyrocket .
8. Viking Ship Museum Hoax .
April 1st , 2007 , the Viking Ship Museum Roskilde published a press release , which stated that Ireland has claimed the handing - over of the wreck of Skuldelev 2 , the remains of a Viking ship on display in museum , because of the fact that the ship was built in 1042 AD in Ireland .
The press release further stated that after long and secret negotiations the National Museum in Dublin and the Viking Ship Museum reached an agreement : a true copy of Skuldelev 2 , Sea Stallion of Glendalough , which was planned to perform a voyage from Roskilde to Dublin in summer of the same year , had to be handed over to Irish authorities .
To be sure , Sea Stallion came back to Roskilde safely and it was all a hoax .
9. Oklahoma Runestones .
It is a group of stones with runic or rune - like inscriptions including Heavener Runestone , Poteau Runestone , Shawnee Runestone and Spirit Pond Runestone .
Heavener inscription , the most notorious of the group , probably has the word GNOMEDAL in the Elder Futhark runes .
The problem is that this type of runic writing became obsolete long before the Viking expeditions to North America .
10 . CBA Hoax .
April 1st , 2009 , the Council for British Archeology published an article , which stated that a new find from the far north of Scotland suggests that Vikings did in fact wear horned helmets .
Along with a detailed description of the find , the article featured an interview with the excavation director Ren Lögn who said , “ It is clear that the helmet was worn with one horn up and one down .
Equally important is the fact that it was worn fore and aft not side - to - side . ”
When Christina and Patrick Vitagliano dreamed up their Monster Mini Golf franchises -- 18 - hole , indoor putting greens straddled by glow - in - the - dark statues of ghouls and gargoyles -- they never imagined that a California maker of high - end audio cables would object .
But Monster Cable Products Inc. , which holds more than 70 trademarks on the word monster , challenged the Vitaglianos ' trademark applications .
It filed a federal lawsuit against their company in California and demanded the Rhode Island couple surrender the name and pay at least $ 80,000 for the right to use it .
" It really seemed absurd , " says Ms. Vitagliano .
The legal actions were nothing new for Monster Cable , which was granted its first " Monster " trademark in 1980 .
Since then , the company has fought more monsters than Godzilla did .
Over the years , it has gone after purveyors of monster - branded auto transmissions , slot machines , glue , carpet - cleaning machines and an energy drink , as well as a woman who sells " Junk Food Monster " kids ' T - shirts that promote good eating habits .
It sued Monster.com over the job - hunting Web site 's name and Walt Disney Co. over products tied to the film " Monsters Inc . "
It opposed the Boston Red Sox trademark applications for seats and hot dogs named for the Green Monster , the legendary left - field wall in Fenway Park .
All in all , Monster Cable says it has fought about 190 monster battles at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and filed around 30 monster lawsuits in federal courts .

Sri Lanka last night scored a major propaganda coup when the UN human rights council praised its victory over the Tamil Tigers and refused calls to investigate allegations of war crimes by both sides in the final chapter of a bloody 25 - year conflict .
In a shock move , which dismayed western nations critical of Sri Lanka 's approach , the island 's diplomats succeeded in lobbying enough of its south Asian allies to pass a resolution describing the conflict as a " domestic matter that does n't warrant outside interference " .
The Geneva council session , called because of alarm over the high number of civilian casualties as well as the island 's treatment of displaced Tamil civilians , also condemned the Tamil Tigers for using ordinary people as human shields .
In another controversial development , it supported the Sri Lankan government 's decision to provide aid groups only with " access as may be appropriate " to refugee camps .
The Sri Lankan government denies it was responsible for the death of even one of the 7,000 civilians the UN estimates were killed in the first four months of the year .
Sri Lanka 's human rights minister , Mahinda Samarasinghe , said : " This is a strong endorsement of our president 's efforts to rout terrorism , and the successful handling of the world 's biggest hostage crisis .
" This is a clear message that the international community is behind Sri Lanka . "
Amnesty International described the vote as " extremely disappointing " and a " low point for the human rights council " , with a spokesperson saying : " It abandons hundreds of thousands of people in Sri Lanka to cynical political considerations . "
European countries , along with Canada , Chile and Mexico had backed an investigation into allegations that the Tigers prevented civilians from leaving the densely populated conflict zone , and that government forces used heavy artillery on the area and killed rebels trying to surrender .
They also urged Sri Lanka to open up refugee camps fully to international aid agencies .
The Red Cross and other groups say they remain barred from visiting some camps despite repeated requests for access .
Aid groups want to check on conditions for the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the fighting .
The Red Cross – which usually refrains from publicly criticising governments – complained Sri Lanka had denied it access to the war zone during the final weeks of the conflict .
Sri Lanka 's ambassador in Geneva said European nations had failed with a " punitive and mean - spirited agenda " against his country .
" This was a lesson that a handful of countries which depict themselves as the international community do not really constitute the majority , " Dayan Jayatilleka told the Associated Press .
" The vast mass of humanity are in support of Sri Lanka . "
The UN human rights council has no enforcement power , but countries are generally keen to avoid criticism and the negative attention its resolutions bring .

The purge of moderate Republicans continued today as talk show host Rush Limbaugh called for Colin Powell to leave the Republican Party and become a Democrat , after Powell had the nerve to insult Rush Limbaugh by saying that Rush inserts nastiness that the Republican Party can do without .
Here is the video from Media Matters :
Originally , Powell blasted Limbaugh , ” I think what Rush does as an entertainer diminishes the party and intrudes or inserts into our public life a kind of nastiness that we would be better to do without . ”
Advertisements
Criticizing Rush Limbaugh means immediate dismissal from the Republican Party , at least in the mind of Rush Limbaugh , “ Powell is out there saying I am killing the Republican Party while he endorsed and voted for Obama . …
He ’s just mad at me because I ’m the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama .
It was purely and solely based on race !
There can be no other explanation for it .
What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party . ”
Powell should leave the Republican Party , as should every Republican with a moderate bone in their body .
The Grand Old Party has become a gathering of the right wing fringe .
Other elected Republicans may in cower in fear of Limbaugh , but Colin Powell does n’t .
Notice that Limbaugh does n’t have much on Powell except that he supported Obama .
Rush can keep his head in the sand and ignore the fact that Powell gave a comprehensive account of why he supported Obama last fall on Meet the Press .
People like Rush Limbaugh do n’t want to admit that the Republican Party is in big trouble .
Gen .
Powell is correct in saying that sometimes people are willing to pay more taxes to get the services that they want .
If this is true , the Republican Party is doomed because they have based their whole ideology on the notion that every tax is a bad tax .
Moderate Republicans like Powell are an endangered species , and what Rush Limbaugh is saying is that there is no place in my Republican Party for you .
If this is the case , then there is probably no place for millions of other moderate Republicans either .
These voters will continue to move towards the Democratic Party as long as radical Republicans have no interest in them .
This is why Democrats are going to continue to win elections for the next few years , at least .
I 'm writing a book about Lisp and O'Reilly is going to publish it .
The aim is to show people who suspected that Lisp was dead because it could n't look outside the box , along with those who hoped it could but did n't know how , that the going is n't all that hard .
Although the book will introduce Common Lisp from scratch and give generous treatment to those features which make the language great , it is n't going to cover the whole thing or anything like it .
I want to make Lisp look easy and steer the novice away from the more complex edge cases .
The core of the book will be a number of in - depth examples which between them will thoroughly address the use of libraries whether or not these were written in Lisp .
It 'll also go into common , important utilities for dealing with persistence , threading , GUIs , system building and more .
Examples will include : an end - user desktop application , a webserver , and an introduction to getting Lisp working on a mobile phone .
So right now I 've got a head full of ideas and a minimalist website .
I 'll post again when there 's more to show .

Moon and Morning Star
Credit & Copyright : David Cortner
Explanation : Wednesday , the Moon and Venus rose together in early morning skies .
Even through clouds , both show off a lovely crescent in this well - composed skyscape from Rutherford College , North Carolina , in the eastern US .
Farther west , North American skygazers could also witness the Moon passing in front of Venus .
The bright planet disappeared behind the Moon 's sunlit crescent and reappeared along its darkened limb as morning twilight gave way to daylight hours .
Of course the dimmer lunar crescent was waning , approaching today 's New Moon phase .
Beginning a stint as the brilliant Morning Star , Venus ' crescent is waxing though , and will grow thicker in the coming months as Venus rises higher in morning skies .
Audiophiles across the world have their minds blown as McIntosh upgrades two classic home audio components in the " Classic Systems " limited release .
I 'd be more excited if I had $ 15,000 to blow on audio equipment .

For its 60th anniversary yesterday , McIntosh Labs released the new MC75 tube amplifier ( modeled after the original 1961 version ) and the C22 preamplifier ( modeled from the original 1962 version ) .
The distinctly retro look of both devices remain true to the original designs , while many internal circuit enhancements improve reliability of the equipment to meet modern specifications .
The backlit glass and brushed anodized aluminum definitely preserves the iconic character of audio equipment from generations past , and now I have reoccurring flashbacks of dad in his bell bottoms fiddling with his old high - end stereo system trying to get Creedence Clearwater Revival to play at full blast .
At a snub to the current generation music lovers , there 's nary an iPod dock nor HDMI input in sight .
The most modern upgrade the McIntosh dudes added was a remote control for the preamp .
And in true snobby audiophile style , only 120 of these sonic treasures will be released in the U.S. [ McIntosh ]

" The entertainment industry is moving rapidly into an era of revolutionary change , " said Will Wright .
" Stupid Fun Club will explore new possibilities that are emerging from this sublime chaos and create new forms of entertainment on a variety of platforms .
In my twelve years at EA , I 've had the pleasure to work alongside some of the brightest and most talented game developers in the industry and I look forward to working with them again in the near future . "
Stupid Fun Club will be " an entertainment think tank developing new Intellectual Properties to be deployed across multiple fronts including video games , movies , television , the internet , and toys , " according to the official press release on the matter .
It will allow Wright to " explore new projects " and EA retains the right to develop games based on Stupid Fun Club projects .

The site for Stupid Fun Club features an image of a ball broken down into rectangles .
Some of the rectangles link to information on the site , previous Wright press coverage and an about statement that reads , in part : " the ideas here can be manifested in video games , online environments , storytelling media and fine home care products "
There are also three links hidden on the front page which lead to strange interactive toys of sorts .
Two feature five floating images of Earth as seen from space and a selection of multi-hued tubes or rectangles .

The third allows you to select from a number of images to move fill up a blank page .
A small yellow creature in the bottom right corner of the screen occasionally comments in a speech bubble filled with what appears to be nonsense characters .
Knowing Wright , I can't help but think that there 's at least some new information hidden on the page .

Portuguese open sourcers are a bit miffed that a government " eProcurement " platform offers " conditioned access to bid at a public tender " , viz :
If you 're not running Microsoft software you 're not tendering for anything .
That 's according to the Associação de Empresas de Software Open Source Portuguesas , aka ESOP , which claims that the “ vortalGOV ” platform , operated by Vortal - Comércio Electrónico , Consultadoria e Multimédia S.A , " excludes every company not running Microsoft - based technology from bidding at a public tender " .
ESOP explains : " Even though this is an online platform available on the web , therefore in theory universally accessible , only Microsoft browsers and operating systems can in fact gain access to it . "
It adds : " For instance , national companies opting for Linux , Solaris , BSD or Apple - based systems cannot access the platform , and are consequently prevented from bidding at public tenders , unless they acquire Microsoft technology for that purpose . "
Having made its point , repeatedly , ESOP then insists : " Since the deployment of electronic procurement platforms is currently mandatory , this is a particularly serious situation .
It entails an artificial constraint on the market induced by a private firm while implementing a service foreseen in Código dos Contratos Públicos ( Public Procurement Law ) . "
This " artificial constraint " is , ESOP notes , contrary to " the dispositions contained in Decree - law n. 143-A/2008 and European directives , where non-discrimination , interoperability and compatibility are key criteria " .
While ESOP rather kindly says it " does not oppose of a private entity such as Vortal using Microsoft , or any other base technology of their choice , and has no legitimacy to comment upon internal software options " , it insists that " to impose software of a specific brand onto a third party and thus , in clear opposition to several laws , directly hamper competition through a legally required service is indeed a serious matter " .
It adds : " This situation gives rise to a direct interference in the software options of end - costumers / enterprises , options which should be based exclusively on regular market functioning , with no restrictions arising from the technical requirements of a public service . "
ESOP has apparently made several approaches to Vortal 's development team " to diplomatically reach a solution for this problem " - without success .
As a result of Vortal 's rebuff , the organisation has now reported the matter to the relevant " national and international authorities " - including the European Commission .
It warns : " ESOP ’s associate companies may eventually demand compensation for possible client loss and public image damage caused by this situation . " ®
Much html code has been spilled about the wingnut obsession with “ going Galt ” in order to avoid paying a 39 % marginal rate on income over 250 K a year .
Matt Yglesias points out that we ’d probably be better off if a lot of wealthy Americans went Galt , the Washington Independent has a nice run-down of the whole movement , if it can be called that , and commenters all over point out that John Galt would never have worked as a dentist , represented people from Bakersfield , or slept with Glenn Reynolds .
These are good points , but I think there ’s been too much emphasis on what idiots these people are and not enough on how childish they are .
Quitting work because of a slight tax increase is n’t akin to anything from any sort of philosophy , not even one as crude and simplistic as Ayn Rand ’s ; it ’s more akin to a child ’s decision to take his ball and go home .
It ’s probably worse , though , since when a typical ten year - old gets home , stops crying , and wipes his nose , he does n’t then fantasize about how the world will now suffer from the loss of his inestimable brilliance .
I do n’t know if Vincent Gallo is a Randian or not ( it certainly would n’t surprise me if he was ) , but this quote summarizes Galtism in its current form perfectly : “ I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings ; and I did it out of spite . ”
What I think is more insidious , though , than wingnut dentists ’ cutting back their hours or Mrs. Instapundit cutting back on whatever it is that she normally does , is the widespread belief among elites that they and their colleagues are indispensable men .
Like one of JMM ’s readers , I fear that Geithner thinks that our economy would be decimated if we forcibly Galted the geniuses who ran our financial industry into the ground .
I fear that when Andrew Sullivan and Joe Klein gush about the greatness of David Brooks , it ’s because they view themselves and each other as a d’Anconia - Danneskjöld - Galt punditocratic triumvirate that may yet save the world from unseriousness and blogofascism .
I even fear that when Villagers praise Obama ’s “ political gifts ” , they ’re doing so for the same reason they praised George Bush ’s cowboy gut instincts ; that is , because they feel that the talents of leaders in Washington reflect upon its scribes .
To put it simply , I fear that we are now ruled by incompetent egomaniacs who will never blow the whistle on each other , no matter how bad things get , because to do so would be to admit that none of them is indispensable or brilliant after all .
Raised by keepers since birth in December , experts at the San Francisco Zoo decided to introduce baby Hasani to his new surrogate mom , Bawang , yesterday .
After a few cautious hours , the two got along wonderfully as you can see in this touching video .
ZooBorns has been following little Hasani since he was just 9 days old .
Here 's a reminder .
Surrogate gorilla mom Bawang has raised three offspring of her own and has proven to be a outstanding mother .
Keepers noted that Bawang 's handling of Hasani was very gentle and clearly demonstrated her natural maternal instincts kicking in .
Appointed two months ago by the Director of National Intelligence Adm. Dennis Blair to chair the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) , the body charged with producing analyses on key issues on behalf of all 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community , ret .
Amb. Charles " Chas " Freeman withdrew his name in mid-March after a sustained campaign against the appointment by right - wing leaders of the so - called " Israel Lobby " concerned about his past criticism of Israel ’s relations with its Arab neighbors , and particularly its treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories .
One of the most highly regarded and experienced diplomats of his generation , Freeman , now 66 , was strongly supported not only by Blair , but also by many retired senior intelligence and foreign service officers , including former U.N. Amb .
Thomas Pickering and Samuel Lewis , both of whom had themselves served at one time as ambassadors to Israel .
They , along with 15 other top - ranking retired diplomats , praised Freeman as a " man of integrity and high intelligence who would never let his personal views shade or distort intelligence estimates . "
In an exclusive interview , which is excerpted below , IPS Washington bureau chief Jim Lobe asked Freeman about his ambitions as chairman of the NIC .
IPS : Because much of the talk around Washington after your appointment — before , during and after your withdrawal — has so narrowly focused on a few issues , there was never much public debate about what you hoped to accomplish in the job of NIC chairman .
CF : I was , frankly , approaching this with a fairly well thought out but still hypothetical focus on process with some additional questions of substance that I wanted to explore .
I say hypothetical , because you never know until you encounter bureaucratic or other realities whether your notion of what needs to be done is in fact realistic or feasible .
But my sense was there have been several problems with the intelligence community and its output in recent years .
Obviously , there ’s been a problem of quality , illustrated along with the other problem — credibility — very nicely in the run-up to the Iraq War and the credulity with which the intelligence community responded to assertions by exile and special interest groups and others , and its willingness to slice and dice its conclusions to suit the political taste of its principal consumers .
IPS : What sorts of procedural changes were you thinking about implementing ?
CF : In general , I would ’ve tried very hard to encourage members of the intelligence community to use classified information as a form of corroboration for information that is not classified , or is not terribly sensitive even if it is classified .
In other words , I would urge analysts to write down rather than write up terms of levels of classification .
The theory here is that , whereas many people in the ( NIC ) have tended to see the value of intelligence as directly proportional to its level of classification , this , in fact , misunderstands the nature of intelligence .
Intelligence is simply information that is relevant to statecraft or decision - making .
If it ’s on the front page of the Financial Times or Inter Press or has been stolen out of the Kremlin safe , the key question is what is its reliability and how much can you rely upon it in understanding the situation you confront and in forming policies to deal with that situation .
I must say much of the criticism of my appointment focused on the apparently horrifying possibility that I might actually produce intelligence that might not conform to political convenience or correctness but reached some other conclusion — intelligence that would n’t fit the preconceptions or policy preferences of its consumers .
And that would be unacceptable .
IPS : What about the approach to gathering and assessing intelligence ?
CF :
The tendency has been very much to focus on the short - term , on current intelligence — for example , how many tunnels collapsed in Gaza under Israeli bombs yesterday ? — and not to think about longer - term issues .
What does it mean that tunnels are collapsing under Israeli bombs ?
What does it mean for Israel ?
What does it mean for Egypt ?
What does it mean for Palestinians in Gaza ?
What does it mean for the international community ?
Most importantly , what does it mean for U.S. interests and U.S. policy ?
What are the longer - term consequences of the absence of peace for Israelis and the continued squeeze on Palestinians for them ?
I would ’ve tried to shift toward a more consistently medium - or long - range focus .
I would ’ve hoped that the material provided to the president could include feature writing , to use a journalistic analogy , as well as reporting on current events .
IPS : What about longer - term strategic issues that may not be getting enough attention ?
CF : One is very apposite today , and that is the future of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency .
At Bretton Woods , the dollar became the global reserve currency , backed by gold .
A quarter century later , Nixon eliminated the gold backing for our currency .
Dollar hegemony has been central to our ability to basically go off the tracks fiscally and financially here .
It has enabled us to avoid addressing all sorts of problems with which we ’re now afflicted , and it has enabled us to avoid having financial discipline being imposed on us of the sort we have insisted be imposed on every other country under IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) guidelines .
The role of the dollar as a universal currency for reserve and trade settlement purposes is absolutely central to our international power and reach .
Furthermore , we have used the fact that the dollar is an extension of our sovereignty to impose unilateral sanctions all over the place and to manipulate the global banking sector to enforce our policies , even when those policies — say , with respect to Iran — are not supported by others .
So we have a big stake in this , and when we get the dollar into trouble , as we have done , this is very , very fundamental .
We now have China , Russia , Brazil , India , South Korea , at least , and very likely others , calling for the gradual elimination of the dollar as a reserve currency and its replacement by stages with something else — in the case of the Chinese proposal , with special drawing rights under the IMF .
I ’ve seen this coming for well over a year , and have been talking about it .
It ’s now upon us , and it is not a problem you can send the fleet to solve .
In the end , if you create a situation where people do n’t want dollars , there ’s nothing you can do about that .
So I think this is a strategic issue .
There ’s another issue that no one ’s paying any attention to , and that is the consequences of the erosion of the world order that we crafted after World War II and for the post - colonial era that followed .
Both depended on what I would call Euro - American or Atlantic - community notions of the rule of law and the sanctity of international agreements and common notions of civil and human rights , including the idea that all states — even the United States — should be subject to the same rules .
Now we ’re looking at a world in which the center of gravity in many ways is moving to Asia — to countries like China and India — non-western nations that were not participants in the crafting of this Atlantic consensus on the rule of law .
This raises a big question : if we and the Europeans do n’t work together to sustain the heritage that we created , will it survive ?
Or will new rules and a new order be dictated by people whose values are not the same as ours ?
And what are the consequences for us of an order based on values that differ from our heritage ?
There is a lot of rethinking that needs to go on .
To put all this in a broader context , the United States has been following strategies that are largely inchoate rather than deliberately developed .
That is , they have been implicit in our activities , rather than developed by an explicit reasoning process .
I do n’t think we can afford this anymore .
We have come close to the end of the line on quite a range of issues and relationships with foreign regions and nations .
We need to re-examine our strategies systematically .
It may be that I ’m wrong on the specifics and , if so , I ’d be happy to be corrected , but I do not think it deniable that we need to examine what is happening , why it ’s happening , and that we need to judge whether allowing it happen is in our interests or not , and , if not , to consider what might be required to reverse it .
IPS : Why do you think Blair picked you for the job of NIC chairman ?
CF : In some ways , he and I think very much alike .
He asked me to do this , and my initial reaction was I did n’t want to do it , because I had spent 30 years working for the government , and — in my view — that was 30 years enough , and I did n’t want to do it again .
But he convinced me in the end that my way of thinking and range of experience , which does include Latin America , Africa , South Asia , East Asia , South East Asia , the Arab world , the Middle East , Europe , defense policy , and Russia and central Asia , as well as Japan and South Korea — that this level of experience is not easily duplicated .
Second , I have been told that I have a reputation for thinking strategically and looking at long - term implications of issues rather than dwelling on the short - term .
I ’ve also been accused of the sin of realism and objectivity .
And maybe I ’m seen as an iconoclast .
Admiral Blair convinced me that he could n’t easily find anyone else with these characteristics , and that I therefore had a duty to the country to volunteer , so I did .
I knew I would be controversial for the reason that I have been indifferent to political correctness .
I came to believe that I could improve the quality of the process ; I could build in checks and balances against sycophancy ; I could reestablish the credibility of the product .
I could produce things that were sufficiently low in classification or maybe unclassified that they would really be useful to the Congress and others participating in a national discussion about what to do .
But when it became apparent that this little gang of Likudniks who were after me were going to stay on my case and continue their defamatory activities and use me as an excuse to discredit any judgment from the intelligence community that they found uncongenial , I concluded I could do everything I intended except restore the credibility of the product .
The only consolation I have to offset the viciousness of their attacks is that I think they rather overplayed their hand .
Instead of reinforcing the suffocation of debate , they may have opened it up .

Overture
For a long time I used to go to bed early .
Sometimes , when I had put out my candle , my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say “ I ’m going to sleep . ”
And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken me ; I would try to put away the book which , I imagined , was still in my hands , and to blow out the light ; I had been thinking all the time , while I was asleep , of what I had just been reading , but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own , until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book : a church , a quartet , the rivalry between François I and Charles V .
This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake ; it did not disturb my mind , but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning .
Then it would begin to seem unintelligible , as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit ; the subject of my book would separate itself from me , leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no ; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness , pleasant and restful enough for the eyes , and even more , perhaps , for my mind , to which it appeared incomprehensible , without a cause , a matter dark indeed .
I would ask myself what o’clock it could be ; I could hear the whistling of trains , which , now nearer and now farther off , punctuating the distance like the note of a bird in a forest , shewed me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station : the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place , to doing unusual things , to the last words of conversation , to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night ; and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home .
I would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow , as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood .
Or I would strike a match to look at my watch .
Nearly midnight .
The hour when an invalid , who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a strange hotel , awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief a streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door .
Oh , joy of joys !
it is morning .
The servants will be about in a minute : he can ring , and some one will come to look after him .
The thought of being made comfortable gives him strength to endure his pain .
He is certain he heard footsteps : they come nearer , and then die away .
The ray of light beneath his door is extinguished .
It is midnight ; some one has turned out the gas ; the last servant has gone to bed , and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help .
I would fall asleep , and often I would be awake again for short snatches only , just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot , or to open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness , to savour , in an instantaneous flash of perception , the sleep which lay heavy upon the furniture , the room , the whole surroundings of which I formed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very soon return to share .
Or , perhaps , while I was asleep I had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life , now for ever outgrown ; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors , such as that old terror of my great - uncle ’s pulling my curls , which was effectually dispelled on the day – the dawn of a new era to me–on which they were finally cropped from my head .
I had forgotten that event during my sleep ; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my great - uncle ’s fingers ; still , as a measure of precaution , I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams .
Sometimes , too , just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam , so a woman would come into existence while I was sleeping , conceived from some strain in the position of my limbs .
Formed by the appetite that I was on the point of gratifying , she it was , I imagined , who offered me that gratification .
My body , conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers , would strive to become one with her , and I would awake .
The rest of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company I had left but a moment ago : my cheek was still warm with her kiss , my body bent beneath the weight of hers .
If , as would sometimes happen , she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking hours , I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her , like people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have always longed to visit , and imagine that they can taste in reality what has charmed their fancy .
And then , gradually , the memory of her would dissolve and vanish , until I had forgotten the maiden of my dream .
When a man is asleep , he has in a circle round him the chain of the hours , the sequence of the years , the order of the heavenly host .
Instinctively , when he awakes , he looks to these , and in an instant reads off his own position on the earth ’s surface and the amount of time that has elapsed during his slumbers ; but this ordered procession is apt to grow confused , and to break its ranks .
Suppose that , towards morning , after a night of insomnia , sleep descends upon him while he is reading , in quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to sleep , he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course , and , at the moment of waking , he will have no idea of the time , but will conclude that he has just gone to bed .
Or suppose that he gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position ; sitting in an armchair , say , after dinner : then the world will fall topsy - turvy from its orbit , the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space , and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country .
But for me it was enough if , in my own bed , my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness ; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep , and when I awoke at midnight , not knowing where I was , I could not be sure at first who I was ; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence , such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal ’s consciousness ; I was more destitute of human qualities than the cave - dweller ; but then the memory , not yet of the place in which I was , but of various other places where I had lived , and might now very possibly be , would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not - being , from which I could never have escaped by myself : in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of civilisation , and out of a half - visualised succession of oil - lamps , followed by shirts with turned - down collars , would put together by degrees the component parts of my ego .
Perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon them by our conviction that they are themselves , and not anything else , and by the immobility of our conceptions of them .
For it always happened that when I awoke like this , and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to discover where I was , everything would be moving round me through the darkness : things , places , years .
My body , still too heavy with sleep to move , would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orientation of its various members , so as to induce from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood , to piece together and to give a name to the house in which it must be living .
Its memory , the composite memory of its ribs , knees , and shoulder - blades offered it a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept ; while the unseen walls kept changing , adapting themselves to the shape of each successive room that it remembered , whirling madly through the darkness .
And even before my brain , lingering in consideration of when things had happened and of what they had looked like , had collected sufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room , it , my body , would recall from each room in succession what the bed was like , where the doors were , how daylight came in at the windows , whether there was a passage outside , what I had had in my mind when I went to sleep , and had found there when I awoke .
The stiffened side underneath my body would , for instance , in trying to fix its position , imagine itself to be lying , face to the wall , in a big bed with a canopy ; and at once I would say to myself , “ Why , I must have gone to sleep after all , and Mamma never came to say good night ! ” for I was in the country with my grandfather , who died years ago ; and my body , the side upon which I was lying , loyally preserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have forgotten , brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the night - light in its bowl of Bohemian glass , shaped like an urn and hung by chains from the ceiling , and the chimney - piece of Siena marble in my bedroom at Combray , in my great - aunt ’s house , in those far distant days which , at the moment of waking , seemed present without being clearly denned , but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly awake .
Then would come up the memory of a fresh position ; the wall slid away in another direction ; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint - Loup ’s house in the country ; good heavens , it must be ten o’clock , they will have finished dinner !
I must have overslept myself , in the little nap which I always take when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint - Loup , before dressing for the evening .
For many years have now elapsed since the Combray days , when , coming in from the longest and latest walks , I would still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window .
It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint - Loup , and a different kind of pleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings , from visiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play , as a child , in the sunshine ; while the bedroom , in which I shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for dinner , from afar off I can see it , as we return from our walk , with its lamp shining through the window , a solitary beacon in the night .
These shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than a few seconds ; it often happened that , in my spell of uncertainty as to where I was , I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that uncertainty was composed any more than , when we watch a horse running , we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon a bioscope .
But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in which I had slept during my life , and in the end I would revisit them all in the long course of my waking dream : rooms in winter , where on going to bed I would at once bury my head in a nest , built up out of the most diverse materials , the corner of my pillow , the top of my blankets , a piece of a shawl , the edge of my bed , and a copy of an evening paper , all of which things I would contrive , with the infinite patience of birds building their nests , to cement into one whole ; rooms where , in a keen frost , I would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the outer world ( like the sea - swallow which builds at the end of a dark tunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth ) , and where , the fire keeping in all night , I would sleep wrapped up , as it were , in a great cloak of snug and savoury air , shot with the glow of the logs which would break out again in flame : in a sort of alcove without walls , a cave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself , a zone of heat whose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature as gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face , from the corners of the room , or from parts near the window or far from the fireplace which had therefore remained cold–or rooms in summer , where I would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening , where the moonlight striking upon the half - opened shutters would throw down to the foot of my bed its enchanted ladder ; where I would fall asleep , as it might be in the open air , like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised in the focus of a sunbeam–or sometimes the Louis XVI room , so cheerful that I could never feel really unhappy , even on my first night in it : that room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling would part , ever so gracefully , to indicate where the bed was and to keep it separate ; sometimes again that little room with the high ceiling , hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys , and partly walled with mahogany , in which from the first moment my mind was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses , convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though I were not there ; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet , which stood across one corner of the room , cleared for itself a site I had not looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of vision : that room in which my mind , forcing itself for hours on end to leave its moorings , to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the exact shape of the room , and to reach to the summit of that monstrous funnel , had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched out in bed , my eyes staring upwards , my ears straining , my nostrils sniffing uneasily , and my heart beating ; until custom had changed the colour of the curtains , made the clock keep quiet , brought an expression of pity to the cruel , slanting face of the glass , disguised or even completely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses , and distinctly reduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling .
Custom !
that skilful but unhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end with her provisional arrangements ; whom the mind , for all that , is fortunate in discovering , for without the help of custom it would never contrive , by its own efforts , to make any room seem habitable .
Certainly I was now well awake ; my body had turned about for the last time and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding objects stand still , had set me down under my bedclothes , in my bedroom , and had fixed , approximately in their right places in the uncertain light , my chest of drawers , my writing - table , my fireplace , the window overlooking the street , and both the doors .
But it was no good my knowing that I was not in any of those houses of which , in the stupid moment of waking , if I had not caught sight exactly , I could still believe in their possible presence ; for memory was now set in motion ; as a rule I did not attempt to go to sleep again at once , but used to spend the greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at Combray with my great - aunt , at Balbec , Paris , Doncières , Venice , and the rest ; remembering again all the places and people that I had known , what I had actually seen of them , and what others had told me .
At Combray , as every afternoon ended , long before the time when I should have to go up to bed , and to lie there , unsleeping , far from my mother and grandmother , my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred .
Some one had had the happy idea of giving me , to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched , a magic lantern , which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner - time to come : in the manner of the master - builders and glass - painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable iridescence , supernatural phenomena of many colours , in which legends were depicted , as on a shifting and transitory window .
But my sorrows were only increased , because this change of lighting destroyed , as nothing else could have done , the customary impression I had formed of my room , thanks to which the room itself , but for the torture of having to go to bed in it , had become quite endurable .
For now I no longer recognised it , and I became uneasy , as though I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging , in a place where I had just arrived , by train , for the first time .
Riding at a jerky trot , Golo , his mind filled with an infamous design , issued from the little three - cornered forest which dyed dark - green the slope of a convenient hill , and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the castle of poor Geneviève de Brabant .
This castle was cut off short by a curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the transparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through a slot in the lantern .
It was only the wing of a castle , and in front of it stretched a moor on which Geneviève stood , lost in contemplation , wearing a blue girdle .
The castle and the moor were yellow , but I could tell their colour without waiting to see them , for before the slides made their appearance the old - gold sonorous name of Brabant had given me an unmistakable clue .
Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read aloud by my great - aunt , which he seemed perfectly to understand , for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty , so as to conform to the indications given in the text ; then he rode away at the same jerky trot .
And nothing could arrest his slow progress .
If the lantern were moved I could still distinguish Golo ’s horse advancing across the window - curtains , swelling out with their curves and diving into their folds .
The body of Golo himself , being of the same supernatural substance as his steed ’s , overcame all material obstacles –everything that seemed to bar his way–by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself : the door - handle , for instance , over which , adapting itself at once , would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face , never losing its nobility or its melancholy , never shewing any sign of trouble at such a transubstantiation .
And , indeed , I found plenty of charm in these bright projections , which seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past , and to shed around me the reflections of such ancient history .
But I cannot express the discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought no more of the room than of myself .
The anaesthetic effect of custom being destroyed , I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things .
The door - handle of my room , which was different to me from all the other doorhandles in the world , inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord and without my having to turn it , so unconscious had its manipulation become ; lo and behold , it was now an astral body for Golo .
And as soon as the dinner - bell rang I would run down to the dining - room , where the big hanging lamp , ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef , shed the same light as on every other evening ; and I would fall into the arms of my mother , whom the misfortunes of Geneviève de Brabant had made all the dearer to me , just as the crimes of Golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience .
But after dinner , alas , I was soon obliged to leave Mamma , who stayed talking with the others , in the garden if it was fine , or in the little parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet .
Everyone except my grandmother , who held that “ It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country , ” and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the very wettest days , because he would send me up to my room with a book instead of letting me stay out of doors .
“ That is not the way to make him strong and active , ” she would say sadly , “ especially this little man , who needs all the strength and character that he can get . ”
My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer , for he took an interest in meteorology , while my mother , keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him , looked at him with tender respect , but not too hard , not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind .
But my grandmother , in all weathers , even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Françoise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs , so that they should not get soaked –you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden , lashed by the storm , pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to imbibe the life - giving draughts of wind and rain .
She would say , “ At last one can breathe ! ” and would run up and down the soaking paths–too straight and symmetrical for her liking , owing to the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener , whom my father had been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve–with her keen , jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by the intoxication of the storm , the force of hygiene , the stupidity of my education and of symmetry in gardens , rather than by any anxiety ( for that was quite unknown to her ) to save her plum - coloured skirt from the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh despair .
When these walks of my grandmother ’s took place after dinner there was one thing which never failed to bring her back to the house : that was if ( at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her , moth - like , in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs were set out on the card - table ) my great - aunt called out to her : “ Bathilde !
Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy ! ”
For , simply to tease her ( she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my father ’s family that everyone made a joke of it ) , my great - aunt used to make my grandfather , who was forbidden liqueurs , take just a few drops .
My poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to taste the brandy ; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops all the same , and she would go out again sad and discouraged , but still smiling , for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards others , and her continual subordination of herself and of her own troubles , appeared on her face blended in a smile which , unlike those seen on the majority of human faces , had no trace in it of irony , save for herself , while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes , which could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them passionate caresses .
The torments inflicted on her by my great - aunt , the sight of my grandmother ’s vain entreaties , of her in her weakness conquered before she began , but still making the futile endeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur - glass–all these were things of the sort to which , in later years , one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at them , to take the tormentor ’s side with a .
happy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not , really , tormenting ; but in those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my great - aunt .
And yet , as soon as I heard her “ Bathilde !
Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy ! ” in my cowardice I became at once a man , and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and injustice ; I preferred not to see them ; I ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the roof , which smelt of orris-root , and was scented also by a wild currant - bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through the half - opened window .
Intended for a more special and a baser use , this room , from which , in the daytime , I could see as far as the keep of Roussainville - le - Pin , was for a long time my place of refuge , doubtless because it was the only room whose door Ï was allowed to lock , whenever my occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude ; reading or dreaming , secret tears or paroxysms of desire .
Alas !
I little knew that my own lack of will - power , my delicate health , and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother ’s mind than any little breach of the rules by her husband , during those endless perambulations , afternoon and evening , in which we used to see passing up and down , obliquely raised towards the heavens , her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks , which with age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn , covered , if she were walking abroad , by a half - lifted veil , while upon them either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an involuntary tear .
My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma would come in and kiss me after I was in bed .
But this good night lasted for so short a time : she went down again so soon that the moment in which I heard her climb the stairs , and then caught the sound of her garden dress of blue muslin , from which hung little tassels of plaited straw , rustling along the double - doored corridor , was for me a moment of the keenest sorrow .
So much did I love that good night that I reached the stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible , so as to prolong the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared .
Sometimes when , after kissing me , she opened the door to go , I longed to call her back , to say to her “ Kiss me just once again , ” but I knew that then she would at once look displeased , for the concession which she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of peace always annoyed my father , who thought such ceremonies absurd , and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need , the custom of having her there at all , which was a very different thing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was already crossing the threshold .
And to see her look displeased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before , when she bent her loving face down over my bed , and held it out to me like a Host , for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of her real presence , and with it the power to sleep .
But those evenings on which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests to dinner , and therefore she did not come at all .
Our ’ guests ’ were practically limited to M. Swann , who , apart from a few passing strangers , was almost the only person who ever came to the house at Combray , sometimes to a neighbourly dinner ( but less frequently since his unfortunate marriage , as my family did not care to receive his wife ) and sometimes after dinner , uninvited .
On those evenings when , as we sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut - tree and round the iron table , we heard , from the far end of the garden , not the large and noisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous , interminable , frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out of action by coming in ’ without ringing , ’ but the double peal–timid , oval , gilded –of the visitors ’ bell , everyone would at once exclaim “ A visitor !
Who in the world can it be ? ” but they knew quite well that it could only be M. Swann .
My great - aunt , speaking in a loud voice , to set an example , in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural , would tell the others not to whisper so ; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a stranger coming in , who would be led to think that people were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear ; and then my grandmother would be sent out as a scout , always happy to find an excuse for an additional turn in the garden , which she would utilise to remove surreptitiously , as she passed , the stakes of a rose - tree or two , so as to make the roses look a little more natural , as a mother might run her hand through her boy ’s hair , after the barber had smoothed it down , to make it stick out properly round his head .
And there we would all stay , hanging on the words which would fall from my grandmother ’s lips when she brought us back her report of the enemy , as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of possible invaders , and then , soon after , my grandfather would say : “ I can hear Swann ’s voice . ”
And , indeed , one could tell him only by his voice , for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes , under a high forehead fringed with fair , almost red hair , dressed in the Bressant style , because in the garden we used as little light as possible , so as not to attract mosquitoes : and I would slip away as though not going for anything in particular , to tell them to bring out the syrups ; for my grandmother made a great point , thinking it ’nicer / of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary , which we kept for visitors only .
Although a far younger man , M. Swann was very much attached to my grandfather , who had been an intimate friend , in his time , of Swann ’s father , an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing would , it seemed , often check the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts .
Several times in the course of a year I would hear my grandfather tell at table the story , which never varied , of the behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife , by whose bedside he had watched day and night .
My grandfather , who had not seen him for a long time , hastened to join him at the Swanns ’ family property on the outskirts of Combray , and managed to entice him for a moment , weeping profusely , out of the death - chamber , so that he should not be present when the body was laid in its coffin .
They took a turn or two in the park , where there was a little sunshine .
Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather by the arm and cried , “ Oh , my dear old friend , how fortunate we are to be walking here together on such a charming day !
Do n’t you see how pretty they are , all these trees–my hawthorns , and my new pond , on which you have never congratulated me ?
You look as glum as a night - cap .
Do n’t you feel this little breeze ?
Ah !
whatever you may say , it ’s good to be alive all the same , my dear Amédée ! ”
And then , abruptly , the memory of his dead wife returned to him , and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire into how , at such a time , he could have allowed himself to be carried away by an impulse of happiness , he confined himself to a gesture which he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind : that is , he passed his hand across his forehead , dried his eyes , and wiped his glasses .
And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife , but used to say to my grandfather , during the two years for which he survived her , “ It ’s a funny thing , now ; I very often think of my poor wife , but I can not think of her very much at any one time . ”
“ Often , but a little at a time , like poor old Swann , ” became one of my grandfather ’s favourite phrases , which he would apply to all kinds of things .
And I should have assumed that this father of Swann ’s had been a monster if my grandfather , whom I regarded as a better judge than myself , and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn , had not gone on to exclaim , “ But , after all , he had a heart of gold . ”
For many years , albeit–and especially before his marriage–M .
Swann the younger came often to see them at Combray , my great - aunt and grandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society which his family had frequented , or that , under the sort of incognito which the name of Swann gave him among us , they were harbouring –with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know it–one of the smartest members of the Jockey Club , a particular friend of the Comte de Paris and of the Prince of Wales , and one of the men most sought after in the aristocratic world of the Faubourg Saint - Germain .
Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the world of fashion was , of course , due in part to his own reserve and discretion , but also to the fact that middle - class people in those days took what was almost a Hindu view of society , which they held to consist of sharply defined castes , so that everyone at his birth found himself called to that station in life which his parents already occupied , and nothing , except the chance of a brilliant career or of a ’ good ’ marriage , could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste .
M. Swann , the father , had been a stockbroker ; and so ’ young Swann ’ found himself immured for life in a caste where one ’s fortune , as in a list of taxpayers , varied between such and such limits of income .
We knew the people with whom his father had associated , and so we knew his own associates , the people with whom he was ’ in a position to mix . ’
If he knew other people besides , those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old friends of the family , like my relatives , shut their eyes all the more good - naturedly that Swann himself , after he was left an orphan , still came most faithfully to see us ; but we would have been ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat , had he met them while he was walking with ourselves .
Had there been such a thing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself , as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father ’s position , his coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs , because , leading a very simple life , and having always had a craze for ’ antiques ’ and pictures , he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit , but which stood on the Quai d’Orléans , a neighbourhood in which my great - aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered .
“ Are you really a connoisseur , now ? ” she would say to him ; “ I ask for your own sake , as you are likely to have ’ fakes ’ palmed off on you by the dealers , ” for she did not , in fact , endow him with any critical faculty , and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who , in conversation , would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness , not only when he gave us kitchen recipes , going into the most minute details , but even when my grandmother ’s sisters were talking to him about art .
When challenged by them to give an opinion , or to express his admiration for some picture , he would remain almost impolitely silent , and would then make amends by furnishing ( if he could ) some fact or other about the gallery in which the picture was hung , or the date at which it had been painted .
But as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure–and he would have a fresh story for us on every occasion –with some one whom we ourselves knew , such as the Combray chemist , or our cook , or our coachman .
These stories certainly used to make my great - aunt laugh , but she could never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann invariably made himself play in the adventures , or of the wit that he shewed in telling us of them .
“ It is easy to see that you are a regular ’ character , ’ M. Swann ! ”
As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a trifle ’ common , ’ she would always take care to remark to strangers , when Swann was mentioned , that he could easily , if he had wished to , have lived in the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l’Opéra , and that he was the son of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million francs , but that it was a fad of his .
A fad which , moreover , she thought was bound to amuse other people so much that in Paris , when M. Swann called on New Year ’s Day bringing her a little packet of marrons glacés , she never failed , if there were strangers in the room , to say to him : “ Well , M. Swann , and do you still live next door to the Bonded Vaults , so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to Lyons ? ” and she would peep out of the corner of her eye , over her glasses , at the other visitors .
But if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann , who , in his capacity as the son of old M. Swann , was ’ fully qualified ’ to be received by any of the ’ upper middle class , ’ the most respected barristers and solicitors of Paris ( though he was perhaps a trifle inclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance ) , had another almost secret existence of a wholly different kind : that when he left our house in Paris , saying that he must go home to bed , he would no sooner have turned the corner than he would stop , retrace his steps , and be off to some drawing - room on whose like no stockbroker or associate of stockbrokers had ever set eyes –that would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as , to a woman of wider reading , the thought of being herself on terms of intimacy with Aristaeus , of knowing that he would , when he had finished his conversation with her , plunge deep into the realms of Thetis , into an empire veiled from mortal eyes , in which Virgil depicts him as being received with open arms ; or–to be content with an image more likely to have occurred to her , for she had seen it painted on the plates we used for biscuits at Combray–as the thought of having had to dinner Ali Baba , who , as soon as he found himself alone and unobserved , would make his way into the cave , resplendent with its unsuspected treasures .

( CNN ) -- The U.S. government has dropped charges against Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , the suspect in the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole , according to a Pentagon spokesman .
Parents and friends at the funeral in 2000 for a sailor killed during the bombing of the USS Cole .
The charges were dropped " without prejudice " by Susan Crawford , convening authority at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , according to Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon .
The proceeding did not address specifics of the government 's case against al - Nashiri , who remains a " high value " detainee held at Guantanamo .
In removing the charges without prejudice , prosecutors can resubmit charges at a later date while at the same time complying with President Barack Obama 's order to the military to hold off on cases for four months .
On his first day in office , Obama ordered the halt , requiring prosecutors to seek delays in the 14 active cases before military commissions there .
But the judge , Col. James Pohl , ordered arraignment for Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri to go ahead as scheduled on Monday .
With this move , all cases at Guantanamo are now in line with the president 's order to halt court proceedings at the detention center , according to Gordon .
Al - Nashiri is accused of planning the October 2000 bombing of the Cole while it was in the Yemeni port of Aden .
The attack killed 17 American sailors and crippled the vessel , which returned to service in 2002 .
The Office of Military Commissions , which manages the prosecutions of suspected terrorists , said last week that it might have to temporarily drop charges against al - Nashiri to comply with the presidential order .
Do n't Miss Judge refuses to delay case against USS Cole suspect
When prosecutors asked for a continuance in the trial , Pohl denied the request , saying the government 's " argument for continuances were unpersuasive , " according to a copy of his opinion .
Pohl noted there had been no previous requests for a delay , and that the public 's interest in a speedy trial would be harmed by further delay .
Al - Nashiri was captured in 2002 .
He was held in secret locations until being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006 .
Meanwhile , the White House has invited families of sailors who died in the Cole bombing to meet with Obama on Friday .
A number of the families were called Thursday afternoon , according to Andrew Hall , the lawyer who represented families .
The invitation was for the families to attend " without their lawyers , " according to Hall .
They were not told why they were going to meet with Obama , he added .
According to the White House schedule for Friday , Obama will meet privately with families of the Cole attack and also with families of victims of the 9/11 attacks .
" The president wants to talk with these families about resolving the issues involved with closing Guantanamo Bay -- while keeping the safety and security of the American people as his top priority , " the schedule said .

See the prototype Anaconda in action
Anaconda , a giant rubber “ snake ” that floats offshore and converts wave energy to electricity , is a step closer to commercialisation .
An 8 - metre long , 1/25th scale version is currently undergoing tests in a large wave tank in Gosport , UK , and a full - size working version could be a reality in five years .
Harnessing the power of waves is an attractive proposition because they are much more energy dense than wind .
But wave power remains the poor relation of the renewable energy sector due to the difficulties of cheaply operating machinery in the harsh marine environment .
The world ’s first commercial wave farm only began operating last year , off the northern coast of Portugal .
A variety of other designs are in testing around the world , but none are as unusual as the Anaconda .
The rubber snake is filled with freshwater – to help deter sea creatures from setting up a home inside – and sealed at both ends to create a semi-rigid balloon that floats at the sea ’s surface .
Wave pulse
The tube is anchored at one end and as waves wash along its length they exert pressure on the snake that is transmitted by the water inside .
This forces Anaconda ’s walls to expand outwards into the wave troughs where they are under less pressure , forming “ bulge waves ” that travel along the Anaconda ’s length .
Advertisement
These waves are similar to those that pass through the human circulatory system and can be felt as the pulse in the wrist and neck , says Rod Rainey of Atkins Global , co-inventor of the Anaconda .
When each bulge wave reaches the end of the snake it keeps a turbine spinning to generate electricity .
The snake is made from a rubber - based material similar to that used to make dracones – flexible containers that are filled with diesel or water and towed behind ships for quick and cheap transportation .
Other than the turbine , Anaconda has no moving parts and unlike other wave power devices it needs only one tether to the ocean floor .
That lowers construction costs and reduces the need for maintenance – an expensive undertaking in offshore settings where corrosion and accessibility are problems , explains Rainey .
Full - size snake
Des Crampton , CEO of Checkmate Seaenergy , the firm commercialising the flexible wave harvester , says a full - size Anaconda 200 metres long could generate enough energy to power 1000 average homes .
“ Anaconda captures more energy than all existing wave energy devices , ” he says .
Rainey and retired physicist Francis Farley began work on the concept in 2007 , and tested mini Anacondas last year .
The first full - size Anacondas could become operational in 2014 .
That would leave Anaconda several years behind competing technologies , such as the Pelamis system currently operational off the Portuguese coast .
But paradoxically , Rainey thinks success for Pelamis will be crucial for the future of Anaconda .
“ It will deeply upset the investment community if Pelamis fails , ” he says .

Advertisement Thousands of people are streaming into camps seeking refuge from the conflict between Pakistan 's army and Taleban rebels in the country 's north - west .
Most of the civilians come from Mingora , the main city in the Swat valley , where a curfew was temporarily lifted to allow residents to leave .
The road out of Mingora was filled with buses and trucks on Friday , each one overcrowded , with people on the roofs .
The UN says nearly one million people have fled in the past two weeks .
The total number of people internally displaced within Pakistan over the past 12 months has risen to around 1.4 million .
See a map of the region
At least 80,000 of those are now living in camps run by the UN refugee agency ( UNHCR ) , based around the city of Mardan .
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says the sheer speed with which people have fled their homes in north - west Pakistan has taken even experienced UN aid workers by surprise .
Owen Bennett - Jones , Islamabad
There are currently three separate large - scale military offensives in the north - west of Pakistan .
People leaving the affected areas are terrified by the scale of the army action .
Stories are circulating about the terrible decisions war imposes .
One family in Swat for example is said to have left behind a son who could not be moved because he is a polio victim .
They gave him a supply of bread and water and left him on his own as they headed for safety .
For the moment public opinion is with the army .
Those who have actually lived under the Taleban held areas have been particularly disgusted by the floggings and the beheadings .
But the generals know the public mood could change if there are too many civilian casualties .
In pictures : Leaving Swat Schoolgirl 's harrowing escape Offensive heads for climax Aid workers say some parts of the Swat valley have been emptied of their populations .
The UNHCR says the crisis could destabilise the entire region unless there is a massive response from the international community .
It is expected to launch an emergency appeal for Pakistan in the next few days .
Pakistan 's Prime Minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani , has described the situation as the country 's worst refugee crisis since the bloody partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 at the end of colonial rule .
Speaking at the opening of a briefing session for key Pakistani political figures , Mr Gilani said Pakistan was " at the crossroads of its history " , but conceded that the army operation in Swat could not be a " permanent solution " .
The military commander in North West Frontier Province , Gen Tariq Khan , said the current military operations would probably be finished in about a month , but the process would continue elsewhere , turning into police operations by the end of the year .
' No hope '
The army has blockaded the town of Mingora , the administrative hub of the Swat valley .
The first wave of people left Mingora a week ago , and food and other vital supplies are now scarce inside the city , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .
But the army remains reluctant to engage in street - to - street combat while large numbers of civilians remain in Mingora , she adds , and authorities are keen to allow as many civilians as possible to leave the city .
After days under curfew and bitter fighting between government troops and rebels , buses were laid on to ferry to safety some of the 150,000 civilians thought to remain inside Mingora .
People have been getting used to new living conditions
But residents spoke of the need to walk 4 km to the edge of the city to pick up transport , running the gauntlet between Taleban positions and army attacks .
One man , Iftikhar , told the BBC that Pakistani helicopter gunships fired on residential areas , killing civilians .
" When I was leaving I saw many bodies lying on the roadside , " he said .
" Thousands of men , women and children are on foot trying to get out of Swat . "
The road from the southern edge of the conflict zone towards Mandar was clogged with buses , trucks , motorbikes and rickshaws throughout Friday .
Taleban ' hotline '
As the army pressed forward , it urged civilians to help them catch insurgents trying to flee the area .
It said some militants were disguising themselves by shaving off their beards and cutting their hair , and it gave a hotline number for people to call if they thought they had seen a Taleban fighter .
Up to 15,000 troops have now been deployed in the Swat valley and neighbouring areas to take on some 5,000 militants .
The army said on Friday that it killed 55 militants across Swat over the previous 24 hours , with three Pakistani security personnel also killed .
In a statement , the army also said a leading Taleban commander , Dawa Noor , identified as an instigator of the Taleban 's recent move into Buner , south of Swat , was among those killed .
But a Taleban spokesman , Muslim Khan , says the militants have killed at least 37 soldiers in fighting since Wednesday , with just three of their fighters killed .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says independent confirmation of these claims is difficult as the phone system across
Swat is down and tens of thousands of mobile phones have gone dead because of a lack of electricity .

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - Rival Palestinian groups agreed on Sunday to hold presidential and legislative elections by January 2010 but remained deadlocked over the key issue of forming a unity government that would prepare for the polls .
Diplomats and analysts see the success of the Egyptian - sponsored talks as key to reuniting Palestinians after 21 months of schism between Hamas - ruled Gaza and the West Bank , where the Fatah group of President Mahmoud Abbas holds sway .
Fatah and Hamas , the largest two Palestinian groups , differ fundamentally on how to deal with Israel .
Hamas believes in armed struggle , though it is willing to consider a truce , while Abbas backs negotiations with the Jewish state .
The groups agreed on holding presidential and legislative elections by January 25 , 2010 , Wasil Abou Youssef , secretary - general of the Palestine Liberation Front , told Egypt ’s state - run Middle East News Agency .
But participants said differences remained between Fatah and Hamas on whether the unity cabinet that would emerge from the talks be composed of political groups or non-partisan technocrats , as demanded by Western powers and Egypt .
“ It is a standstill on the issue of the government , ” said Walid al - Awad of the communist People ’s Party .
The groups agreed on February 26 to form five committees to also tackle issues such as the composition of security agencies in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank .
The groups have yet to agree on an electoral law and whether it would be based on proportional representation or constituencies , Awad and Abou Youssef told Reuters .
Awad said two committees discussing national reconciliation and the reform of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) concluded their work on Saturday .
The PLO , dominated by Abbas and the groups loyal to him , have represented the Palestinians since 1964 but the more recently created Islamist movements , such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad , have never been part of it despite a 2005 agreement to bring them under its umbrella .
In Gaza , Hamas official Taher al - Nono told Reuters : “ There was progress in some issues last night .
There is an optimism , a cautious optimism . ”
The West had shunned a previous unity government headed by Hamas after it won parliamentary elections in 2006 .
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said this month he intended to resign by the end of March to pave the way for the formation of a unity cabinet .
Abbas , who appointed Fayyad after Hamas routed Fatah in Gaza in June 2007 , asked him to remain in office until results emerged from the talks in Cairo .
The new government is also expected to lead efforts to reconstruct the Gaza Strip after Israel ’s three - week military offensive , which ended in January .
Awad said his party has put forward a suggestion that the prime minister and six cabinet posts -- foreign affairs , interior , reconstruction , education , information and finance -- be held by independent ministers .
The remaining seats would be decided on political basis , he added .
New Banksy painting vandalised by graffiti artists
Banksy has been given a taste of his own spray paint after one of his pieces was vandalised by fellow graffiti artists .
Just days after he daubed his work on a wall in Hendon , someone spray - painted over the word PRICE - LESS .
They intended to remind Banksy of what urban art was all about , something he may have forgotten through his successful career .
Banksy 's latest work before it was written over by another ' urban artist '
A graffiti artist starts making his own statement , perhaps sending a message to the world famous Banksy
Banksy 's picture appeared about a month ago on the side of a power station at the junction with the A1 and the A406 North Circular Road .
It depicts a boy seemingly marking the wall of a power station with the words ' Last Graffiti Before Motorway ' .
Before it was vandalised , the 15ft painting could have been worth thousands of pounds .
His work is now barely recognisable at the junction with the A1 and the A406 North Circular Road in Hendon
The price of the The Whitehouse pub in Liverpool doubled to £ 1 million after Banksy adorned it with a rat holding a machine gun .
However , it 's not the first time a Banksy piece has been spray - painted .
One of his works on a building in Gillett Square , Dalston , shows a young boy wearing a chain with a pendant of a gun and carrying a teddy bear in his right hand and a ghetto - blaster .
Days later it was sprayed in blue , and the words ' love not money ' .
There still remains public uncertainty about the identity of Banksy , who was reportedly born and raised in Bristol .
He became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of the late 1980s .
Banksy 's famous art now appears in cities across the world .
Awesome , all the banks are showing a profit this quarter .
Even beleaguered Citigroup ( C ) managed to report a profit , while managing to post negative EPS , which is unusual .
So how'd they actually do it ?
Part of it was trading profits .
All the banks have had an awesome quarter in this respect , even as other core businesses have continued to deteriorate .
And part of it is just plain old creative accounting .
This Bloomberg piece explains :
“ It ’s very hard for me to foresee that one quarterly earnings report , or one announcement by Vikram Pandit that they are more profitable than they ’ve been since the third quarter of ‘ 07 , means all past things are forgiven , ” said Douglas Ciocca , a portfolio manager at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood , Kansas .
“ There has to be demonstration of traction . ”
Citigroup posted a $ 2.5 billion gain because of an accounting change adopted in 2007 .
Under the rule , companies are allowed to record any declines in the market value of their own debt as an unrealized gain .
In other words , because Citi 's debt is trading at distressed levels , the company could , theoretically , book some balance sheet gains by buying it back -- reducing liabilities by more than it costs to retire that debt .
Of course , they have n't done that yet .
But they could !
And then there 's just portfolio shuffling .
The company has moved assets , which might otherwise have to be written down , into its " helt ot maturity " portfolio , which means it does n't have to mark those assets to market .
Again , within the rules , but no fundamental improvement .
During the Vietnam War , Stanford students succeeded in banning secret military research from campus .
Last weekend , 150 activist alumni and present Stanford students targeted Condoleezza Rice for authorizing torture and misleading Americans into the illegal Iraq War .
By Marjorie CohnVeterans of the Stanford anti-Vietnam War movement had gathered for a 40th anniversary reunion during the weekend .
The gathering featured panels on foreign policy , the economy , political and social movements , science and technology , media , energy and the environment , and strategies for aging activists .
On Sunday , surrounded by alumni and students , Lenny Siegel and I nailed a petition to the University President ’s office door .
The petition , circulated by Stanford Say No to War , reads :
“ We the undersigned students , faculty , staff , alumni , and other concerned members of the Stanford community , believe that high officials of the U.S. Government , including our former Provost , current Political Science Professor , and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow , Condoleezza Rice , should be held accountable for any serious violations of the Law ( included ratified treaties , statutes , and / or the U.S. Constitution ) through investigation and , if the facts warrant , prosecution , by appropriate legal authorities .
” I stated , “ By nailing this petition to the door of the President ’s office , we are telling Stanford that the university should not have war criminals on its faculty .
There is prima facie evidence that Rice approved torture and misled the country into the Iraq War .
Stanford has an obligation to investigate those charges .
” After the petition nailing , I cited the law and evidence of Condoleezza Rice ’s responsibility for war crimes - including torture - and for selling the illegal Iraq War : As National Security Advisor , Rice authorized waterboarding in July 2002 , according to a newly released report of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Less than two months later , she hyped the impending U.S. invasion of Iraq , saying , “ We do n’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . ”
Her ominous warning was part of the Bush administration ’s campaign to sell the Iraq war , in spite of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ’s assurances that Saddam Hussein did not possess nuclear weapons .
A week before the nailing of the petition , Rice made some Nixonian admissions in response to questions from Stanford students during a campus dinner designed to burnish Rice ’s image on campus .
In October 1968 , Stanford anti-war activists had nailed a document to the door of the trustees ’ office which demanded that Stanford “ halt all military and economic projects concerned with Southeast Asia . ”

Mike Pence stands with the crooked banksters against his own constituents
Yesterday evening the House voted on Pat Leahy 's amendments to a bill to " improve enforcement of mortgage fraud , securities and commodities fraud , financial institution fraud , and other frauds related to Federal assistance and relief programs , for the recovery of funds lost to these frauds . "
It was a real bipartisan slam dunk , passing 338 - 52 , every single Democrat and most of the Republicans voting in favor and just 52 of the worst and most corrupt knee - jerk obstructionist and bankster shills voting in favor of fraud .
I suspect regular readers ofcould name most of the 52 slimy obstructionists who the banksters have in their pockets .
It 's boring typing their names over and over but here 's a sample of Republicans who count on their constituents being too stupid to know which way is up and which way is down : Todd Akin ( R - MO ) , Michele Bachmann ( R- MN ) , Joe Barton ( R - TX ) , Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) , John Boehner ( R- OH ) , Paul Broun ( R- GA ) , Dan Burton ( R- IN ) , Dave Camp ( R - MI ) , Jason Chaffetz ( R- UT ) , John Culberson ( R - TX ) , Vernon Ehlers ( R - MI ) , Virginia Foxx ( R- NC ) , Scott Garrett ( R- NJ ) , Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) , Steve King ( R- IA ) , John Kline ( R- MN ) , Doug Lamborn ( R- CO ) , Connie Mack ( R- FL ) , Don Manzullo ( R- IL ) , Patrick McHenry ( R-NC ) , Randy Neugenbauer ( R - TX ) , Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , Mike Pence ( R- IN ) , Tom Price ( R- GA ) , Pete Sessions ( R - TX ) , John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) , Adrian Smith ( R-NE ) , Lynn Westmoreland ( R - GA ) ... what a pack of dogs !
The whole package had passed the Senate April 28 92 - 4 , only the 4 worst obstructionist bankster slime in that body voting " no , " Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) , Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) and Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) .
Coburn and DeMint are both up fopr re-election next year and both know all too well they can feed their constituents any line of crap they want and still get re-elected .
Freshman Democratic Congressman Eric Massa ( D - NY ) voted , wisely , against the original bailout for the banksters .
But today he voted to add accountability to that bill .
" When TARP first came up , " he explained , " I argued to no avail that there was not enough transparency or accountability in the bill and we ended up arguing over AIG 's outrageous bonuses .
I would still vote against TARP , but I am happy to add more stringent requirements to the use of TARP and Recovery funds .
This bill will create an oversight committee to make sure that Recovery funds are spent properly .
The 111th Congress came into office with a pledge to clean up Washington and deliver the change that Americans demanded last November .
Because of this public desire for accountability in their elected officials , we were able to gain overwhelming bipartisan support for this plan .
" Every New York member of Congress , regardless of party , voted for the bill and all the Republicans left in the northeast except one crooked bribe taker , New Jersey bank shill , Scott Garrett , voted for it too .
Garrett always votes as though he were representing a backward rural district of Texas or Georgia , always blithely unaware that his constituents distrust and hate banks , or , as new polling out this morning shows , " higher fees and a worsening image for U.S. banks have left customers of the nation 's biggest lenders more dissatisfied with the service they receive . "
Let 's hope that 2010 is the year these northern New Jersey suburbanites put two and two together and come up with who enables these banksters and start to wonder why all the other New Jersey Republican Congressmen -- Frelinghuysen , LoBiondo , Smith , and Lance -- each took the side of their constituents while Garrett took the side of the banksters .

On FOX News Sunday with Chris Wallace , Convervakrat Evah Bayh joined hard - right fanatic Tom " Dr. No " Coburn and echoed his conservative principles and renewed his opposition to universal health care for America .
It 's really sad that a man rumored to be a VP pick is using the tired right wing talking points that the government can't do anything effectively and he had the frakkin ' nerve to bring in the Hannity - Beck line calling everything in sight " socialism " to describe Obama 's fiscal beliefs .
Is he seriously a member of the Democratic Party ?
He 's against any form of nationalism of the banking industry and wins the coveted " C&L Propaganda Spoon " befitting a FOX Talker when he called universal health care socialized medicine .
Bayh :
Some action in the crisis was called for , that 's in the short run .
In the long run though we 've got to start unwinding some of these things .
We do n't want the government in the business of owning our banks .
We do n't want the government intruding any more than it has to in the private sector so we 've got to start reversing some of this once the momentum is in the economy to grow the economy once again to stabilize situations and I do agree with Tom , when it comes to health care we do n't want " socialized medicine , " but there is an appropriate role for government to expand coverage , to make it more affordable for people who do n't have the means and that actually enables to meet the challenges ....
Evan Good
Bye should be a regular on Hannity 's Great America panel .
He 'd fit in like a glove .
Good Bye was very outspoken against President Obama 's budget and is setting up a Blue Dog caucus of his own in the Senate .
That 's just what we need , failed conservative economic principles at a critical time in our history .

BBC News , Baghdad
Mobile footage of gay men being abused is being widely circulated in Iraq Grainy footage taken on a mobile phone and widely distributed around Baghdad shows a terrified young Iraqi boy cowering and whimpering as men with a stick force him to strip , revealing women 's underwear beneath his dishdasha ( Arab robe ) .
" Why are you dressed as a girl ? " roars one of the men , brandishing his stick as the youth removes his brassiere .
The sobbing boy , who appears to be about 12 , tries to explain that his family made him do it to earn money , as they have no other source of income .
The scene , apparently filmed in a police post , reinforced reports of a campaign against gay men in Iraq which activists say has claimed the lives of more than 60 since December .
In the latest manifestation of the campaign , posters have appeared on walls in the poor Shia suburb of Sadr City in eastern Baghdad , listing alleged homosexuals by name and threatening to kill them .
Those named have gone underground , while gay men throughout the city and in some other parts of the country also live in fear .

The phenomenon seems mainly to be affecting Shia neighbourhoods , where a number of clerics have given sermons seen as homophobic incitement .
This footage shows Iraqi police molesting a person with female and male genitalia In Sadr City , Sheikh Jassem al - Mutairi used his Friday sermon to attack what he called " new private practices by some men who dress like women , and are effeminate " .
He called on families to prevent their youngsters from following such a lifestyle .
Police sources say that in the past month alone , the bodies of six young men have been found in Sadr City , some with placards labelling them " perverts " or " puppies " , the derogatory Iraqi term for gay men .
" The campaign started in 2004 , but now it 's very much worse , " said a Baghdad homosexual who goes by the name of Surour .
He talked to the BBC on condition of anonymity .
" They kill the gays , they beat them up I have a lot of friends that have been killed - 15 or 16 , something like that , too much . "
" Life has become like hell , believe me , like hell .
Whenever I go anywhere , there are checkpoints , and when they see us , they know about us , they detain us and question us , and they want to touch me , yes , to molest me . "
As though to underline the accusation , another piece of mobile phone footage circulating in Baghdad shows a group of uniformed police harassing a hermaphrodite they have caught at a checkpoint , obliging him to expose his well - developed breasts which are then gleefully manhandled and kissed .
One Iraqi homosexual who fled the country last week said he was detained for three weeks and beaten until a bribe of $ 5,000 ( £ 3,380 ) raised by friends bought his release .
Clerical cue Gay activists believe the campaign emerged as police , militias and tribes took their cue from the clerics .
It 's a phenomenon which has to be fought , but through treatment
Shaikh Sadeq al - Zair
Shia cleric
Fears over Iraq gay killing spate
But officials in all categories deny that they support the persecution or killing of homosexuals .
" The Interior Ministry has no policy of arresting gays just for being gay , " said Brigadier Diah Sahi , head of the Iraqi police 's Criminal Investigation Department .
" There 's no law to justify it , unless they commit indecent acts in public . "
" It 's a psychological problem in any case .
Arresting people and putting them in jail is n't going to change anything , " he added .
A Shia cleric in central Baghdad 's Kerrada district , Shaikh Sadeq al - Zair , said he saw many young men dressing more effeminately than women .
" It 's a phenomenon which has to be fought , but through treatment , " he said .
" If these people are sick , they should be given therapy .
But violence is rejected by all religions , especially by Islam , which is a religion of mercy . "
A spokesman of the Sadrist movement - followers of the militant young cleric Moqtada Sadr whose Mehdi Army militia used to rule Sadr City - also said that there was nothing in Islam to say that homosexuals should be killed .
But they are being killed , and the Shia militias are among the most oft - cited suspects .
Family honour
In some cases , it is believed that their own families are killing homosexuals , out of shame for their behaviour .
Brigadier Diah Sahi says Iraq has no policy of arresting gay men " In Sadr City , four of those who died were killed by their own families , because they think it is better for their name , for their honour , " said Surour .
Homosexuals admit that their problem is as much with their own society and families as with the authorities , police or militias .
But the Iraqi government appears to be slow to take the lead in discouraging the homophobic campaign .
Amnesty International , which believes at least 25 alleged gay men have been killed in Baghdad in the last few weeks , wrote to the Iraqi government last week seeking " urgent and concerted action " to bring the culprits to justice and protect the gay community .
The appeal has so far brought no response , and the government has yet to comment on the killings or take any visible action to combat them .

Abstract
Inflammation is the body 's response to tissue damage and infection and is correlated with several chronic diseases like type II diabetes .
Cytokines are cell signaling proteins with multiple functions including control of inflammation .
Cytokines are influenced by several factors such as carbohydrate intake and exercise .
Thus , carbohydrate intake and exercise can influence inflammation .
Purpose :
To determine the influence of high carbohydrate intake on the inflammatory response to exercise that induces muscle damage and inflammation .
Methods :
The study was a cross -over design .
Each subject completed a high carbohydrate condition and a high fat and protein condition .
Each condition consisted of 6 sets of 10 maximal high - force eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors and extensors .
The exercise was followed by a controlled diet for the first 8 hours post - exercise based on the condition .
The cytokines interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) and interleukin - 1B ( IL - B ) were measured as indicators of local inflammation .
C- reactive protein ( CRP ) was measured as an indicator of systemic inflammation .
Creatine - kinase ( CK ) , muscle soreness , upper arm circumference , and strength loss were measured as indicators of muscle damage .
Blood glucose and insulin were measured to identify differences between diets in the conditions .
Results : Insulin was significantly increased in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition at 1.5 , 4 , and 8 hours post - exercise .
Perceived soreness was elevated at all time points post - exercise in both conditions and was significantly elevated in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition .
There was a main effect trend for IL - 6 to be greater in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition .
Il - 1B was significantly increased 24 hours post - exercise in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition .
Conclusion : Elevated carbohydrate intake post - exercise augmented the local inflammatory response to the exercise observed by elevated IL - 1B and IL - 6 .
The augmented inflammatory response contributed to greater perceived muscle soreness post - exercise .
Further research is required to investigate this mechanism further to provide better prevention and treatment methods for chronic diseases related to inflammation .
Alternative sexual preferences , civil rights and hate speech April 28 , 2009
Posted by Greg Korgeski , Ph.D. in Uncategorized
Here is a link to a speech by Dr. Gloria Brame on alternative ( particularly BDSM ) sexual communities .
She makes many good points that underscore the basic truth that folks whose core sexual identities include some kind of identification with , or fundamental interest or pleasure in “ kinky ” experiences , are basically treated differently , with less respect , in the mainstream press and communities than “ vanilla ” or even gay / lesbian / transgender individuals .
( Which is similar to my critique of the tone of Bergner ’s Other Side of Desire in my recent posts . )
Brame goes on to say ,
But when did you ever see a headline describing someone as “ Vanilla Madman ? ”
Or a “ Only Likes Missionary Position ” Girlfriend ?
Never .
No one ever bothers to expose the intimate lives of vanilla people .
Yet when it comes to people like us , the press — and the law — feel entitled to invade our privacy and expose us to public ridicule .
When media and courts put the spotlight on what we do , instead of who we are , they show a bais against BDSM by implying that crime and BDSM are linked .
That implication is a subtle form of hate speech that goes unnoticed — except , of course , by anti-SM proselytizers whose prejudices are fueled by such propaganda .
Her speech is well worth a read .
Neil Gaiman Gets Newbery Sticker
Cheers to Neil Gaiman for taking home the Newbery Award for " The Graveyard Book , " a book which he describes as " The Jungle Book , but with ghosts .
" " The Graveyard Book " is the story of a kid named Nobody who grows up in a graveyard , surrounded by ghosts who protect him from his family 's murderer , a " man named Jack . "
Now , fifth graders doing book reports everywhere will be able to choose something other than " Johnny Tremain " and " Cry , the Beloved Country , " something a little bit more magical and strange .
I 'm glad that Gaiman has successfully made the complete transition from comic book writer to novelist .
One of my favorite set - pieces from Gaiman 's " Sandman " comic book is the library in the Dreaming where all the books that never had a chance to get written end up , books thwarted by fear , insanity , drug addiction , or an untimely death .
There is a whole shelf full of lost Coleridge , for instance .
I bet Gaiman 's shelf is huge .
Lately , however , Gaiman is plucking unwritten gems from the vault of his imagination at an alarming rate : a phenomenon which could be risky , and is always painful .
" The Graveyard Book " sounds like the kind of book I would have enjoyed when I was a kid .
Ghosts make good characters in books because once they get what they want they disappear forever , not like the rest of us who must deal with the ramifications of acquired desire .
As a result of his success , Gaiman has already announced a movie deal for his fairy tale .
According to Gaiman , Neil Jordan -- Irish director of " The Butcher Boy , " " Michael Collins , " " Breakfast on Pluto , " and " The Crying Game " -- will be directing the movie version of " The Graveyard Book .
" Will " the man named Jack " be secret IRA ?
Or perhaps a secret lady ?
Evidently , Jordan did a movie called " High Spirits " back in 1988 about Irish ghosts starring Peter O'Toole and Steve Guttenberg .
From wikipedia : " Peter O'Toole is Peter Plunkett , the owner of a dilapidated Irish castle which acts as a bed and breakfast supplying the only employment for the local villagers .
Owing money to an American businessman , Plunkett has the idea to turn the castle into " The most haunted castle in Europe " for the tourist trade .
He and his wacky staff of Irish characters set about creating ghost costumes and effects for their first group of American lodgers .
" Before Gaiman 's narrative is burned into celluloid , I suggest you get out there and read this book as soon as you can , preferably out loud to someone young and impressionable like an NYU student .
You may only have a year or so to help them build their imagination and to fill them with their first , sad realization that " the book was better all along . "
Over time , software applications grow , sometimes becoming so complex that one hand of the enterprise does n't have a grip or know what the other hand is doing to track how the application is laid out .
In the collaborative environment that under - girds open source software development , getting a grip on the project 's architecture -- or tracking who has the grip -- can be contentious , to put it mildly .
Enter code scanning vendor Coverity , which is introducing service that maps open source code architecture .
Today , the company announced that it published the software architecture maps of 2,500 open source projects in a bid to help developers optimize their code .
Coverity also released the architecture mapping tool that it uses to build those maps .
The new mapping effort comes at an opportune time for Coverity , which just completed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security to improve open source code security .
With the publication of the open source software architectures , Coverity is aiming to further improve open source code development .
" Our hope is that when people look at software in this way it will cause them to think a little more about architecture , " David Maxwell , open source strategist for Coverity , told InternetNews.com .
" The tool does have the ability to bring to a developer 's attention things that otherwise might be hidden under thousands of lines of code . "
Among the projects that Coverity has mapped are popular open source programming languages such as Perl , PHP , Python and TCL .
( The Coverity Scan architecture provides the software maps under a Creative Commons license . )
The Coverity Architecture Analyzer product , which builds the software maps , is available under a free , renewable license to open source developers .
( The Coverity Architecture Analyzer itself is not open source , Maxwell noted . )
The software architectures could provide a roadmap that gives developers a sense of what to expect from a project .
Or if an architecture has organized code that is particularly effective , others could learn from that and improve .
" As well if someone is going to write a plug - in or add - on to an existing project they can look at how the plugin interfaces with the main application to get a better understanding of how to optimize , Maxwell explained .
The software architecture could also help developers of the mapped project to identify code references that are not optimized .
Such references could be relatively benign cyclical references that cause stability issues , but could also lead to potential security as well .
According to Coverity , with a visual representation of architecture , developers could identify pathways that circumvent access control checkpoints , encryption / decryption APIs as well potentially eliminate unintended back doors .
" When we look at defect identification , the reason why defects creep in the first place is often because of misplaced code , " Maxwell said .
" We think that having a well defined architecture provides information that could prevent defect creep . "
Coverity is no stranger to looking at open source code .
In 2006 , Coverity was the recipient of a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) grant to improve open source code security .
Over the last three years , Coverity has scanned hundreds of open source projects and has helped to eliminate over 8,500 defects .
Though the original mandate from DHS has already been completed , Coverity is still running the open source code analysis effort .
The code scanning effort in some way serves to highlight the value of Coverity 's code analysis software which it also sells to commercial vendors .
The new architecture analyzer similarly will have a commercial license that Coverity will aim to sell as well .
Maxwell noted that it is still Coverity 's intention to keep on scanning open source , even without government support .
" It is true that the DHS contract has come to an end and we 're contemplating whether there are other funding sources or partnerships out there to help us to serve as many projects as we can , " Maxwell said .
But Coverity is continuing with the effort in the absence of a government grant . "

I See a Red Robe and I Want to Paint it Black
Two prominent American prelates ,
Some preliminary thoughts toward sorting this out .
First , awareness of Church history helps contemporary Catholics sleep at night .
This is not the first time that upright bishops have differed over important points of pastoral practice ; for that matter , strong episcopal conflicts over ( unsettled ) matters of doctrine are not unknown in the Church .
So , let 's be confident in the Holy Spirit 's power to lead the Church through this issue as He has led us through others .
I often tell my students , the answer to a canonical question is seldom found in a single canon .
Two prominent American prelates , Abp. Donald Wuerl of Washington DC and Abp. Raymond Burke of the Apostolic Signatura , are the lead figures in a significant disagreement over admitting certain pro-abortion Catholic politicians to holy Communion .
Wuerl basically believes that , under Canon 916 , Catholics , including pro-abortion politicians , should determine their own eligibility for reception of Communion .
Burke argues that , beyond Canon 916 , Canon 915 requires ministers of holy Communion to withhold the Eucharist from some pro-abortion politicians if they do n't refrain from approaching on their own .
Both sides can't be right , and I suspect that the more compelling case is made by reading the two canons together instead of reading one to the exclusion of the other .

Second , one must avoid " personalizing " the debate .
Both archbishops are distinguished thinkers and both have many decades of loyal service to the Church behind them , including some services rendered under very difficult circumstances .
In short , each is an attractive figure .
But , while it 's tempting to rally behind one or the other , personalities are not what 's at issue here .
Rather , if we want to resolve the question of Communion admission , we must plainly identify the core of the disagreement .
I think it 's this : may one rely on a single canon to absolve arch / bishops of any direct responsibility to act when pro-abortion Catholic politicians present themselves for Communion , or must one read both the relevant canons in these cases , even if one of those canons requires ministerial intervention under certain circumstances ?
expresses the fundamental responsibility of individual Catholics to weigh their conscience before approaching the Holy Banquet and to refrain from receiving Communion if they believe themselves to be in grave sin .
I suggest that , for one to argue that Communion reception by Catholics is a purely personal decision under Canon 916 is to ignore impermissibly Canon 915 and its assertion of ministerial obligations in certain cases .

( CNN ) -- NATO forces patrolling the Gulf of Aden foiled a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker this weekend , a NATO spokesman said .
The Canadian navy 's HMCS Winnipeg helped foil a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker Sunday , NATO says .
Pirates attempted to capture the MV Front Ardennes at 6 p.m. Saturday and were apprehended seven hours later , Commander Chris Davies told CNN .
A NATO - supported Canadian navy ship , the HMCS Winnipeg , was returning from escorting a World Food Program vessel in the gulf when it saw the Norwegian ship under attack , Davies said .
A British Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel , the Wave Knight , was also in the area .
The pirates were captured at 1 a.m.
Sunday after they threw weapons , ladders and scaling equipment overboard , Davies said .
Several rounds of ammunition were found on the pirates ' boat .
The pirates were detained , but allowed to go free after questioning .
There is currently no formal procedure for NATO personnel to follow once they have apprehended pirates , Davies noted .
Their weapons are confiscated and they are then typically given provisions and released .
The Sunday incident is the latest in a string of hijackings off the Horn of Africa , which have received more attention since pirates attacked a U.S. - flagged cargo ship on April 8 and took its captain hostage .

On Saturday , Dutch naval forces captured seven pirates and freed 20 captive fishermen after tracking the pirates to their " mother ship " in the western Gulf of Aden .
The rescue came as pirates were capturing another vessel -- a Belgian ship -- off the coast of the Seychelles islands .
On Wednesday , the French navy captured 11 suspected pirates off the coast of Kenya , the French Ministry of Defense announced .
The French launched a helicopter from the frigate Nivose to head off an attack on a ship Tuesday night , then seized the suspected pirates Wednesday morning , the statement said .
On Tuesday , the Liberty Sun , a U.S. - flagged cargo ship bound for Mombasa , Kenya , was attacked by Somali pirates , according to a NATO source with direct knowledge of the matter .
The pirates never made it onto the ship .
Also Tuesday , pirates in the Gulf of Aden hijacked the MV Irene EM , a 35,000 - ton Greek - owned bulk carrier , according to a NATO spokesman and the European Union 's Maritime Security Center .
Later Tuesday , pirates on four skiffs seized the 5,000 - ton MV Sea Horse , a Lebanese - owned and Togo - flagged vessel , Davies said .
On Monday , pirates hijacked two Egyptian fishing boats carrying a total of between 18 and 24 people , the Egyptian Information Ministry told CNN .
The hijacking of the U.S. - flagged ship , the Maersk Alabama , began when pirates attacked the vessel about 350 miles off Somalia 's coast on April 8 .
The crew quickly regained control of the ship , but the captain , Richard Phillips , was taken hostage and held for five days in a covered lifeboat .
On April 12 , U.S. Navy snipers killed three pirates holding Phillips .
A fourth pirate was taken into custody .
Pirates in Somalia said later that Tuesday 's attack on the Liberty Sun was a response to the killing of Phillips ' captors .
CNN 's Carol Jordan in London , England , contributed to this report .

Regular readers of this blog ( and of my work more generally ) will note that I tend towards relativism .
Not for me “ good vs evil ” or “ black vs white ” - I ’m all about the shades of grey , the “ but then there ’s also -"s and the " but you ’ve got to remember that -"s .
But this is once instance in which I ’m sufficiently pissed off to throw relativism ( at least partly ) out the window .
Australians will be familiar with Stephanie Naumoska , the Miss Universe contestant who was all over the news and current affairs circuit last week for being " too thin ” .
Overseas readers may be familiar with the story as well - it ’s spread like wildfire ( indeed , the video above is British ) .
Now , I do n’t want to make this a post about Stephanie ’s body .
She ’s the only one who really knows if she is “ healthy ” ( whatever that means in this kind of debate ) , and I do n’t think she ’s under any obligation to go beyond the obvious PR line when talking to media outlets hungry for a sensationalist story .
Not to mention , I think it ’s deeply disrespectful and objectifying to sit around deconstructing the way a person looks - there can be no winners in that exercise .
Instead , I ’d like to talk about the rhetoric that dominated this story - rhetoric which is unsurprisingly similar to that used by the Australian fashion industry a couple of years ago when they refused to follow the lead of Madrid and Milan and institute a minimum BMI for fashion week models .
Arguments like :
“ Some girls are just naturally thin . ”
“ It ’s not fair to discriminate against naturally skinny girls . ”
“ Models have to be skinny - that ’s the point …
No one wants larger girls to show off their clothes ; it looks a bit silly ” - direct quote from Australian fashion designer , Alannah Hill .
“ All you people complaining are juz jelus fatties ” - paraphrasement of Australia ’s Next Top Model judge , Alex Perry .
“ Why is it okay to say that models are too thin , but not okay to say when people are too fat ? ”
And so on .
These are muddy waters to wade in .
Because , you know , it ’s not okay to be nasty to women because they happen to thin , just like it ’s not okay to be nasty to them because they happen to be fat ( even though we seem to do both all the time ) .
But I ’m going to go there anyway .
Because while some of those arguments ( ie , the first two ) are good as arguments , in practice , they ’re bullshit .
The way much of the fashion industry goes on , you ’d think people were trying to throw their precious skinny models off the catwalk and replace them with a legion of Beth Dittos .
Or , you know , US size 6s .
Hardly .
Body Mass
Index might not be a perfect indictator of health , but a BMI of 18.5 ( the minimum instituted by Milan and Madrid ) is still really , really small .
Not to mention that pretty much everyone who becomes a model is “ naturally thin ” - it ’s pretty much a requirement for the job .
It ’s virtually impossible to achieve the figure of a fashion model unless you ’re naturally small - boned and genetically disinclined towards storing fat on your body .
Take Victoria ’s Secret model Miranda Kerr , recently voted by the readers of Grazia the celebrity with the most admired body , who I saw in the flesh a few years ago at Australian fashion week .
Miranda Kerr is a tall woman - she ’s 5 ' 10 " - but the word that springs to mind when describing her is “ tiny ” .
She ’s seriously petite .
If I ( or likely , you ) were that small , I ’d look like death , but Miranda looked great - because , I ’m willing to bet , that 's just the way she was made .
And that ’s the thing : most people look healthy when they ’re at the weight that ’s right for their body .
There ’s no polite way to say this next bit , so I ’ll take the easy way out and let women ’s mag journo and blogger Erica Bartle do it for me .
Conversely , " if there ’s a general consensus that you are too thin – that you are not looking your best – then you probably are .
And you need help . “
And that ’s especially true when you live in a society that equates thinness with health and beauty as much as ours does .
The more I read and engage with other young women , the more it hits me just how widespread eating disorders really are ( even if , contrary to the media portrayal , they do n't usually end in extreme thinness and / or death ) .
Given that models pay their rent and put food on their plates based on the way they look , it ’s no surprise that eating disorders are rife throughout the industry - every model I ’ve been friends with has had one ( admittedly , this is a sample size of around a handful ) .
Even Natalia Vodianova , a model with an incredibly high profile and stature , has spoken out about the pressure she has to be thinner than her naturally petite body is meant to be .
So , given the above , I ca n’t help but be cynical when the fashion industry leaps to the defense of its very thinnest models .
Because this is n’t about embracing women in all the shapes they come in , or about those " jelus fatties ” being bitter about the impossible beauty standards they set .
It ’s about them willfully shutting their eyes to physical and mental illness - even when it results in death - in the pursuit of an ideal that not even the naturally thinnest girls can naturally live up to .
Unless they ’re 13 .
But that ’s a story for another time .
On her tax return that year Ms Anstis claimed $ 920 for educational expenses , including textbooks , student fees and travel expenses .
She reasoned that , because the Youth Allowance was part of her income , she should be able to claim deductions on relevant costs .
In the past , the Australian Taxation Office made it clear it would not allow educational expenses to be claimed against welfare payments .
Her father , Michael Anstis , who is a qualified solicitor but does not work as a lawyer , helped her with her return and told her the Government was likely to reject her claim .
But they decided it seemed fair that students be able to claim educational costs , and pushed on regardless .
The Tax Office rejected the claim , so the pair fought the case all the way to the Federal Court .
" It was n't a lot of money but it was important — it 's quite a hard life as a student , " Ms Anstis said yesterday .
Asked if she was known for stubbornness , she laughed .
" I thought we were in the right , so I did n't want to just let it go .
Why not take on the big guys ? "
In court , Mr Anstis argued that because his daughter had to be enrolled in a full - time course of study to get her assessable income of Youth Allowance , any costs incurred in the course of studying should be deductible .
In a surprise judgement this month , the Federal Court agreed , ruling that in order to meet the requirements for Youth Allowance , a student was forced to make a range of expenses that the student should be entitled to claim as tax deductions .
Tax experts say this could set a precedent for students and other recipients of welfare payments who want to claim expenses against their pensions .
About 440,000 students receive Youth Allowance or Austudy , according to Government figures .
KPMG tax partner Andy Hutt believes the decision may have ramifications for students on income support and they should consider which items — such as computers or textbooks — could be most obviously connected to their income .
During his preparations , Mr Anstis studied previous Federal Court tax cases .
He said that in the past two years only a handful had been won , and those had been led by teams of senior lawyers .
Mr Anstis said his daughter had taken on the issue to make a point about social justice , not for the modest financial gain .
" This should mean that students can claim the costs of their studies — it 'll be worth about $ 300 or $ 400 to the average student , " he said .
The Tax Office may appeal against the decision .
It 's usually sovereign rings and chunky gold chains that get pushed under the counter window for a pawnbroker to inspect but at Nikolas Michael the items are far grander .
Not far from the gilded towers that house the London bases of discredited institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS , and tucked above a sandwich shop , is what is thought to be the first pawnbroker to open in the City of London for the best part of a century .
In a grim sign of the times the shop , which opened last month , used to house a recruitment consultant .
At Nikolas Michael it is Rolex watches and diamond necklaces that are the currency of the loans it provides as , with bonuses long gone , City workers seek out alternative ways to make ends meet .
" It is mostly expensive watches and diamonds coming in , " says Mike Davies , who runs the store with his partner .
At about £ 1,000 , the typical loan dished out by Davies is 10 times that of a suburban pawn shop .
He says the " savvy " City clientele , who may have just stepped away from a trading desk , are far more aware of the value of their items than a typical pawnbroking client borrowing £ 100 to get through to pay day .
For many , pawnbroking evokes a mental picture of a Dickensian figure in fingerless gloves pawing over a woman 's Sunday linen .
But in recent years the so - called " alternative credit " industry has gained a wider audience as quoted groups such as H&T open high street stores .
Indeed , last month H&T reported record profits as a growing number of Britons sought to raise cash by hocking valuables or borrowing against their pay cheques .
John Nichols , president of the National Pawnbrokers Association , says pawnbroking can be traced back to 15th - century Italy when the Medici family was the dominant financial power ; when the family split , one half became bankers , the other pawnbrokers .
Whether overt or not , Nichols says secured lending has always been a feature of City life , with valuable items such as paintings stowed in bank vaults as collateral for loans .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court 's conservative majority expressed varying degrees of concern Wednesday over a civil rights case brought by 20 firefighters , most of them white , who claim reverse discrimination in promotions .
Recent case has Supreme Court justices deciding when race considerations are proper to ensure a diverse workplace .
The suit was filed in response to New Haven , Connecticut , officials ' decision to throw out results of promotional exams that they said left too few minorities qualified .
At issue is whether the city intentionally discriminated , in violation of both federal law and the Constitution 's equal protection clause .
The high court is being asked to decide whether there is a continued need for special treatment for minorities , or whether enough progress has been made to make existing laws obsolete , especially in a political atmosphere where an African - American occupies the White House .
Watch why the plaintiffs are suing »
As is true in many hot - button social issues , Wednesday 's arguments fell along familiar ideological lines , with most justices expressing clear views on when race considerations are proper to ensure a diverse workplace .
" It looked at the results and classified successful and unsuccessful applicants by race , " said Justice Anthony Kennedy , head in hand .
" And you ( the city ) want us to say this is n't race ?
I have trouble with this argument . "
But a ruling against the city could leave New Haven officials stuck in a " damned - if - you - do , damned - if - you - do n't " situation , subject to lawsuits from both minority and majority employees , said Justice David Souter .
It is a situation business groups and municipalities have long expressed concern about .
Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotional exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in New Haven , Connecticut 's second - largest city .
The personnel department contracted with a private firm to design an oral and written exam .
When the results came back , city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam would have been promoted .
The New Haven corporation counsel refused to certify the test and no promotions were given .
The record does not indicate how many firefighters took the two tests for promotion to captain and lieutenant .
Watch why the lawsuit is so controversial »
The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII , employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a " disparate impact " on a protected class , such as a specified race or gender .
But a group of firefighters sued , calling themselves the " New Haven 20 . "
The plaintiffs , wearing their dress blue uniforms , posed on the high court steps after the 75 - minute argument .
Nineteen identify themselves as white while one says he is Hispanic - white .
Inside , conservatives on the high court questioned whether the city could throw out the results of the promotion exams after they were already given .
" You had some applicants who were winners and their promotion was set aside , " said Justice Antonin Scalia .
Chief Justice John Roberts offered a hypothetical : " Jones , you do n't get the promotion because you 're white ... and they go down the list and throw out everybody who took the test .
That would be all right , " he asked .
" They get do - overs until it comes out right .
Or throw out this test , they do another test .
Oh , it 's just as bad , throw that one out . "
Christopher Meade , arguing for New Haven , said , " The city has a duty to ensure that its process is fair for all applicants , both black and white . "
Justices on the left seemed to support that view .
Justice John Paul Stevens suggested that if there were a choice of two tests , one of which had a lesser " disparate impact " on minorities , " they could take that test , even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial proportionality in candidates selected . "
The firefighters ' attorney , Greg Coleman , countered by saying the city 's action in this instance " violates the principle of individual dignity . "
Kennedy 's views could prove key .
He appeared to oppose the city 's dismissal of the test results and has traditionally been skeptical of many race - based decisions in education and the workplace .
But his more moderate views could blunt the impact of any ruling by his more right - leaning colleagues .
In a key ruling three years ago that tossed out racial diversity plans in two public school districts , Kennedy took a more centrist view that held open the limited use of skin color when trying to achieve diversity in the classroom .
The Obama administration also has taken a nuanced position on the appeal .
A Justice Department lawyer told the high court that while the federal government supports the city 's discretion to nullify the test results , it believes the lawsuit should be allowed to proceed on a limited basis .
The case has attracted a broad range of interest from a variety of advocacy and business groups concerned about how far the high court would go to allow race to be used at all by government and the private sector in such areas as affirmative action , education , and contracting .
The case is Ricci v. DeStefano ( 07-1428 ) , A ruling is expected in about two months .

The rapid mass burial of the victims and the continuing presence of insurgents in the area have hampered investigations .
Journalists were advised against visiting Granai .
Villagers were interviewed here in Farah , the provincial capital , where they came to collect compensation payments , and in the neighboring province of Herat , where some were taken for treatment .

Much of the villagers ’ descriptions matched accounts given by the United States military spokesman , Col. Greg Julian , and the provincial police chief , Col. Abdul Ghafar Watandar .
But they differed on one important point : whether the Taliban had already left Granai before the bombing began .
There was particular anger among the villagers that the bombing came after , they say , the Taliban had already left at dusk , and the fighting had subsided , so much so that men had gone to evening prayers at 7 p.m. and returned and were sitting down with their families for dinner .
The police chief said that sporadic fighting continued into the night and that the Taliban were probably in the village until 1 a.m .
Whatever the case , American planes bombed after 8 p.m. in several waves when most of the villagers thought the fighting was over ; and whatever the actual number of casualties , it is clear from the villagers ’ accounts that dozens of women and children were killed after taking cover .
One group went to a spacious compound owned by a man named Said Naeem , on the north side of the village , where the two girls were wounded .
Only one woman and six children in the compound survived , one of their fathers said .
Another group gathered in the house of the village imam , or religious leader , Mullah Manan .
That , too , was bombed , causing an equally large number of casualties , villagers said .
Colonel Julian , the American military spokesman , said that the airstrikes hit houses from which the Taliban were firing .
The enormous explosions left such devastation that villagers struggled to describe it .
“ There was someone ’s legs , someone ’s shoulders , someone ’s hands , ” said Said Jamal , an old white - bearded man with rheumy eyes , who lost two sons and a daughter .
“ The dead were so many . ”

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A senior Palestinian Muslim cleric fiercely denounced Israeli policy in Jerusalem in the presence of Pope Benedict on Monday and appealed to the pope to help end what he called the “ crimes ” of the Jewish state .
The speech , at the end of a meeting between the pope and Christian , Muslim and Jewish clergy engaged in contacts among the three main religions in Jerusalem , angered both the Vatican and Israel ’s chief rabbinate , which said it would boycott the dialogue forum until the Palestinians barred the cleric .
Referring to Palestinian Muslims and Christians , Sheikh Taysir al - Tamimi said : “ We struggle together and suffer together from the oppression of the Israeli occupation .
“ We look forward together to liberation and independence and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state . ”
The incident further marred the start of the German - born pope ’s five - day tour of Israel and the Palestinian territories , after criticism by some Jews that a speech at a Holocaust memorial did not go far enough to mend Catholic - Jewish rifts .
Pope Benedict , in his own speech to the gathering of priests , rabbis and sheikhs , praised their efforts to seek common values and mutual respect to overcome differences in religious practices that “ may at times appear as barriers . ”
The final speaker from the platform at an auditorium in a Roman Catholic institution was Tamimi , the chief judge of the Muslim religious courts in the Palestinian territories .
In uncompromising language , he welcomed the pope to “ Jerusalem , the eternal capital of Palestine ” -- a direct riposte to Israeli claims to the same city -- and enumerated many of the complaints Palestinians have against Israel .
“ DESECRATION ”
He said Israel had “ desecrated ” the Old City ’s holy sites since capturing it from Jordanian forces in the 1967 Middle East war and was defying international law by demolishing homes , seizing land , building Jewish settlements and erecting a series of walls and fences that had turned the city into “ a prison . ”
Tamimi won a round of applause from some of the assembled clerics for comments referring to Israel ’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip in January in which 1,400 Palestinians died .
Addressing the pope at the end of a six - minute address , he said : “ Your Holiness , I call on you in the name of the one God , to condemn these crimes and press the Israeli government to halt its aggression against the Palestinian people . ”
Tamimi shook the pope ’s hand as he left the podium and the meeting broke up as scheduled immediately afterwards .
The director general of Israel ’s Chief Rabbinate , Oded Wiener , said : “ Sheikh Tamimi embarrassed the pope . ”
He said Tamimi , a familiar and fiery figure in Palestinian public life , had pressured the Catholic organizers to be allowed to speak and that the Jewish members would no longer take part in a long - standing , three - way interfaith dialogue until the sheikh was barred from attending .
“ The Chief Rabbinate will not continue it as long as Tamimi is part of the Palestinian delegation , ” Wiener said .
Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said : “ The speech by Sheikh Taysir Tamimi was not scheduled by the organizers of the meeting .
In a meeting dedicated to dialogue , this intervention was a direct negation of what a dialogue should be .
We hope that such an incident will not damage the mission of the pope aiming at promoting peace and also interreligious dialogue . ”
When I entered my friend Jason ’s house he was shouting into his telephone , “ Where ’s my million dollars ? ”
There was a pause , after which Jason insisted , “ I want you to pay me the million dollars you promised me ! ”
His face was red and he was angry .
To my shock , my senior friend , in his youth a U.S. military intelligence officer , had been paying tens of thousands of dollars in “ processing fees ” to con artists that initially contacted him by mail with the “ good news ” of his fantastic winnings .
After he mailed them checks for a few dollars , they called him by phone and told him to wire hundreds , then thousands , of dollars , to win his million dollar prize , which he did .
But the prize money never came .
Now the too trusting Jason was out tens of thousands of dollars , money he intended to leave to his children , leaving him confused and bewildered .
The Federal Trade Commission gets more than 10,000 consumer complaints annually about prize promotions .
“ Most of those consumers received letters or phone calls that suggested they were major prize winners , but later discovered they had to make purchases or pay hefty fees to claim them , ” consumer reporter Asa Aarons wrote in the New York Daily News .
The U.S. Post Office warns that unscrupulous high pressure sales people “ armed with sophisticated selling techniques designed to get you to send them money ” are operating out of “ boiler rooms , ” and are out to defraud consumers .
In Jackson , Miss. , Guy Robinson , supervisor of the U.S. Postal Inspection Services , told The Clarion - Ledger of a Canadian - based scam that sent lottery numbers through the mail to senior citizens in exchange for money .
“ In a few weeks , someone notifies the person by phone and tells them that they have won millions of dollars in this lottery club and all they have to do is pay this specific amount to cover taxes and other expenses , ” Robinson said .
“ They send their money in and receive nothing in return .
This is a scam , and it ’s illegal . ”
After contacting Jason ’s ( not his real name ) son to alert him to his father ’s plight , I began going through the scores of letters Jason received weekly .
According to postal authorities , there is a veritable blizzard of such letters in the mail targeting the elderly .
To my knowledge , none of the following named outfits are involved in the Jason swindle .
Their pitches , though , typify the prize come - ons being commonly employed .
One letter titled “ Distribution Form 0110 ” came from Sterling , Gray & Associates , of P.O. 379047 , Las Vegas , 89137 .
It began “ Congratulations ” and continued , “ you were confirmed by a data audit for receipt of a check issued in your name . ”
This letter , from “ Payments Officer ” Marc Adams , informed Jason of a “ Maximum Award Opportunity ” of $ 798,497.18 and , oh , yes , requested an “ assessment & processing fee ” of $ 19.50 .
The fine print below , however , indicated Jason ’s payoff might be as little as 97 cents .
Another letter from the same outfit advised , “ we have the pleasure of announcing to you that there is a check for cash just waiting to be sent directly to you .
We are so thrilled for you … ”
This was signed by Michael Maldar of the “ Cash Claim Department ” and wanted another $ 23.99 processing fee .
Not far from Sterling , Gray & Associates is “ Chase M. Enterprises , ” located at 10120 W. Flamingo Rd. , # 4 , Las Vegas , NV 89147 , which is not claiming to hand out $ 798,000 but merely $ 789,000 .
It wants $ 23.47 returned in its pink envelope to the “ Office of the Prize Director . ”
Their letter says if Jason does n’t respond “ within the allotted time frame ” he will lose out .
The fine print says Jason ’s check might be for just 92 cents .
This solicitation sounds very much like the Sterling , Gray , etc. , request .
And what do you know , operating out of the very same suite and street address as Sterling , Gray , etc. , is Kemper & Covington , which sent Jason an “ Authorized Check Transfer Form ” to release information details about $ 997,997.97 .
It also said if he pays them $ 19.79 he can claim his “ guaranteed check ” but does not state how much it is for .
One certainly gets the impression that Suite # 4 is a very crowded office .
Aggregate Merchants ( AM ) of 9030 W. Sahara Ave. , # 131 , Las Vegas , NV 89117 , wanted Jason to send his check for $ 19.98 to them in their return envelope marked “ Claim Document ” with the words “ Issue Check on Receipt . ”
Their letter said cash to be released is $ 9,950 .
In another letter , AM ’s Harold Jamesin sent Jason what appears to be a facsimile check for $ 458,389 which he was requested to sign .
It is stamped “ Confirmed Winner Claim . ”
Of course , it only resembles a check .
Oh , yes , and to send $ 27.67 .
And so it goes :
# Patrick McSorley of Premiere International , P.O. 95798 , Las Vegas , NV , 89193 , wants $ 24 in return for receiving “ full registry papers ” to allow Jason to enjoy “ unimpeded ” entry into sweepstakes in the amount of $ 1,150,000 .

Whistleblower speaks out on KBR electrocutions David Edwards and Jeremy Gantz
Published : Tuesday March 10 , 2009
Print This Email This Defense contractor Kellogg Brown & Root knowingly performed substandard electrical work in Iraq and threatened workers who " made a lot of noise " about shoddy construction and maintenance , according to ex-KBR electrician Debbie Crawford .
Crawford , appearing on The Rachel Maddow Show March 9th , detailed her experiences working for the embattled company , which is a former subsidiary of Halliburton , the massive energy company once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney .
" There was quite a few complaints about soldiers or civilians , other subcontractors , being shocked , yes , " Crawford said .
Late last year KBR denied a CBS News investigation that it knowingly exposed U.S. soldiers to toxic materials in Iraq .
In January , the company came under fire in a U.S. Army investigation for " negligent homicide " in the fatal electrocution of a solider .
Crawford , who last year testified before a Senate panel investigating that death , told Maddow Monday that " [ i] t was put up or shut up ...
People who pushed the issue and made a lot of noise were threatened to be transferred into other more hostile work environments ... or they were sent home . "
Maddow began the KBR segment with a photograph , provided by Crawford , that showed running water in a bathroom sink charged with 180.6 volts .
A normal electrical socket 's voltage is 120 volts , Maddow said .
" Clearly , that 's an error , " Crawford said , describing the photograph .
" I have n't seen that anywhere but Iraq .
" KBR does have some very qualified people working for them , " continued Crawford , who blogs at mssparky.com .
" But the majority of the work is done actually by third - country nationals ....
And they may be very good electricians in their own country , but they 're not up to the standards of the American - licensed electrician .
The American electricians for the most part supervise third - country national workers . "
Last week , lawyers for the family of an electrocuted soldier accused KBR of violating a court - ordered confidentiality agreement by releasing documents related to the family 's lawsuit to media in February , the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review reported .
The parents of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth sued KBR because their son died after turning on and stepping into his shower at the Radwaniyah Palace Complex in Iraq .
The lawsuit claims the contractor performed shoddy work and failed to maintain the electrical infrastructure at the estate once owned by Saddam Hussein , the Tribune - Review reported .
The company has denied involvement in Maseth 's electrocution , along with 17 others electrocuted since the Iraq War began in 2003 .

As a preview to this Keith Olberman video , here ’s quick review of the background on this : Andrew Sullivan wrote a post comparing the adopted hero of the right - wing , Winston Churchill , and current creature of the right - wing , Dick Cheney – specifically on the issue of torture .
Sullivan explained that Churchill refused to torture German prisoners even with Britain being bombed daily by the Germans .
He cited one of Britain ’s chief interrogators during World War II on torture :
[ He ] did not eschew torture out of mercy .
This was no squishy liberal : the eye was made of tin , and the rest of him out of tungsten .
( Indeed , he was disappointed that only 16 spies were executed during the war . )
His motives were strictly practical .
“ Never strike a man .
It is unintelligent , for the spy will give an answer to please , an answer to escape punishment .
And having given a false answer , all else depends upon the false premise . ” …
Barack Obama then cited Churchill ’s refusal to torture during a press conference – and aides later confirmed he reads Andrew Sullivan ’s blog and had come across this information shortly before he brought it up at the press conference .
Immediately , the right - wing press began to try to reclaim Churchill as their hero re-branding him as a torturer and war criminal .
Take it away , Keith …

If you totally screw up a bank , a Labour minister will grant you a pension of £ 700,000 for life .
If you screw up a social services department , a Labour minister will sack you without compensation .
It has taken a decade for the government to mimic Animal Farm .
As we peer in through the windows of Downing Street , we can look " from pig to man and from man to pig ... but already it is impossible to say which was which " .
Some are more equal than others .
Politician and banker have become one .
On the subject of Lord Myners and Sir Fred Goodwin enough has been said .
But yesterday Sharon Shoesmith , late of Haringey council , launched her claim against unfair dismissal and the way Ed Balls , the children 's secretary , used his powers to remove her without compensation in a blaze of publicity last year .
He did so after a tabloid witch - hunt over Baby P's death portraying the management of Haringey as little better than murderous Taliban .
Its inadequacies , thundered Balls , were " devastating and damning " .
Its failure should not be " rewarded with compensation or payoffs " .
Shoesmith should go before any more nasty headlines appear in the Sun .
Needless to say , neither Balls nor his colleagues have made any comment on the managerial inadequacies of RBS or Lloyds let alone of the Financial Services Authority , the Bank of England or the Treasury .
There was no sign of any permanent secretary or regulator being sacked , let alone stripped of pay or compensation or even dignity .
To Balls and his colleagues , City bankers and their Whitehall overseers are gilded ones .
No subsidy is too great for them , no barony too exalted , and no sympathy in distress too generous .
They are men of money and power , and we know that most scions of the Treasury will one day be in need of a directorship .
They are unlikely to serve on a future Haringey social services committee .
From his time at the Treasury , Balls is used to dealing with bankers and ermine .
As a cabinet minister he and his colleagues - Lord Myners , Lord Mandelson , Lord Turner and Lady Vadera - dispense stupefying sums in subsidy to banks .
When he contemplates people like Shoesmith , her very name an echo of Labour 's past , he must feel like Macmillan on finding himself at a Tory conference in Llandudno : " Good God , are there no dukes around here . "
Shoesmith worked in local government , a peasantry for which Balls , after a lifetime cast in the Treasury mould , has institutional contempt .
Its workers must remind him of the sort of people he has to meet at constituency tea evenings .
Dabbling in the gutters of public administration , Shoesmith 's day was a round of battered babies , violent parents , deprived estates and hopelessly under- qualified staff .
To Balls she embodied sadness and bad publicity .
I carry no torch for Shoesmith .
People who get top jobs are bound to be targets for unfair treatment , whether from the press or from ministers .
If things go awry , as they often do , such people should not go to employment tribunals but accept the rough with the smooth .
The zest for such white - collar litigation is a deterrent to imaginative appointment and a growing cost to the taxpayer .
But the contrast between Shoesmith 's treatment and that of the bankers under Gordon Brown is a shocking reminder of how far Labour has travelled , not just from its past - no concern of mine - but from any sense of human fairness or proportion .
Balls blatantly abetted the press in almost accusing the Haringey official of infanticide .
The matters being investigated by the Shoesmith tribunal are only in part to do with the process of her removal , which was more like Chelsea Football Club than a public service .
They also reflect the bureaucratic rot to which central oversight has reduced local government .
The fate of Baby P clearly revealed shortcomings at Haringey , but they are no more than the converse of those about which the press howls when local officials are too zealous in taking children into care .
After hysteria over the Climbié case , there was a " surge " of children being taken from their parents .
Some , like the Websters of Norfolk , saw them sent irrevocably into adoption after a grotesque miscarriage of justice .
The scandal of Baby P and other such tragedies lies in the 60 % - 70 % of social workers ' time now allegedly spent at their desks filling in forms and reports , as against 30 % in contact with clients .
It is hardly surprising that this was cited as the chief reason for the 20 % understaffing in urban social service departments , rising to a third in Haringey itself .
When staff are asked why they leave social work - as well as in the health service , police and teaching - the answer is not low pay or job stress , but the demoralising paperwork that now cripples these professions .
This bureaucracy is rarely stimulated from within local government .
It is imposed from Whitehall .
How can social workers sensibly keep in touch with those who may be at risk when two - thirds of their day is spent filling in Balls 's forms ?
Whitehall claims that interference is needed because local officials cannot be trusted with professional responsibility or public money .
( We might say the same of Whitehall , notably in computer procurement . )
Public and press reaction to any mistake is also cited to justify interference .
Haringey was an area of London whose poverty , and therefore case load , required a priority on frontline care .
Anyone reading of the bureaucracy demanded by Balls and his officials - ever more demands for " better record - keeping " - could see why scant time was left for such care .
It was not within Shoesmith 's discretion to demand that her staff spend more time with their clients , when Balls was demanding they sit in their offices and fill in his reports .
Cutting bureaucracy has become a mantra of the white - collar classes .
In reality it is a self - deprecating joke , like doing more in the garden or spending more time with the children .
Yet it is no joke .
In most of public administration time spent at desk and screen has grown from an inconvenience to a block on personal responsibility and commonsensical behaviour .
Balls runs one of Whitehall 's worst departments : ask any teacher or social worker .
When accidents happen - nobody in authority wanted Baby P to die - the charge of negligence cannot rest with local staff .
In this top - heavy and hierarchical public sector , it should go to the top .
Those who always claim the credit must take the blame .

Tens of thousands of civilians are still believed to be trapped India has said it ready to help in the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians caught up in the fighting in Sri Lanka .
Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee also told parliament the Tamil Tiger rebels had " done much damage " to the Tamil community and should lay down arms .
The UN and Red Cross have expressed deep concern for the trapped civilians .
The Sri Lankan navy has escorted a new convoy of food to the area but it is only a fraction of what is needed .
Meanhwile , the defence ministry says the army is continuing to take rebel areas in the shrinking zone the Tigers control and the government has again ruled out a ceasefire .
See map of the region
No independent journalists can reach the conflict zone so claims by either side cannot be independently verified .
Uproar
In his statement to the Indian parliament , Mr Mukherjee said the plight of about 70,000 trapped civilians was a " serious source of concern to us " .
We categorically deny the recruitment of anyone below an 18 - year limit
B Nadesan ,
Tamil Tigers ' political chief
He said India was " actively engaged to prevent a further deterioration of humanitarian conditions " and had sent relief supplies to civilians .
Mr Mukherjee added : " The government of India is ready to facilitate the evacuation of civilians trapped in the area of conflict , working with the government of Sri Lanka and the International Committee of the Red Cross , who would take responsibility for the security , screening and rehabilitation . "
Sri Lankan defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said that it welcomed the offer from India " provided it is done within the framework the we have set up already " .
Mr Mukherjee said India continued to back " a negotiated political settlement " but that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) remained " a proscribed organisation in India [ that ] has done much damage to the Tamil community " .
His comments sparked anger among MPs of two regional parties from India 's Tamil Nadu state and the uproar forced two adjournments .
There are about 62 m
Tamils in the state and they have close links to Sri Lanka .
The Sri Lankan military has made steady inroads into rebel positions
In the 1980s India sent troops to enforce a peace deal but they ended up fighting the Tigers and were withdrawn in 1990 .
Concerns for civilians has led to a new convoy of food aid being sent by sea .
About 30 tonnes of rations were despatched , accompanied by Sri Lankan navy vessels .
However aid workers say civilians are facing severe shortages of food , medicine and clean water and that a minimum of of 2,500 tonnes of food a month are needed .
Meanwhile the government has again rejected calls for a ceasefire .
The Tamil National Alliance , which has 21 MPs in parliament , made the call but Mr Rambukwella said : " We have taken a policy decision to completely root out terrorism .
There will be no ceasefire with the LTTE . "
The army said it had captured another rebel village and recovered 28 rebel bodies since Monday amid heavy clashes .
Denial On Wednesday , a regional health official , Dr Thurairaja Varatharajah , told Associated Press at least 38 civilians had been killed in government artillery attacks and air raids .
And the rebels accused the air force of killing 100 civilians and injuring another 70 with cluster bomb attacks on Aananthapuram .
Mr Rambukwella denied the accusation .
The rebels ' political chief B Nadesan also denied UN allegations that the Tigers were stepping up the forcible recruitment of child soldiers .
" We categorically deny the recruitment of anyone below an 18 - year limit , " he told the pro-rebel TamilNet website .
He also said criticised the UN for " not taking effective measures to protect the life , security and interests of innocent Tamil civilians " .
" Instead , the UN is engaged in fruitless exercises of accusing the wrong side . "
About 50,000 soldiers are pressing the Tamil Tigers into a patch of north - eastern jungle after taking the key areas of Kilinochchi , Elephant Pass and Mullaitivu .
The Tigers have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east for a quarter of a century .

While onlookers have always been puzzled about why eBay bought Skype , an even more bizarre acquisition by the online auction giant , though on a smaller scale , was that of StumbleUpon , back in 2007 for a reported $ 75 million .
Today , the mismatch has apparently been dissolved , with StumbleUpon announcing that it has “ returned to the ranks of an investor - backed startup ” according to a press release and investor David Hornik .
The move comes at an interesting time for StumbleUpon , as it faces serious competition from Digg , who now has Stumble - like features in the controversial DiggBar .
The company has been doing some exciting things though recently , including its Premiere Partner program for Web publishers ( of which Mashable is a member ) .
Hopefully , freed from the bureaucracy of an Internet giant like eBay , StumbleUpon will become a more nimble startup and keep the innovation going .
This is essentially what StumbleUpon founder Garrett Camp – who is using some of his own funds to free the company from eBay – suggests , saying , “ This change makes it possible for StumbleUpon to continue to innovate and focus on becoming the Web ’s largest recommendation service . ”
Meanwhile , this could be the first step of eBay dissolving what has essentially become a holding company for a number of startups that do n’t really fit into its main auction business .
Speculation continues to mount that the company will soon spin - off or sell back Skype to some of its original investors , in a similar deal to what was just announced with StumbleUpon .

Palin , Fundraising Firm Part Ways
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has had some trouble coordinating her Alaska staff and those working for her PAC .
( AP Photo / Darron Cummings )
Campaign Solutions , a Republican consulting firm advising Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's political action committee , has parted ways with the former Republican vice presidential nominee .
The group had been working with the Palin operation to raise money for SarahPAC but decided to step aside after a series of strategic and philosophic differences , according to a source familiar with the decision .
Campaign Solutions head Becki Donatelli had long been associated with the fundraising efforts of Arizona Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) and got to know Palin during last year 's presidential campaign .
When Palin decided to set up a PAC earlier this year as a first step toward solidifying her role on the national stage and potentially positioning herself for a 2012 presidential run , Donatelli 's firm was the obvious choice to help raise money for the fledgling effort .
" When the Governor gave Kristan Cole permission to launch a legal expense fund , she had one request : keep it in Alaska .
Campaign Solutions is not based in Alaska , " said SarahPAC spokesperson Meghan Stapleton .
We appreciate Donatelli 's good work for us , but as we have been saying all along , the Governor is focused on Alaska and Alaskans . "
Pam Pryor , the DC - based spokeswoman for SarahPAC , will stay on in her current role .
SarahPAC formally incorporated in late January but is not required to file a report detailing its contributions and expenditures until the end of June .
The parting of ways between Palin and Campaign Solutions is the latest sign of a divide between the governor 's official Alaska staff and those advising her on the national level .
Palin has struggled badly to balance those competing interests ; she recently agreed to and then canceled an appearance at a fundraiser to benefit the Republican House and Senate campaign committees .
The news of the latest problem in Palin 's political world comes on the same day that the Alaska governor announced the formation of the Alaska Fund Trust , an official legal fund designed to " defend the integrity of the Alaska Governor 's Office from an onslaught of political attacks launched against current Governor Sarah Palin , the First Family , and state - employed colleagues , " according to a mission statement on the organization 's Web site .
It also comes less than 24 hours after Levi Johnston , the former fiancee of her daughter , Bristol , appeared on CNN's " Larry King Live " to discuss his relationship with the Palins .
The conclusion in recently released Justice Department memos that CIA interrogation techniques would not cause prolonged mental harm is disputed by some doctors and psychologists , who say that the mental damage incurred from the practices is significant and undeniable .
An August 2002 memo outlined 10 interrogation techniques used on top Al Qaeda suspects , including waterboarding , stress positions and -- for one prisoner with a known fear of insects -- cramped confinement with a bug .
Other memos also described such techniques .
“ I disagree wholeheartedly with their contention that there are no long - term psychological effects of these treatments , ” said Nina K. Thomas , an adjunct clinical associate professor at New York University ’s postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis , who has worked with torture victims .
Interrogation techniques undoubtedly have lasting effects , she said , such as paranoia , anxiety , hyper- vigilance and “ the destruction of people ’s personalities . ”

Brad Olson , a research professor of psychology at Northwestern University , said the approved methods could be extremely damaging .
“ Even given individual differences in a person ’s resilience , over time -- using any of those techniques in combination -- there ’s absolutely no question they are going to lead to permanent mental harm , ” Olson said .
When interrogators were tipped off to one prisoner ’s fear of insects , they planned to put him and a bug in a box , although the CIA said it never did so .
“ Some of these [ techniques ] clearly have a very real physical component , ” said Dr. Allen Keller , director of the Bellevue / NYU Program for Survivors of Torture .
He cited waterboarding , in which water is poured over the face to simulate drowning , as an example .

A prisoner deprived of sleep may be overwhelmed with memories of torture when they become tired years later , Keller said .
The same is true , he said , for the stomach growls of those tortured by starvation .
But David Rivkin , who served in the Justice Department under Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush , defended the practices .
He said the military had been subjecting its own to these techniques for years during training .
“ If this is torture , we ’ve been torturing our own soldiers for years , ” Rivkin said .
“ Why is it that we are all of a sudden revolted and aghast ? ”
In Rivkin ’s estimation , these techniques are better than other methods of coercion .
“ They ’re not easy , but they ’re enormously restrained -- they ’re not relying on brute force , they ’re not relying on infliction of pain , ” he said .

Regardless of its lasting damage , torture is not an effective way of extracting information , said Fathali Moghaddam , a professor of psychology at Georgetown University .
“ Depending on the individual being tortured , all of these can have the effect of leading the individual being tortured to give completely incorrect information -- as a way of stopping the pain , ” Moghaddam said .

Pretty funny video , another example of the “ Simpsons did it ” phenomenon .
The vaccine debate continues for some people , despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and do n't cause autism .
With so much misinformation about vaccines confusing parents , it can be hard for some to know what to do and whether or not to vaccinate their kids .
In addition to talking to your pediatrician , reading one or more of these books about vaccines — which are some of the best books about vaccines — can help you make the right decision , get your kids vaccinated on time , and help protect them from vaccine - preventable infections .
Jack Cover , an aerospace scientist who invented the Taser stun gun -- a device used by thousands of law enforcement agencies to subdue unruly offenders with electrical shocks -- has died .
He was 88 .
Cover had Alzheimer ’s disease and died of pneumonia Saturday at the Golden West Retirement Home in Mission Viejo , said his wife , Ginny .
Trained as a nuclear physicist , Cover spent most of his career working in aerospace and defense industries .
He was a chief scientist for North American Aviation ( later Rockwell International ) and helped the firm become a primary NASA contractor on the Apollo moon landing program in the early 1960s .
He also was a born inventor who in the 1940s already was building gadgets , including cooked - food testers , voice - activated switches and an electric toothbrush .
One of his last brainstorms was an alternative - energy generator .
But the Taser was his most successful invention , credited with preventing deadly police encounters and spurring improvements in the tactics used to take violent offenders into custody .
“ Jack is an unsung hero .
He did something great for the world , saved a lot of lives and prevented a lot of injuries , ” said Greg Meyer , a retired police captain who was heading the Los Angeles Police Department ’s nonlethal weapons research when he met Cover 30 years ago .
The Taser also has its share of critics , who have linked the device to scores of deaths in recent years , including two Orange County jail inmates last year .
The American Civil Liberties Union is pressing to have Tasers classified as lethal weapons , but experts disagree on whether the stun guns directly caused the deaths .
Despite the continuing debate , the Taser has come into widespread use , adopted by more than 13,000 military and law enforcement agencies around the world , including the LAPD , which worked closely with Cover to test the device in the 1980s .
According to Meyer , Cover began to develop the Taser in the 1960s in response to a rash of airplane hijackings .
Sky marshals carrying sidearms began riding on commercial airliners to discourage hijackers , but Cover saw the risk inherent in the situation .
If a bullet missed the hijacker and pierced the fuselage instead , the plane could go down .
“ He said , ‘ Let me figure out something better than shooting people that might crash the plane , ’ ” Meyer said .
Cover told the Orange County Register in 1991 that he got the idea for the Taser after hearing about a man who was briefly immobilized by a fallen power line .
He began tinkering in his garage and in the late 1960s came up with a device that looked something like a flashlight but fired darts that delivered an electrical charge .
The darts could hit a target up to 15 feet away .
He got the name for the weapon from one of his favorite childhood books , “ Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle , ” one in a popular early 20th century series by Victor Appleton .
In the book , the young Swift invents a rifle that shoots bolts of electricity .
The story apparently continued to animate Cover ’s imagination decades later , when he conceived the word “ Taser ” as an acronym for “ Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle . ”
( Cover evidently added the middle initial “ A , ” which does not appear in the books . )
Cover was born in New York City on April 6 , 1920 , and grew up in Chicago .
He earned a bachelor ’s degree and a doctorate in physics at the University of Chicago , where his professors included Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller , the renowned atomic scientists .
During World War II , he was an Army Air Forces test pilot .
After the war , he spent several years at the Inyokern Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake , Calif .
He was a scientist at North American Aviation from 1952 until 1964 and later worked for IBM and Hughes .
In 1970 , he formed Taser Systems Inc. , believing that his invention of a weapon that could stun but not kill an assailant would have wide appeal .
But because the Taser used gunpowder to launch the darts , the federal government considered it a firearm , a classification that ruled out a civilian market and also discouraged police and military sales .
The LAPD had rejected the Taser twice during the 1970s , Meyer recalled , but reconsidered in 1979 after the controversy involving Eula Love , a South Los Angeles woman who was shot to death by LAPD officers in a confrontation over an unpaid gas bill .
As a result of field tests with the LAPD in 1980 , Cover won department approval with an 11 - watt Taser that proved more effective than his initial 7 - watt model , Meyer said .
But sales remained limited and the business collapsed .
In 1993 , two Arizona brothers , Tom and Rick Smith , contacted the then - 73 - year - old Cover about retooling the Taser as a nonlethal self - protection device that could legally be sold to civilians .
“ Jack was very dedicated to the mission , ” Tom Smith , co-founder and chairman of Taser International in Scottsdale , Ariz . , said this week .
“ He had a true belief in where this technology was going to go . ”
In 1994 , the Smiths ’ company launched the Air Taser , based on Cover ’s proposal to change the propulsion system from gunpowder to compressed air .
Among projectile stun guns , the Smiths ’ devices are the most widely sold in the world , used by police and military agencies in 45 countries .
In addition , more than 180,000 Tasers have been sold to private citizens , according to a company spokesman .
Cover was cremated , and there are no immediate plans for a memorial service .
In addition to his wife , of San Clemente , he is survived by four children , two stepchildren , 10 grandchildren and five great - grandchildren .

You have to love the credit card industry .
They remind me of that old story about the man who killed both his parents - and then threw himself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan :
If you have n't had the credit limit cut on your credit card recently , count yourself lucky .
Risk - averse card issuers are getting slash happy .
And while many cardholders gripe that such cuts slice razor - close to their balance amounts , for an unfortunate few the cuts go far deeper : below what they currently owe .
Under different circumstances , David Chaplin - Loebell would n't have minded that American Express cut his unlimited credit line to just $ 5,000 .
Except that when AmEx reduced his line in October , he had an outstanding balance of $ 10,000 .
" I found out by having a business purchase declined , " he says .
Repeated calls to AmEx failed to yield an answer about why the cut was made .
Chaplin - Loebell , who lives in Philadelphia , is now paying the balance under his regular card terms , and presumes the line will free up for new purchases once he 's below the limit .
" For now , they 've essentially frozen the account , " he says , leaving him to juggle business expenses on his personal cards .
American Express did not respond to requests for comment .
Nasty as it may be , the practice of cutting credit lines below the balance is legal -- at least , for now , says Chi Chi Wu , a staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center , a consumer advocacy group .
Federal Reserve rules requiring lenders to give cardholders 45 days notice before reducing a credit line to the point that it would trigger penalties wo n't go into effect until July 2010 .
" [ Until ] then , there are no federal protections , " says Wu .
A regime where currently illicit drugs are regulated and legalized would provide numerous benefits to Britain , not the least of which would be up to $ 20 billion a year in savings to government , crime victims , and drug users , according to a comprehensive comparison of the costs of drug prohibition and drug legalization .
The figure comes from A Comparison of the Cost - effectiveness of Prohibition and Regulation , a report released Wednesday by the British drug reform group the Transform Drug Policy Foundation .
The group says it is the first time anyone in Britain has attempted an across - the - board comparison of the differing approaches to drug use and sales .
According to official British policy , policies or programs should be assessed by a cost - benefit analysis or impact assessment , but that has never been done with drug prohibition .
Instead of evidence - based policies , the British government has relied on mere assertion to justify maintaining prohibition and to argue that the harms of legalization would outweigh its benefits .
Now , Transform is calling the government 's bluff .
According to its analysis , which examined criminal justice , drug treatment , crime , and other social costs , a regime of regulated legalization would accrue large savings over the current prohibitionist policy .
Transform postulated four different legalization scenarios based on drug use levels declining by half , staying the same , increasing by half , and doubling .
Even under the worst case scenario , with drug use doubling under legalization , Britain would still see annual savings of $ 6.7 billion .
Under the best case scenario , the savings would approach $ 20 billion annually .
" The conclusion is that regulating the drugs market is a dramatically more cost - effective policy than prohibition and that moving from prohibition to regulated drugs markets in England and Wales would provide a net saving to taxpayers , victims of crime , communities , the criminal justice system and drug users , " Transform found .
After nearly seven decades of waffling , Archie Andrews has finally decided to end pop culture 's most famous love triangle .
His bride - to - be ? Snooty brunette Veronica Lodge .
Would it be her or Betty ?
The issue was put to debate .
The publishers decided .
Issue # 600 will feature the long - time freckle - faced high - school klutz on bended knee with a ring in his hand .
While Veronica screams out " Yes ! "
Betty stands wiping away a tear .
This relationship jolt leaves long - time readers of the checkout aisle comic a little lost .
Was n't Veronica forever going hot and cold on poor Archie ?
And is n't her dad a rich buttinsky with strong control - freak tendencies ?
And was n't sweet all - American blond Betty Cooper always there to pick up the pieces ?
For those reasons , sentiment was running strongly in Betty 's favour in the two weeks leading up to the pick .
And it was running just as strongly on the side of proposal nullification .
After all , Archie 's been juggling dates for so long , he 's probably not husband material .
" Why could n't you wait until I was dead before you finally had him pick between the two ? " 46 - year - old fan , Valerie , wrote on the publisher 's website .
In case you have n't checked for a while , Archie is n't 17 any more .
He 's now a college grad looking to explore vistas beyond Principal Weatherbee 's office and the few last miles his jalopy can manage before backfiring her last .
But marriage ?
This is a big step .
And it immediately eliminates about 90 per cent of the narrative twists that have launched thousands of Archie stories .
" So is this the end of Archie Comics ? " wrote another fan , Ebony , likely on a tear - streaked keyboard .
For those who fear that the magic is now gone , along with the eternal youth of all the kids at Riverdale High , there is some hope .
The title of Issue 600 is " Archie Marries Veronica , Part 1 : The Proposal . "
That does n't sound terribly definitive .
Could there be a Part II : Left at the Altar ?

The developers behind Ubuntu project announced Thursday the availability of version 9.04 , codenamed Jaunty Jackalope .
The new release ships with the latest desktop software and several new features .
The Ubuntu Linux distribution is developed around a six - month release cycle , which means that two new versions come out every year .
The version numbers are based on the year and month of the release .
Ubuntu 's launch schedule is based on that of the GNOME project — the open source desktop environment that provides the core applications and user interface in Ubuntu and other popular distributions .
Ubuntu 9.04 comes with GNOME 2.26 , which was released last month .
The new version of GNOME includes a variety of incremental improvements , such as UPnP support for the Totem video player .
Jaunty ships with version 2.6.28 of the Linux kernel , the first kernel release in which the Ext4 filesystem is designated as stable .
Ubuntu supports Ext4 and will allow users to choose it during the installation process , but Ext3 is still used by default because there are still a number of unresolved technical problems with the new filesystem .
Ext4 offers better performance and boosts the maximum filesystem size to 1 exabyte .
Other applications bundled with the 9.04 release include OpenOffice.org 3.0 and GIMP 2.6 .
One of the most significant user - visible changes in Ubuntu 9.04 is the introduction of Canonical 's new notification system and messaging indicator applet .
The old notification daemon has been replaced by a newer system that is designed to boost usability and aesthetic appeal .
Users can now seamlessly click through notifications and interact with the windows below .
The messaging indicator is a new panel applet that aggregates persistent notifications from messaging applications across the desktop .
The developers have already added support for its capabilities in Pidgin and Evolution .
When a new e-mail or instant message is received , the messaging indicator icon will change and a notification item will be listed in the indicator menu .
It can be used to keep track of incoming messages and quickly navigate to the relevant programs .
The items in the indicator menu disappear when their respective applications gain focus .
I 've implemented support for this feature in Gwibber , my open source microblogging program for Linux .
Stay tuned next week for a detailed technical introduction to the messaging indicator with code examples that demonstrate how you can use it in your own programs .
Several other flavors of Ubuntu are also now available for download , including the server edition , Kubuntu , Xubuntu , and Ubuntu Studio .
Kubuntu ships with KDE 4.2.2 and includes some improvements like the new KDE NetworkManager plasmoid , and several new programs , such as the Quassel IRC client .
Xubuntu 9.04 comes with Xfce 4.6 , which we reviewed last month .
Canonical has also announced an official release of the Ubuntu Netbook Remix , a custom version of the distro that is optimized for netbook devices .
When the Netbook Remix was first introduced last year , it was primarily intended to be used for hardware makers who wanted to preinstall Ubuntu on netbooks .
The 9.04 Netbook Remix release marks the first time that it has been made available officially as a user - installable image .
It is supported on several off - the - shelf netbooks , including the Dell Mini 9 , the Acer Aspire One , and several models of the Asus Eee PC .
Ubuntu is beginning to make considerable progress in the server space .
The 9.04 release brings a few noteworthy improvements to the Ubuntu server edition that could help to further accelerate Ubuntu 's growth on servers .
It offers a first look at the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud stack , which leverages the Eucalyptus project to to provide software infrastructure that will enable companies to build their own self - hosted computing clouds .
Ubuntu 9.04 server edition is also officially supported on Amazon 's EC2 service .
For more details about the release , you can refer to the official announcement on the Ubuntu mailing list .
You can download the installation images from the Ubuntu website or via BitTorrent .
[ Haskell ] CFP Haskell Symposium 2009
Haskell 09 ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2009 Edinburgh , Scotland , UK September 3 , 2009 CALL FOR PAPERS http://haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2009/
The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2009 will be co-located with the 2009 International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP ) .
The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experiences with Haskell and future developments for the language .
The scope of the symposium includes all aspects of the design , semantics , theory , application , implementation , and teaching of Haskell .
Topics of interest include , but are not limited to , the following : * Language Design , with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo ; * Theory , in the form of a formal treatment of the semantics of the present language or future extensions , type systems , and foundations for program analysis and transformation ; * Implementations , including program analysis and transformation , static and dynamic compilation for sequential , parallel , and distributed architectures , memory management as well as foreign function and component interfaces ; * Tools , in the form of profilers , tracers , debuggers , pre-processors , and so forth ; * Applications , Practice , and Experience , with Haskell for scientific and symbolic computing , database , multimedia and Web applications , and so forth as well as general experience with Haskell in education and industry ; * Functional Pearls , being elegant , instructive examples of using Haskell .
Papers in the latter two categories need not necessarily report original research results ; they may instead , for example , report practical experience that will be useful to others , re-usable programming idioms , or elegant new ways of approaching a problem .
The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit .
It is not enough simply to describe a program !
Before 2008 , the Haskell Symposium was known as the Haskell Workshop .
The name change reflects both the steady increase of influence of the Haskell Workshop on the wider community as well as the increasing number of high quality submissions .
The acceptance process is highly competitive .
After eleven Haskell Workshops between 1995 and 2007 , the first Haskell Symposium was held in Victoria in 2008 .
Submission Details * Submission Deadline : Friday , May 8th 2009 ( 3:00 pm , Eastern US Time ) * Author Notification : Monday , June 1st 2009 * Final Papers Due : Monday , June 15th 2009 Submitted papers should be in portable document format ( PDF ) , formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines ( http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm).
The length is restricted to 12 pages , and the font size 9pt .
Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN 's republication policy , as explained on the web .
Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission .
Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM Digital Library .
If there is sufficient demand , we will try to organize a time slot for system or tool demonstrations .
If you are interested in demonstrating a Haskell related tool or application , please send a brief demo proposal to Stephanie Weirich , sweirich at cis.upenn.edu .

April 22 , 2009  --
The culture wars are raging .
But if we 're in the midst of a revolution , it 's hardly being televised .
A flurry of state - level activity is dramatically expanding gay marriage in the United States .
A court ruling in Iowa and a legislative vote in Vermont made them the third and fourth states to legalize same - sex marriage , and moves are under way for states including New York , Connecticut and New Hampshire to join them soon .
Add to that Obama administration executive orders on stem - cell research and abortion rights , and the last few months have brought victories for social liberals -- and setbacks for social conservatives -- on a scale not seen in decades .
Yet beyond the expected condemnation from conservative leaders , the stunning series of events is notable for how little it 's reverberated across the national political landscape .
" It 's almost like the silence is deafening , " said Tony Fabrizio , a GOP pollster .
" This is the first time in probably 15 years that the social right has really no levers of power , and they are watching their agenda get rolled back . "
The national agenda is consumed by the economic crisis , with all of its tentacles .
Last week , nationwide grassroots protests offered a sharp critique of President Obama -- but the " tea parties " came together around fiscal issues , not social ones .
The religious right , a force powerful enough to dictate policy direction in Congress and the White House as recently as the Terri Schiavo affair , has shown signs of splintering at the national level .
While social conservatives remain a major part of the GOP , they are losing influence inside and outside the party , said Rich Galen , a Republican strategist .
" The social conservatives do n't have the sway that they 've had before , because they have n't been very successful running the party the last six years , " Galen said .
" The libertarian / fiscal conservative wing of the party is proving to be in the ascendancy . "
On one level , the relative quiet should n't be surprising .
The gay - marriage expansions have been happening at the state level , with no direct involvement by Democratic congressional leaders or Obama .
A Conservative Argument for Gay Marriage ?
In the wake of the activity in Iowa and Vermont , a coalition called the National Organization for Marriage did launch a TV advertising campaign in targeted states , designed to warn religious voters about the potential impact of gay marriage on their lives .
" They want to bring the issue into my life , " says one actor in the ad .
" My freedom will be taken away , " says another .
Maggie Gallagher , the organization 's president and a conservative commentator , said there 's no shortage of grassroots conservative anger over the recent moves expanding gay marriage .
That outrage may not be getting much national press attention , but it remains a potent political force , she said .
" It 's manufactured moment , this idea that people are ready to give up on the gay - marriage fight , " Gallagher said .
" In Connecticut , in New Hampshire , in Iowa , the legislators are being flooded with phone calls on this issue .
People are not happy with gay marriage . "
Gallagher noted that voters continue to support gay - marriage bans , as they did in California last year .
Still , prominent Republican politicians have been much more apt to criticize Obama and national Democrats on fiscal policies and national security than to adopt social conservative causes as rallying cries this year .
Utah 's Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. recently came out in favor of civil unions for gay couples , even as he leads one of the nation 's most Republican states .
Last week , Steve Schmidt , who ran Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign last year , sparked a fresh debate inside the Republican Party by publicly calling on the GOP to drop its opposition to gay marriage .
" There is a sound conservative argument to be made for same - sex marriage , " Schmidt told the Log Cabin Republicans , a gay GOP group .
" I 'm confident American public opinion will continue to move on the question toward majority support , and sooner or later the Republican Party will catch up to it . "
Schmidt 's comments are unlikely to prompt a wholesale reexamination of the party 's positions on gay rights .
Many other party strategists say that Schmidt 's prescription would cause short - term electoral disaster for Republicans , since the party 's support is rooted in religious and other social conservatives .
GOP Trying to Appeal to Moderate Voters
" That 's a sure way to make sure that social conservatives stay home , " GOP pollster and strategist Whit Ayres said of Schmidt 's suggestion that the party support gay marriage .
Polling suggests that an overwhelming majority of voters continue to oppose same - sex marriage .
A March CBS
News poll found just 33 percent saying they support legalizing gay marriage , with another 27 percent saying they favor civil unions , essentially a marriage equivalent in all but name .
That same poll found that only 6 percent of Republicans favor gay marriage .
But , as Schmidt referenced in his speech , there 's a big split among age groups .
Among younger voters of all political persuasions -- ages 18 - 45 -- 41 percent said they support gay marriage .
Among voters 65 or older , that number drops to just 18 percent .
Even many socially conservative voters realize that the party needs to emphasize different aspects of its platform to appeal to moderate voters , Ayres said .
That leaves the Republican Party rebuilding itself along economic lines .
" The distinctions drawn there are likely to be more beneficial to the party , " Ayres said .
" It changes the emphasis , " he said .
" With people so concerned about losing their jobs , their healthcare , their retirement savings , it 's hard to break through if you 're not talking about that right now . "
Timing dictates so much in politics -- and this is no exception , Fabrizio said .
" If this had happened a year ago , it would have turned the presidential campaign on its head , " he said .
The return of blue whales to the waters off Canada and Alaska may mean the marine mammals have managed to re-establish a migration pattern not seen since long before commercial whaling ended in 1965 .
Blue whales are the largest creatures to have ever existed , and their numbers were decimated during the peak period of commercial whaling between 1908 and 1965 .
Since the species ’ population did not show signs of recovery after whaling ended , it was feared that the animals had lost the cultural knowledge to reclaim their habitats .
But analysis of photographs taken of 15 blue whales off British Columbia and Alaska since 1997 by Canadian and U.S. researchers showed that four were also seen off California .
It ’s believed the species is migrating into the Gulf of Alaska because there is n’t enough krill to sustain them solely in coastal California .
The research was conducted by the Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia Washington in coordination with NOAA and Canada ’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
Results were published in the journal Marine Mammal Science .

It was not his first visit to her home .
" He probably thought he would be in and out and no one would know , because that 's what happened before , " said his wife , Betty Yettaw , referring to a previously unknown visit last summer when Mrs Suu Kyi's maids turned him away without seeing her .
Technology.am ( Apr. 11 , 2009 ) — Smarter is not always better — at least when it comes to utilities .
The nation ’s electricity grid has been compromised by foreign hackers .
Many warnings have been sounded over the years .
The infrastructure in the U.S. is vulnerable to cyberattack , the situation has worsened as utilities move their control systems closer to the Internet and install smart - grid technology , according to security experts .
The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) control systems used by the energy industry used to be segregated from public networks .
But they have increasingly become more dependent on Internet protocol - based systems , the experts said .
At the same time , their security precautions are inefficient , they said .
“ Plant control networks and their programmable logic controllers should be disconnected from the Internet , ” said Peter “ Mudge ” Zatko , technical director of the national intelligence research unit at BBN Technologies .
“ These are the things lifting and lowering the plutonium rods into the water to make steam …
It ’s on the Internet .
This is terrifying . ”
In 1999 , Zatko compiled a list of about 30 utilities whose plant control networks could be accessed remotely , and he says many of them still have the same problems today .
In 2004 , Gartner did a report concluding that the use of IP networks for critical infrastructure could serve as bait for cyberattackers .
Security company Industrial Defender has done more than 100 threat assessments over the past seven years , primarily in utility infrastructure , and identified 34,000 vulnerabilities , said company CEO Brian Ahern .
IP networks are n’t the only problem .
The use of smart - grid technology , which consists of networked meters designed for adjusting electricity flows and monitoring everything from power plants to individual appliances in homes , are also putting critical systems at risk , experts said .
The energy sector was the industry most vulnerable to cyberattack .
More than 2 million smart meters are in use in the U.S. today , and an estimated 73 utilities have ordered 17 million additional smart meters , according to IOActive .
The story is likely linked to turf battles within the federal government over which agency will oversee the cybersecurity policies , and get the funding for it , several of the security experts suggested .
For instance , the Department of Homeland Security has been criticized for not doing enough on cybersecurity , while the director of Homeland Security ’s National Cybersecurity Center resigned recently , accusing the NSA of trying to wrest control .
Children ’s early reading experience is critical to the development of their lifelong reading skills a new study from the University of Leicester has discovered .
It found that the age at which we learn words is key to understanding how people read later in life .
The study addresses a 20 - year riddle :
When researchers investigate reading behaviour in children they find different patterns .
Some researchers have found children ’s reading mimics that of adults , but others have seen a different pattern of reading behaviour .
Psychologists have struggled for twenty years to offer a convincing explanation for why different studies looking at the same topic have found such different results .
Now research by Dr Tessa Webb in the School of Psychology at the University of Leicester sheds new light on the subject by taking into account the age at which words are learnt .
She said : “ Children read differently from adults , but as they grow older , they develop the same reading patterns .
When adults read words they learned when they were younger , they recognise them faster and more accurately than those they learned later in life . ”
In her research children from three different school years read aloud common and rarely used words , with half of the words following spelling to sound rules and the other half not obeying them .
Unlike previous studies , Dr Webb made sure her research considered word learning age as well .
She found that children in their first few years at school read the words differently from adults .
However , by age 10 , they were mimicking the reading pattern of adults .
This suggests that the different pattern of results found in children compared to adults may be due to the fact that word learning age was not considered .
This led her to conclude that word learning age is a key aspect of reading that should not be left out of research , lest the results are unsound .
The results of this research could have implications in tackling reading - related disabilities , such as dyslexia , said Dr Webb .

Pregnant ?
NOOOOO !!!
It sounded like a good idea at first .
Such and such team was holding a cheerleader tryout and you used to cheer for the boys back at Central High .
But its been 8 years since graduating from high school .
The body has changed – a little – but you still think the talent is there to work it for a professional team .
You withdraw $ 50 from the savings , head down to the arena and take the workout clothes .
You walk onto the floor where there are 80 - 100 smiling , blond 19 - 20 - year - olds with sculpted bodies and breasts that would make a plastic surgeon smile .
Soon realization hits , you are part of the “ 8 Greatest Moments In Cheerleader Tryout Fails . ”
The above photo is a great example .
Your baby probably does n’t want tossed around like a Caesar .
Going to work is one thing but bouncing around a basketball court ?
Fail !
Listen , ladies , if you are sporting a 12 - pack beer gut save the $ 50 bones and join the gym until next year .
You ’ll waste a Saturday shaking it for nothing .
Walk into the gym and look at the stomach .
That ’s a huge indicator where you stand .
If it ai n’t flat and showing a little ribcage , find another activity .
And the breasts cannot be saggy .
See the Charger Girls for a good idea what we ’re talking about .
What about the legs , you ask ?
If there is n’t daylight between them when standing upright , we ’re talking major fail .
Age ?
If you ’ve used the term 401 k more than Twitter or Facebook in the last month , professional cheerleading wo n’t be for you .
Police keep watch on a bridge in a file image May 1 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Umit Bektas
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese man was pushed off a bridge by an angry passer - by after his threat to commit suicide held up traffic for five hours , Chinese media reported on Saturday .
Retired soldier Lian Jiansheng , 66 , broke through a police cordon and reached out to shake the hand of would - be jumper Chen Fuchao before shoving him off the bridge .
“ I pushed him off because jumpers like Chen are very selfish .
Their action violates a lot of public interests , ” Lai was quoted as saying by the China Daily newspaper .
“ They do not really dare to kill themselves .
Instead , they just want to raise the relevant government authorities ’ attention to their appeals . ”
Chen , 2 million yuan ( $ 293,200 ) in debt because of a failed building project , fell 8 metres ( yards ) onto a partially inflated emergency air cushion and was hospitalized with wrist and back injuries .
Lai was detained by police .
Chen was at least the twelfth person since early April to threaten suicide at the same spot , the Haizhu bridge in Guangzhou .
But none jumped and -- until Lian gave Chen a helping hand -- none was pushed .
The HEXBUG
Ant has made it's way online and I have secured five of them to give to our readers .
Just drop a comment below for a chance to win .
I 'll choose five lucky winners at noon central time tomorrow , April 9th .
We 've been having a lot of fun dropping the Ants in the kitchen and watching the cats go insane .
The ants are fast enough to be difficult to catch , and sturdy enough to withstand a swift kick .
The axles are also removable to make cleaning out the lint easy .
The Ant 's web page has a new Design tab that shows some of the early prototypes and gives a peek into how these fun toys were developed .
Click through to get a sneak peak at one of the earliest prototype ants .
Click through for a look at some of the first prototype ants .
Some of the parts to build prototypes below were printed on a Dimension SST 3D printer .
The motors were scavenged from the original HEXBUGs and the axles are small Allen wrenches .
Liberal application of super glue was used to strengthen the fragile parts like the wheels .
I do n't think this is the very fist prototype ant , but it is close .
While it did n't work extremely well , it gave a good approximation of how the final version behaves .
Friction turned out to be a problem with the primitive " touch " sensor .
Two of the wheels were repurposed to use on the next prototype .
Rev 2 dropped the touch sensor and just ran forward .
This was the first attempt at dressing him up .
The springy antenna were borrowed from an original hexbug .
The antenna gave it a little bounce when hitting obstacles and it would spin around and run off in a new direction .
The last printed version has a lot in common with the final production model .
The motor placement , high speed gear train , and basic shape of the body and wheels are close .
Now it is up to the engineers and product designer to collaborate and make a final version that not only looks good , but can be produced at a reasonable cost .
There are some pictures from that process on the Ant 's Design tab on the HEXBUG.com .
Be sure to leave a comment for a chance to win a new HEXBUG Ant .
It seemed among the easiest of his transparency pledges and is entirely under his control , but President Obama is finagling his promise to post bills on the White House Web site for comment for five days before he signs them .
Mr. Obama last week signed four bills , each just a day or two after Congress passed and sent it over to him .
The White House said it posted links from its Web site to Congress ‘ legislative Web site about a week before Mr. Obama signed the measures , but transparency advocates say that does n’t match the president ’s pledge to give Americans time to comment on the final version he is about to sign .
“ He did n’t say , ‘ When there ’s a bill heading to my desk , ’ or ‘ When we ’re pretty sure a bill will soon be passed . ’
He said when a bill ends up on his desk - a strong implication that public review would follow the bill arriving at his desk , ” said Jim Harper , director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute .
RELATED STORIES :

• Obama picks Judge Sotomayor for Supreme Court
During the campaign and again during the transition , Mr. Obama said opening bills up for public comment was a way of fighting back against special interests ’ control of the process .
“ When there ’s a bill that ends up on my desk as president , you the public will have five days to look online and find out what ’s in it before I sign it , so that you know what your government ’s doing , ” Mr. Obama said in a major campaign speech laying out his goals for transparency .
Mr. Harper said that to him , the pledge means putting a copy of the bill on www.whitehouse.gov and then waiting five days to allow comments to roll in .
“ That ’s the only interpretation of this promise that delivers solid transparency , ” he said .
“ Posting a bill late in the process does n’t give the public a chance to review the final legislation - especially last - minute amendments , which are where a lot of congressional hijinks happen . ”
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the clock starts ticking when a link is posted to bills when they are in their final version , such as a conference report , even if they have n’t passed Congress .
“ A conference report , as you know , is an unamendable piece of legislation that has to be approved by both houses , language has to be simultaneous , it gets sent down here , and we sign it , ” he told reporters Friday .
But that was not the case for last week ’s bills , at least some of which were n’t in their final form until a day or two before being sent to Mr. Obama .
In the case of a Defense Department weapons acquisition bill , the White House posted its link to the Library of Congress Web site , www.Thomas.gov, on May 14 , even though the conference report was n’t done until May 20 .
Congress passed that bill on May 21 and Mr. Obama signed it the next day .
On the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights Act , the White House posted a link to Congress on May 14 , but the Senate did n’t finish its work until May 19 ; the House agreed to the Senate ’s version on May 20 , and Mr. Obama signed it two days later .
Speaking on the condition of anonymity , a White House official said the link to Congress ‘
Web site allows readers to find every version of the bill and is more up - to - date .
“ We link to Thomas pages that list the latest version , so once they were amended people could still read that latest version once it got posted , as opposed to us posting text that became outdated , ” the official said .
The link the White House posts goes to a list of bills in various stages of the process .
In the case of the military procurement measure , the White House listed two bills winding their way through Congress , because it could n’t know which version would actually be presented .
Mr. Obama has exempted emergency bills from his promise and used that to justify his signing some major measures such as the stimulus spending bill before a full five days had elapsed .
But there was no stated emergency for last week ’s bills .
“ They ’re certainly not making it a priority to live up to the pledge , ” said John Wonderlich , policy director at the Sunlight Foundation .
Sunlight is pressing for a waiting period for Congress , to prevent instances like last week , when House and Senate negotiators filed their final version of the weapons acquisition bill and put it to a vote in the Senate the same day .
The House voted on it the next day .
Mr. Wonderlich said Congress is where the actual changes to a bill can happen .
By the time it gets to the president , he can only sign or veto it .
In light of that , Mr. Wonderlich said , some transparency advocates have questioned the value of Mr. Obama ’s five - day pledge .
Mr. Harper , though , said the value will come if and when Mr. Obama enforces the rule .
“ Members of Congress are very skilled political risk analyzers .
When the president is enforcing this rule and they know their work is going to sit for five days before signing , they ’re going to know they ca n’t slip in that last earmark , ” he said .
He pointed to the language that allowed American International Group executives to claim bonuses as an example .
That language was added in the conference committee between House and Senate negotiators , at the very end of the legislative process .

April 2 , 2009 - Greg Cherlin
It 's been a couple of weeks since we posted , so we thought it'd be good to do some housekeeping .
The next class pack will focus on the Sniper .
It 's actually shaping up to be the largest TF2 update yet , with multiple new maps and a bunch of gameplay tweaks .
In addition , we 've got another update in the works that should be done before the Sniper , and that one will include some new content for all classes .
The XBox 360 update is still being worked on .
If you 're wondering what 's taking so long , since the content is " done " on the PC already , it 's mostly been around fitting it all onto the XBox .
The original version of TF2 in the Orange Box was very close to the XBox 's memory limit , and all the additional TF2 content we 've produced has pushed well beyond it .
We 've found a couple of nifty ways to get back a bunch of that memory , but it 's turned out to be a lot of work , and that 's what most of our time is being spent on .
In the meantime , we 're going to get a code update out to address the server cheating that 's going on .
Like many other folks online , the TF2 team has been loving the Top 10 TF2 Plays of the Week videos that Push Gaming has been doing .
If you have n't seen them yet , you can catch week 1 , and week 2 .
We 're hoping for a third one soon , but we can't really complain .
If we were doing them ourselves , you 'd probably see the third one sometime next year .
While waiting though , you can check out the exploits of some of the Sniper 's countrymen in the second frag video of Aussie clan Mad Dogz .
Deliberate sabotage is being blamed for a sizable internet and telephone service outage Thursday in Silicon Valley .
At 1:30 a.m. , someone opened a manhole cover on a railroad right - of - way in San Jose , climbed down and cut four AT&T fiber optic cables .
A second AT&T cable , and a Sprint cable , were cut in the same manner two hours later , farther north in San Carlos .
Service for Sprint , Verizon and AT&T customers in the southern San Francisco Bay Area has been lost , according to the San Francisco Chronicle .
Police departments have put more units on the street , because nobody can call 9 - 1 - 1 .
A much smaller Comcast outage affecting around 4,500 customers in San Jose began at around 1:00 p.m. Pacific time .
Spokesman Andrew Johnson says the company is investigating the cause .
Update : AT&T is offering a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the vandal .

Five protesters who were assaulted by officers and kept in police custody for two nights have been paid tens of thousands of pounds in an out - of - court settlement .
The five have received £ 85,000 in compensation plus costs , together totalling more than £ 100,000 , in a settlement recorded at the high court this week .
Their detention after a demonstration in London three years ago was " unlawful " and a restriction of their " democratic right to peaceful protest " , the Metropolitan police accepted in a statement released this week .
The admission follows criticism of police behaviour at the G20 summit this month and campaigners say the payout will reinforce concerns about the Met 's handling of public order events and may encourage others to seek compensation .
The peaceful rally outside the Mexican embassy in October 2006 was attended by about 20 activists calling for action over the murder of an American filmmaker , Bradley Roland Will , during a teachers ' strike in the city of Oaxaca .
The shooting was blamed on local state officials .
The vigil was part of a worldwide day of protest outside Mexican embassies .
Eight people were arrested in London .
All eventually had the charges against them dropped or were found not guilty of public order offences .
Yesterday Tony Murphy , the solicitor at Bhatt Murphy who brought the claim , said : " This case shows that policing protest unlawfully carries a high cost .
This includes the severe human cost to protestors , but also the cost to the public purse and more worryingly to public confidence in the police .
The implications for those I am advising in relation to G20 are clear . "
David Howarth , a Lib Dem MP who has been following the case , said : " Given that the Met has admitted liability , the question now is why the officers concerned are not being investigated for criminal offences .
This underlines the urgent need for an independent review of the police 's attitude towards peaceful protest . "
The formal apology sent to the protesters by Detective Chief Inspector Alex Gibbs , of the Met 's directorate of professional standards , stated : " It is accepted that your arrest was unlawful and that any force used on you during your arrest was therefore an assault and battery .
" ... I am in no doubt about the significant effect that this matter has had on you and on your democratic right to peaceful protest ...
I unreservedly regret the upset and distress that this must have caused .
" The policing of public order events and demonstrations ... requires a careful balance of the rights and freedoms of often conflicting interests and necessitates officers making difficult decisions under notable pressure .
In this case it is clear that balance was not achieved ... Lessons have been learned . "
James Welch , from the civil rights organisation Liberty , said : " It 's always good to see the police recognise the right to peaceful dissent , even if it is after an embarrassment and under pain of litigation .
Tunas at the Tsukiji Fish Market .

Psst !
Love your tuna sashimi ?
Well , eat up because they may not be around much longer .
The World Wildlife Fund has a dire report saying that unless current fishing practices are changed , tunas will be wiped out by 2012 :
The population can only be saved by a complete halt to fishing in May and June , when the fish swim to the Mediterranean to spawn , the WWF says .
The call comes as the two month tuna fishing season begins .
' Bluefin tuna is collapsing as we speak and yet the fishery will kick off for business as usual , ' said Sergi Tudela , of WWF .
' It is absurd and inexcusable to open a fishing season when stocks of the target species are collapsing . '
A great deal has happened these last several days involving activists and various Law Enforcement Agencies around Keene , NH .
Many videos have been posted and much outrage expressed .
In the end I think the heat of the moment causes us to lose sight of the reality and perhaps creates an illusionary world where one does not exist .
I might catch hell from my friends for posting this but I ’m the type of person who speaks his mind regardless .
In general the Keene Police Department and the local Sheriffs have acted in a very professional manner and have shown a great deal of restraint in dealing with activists .
Most notably , Lt. Shane Maxfield .
In every incident I have seen involving the Lt. he has been calm and communicative , dare I say honorable .
This is reality .
Whether you like the job they do , the actions they take or the orders they follow , we are fortunate to have good humans in those uniforms .
And they are human , just as we are , subject to the same flaws and features , the same mistakes and misjudgments .
I do take issue with the way Patrick was carried today and the way Sam was likely treated , I do take issue with the orders to arrest peaceful activists for victimless crimes and I do take issue with the use of force in general to achieve a hegemony of the State over the Individual .
One need only read my previous blog entries to see how I feel .
You want to see bad cops search “ police abuse ” on google or Youtube and you will get an eyeful .
You want to see what a lack of restraint truly looks like or what a jackbooted thug really does , see my previous sentence .
This is the reality we live in .
No Photoshop , no bullshit just the real truth .
We ( the activists and the police ) may not see eye to eye but at least we are given legs to stand on and not lying on the ground with a knee on our throat .
I left the police station this afternoon mulling over a blog post describing the event as merely an exercise in intimidation , which it was , but after cooling down and reading some private information I realized that we were giving up our most potent weapon .
The Truth .
We talk and debate about the truth that the State is merely a monopoly of violence and that they do not and can not produce anything because they must first take from the producers .
We talk about the truth involving the drug war and victimless crimes .
Why then can we not speak the truth about how we are treated for the most part by the KPD with respect and civility .
Obviously there are exceptions but they are few .
Here is some more truth .
Police Prosecutor Rivera lost his wits today .
A dozen or more upset but PEACEFUL activists in the lobby concerned over the screams of a friend in captivity and he calls in the hammer squad to bust up the circus .
He knew given our history that we would not harm him physically but the truth is he knows ( do n’t deny the truth Mr. Rivera ) that what was going on was wrong .
His position in the argument was morally bankrupt .
Arresting someone in a public court room for wanting to video tape a public arraignment is just asinine and asking for civil dissent .
Couple that with the fact that no other arraignments were going on at the time and the only people in the court room , other than civil servants , were activists and your left with a What the Fuck situation .
There was no reason to not allow cameras other than the whole power trip obey - and - comply bullshit .
This is the truth .
One final piece of truth for you the reader .
The ONLY reason cameras are not allowed is because Judge Burke embarrassed himself with his little outburst and Youtube ate it up .
When confronted with the truth an individual can choose to do one of the following : deny it , cover it up , ignore it or accept it .
Which one are you going to choose ?
Rivera ?
Burke ?
Maxfield ?
Which is it going to be ?
Man up or STFU .
Are you sitting down ?
If not , you might want to change that before you read this .

( CNN ) -- President Obama said Wednesday that he 's under no illusions that he 'll have a " rubber- stamp Senate " now that Sen.
Arlen Specter has switched parties to join the Democrats .
President Obama speaks on the 100th day of his administration .
" To my Republican friends , I want them to realize that me reaching out to them has been genuine , " Obama said at a prime time news conference capping his 100th day in office .
" I can't sort of define bipartisanship as simply being willing to accept certain theories of theirs that we tried for eight years and did n't work and the American people voted to change . "
Specter on Tuesday announced he was changing parties , saying he 's found himself increasingly " at odds with the Republican philosophy . "
He also admitted Wednesday he was worried about the prospects of facing a Republican primary in order to keep his seat next year .
Specter 's move puts the Democrats one shy of a filibuster - proof Senate majority of 60 seats .
Senate Democrats can reach the 60 - seat mark if courts uphold Al Franken 's disputed recount victory in Minnesota .
As if to prove the president 's point , Specter voted against Obama 's budget plan shortly before the news conference .
Asked if the GOP is in desperate straits , Obama said , " Politics in America changes very quick .
And I 'm a big believer that things are never as good as they seem and never as bad as they seem . "
Watch what Obama says about working with Republicans »
Obama has faced criticism from Republicans that he has n't been reaching across the aisle .
His budget moved through both chambers of Congress on Wednesday with no GOP support , and his economic stimulus plan passed with just three Republican votes from the Senate .
iReport.com : Your thoughts on Obama 's speech and first 100 days
The president said he thinks the administration has taken steps to restore confidence in the American people , noting that " simply opposing our approach on every front is probably not a good political strategy . "
In his first 100 days , he 's been " sobered by the fact that change in Washington comes slow , " said Obama .
Watch Obama discuss what 's surprised him in the first 100 days »
" That there is still a certain quotient of political posturing and bickering that takes place even when we 're in the middle of really big crises , " he said , adding that he'd like for everyone to say " let 's take a time - out on some of the political games . "
In a shift from his previous news conferences which were dominated by questions about the economy , Obama fielded multiple queries on the foreign policy front .
The president said a recent uptick in violence in Iraq wo n't affect his plan for a phased military withdrawal .
" Civilian deaths , incidents of bombings ... remain very low relative to what was going on last year , " Obama said .
" You have n't seen the kinds of huge spikes that you were seeing for a time .
The political system is holding and functioning in Iraq . "
Obama said more details need to be nailed down before U.S. troops leave Iraq -- including how oil revenues will be divided , what the powers of provincial governments there will be and the political relationships between minority Kurds , Sunnis and Shiites -- including the armed Sons of Iraq groups .
On Pakistan , the president said the United States has " huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable " and does n't end up a " nuclear - armed militant state . "
" I am gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan , not because I think that they 're immediately going to be overrun and the Taliban would take over in Pakistan .
I 'm more concerned that the civilian government there right now is very fragile and do n't seem to have the capacity to deliver basic services , " he said .
Obama also said Wednesday he is " very comfortable " with his decision to ban interrogation techniques like waterboarding , which he called torture .
Watch what Obama says about torture »
The president called the practice a recruiting tool for terrorist groups like al Qaeda , citing World War II - era British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , who also rejected such " enhanced interrogation " techniques .
" Churchill understood that if you start taking shortcuts , over time that corrodes what 's best in a people , " Obama said .
" It corrodes the character of a country . "
Asked about the previous administration , he said , " I think that whatever legal rationale were used , it was a mistake . "
On the recent outbreaks of swine flu , Obama insisted his administration is " prepared to do whatever it takes to control the impact of the virus . "
" I 've asked every American to take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu :
Keep your hands washed ; cover your mouth when you cough ; stay home from work if you 're sick ; and keep your children home from school if they 're sick , " he said .
Obama downplayed the possibility of closing the border with Mexico as a way to control the virus , also known by its clinical name of H1N1 .
Watch as Obama warns Americans about the flu »
" It would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out , " Obama said .
The first cases of the virus were detected in Mexico , where health officials suspect swine flu in more than 150 other deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses .
Only 26 cases have so far been confirmed , including the seven fatal cases .
So far , the World Health Organization has reported 148 cases in nine countries .
Obama said the $ 1.5 billion he asked from Congress to help fight the outbreaks will help government health officials monitor and track the virus and replenish the supply of antiviral drugs .
On immigration , Obama said he wants to work with members of Congress , including former Republican presidential rival Sen.
John McCain , to revive efforts to reform the system .
Obama said he hopes lawmakers will begin working on such reform legislation and expects the process to be under way within the year .
Both Obama and McCain supported an ultimately failed plan backed by then - President Bush that would have fined illegal immigrants living in the United States but provided a pathway to citizenship for some .
Obama 's news conference came just hours after both chambers of Congress passed his $ 3.4 trillion budget resolution for fiscal year 2010 .
The measure approves most of Obama 's key spending priorities and sets the federal government in a new direction with major increases for energy , education and health care programs .
Obama said his budget begins to lay a " new foundation " that will strengthen the U.S. economy .
" But even as we clear away the wreckage of this recession , I 've also said that we can't go back to an economy that is built on a pile of sand -- on inflated home prices and maxed - out credit cards ; on overleveraged banks and outdated regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the prosperity of all , " he said .
The United States " will see a better day , " but there 's still a lot of work to do , he said .
" I want to thank the American people for their support and their patience during these trying times , and I look forward to working with you in the next hundred days , in the hundred days after that , all of the hundreds of days to follow , to make sure that this country is what it can be . "

Rahul Gupta , the health department 's director , said the teen died shortly after being showing signs of the flu and visiting her family physician .
Sims was freshman and an honor student at St. Albans High School at the time of her death .
Gupta said Thursday that tests are being conducted to determine if methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria had anything to do with Sims ' death .
" One of the things we have to worry about is MRSA , or the super - bug , " Gupta told the Daily Mail .
" There is no proof at this point that this is what this young lady had .
We 're waiting on future testing . "

A " green tide " swamped the shores of Qingdao in June 2008
Scientists have discovered the source of the gigantic green tide of algae that almost derailed the Beijing Olympics sailing regatta .
The huge algal bloom was triggered by a rapid expansion of farmed seaweed almost 200 km down the coast , satellite images reveal .
The green tide then grew and grew as it moved closer to the regatta city of Qingdao .
At one point , it became the largest ever recorded anywhere in the world .
Initially , the international media and many scientists suggested that excess nutrients ( eutrophication ) in coastal waters caused the algal bloom .
We suspect that the reason the bloom had not occurred previously was that the growth of aquaculture in this region has been so rapid
Dr John Keesing , CSIRO
The new finding , published in Marine Pollution Bulletin , disproves that idea and suggests that similar tides could happen again .
In late June 2008 , the waters and shores at the Qingdao venue hosting the Olympic sailing regatta experienced a massive green tide covering about 600 sq km .
Lasting over two weeks , it took more than 10,000 people to clean up , removing over one million tonnes of algae from the beach and coast .
The algae responsible is called Enteromorpha prolifera .
Satellites saw the algae appearing off Yancheng and moving north
" It 's not a dominant or common species in the local area , " says Dongyan Liu , a marine biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Yantai , Shandong .
" The rapid appearance and sheer scale made us suspect it had accumulated offshore and been transported in . "
E. prolifera pollutes aquaculture farms that grow Porphyra seaweed on semi-floating rafts made of bamboo and net curtain .
The seaweed is mainly sold as food and also grown to prevent eutrophication , as the seaweed takes up nutrients that might otherwise pollute the water , allowing weeds to grow , starving other plants of oxygen .
Photos passed to Liu and John Keesing of the Australian research organisation CSIRO showed the Qingdao green tide contained bamboo poles used in Porphyra aquaculture .
The researchers then spoke to farmers growing the seaweed across the Yellow Sea on the coast of Jianngsu province .
The timing of their harvest suggested the bloom could have originated there .
To investigate further , Liu , Keesing and colleagues examined photos of China 's north - eastern coast taken by instruments on board Nasa 's Terra and Aqua satellites , which view the entire Earth 's surface every one to two days .
On the 15 May 2008 , small green patches of algae , covering around 80 sq km , appeared off the coasts of Yancheng and Lianyungang in Jianngsu province , the images reveal .
The bloom ( in red circles ) grows as it heads towards Qingdao
Within 10 days , these patches had moved away from the coast and into the Yellow Sea , covering 1,200 sq km , and impacting about 40,000 sq km of ocean , making it the largest algal boom , or green tide , ever recorded .
On the 18 June , algae patches began to move towards the coast at Qingdao , landing on the shore on 28 June .
Further satellite data confirmed that the right temperatures , wind speeds and oceanographic conditions existed at the time to favour the rapid growth of the algae , and transport it across the Yellow Sea .
" We suspect that the reason the bloom had not occurred previously was that the growth of aquaculture in this region has been so rapid , " said Keesing .
From 2003 to 2008 , the coastal area used for seaweed aquaculture off the coast of Jianngsu has more than doubled to 23,000 hectares .
" It has now reached a critical size where it has the capacity to produce enough Enteromorpha to cause the problems we saw in 2008 , " the CSIRO researcher said .
To prevent a reoccurrence " we should carefully manage the distribution and production of coastal aquaculture and educate farmers not to discard unwanted Enteromorpha into the water . "

Much backslapping at the Department for Children , Schools and Families whose safe - sex mobile phone drama , Thmbnls , has been shortlisted for a Meffy ( Mobile Entertainment Award ) .
It ought to be gong - worthy , given the series is costing the UK taxpayer more than fifty quid per viewer .
The department has spent 4.6 million nicker on its " Want respect ?
Use a Condom " promotion , the centrepiece of which is a weekly drama sent direct to mobile phones for free .
The government even takes care of the data costs .
It 's that drama that has been shortlisted for the industry award recognising the campaign's " effectiveness " and " quantifiable business benefits " despite the fact that only 5,054 viewers are subscribed to the series which cost more than quarter of a million quid to shoot .
Not that £ 250,000 is the only cash that Thmbnls consumed : the PR agency signed up to promote the series trousered more than that , and we still do n't know how much was spent on the website and assorted other promotional material as it becomes harder to separate out from the larger campaign .
There 's also the cost of distributing the series to subscribers which is n't included - though the project saved money there by keeping viewing figures down .
We reported on the £ 4.6 m budget back in March , at which time we did n't manage to get any kind of breakdown of the campaign costs despite repeated attempts .
That piece so incensed Register reader Dave Gunn that he pursued a Freedom of Information request to find out exactly how many people were subscribed to the drama , and how much cash had been spent making it ; after a bit of a struggle he finally obtained the 5k figure which ( discounting promotion and distribution ) comes down to £ 50 a head .
Want respect - do n't piss away money on Web 2.0 rubbish
Not that the pitch PR agency 20:20 London made to the Mobile Entertainment Forum makes any mention of that - they 'd prefer to concentrate on the tens of thousands of views the YouTube trailer got .
Those figures are real enough , but that makes it all the more remarkable that the following episodes only managed to average about 30 viewings .
Thmbnls does have a Facebook presence , but it only counts 357 fans , while the Twitter channel can only manage 237 followers - the pitch skipped over those details too .
Preventing teenage pregnancies is an important thing , and government money can be well spent that way , but it's hard to see how the makers of Thmbnls can keep a straight face when judged against " Increased brand awareness & statistical evidence " or " Quantifiable business benefits " .
We hope the Meffy judges wo n't be as dazzled by the new technology as the people who approved the budget for the drama no one watched . ®

Billionaire Paul Allen is a Microsoft cofounder , the owner of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the owner of the NBA 's Portland Trailblazers .
And , thanks to the stimulus bill President Obama signed this week , he 's also about to be as much as a billion dollars richer .
Here 's how :
Allen owns a majority stake in cable provider Charter Communications .
Charter Communications this month said it would reduce its debt load by $ 8 billion and enter Chapter 11 .
Normally , partners at a firm like Charter Communications would have to pay taxes on the amount of debt forgiven in this process , which is , in a sense a one - time income windfall .
Tax law calls it a " deemed distribution . "
But under the new bill , companies like Charter Communications will be able to avoid paying taxes on forgiven debt until 2014 .
Even then , Paul will have until 2018 to pay it completely off .
Paul owns about half of Charter , so his share of the Charter Commuincations ' $ 8 billion debt forgiveness is around $ 4 billion .
At a tax rate of 25 % , Allen could avoid paying as much as $ 1 billion in taxes until 2014 , tax expert Robert Willens told the WSJ .
Not clear how a corporate tax benefit would be passed through to Paul 's personal tax payments ?
A reader informs us :
" It 's not a ' corporate tax ' since it 's a partnership rather than a corporation .
The partners pay tax on their share of a partnerships income , which is why partnerships are referred to as " pass - through " entities . "
For what it 's worth , one of Paul 's representatives told the WSJ the billionaire did n't lobby for the windfall .
It just fell into his lap , lucky dog .
So what will Paul do with that money until 2014 ?
Invest it in technology that reduces our dependence on foreign oil and creates new " green collar " jobs for America , per the goals of Obama 's stimulus plan , of course .
Or maybe Paul could buy a new boat !
Here are the two he already owns :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks dropped on Wednesday as rising yields on U.S. government debt fueled concern that businesses and consumers could face higher borrowing costs , which could hamper an economic recovery .

The decline was broad - based , with manufacturer 3M Co MMM.N and International Business Machines Corp IBM.
N among stocks leading a 2 percent fall on the blue - chip Dow .
The S&P and Nasdaq lost more than 1 percent each .
“ Yields are rising to levels that are becoming very worrisome for the economic outlook , ” said William Sullivan , chief economist at JVB Financial Group in Boca Raton , Florida .
Bond prices declined in afternoon trading , causing their yields to rise , as concerns about the heavy supply of debt weighed on the market despite a well - received auction of new five - year notes .
The yield on U.S. Treasuries is a key benchmark for many lending rates .
The Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI fell 173.47 points , or 2.05 percent , to end at 8,300.02 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX was down 17.27 points , or 1.90 percent , at 893.06 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 19.35 points , or 1.11 percent , at 1,731.08 .
The stock market losses follow gains of more than 2 percent in each of the major indexes on Tuesday , when data on consumer confidence stoked optimism about an economy recovery .
Wednesday ’s sell - off in stocks and bonds also surprised some investors as the two tend to move in opposite directions .
Treasuries prices typically fall when investors ’ appetite for riskier assets , such as stocks , increases .
The price of benchmark 10 - year notes was down over 1 - 16/32 and yielding 3.74 percent on Wednesday , up nearly 20 basis points in just one day and over 1.25 percentage points in just six weeks .
Shares of 3 M fell 3.2 percent at $ 56.04 , while shares of IBM lost 2 percent at $ 102.93 , both on the New York Stock Exchange .
Also on the NYSE , shares of General Motors Corp GM.N tumbled 20.1 percent to $ 1.15 as the automaker faced a failed debt exchange , setting the stage for a bankruptcy filing expected by the end of the month .
Semiconductor stocks had kept the Nasdaq in positive territory for much of the day after SanDisk Corp SNDK .
O renewed a chip license with Samsung Electronics 005930 .KS .
Shares of SanDisk rose 14.3 percent to $ 15.52 .
Trading was moderate on the NYSE , with about 1.33 billion shares changing hands , below last year ’s estimated daily average of 1.49 billion , while on Nasdaq , about 2.17 billion shares traded , below last year ’s daily average of 2.28 billion .
Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 7 to 3 , while decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq by about 2 to 1 .
PASSAIC , N.J. ( AP ) 
The body of a 3 - year - old girl has been found in a northern New Jersey river , just hours after police say her uncle left with her and told family members " to watch the 6 o'clock news tonight . "
Passaic police spokesman Andy White says Janiay Rievas was found around 9:30 a.m. Saturday in the Passaic River .
Authorities are still searching for 21 - year - old Juan Mendez , whose abandoned car was found on a bridge over the river .
Mendez had been living with family members in Passaic .
Police say he left with the girl at around 6 a.m .
White says family members told police Mendez " left in a rage and said to watch the 6 o'clock news tonight . "

Yesterday Oprah Winfrey thought she'd be nice and arrange for free KFC grilled chicken for everybody .
Big mistake .
The demand for free fowl has been so overwhelming that many people are having a dickens of a time getting their chickens because the website can't handle all the coupon downloads .
This morning Grub Street compiled some of the more " heart wrenching " comments from thwarted KFC consumers on Oprah 's site , such as " I'M MELTING CAN'T GET THE COUPONS PLEASE IS THERE ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING THEM ????
HUNGRY FOR THE CHIICKEN " and " Nice gesture since I am unemployed and a free dinner would have been nice .
I could not download the coupon . "
And now this harrowing report from the scene of a KFC on 42nd Street between Madison and Park has landed in our inbox :
I went over to our nearest KFC a few minutes ago ... and chaos ensued .
Despite the very visible grilled chicken behind the register , the manager told everyone with coupons to leave and that the promotion was over for the day .
The people there are currently holding a sit-in and refusing to leave until they get their free chicken ... or the cops are called .
Racial epithets were being spewed , people who actually wanted to pay for chicken were facing a potential beatdown , and the manager ran from the screaming horde .
Oprah , what have ye wrought ?
More than a dozen calls placed to the KFC in question have been met with an ominous busy signal .
We can only assume a riot squad is currently cracking skulls to save that last defenseless grilled chicken from the freeloading mob .
Developing ...
UPDATE :
The photo seen here was just sent to us from our source , who returned to the KFC in question but was unable to get inside to assess the situation .
We 're told that " unfortunately the manager is now standing in the entrance and all of the patrons are inside since it 's post - lunch rush . "
We can only assume it 's a bloodbath in there .
Still developing ...

ON APRIL 6 , Carl Joseph Walker - Hoover , distraught from being called " fag , " " girlie , " " gay " and similar names on a daily basis in school , took his own life .
He hung himself with an extension cord in his family 's Springfield , Mass. , home , where he was discovered by his mother , Sirdeaner Walker .
Carl was 11 years old .
He was a football and basketball player in school , a Boy Scout and was active in his church and in putting together a Black history program .
But despite his mother 's weekly pleas to the school Carl attended , New Leadership Charter School , administrators did nothing to stop the taunting .
Sirdeaner found Carl dead just minutes before she was going to confront school authorities again .
Unfortunately , Carl 's case is n't unique .
William and Janis Mohat 's 17 - year - old son Eric was bullied to death at Mentor High School in Mentor , Ohio .
On March 29 , 2007 , Mohat shot himself after relentless harassment and intimidation , which included being pushed , shoved and hit -- not to mention being humiliated by being called a " fag , " a " queer " and a " homo . "
Like Carl , Eric had never shown any interest in homosexuality at all .
Carl Joseph Walker Hoover
In the lawsuit Eric 's parents filed in federal court in March , they said that " a young man told Eric , ' Why do n't you go home and shoot yourself ?
No one would miss you . '
And that 's what he did . "
" When you lose a child like this , it destroys you in ways you can't even describe , " William Mohat told ABC News .
Bully - induced suicides are on the rise , and that trend coincides with an increase over the last five years in the level of viciousness in taunting -- among boys and girls , Summit County Domestic Relations Court community outreach director Sue Tucker told Fox News .
In a 2005 survey by the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) and Harris Interactive , " From Teasing to Torment : School Climate in America , " students said that most of their peers were bullied because of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender expression , which is the second most common reason for bulling behind appearance .
Students said that teachers rarely interfered in cases of gay - related bullying , because they were embarrassed or do n't know what to do , the report showed .
" The truly unfortunate thing is because of the societal atmosphere surrounding gay and lesbian life in the U.S. , administrators are reluctant to act or fail to act , " said GLSEN Executive Director Eliza Byard , who attended Carl 's memorial service .
Gay students report that they are often scared to go to school because of the homophobic culture .
According to the 2005 National School Climate Survey by the GLSEN , nearly one - fifth of LGBT students reported being physically assaulted at school the previous school year because of their sexual orientation , and over one - tenth because of their gender expression .
Suicide is the third leading causes of death among teenagers in general , behind accidents and homicide for ages 15 - 24 , according to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) .
Even more disturbing , suicide is the fourth leading cause of death for children between the ages of 10 and 14 .
Gay teen suicide is shockingly common .
According to a 1999 CDC / Massachusetts Department of Education Youth Risk Behavior Survey , 33 percent of gay youth will attempt suicide .
Many of these kids ' sexuality is unknown , including Carl 's , but no matter .
The pervasiveness of homophobic taunts , the fear that kids -- gay or not -- face in school every day and bullying are inseparable .
And , as they say , it 's easier to kick down than up .
WHEN KIDS bully others because of their sexuality , they are repeating a message that pervades society at large .
What kind of signal , for example , does it send to kids when the government says it 's wrong for two women or two men to get married , or when there is little or no protection for LGBT people in the workplace , in housing and in adoption ?
Some groups such as GLSEN promote LGBT issues by asking school kids not to speak for a day , or as their public service messages say , " Think Before You Speak " to reduce use of the slur " That 's so gay , " which kids understand as derogatory .
Efforts like these may help , but what we really need is more speech against bigotry , more discussion of LGBT issues and more education on why it 's okay to be who you are .
Conrad Honicker of Knoxville , Tenn. , who came out as gay just before his freshman year in high school , told ABC News , " Naturally , I got a lot of teasing , mostly verbal , but it got threatening at one point .
Someone threw a large rock at me .
They missed , but it landed in front of me . "
He survived the verbal abuse that he described as " very graphic " and " like you would treat a woman in a bad , sexualized gratuitous way . "
Bullies also physically attacked him , " squeezing me and kissing my neck . "
Honicker ' responded by forming West High School 's first gay - straight alliance , as well as eight other groups around the school district .
He believes that if these groups are a visible presence in schools , they can thwart the bullying and encourage teachers to act .
Gay - straight alliances are widespread and growing , and see themselves as an army of youth combating anti-gay bigotry .
For example , over 300 high school students are attending LGBT Equality and Justice Day in New York State .
The goal of this day of action is to pressure politicians to give us not only marriage equality , but other demands like transgendered rights bills .
It will also take more action on the national level -- like the passage of Employment Non-Discrimination Act , an end to the military 's policy of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " and federal gay marriage equality -- before the message sinks in that bigotry divides and must be stopped .
" I am determined for the rest of my life to advocate on behalf of students who are voiceless and silent , " Sirdeaner told ABC News .
She has been homeless and a victim of domestic abuse , and is a breast cancer survivor , but , she said , " The one thing we could n't get through was public school . "
It 's hard to imagine what kind of thoughts go through an 11 - year - old child 's head seconds before hanging himself to death .
We can't bring Carl back , but we can honor him and others like him by joining his mom in fighting for the " voiceless and silent " -- by helping those voices come together , grow stronger , loud and proud .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A " furious " President Obama has ordered a review of the decision to fly a Boeing 747 frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday .
Witnesses reported seeing a plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty .
The review will focus on " why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again , " Gibbs said .
Jim Messina , a deputy chief of staff , will lead the effort .
On Tuesday , Obama told reporters , " It was a mistake .
It was something we found out about along with all of you .
And it will not happen again . "
Officials said that when Obama first found out about the incident , he was " furious . "
The incident has led to a large amount of criticism from New Yorkers and politicians .
After a YouTube video showed panicked New Yorkers scrambling as the plane flew frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline , a former Homeland Security adviser questioned whether the man who approved the flyby should remain in his White House office .
Fran Townsend , who advised President George W. Bush for more than three years , called the move " crass insensitivity " in the wake of 9/11 .
" I 'd call this felony stupidity .
This is probably not the right job for Mr. Caldera to be in if he did n't understand the likely reaction of New Yorkers , of the mayor , " Townsend said Tuesday on CNN's " American Morning . "
Louis Caldera , director of the White House Military Office , quickly apologized for Monday 's incident after the planes prompted workers and residents to evacuate buildings in New York and New Jersey .
Watch Townsend slam Caldera »
" Last week , I approved a mission over New York .
I take responsibility for that decision , " Caldera said .
" While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey , it 's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption . "
The Federal Aviation Administration said the aircraft , which functions as Air Force
One when the president is aboard , was taking part in a classified , government - sanctioned photo shoot .
On Tuesday Sen. John McCain wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates saying he was " profoundly disturbed " by the flyover " against the backdrop of September 11 . "
" The supposed mission represents a fundamentally unsound exercise in military judgment and may have constituted an inappropriate use of Department of Defense resources , " McCain , a ranking member of the Senate 's Armed Services Committee , wrote in the letter .
He requested an investigation into the cost of the flyover .
Air Force officials estimate that the mission and the photo shoot for the 747 and an accompanying F - 16 fighter jet cost $ 328,835 .
But they said " the hours would have been flown regardless , and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission . "
An Air Force source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House Military Office planned a photo shoot over various Washington monuments next week , but the shoot has now been canceled .
An angry Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it " defies the imagination " that an agency would schedule the photo shoot so near the site of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center .
Sen . Charles Schumer , D - New York , said the FAA 's decision to not announce the flyby " borders on being either cruel or very , very stupid . "
Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River .
Watch the plane fly over Manhattan »
The YouTube video shows dozens of people standing in a parking lot , watching the plane approach .
As it nears , they begin to run .
Someone unleashes an expletive .
" Run , run ! " says one person .
" Oh my God , " cries another .
A 911 call released by the Hudson County Sheriff 's Department in New Jersey shows the panic caused by the plane .
" There 's a plane falling , there is a big aircraft falling like 9/11 , " a man says to the operator .
" Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking . "
Two officials said the White House Military Office was trying to update its file photos of Air Force One .
Bloomberg said he was perturbed .
Watch the White House apologize »
" I 'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I was n't told , " he said , calling the FAA 's decision to withhold details about the flight " ridiculous " and " poor judgment . "
" Why the Defense Department wanted to do a photo op right around the site of the World Trade Center defies the imagination , " he said .
" Had we known , I would have asked them not to . "
Linda Garcia - Rose , a social worker who counsels post - traumatic stress disorder patients in an office three blocks from where the World Trade Center stood , called the flight an " absolute travesty . "
Watch the White House respond to questions about the scare »
" There was no warning .
It looked like the plane was about to come into us , " she said .
" I 'm a therapist , and I actually had a panic attack . "
Garcia - Rose , who works with nearly two dozen patients ages 15 to 47 , said she was inundated with phone calls from patients .
" They 're traumatized .
They 're asking ' How could this happen ? '
They 're nervous .
Their anxiety levels are high , " she said .
iReport.com :
Tell us what you think
Garcia - Rose said she is considering filing a class - action suit against the government for sanctioning the plane 's unannounced flight .
" I believe the government has done something really wrong , " she said .
Capt .
Anna Carpenter of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland said local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been given notice of the exercise .
New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne said the department had been alerted about the flight " with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it . "
CNN 's Mythili Rao and Ed Henry contributed to this report .

[ Haskell - cafe ] Comments from two weeks of using Leksah
I 've been using the latest and greatest version of leksah for the last couple of weeks and I wanted to give a short report on the things I 've found .
First of all , it 's crashed only once , and the error was an actual segfault , so I 'm not sure what went wrong there .
All in all , I like the eyecandy and have left it on for everything I do , but I 've noticed that arrows have an extra space after them , no matter which arrow .
Also , the candy for =<< and >>= is the same .
Only one " missing feature " that I 've noticed : regex find and replace .
I 'd like very much to be able to find and replace using regexes , as this is pretty much why I keep coming back to vi and emacs .
I really really like the modules pane which gives me quick views into the doc of everything that 's installed and the signatures .
I wonder , though , could it be limited to the packages made available by the dependencies in configuring the current working package ?
That way , it would be easy to tell whether a dependency was missing .
I wonder if there 's a way to setup the preferences so that autocomplete can be accelerator based ( like Ctrl + Space ) instead of constantly on , because I 've noticed that occasionally I 'll hit enter at the end of a line and have it autocorrect my last identifier incorrectly .
It 'd be kind of neat if the error lines from the continuous background build showed up highlighted in the editor in some way , like they do in oh say Eclipse , but that 's just a nice feature .
Only other feature i'd like to see added is the ability to have multiple packages open at once , allow them to depend on each other , and handle configuring , building , and installing each of them be a one - step process .
That 's about it .
For large projects , very neat and very useful !
I like it .

The only surviving suspected gunman in the Mumbai terrorist attacks retracted his confession today , saying it was extracted through coercion .
On the opening day of his trial in Mumbai , a lawyer representing Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab told a special court that he wanted to withdraw the statement , which had been made under duress .
The lawyer , Abbas Kazmi , said : " My client has said he was tortured and that the confession was forced .
He therefore wants to retract it . "
The judge , ML Tahiliyani , said the court would pass an order on the validity of the confession on Saturday .
Prosecutors say Kasab , who sat barefoot in the dock dressed in a full - sleeve T - shirt and navy blue trousers , was one of the gunmen who arrived in Mumbai by sea from Pakistan to carry out the attacks in which 166 people were killed .
The special public prosecutor Ujwal Nikam told the court there was " prima facie evidence " of a criminal conspiracy " hatched in Pakistan to attack India " .
He said at least one Pakistani military officer was involved in the attack and its sophistication suggested the involvement of Pakistan 's intelligence agency .
Kasab , a Pakistani , is charged with 12 criminal counts , including murder and waging war against India .
Prosecutors say Kasab and nine other gunmen who were killed during the siege are responsible for the deaths of 166 people and injuring 304 more .
" There was a criminal conspiracy hatched in Pakistan to attack India , " Nikam said , with the " ultimate target of capturing Jammu and Kashmir , which is part and parcel of India " .
The prosecutor vowed to get to " the root of terror " and said the identity of all those involved would be revealed through the ongoing investigation .
He told the court the attacks in November were masterminded by the Muslim militant group Lashkar - e - Toiba with the help of at least one Pakistani military officer .
Nikam said the plot was made possible by a " terrorist culture " that had taken root in Pakistan .
Lashkar - e- Toiba is widely believed to have been created by Pakistani intelligence agencies in the 1980s to fight Indian rule in Kashmir .
The Himalayan region of Kashmir , which is divided between India and Pakistani but claimed by both , has long been at the centre of bitterness between the two countries .
Pakistani officials have acknowledged that the Mumbai attacks were partly plotted on their soil and announced criminal proceedings against eight suspects .
They have acknowledged that Kasab is Pakistani but have repeatedly denied any involvement by their intelligence agencies in the atrocity .
Kasab's two co-defendants , Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed , are Indian nationals charged with helping to plot the attacks .
Their lawyer maintains that they are innocent .
Court officials have said they hope the case will be finished in six months to a year .
The trial for India 's deadliest terror attack , the 1993 Mumbai bombings that killed 257 people , took 14 years to complete .

Photos from Tehran showed fruit marked " Israel " A twist has emerged in the story of Israeli citrus fruit reportedly sold in Iran in defiance of a ban on commercial dealings between the two enemy states .
It has now been revealed the fruit , a type of orange - grapefruit hybrid marketed as Jaffa Sweetie , were not Israeli in the first place .
The Sweeties were brought to Iran from China , where faking the origin of goods is a common practice .
The discovery of apparent Israeli origin caused a stir in Iran .
Outrage followed , distribution centres stocking the fruit were sealed and accusations were traded .
Such is the infamy of dealing with Israel that an Iranian official went so far as to accuse the opposition of a " citrus plot " .
However , Tal Amit , the general manager of Israel 's Citrus Marketing Board , told the BBC the fruit had not originated in his country .
Prestigious fruit " First of all , it 's a bit annoying that somebody is using our brand name and registered trademark without our permission , " he said .
The fruit was packed in boxes marked " Origin China " " Apart from this , I would like very much the Iranian people to eat Israeli fruit straight from the origin and not via China .
" But the politics is not allowing us to do any commercial relations with Tehran at the moment while back 30 to 40 years ago , Tehran was a superb market for our fruit . "
The genuine Israeli Sweetie is primarily exported to the Far East 's richest markets , Japan and South Korea .
That could explain the prestige of the fruit in the eyes of Chinese exporters and the temptation to counterfeit it .
It is not the first time , however , that citrus fruit have found themselves at the heart of an international political row .
Back in the 1980s , as the most visible of South Africa 's consumer exports , oranges became the key target of anti-Apartheid boycott campaigns .

IF AMERICA'S two beleaguered carmakers , General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler , had harboured the hope that Barack Obama would prove a soft touch , any such illusion has been robustly dispelled .
When the news leaked on March 29th that Rick Wagoner , GM 's chief executive for nine years , had been told to step down by the president 's auto task - force in favour of his number two , Fritz Henderson ( pictured ) , there was little doubt that more unpleasant medicine was on the way .
So it proved .
The next day the task - force gave its analysis of the “ viability plans ” the two firms had submitted in February as a condition of the $ 17.4 billion emergency - loan package agreed on December 31st ( $ 13.4 billion for GM , $ 4 billion for the much smaller Chrysler ) .
Its verdict on both plans was damning ; its threat that bankruptcy , albeit of a “ quick and surgical kind ” , could still be the best option , was unambiguous .
Although GM was given some credit for restructuring its business in recent years , the task - force concluded that progress had been far too slow , and that something much more thorough than GM 's management and key stakeholders seemed willing to contemplate was needed .
Furthermore , the assumptions on which GM was basing its plans were a good deal too rosy and left uncomfortably little margin for error .
The task - force identified six areas where it found GM to be over - optimistic or in denial : domestic market share , which it expects to contract by only 0.3 percentage points a year after 30 years of falling by 0.7 points ; pricing in a collapsing market which still doubts the quality of GM 's products ; the drag of underperforming dealers ; the consequences of the failure of GM's European arm to secure outside investment or government support ; a weakening product mix as consumer tastes and tighter fuel - economy rules eat into sales of high - margin trucks and sport- utility vehicles ; and legacy health - care and pension liabilities that will reach $ 6 billion a year by 2013 , forcing GM to maximise volume rather than return on investment .
But GM can take one quite substantial crumb of comfort from this otherwise bleak assessment :
Mr Obama 's team reckons that if it can shove the company , its unions and its bondholders into taking more drastic and painful action , a healthy business could yet emerge .
GM has started making some good , desirable cars in efficient , flexible factories .
Critically , GM also has the scale , technology and reach that a capital - intensive , highly competitive global industry demands .
None of this , unfortunately , applies to Chrysler .
On just about every count , the task - force sees Chrysler as a basket - case .
Saddled with out - of - date factories , over - reliance on the North American market and unfashionable trucks , a poor reputation for quality , a dearth of new models in the pipeline and insufficient resources to fund future power - train development , Chrysler is too weak and too small to survive on its own .
Chrysler 's only hope , Mr Obama said on March 30th , is to consummate the deal it has been discussing since January with Fiat .
The Italian firm would supply it with “ cutting - edge technology ” in the form of fuel - efficient engines , small - car platforms and factory automation .
In return , Fiat had expected a 35 % stake in Chrysler , a strong base from which to buy the rest of the company should it so wish , as well as a manufacturing and distribution base in America .
In negotiations held in March between Steven Rattner , the investment banker who leads the task - force , and Sergio Marchionne , Fiat 's boss , Fiat agreed to scale back its initial stake to 20 % and not to increase it beyond 49 % until Chrysler had repaid American taxpayers in full .
Chrysler now has until the end of April to get the deal done .
Meanwhile the government will continue to supply it with working capital .
Mr Obama says he will “ consider ” lending the firm a further $ 6 billion if it can construct a credible plan with Fiat .
But can it ?
Mr Marchionne is adamant that Fiat will not put any of its own much - needed cash at risk , and the Fiat team that has been carrying out due diligence on Chrysler thinks it will be two years before the American firm will feel real benefit from the partnership .
Given that Chrysler has spent most , if not all , of the $ 4 billion it received in January , it is hard to see how $ 6 billion will take it through to 2011 .
The government says that if Chrysler is to survive alongside Fiat it will require “ at a minimum … extinguishing the vast majority of Chrysler 's outstanding secured debt [ about $ 9 billion ] and all its unsecured debt and equity . ”
Cerberus Capital Management , the private - equity firm that acquired an 80 % stake in Chrysler in August 2007 , seems resigned to surrendering its equity , and the banks that hold unsecured debt are also in a weak position .
But the senior debt holders may decide that they will fare better if Chrysler files for bankruptcy and they can make a grab for whatever sellable assets are left .
The outlines of GM 's future are not much clearer , but at least it seems to have one .
“ We cannot , we must not , and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish , ” Mr Obama said this week .
That does not , however , mean that GM will necessarily avoid bankruptcy , as Mr Henderson acknowledged .
In a marked change of tone from the old regime , of which he was a part , Mr Henderson said he was prepared to do whatever was necessary to reorganise GM — including making a trip to the bankruptcy court if agreements could not be reached with bondholders and the United Auto Workers union to slash more than $ 50 billion of liabilities .
Mr Obama has given Mr Henderson 60 days ( and sufficient working capital ) to bang heads together and drive through other changes .
Above all , the task - force will want to see evidence that GM can repair its balance - sheet and become capable of generating positive free cashflow in a car market somewhat bigger than today's , but smaller than in the past .
There is , however , a growing belief that the best way to achieve that may be a “ quick rinse ” bankruptcy reorganisation which separates a new , lean and mean GM from an old GM that holds legacy health - care obligations , dud brands and unwanted factories .
Supposedly , the former would swiftly fly free , while the latter would remain in bankruptcy and be slowly wound down .
In practice , nothing is likely to be that neat .
The only certainty is that even though GM has a new boss , the government is really in control .
The Kombi Konvoy - a parade of the VW hippie mobiles winds its way into Nimbin after travelling from Byron Bay via Lismore .
Definitely worth a look , even if you are n't a car buff .
The Hemp Olympix - who would have thought bong throwing or joint rolling was considered a sport ?
The Harvest Ball in Peace Park .
The main drawcard - the Cannabis Law Reform Parade - complete with Ganja Faeries , percussionists , floats and the giant joint .
YOU'D be forgiven for thinking Nimbin was the place time forgot .
Located in the foothills of an extinct volcano , this sub-tropical village is a piece of hippie heritage left over from the 1973 Age of Aquarius festival .
While the Age of Aquarius has physically gone , its spirit remains alive and well , attracting thousands of tourists who want to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and sink into the blissful peace and tranquility that Nimbin offers .
But for one weekend in May , Nimbin transforms into a colourful and crowded metropolis , as people arrive to take part in the annual MardiGrass Festival MardiGrass is basically a peaceful rally for cannabis law reform .
Supporters for the legalisation of cannabis are fighting for it to be recognised as a substance that can be used medicinally , as a food source , an environmentally - friendly fibre or as a potential fuel source .
The festival starts on Friday , May 1 , 2009 .
This is the day to get to the Nimbin Town Hall to purchase your pass and establish your camping digs for the weekend ( or other accommodation ) .
The main festivities start at 4.20 am on the Saturday morning and continue through until Sunday , May 3 at around 11 pm - midnight .
While the township itself is kid friendly , it 's advised not to take children .
Yes , there are the local children around , but as there will be activities like the passing of the giant joint and the Hemp Olympix ; it 's probably best to leave the kids at home .
This festival is really more for people aged 18 years and over .
Whether you 're participating in MardiGrass or simply seeing what the fuss is about ; MardiGrass has something for most tastes , with live music , poetry readings , information sessions and street entertainment .
There 's a host of feature events which include :
The official Nimbin MardiGrass website has an in - depth list of all the events that are happening over the two days , and is definitely worth looking at before you go .
Up until recently , MardiGrass was a free event .
However , like many events , it now comes at a price .
For $ 50 , you can get a full MardiGrass pass for one person .
This includes two nights at the A&I Showground campsite ( tents not included ) .
Should you come to the campsite earlier than the pass allows , additional nights can be purchased for $ 10 per night .
Full weekend passes to MardiGrass without camping are $ 30 per person .
Saturday - only passes are $ 20 and Sunday - only passes are $ 10 .
These passes allow you to everything except the Cannabis Cup .
View Nimbin , NSW in a larger mapFrom Brisbane , Nimbin is around 180 km to the south .
The closest town centres are Lismore and Mullumbimby , with Byron Bay a little further out .
No matter if you 're driving from the north or south , there are a few ways to get to Nimbin .
However , the easiest ( and least confusing ) is to follow the highway and the signs to Lismore .
When you reach Lismore 's town centre , find your way to Woodlark Street ( it'll be the one with the massive Christmas tree on the roundabout ) , head over Fawcett 's Bridge and keep following the signs to Nimbin .
If you do n't have a car , there are plenty of bus services that will get you to Lismore .
Your best bets are Premier Motor Service or Greyhound Coaches From Lismore , Waller 's Bus Company is the only one with a service .
Just note that MardiGrass does n't fall within school holiday time .
As a result - you will be travelling on a bus full of children from ages 5 through to 18 .
For more information , their timetable can be found here .
You can also contact them on ( 02 ) 6622 6266 or on mobile - 0428 255 284 .
For those living in Brisbane , a company called Green Triangle operate a service that runs to Nimbin .
However - its transportation times are limited , so you 'll have to check online or give them a call on 1800 503 475 .
Depending on your budget , there is everything from farm stays , bed and breakfasts , hostels and small hotels to camping .
The MardiGrass $ 50 pass entitles you to two nights camping at the A&I Showgrounds in Nimbin , but there are other options .
The best way to find them is to hop onto Roamfree.com and check out what deals are available .
Alternatively , you can also check out the official Nimbin MardiGrass website which offers some accommodation ideas for all tastes .
Be quick to book though , as places will sell out fast .
The short answer ?
No .
Granted there is a giant joint passed around during the procession , be aware that police still monitor the crowds during MardiGrass , and if you 're caught - you 're liable to end up in jail or charged with a drug offence .
Nimbin locals are also not pro-hard drugs ( ecstasy , heroin and other chemical substances ) , so both the police and the locals will look down on anybody seen with these items .
The police will also arrest and charge you with drug use should you be found with any illegal substances .
Also be aware that police keep a sharp eye on all roads leading to and from Nimbin , so if you 're heading to or coming from that direction - be ready to have your car and your body searched , as well as having to undergo possible drug and alcohol checks .
While this may be a rally for cannabis law reform , you must remember that drugs are still very much illegal - so to the MardiGrass participant who is thinking they want to have a good time - beware !
Apart from packing the tent , a sleeping bag , clothes and food - you should get yourself ready for an experience you 'll never forget .
On a normal day , Nimbin is an unusual place to visit because it feels like you 're still in the 1970s ; yet while it 's laidback , the village is also home to a vibrant artistic community and one that 's close to nature .
The MardiGrass Festival adds that little bit of eccentricity to the village , and has raised its profile .
Apart from the festival , there 's amazing scenery around Nimbin , with the Nightcap National Park only minutes away ( and well worth a day of exploration ) .
There are also other villages well worth a look and the scenic drives are breathtaking .
So why ponder any longer ?
Start making plans and putting in your holidays for the Nimbin MardiGrass and experience it yourself .

WITH unemployment rising and the financial system in shambles , it ’s hard not to feel negative about the economy right now .
The answer to our problems , however , could well be more negativity .
But I ’m not talking about attitude .
I ‘m talking about numbers .
Let ’s start with the basics :
What is the best way for an economy to escape a recession ?
Until recently , most economists relied on monetary policy .
Recessions result from an insufficient demand for goods and services  and so , the thinking goes , our central bank can remedy this deficiency by cutting interest rates .
Lower interest rates encourage households and businesses to borrow and spend .
More spending means more demand for goods and services , which leads to greater employment for workers to meet that demand .
The problem today , it seems , is that the Federal Reserve has done just about as much interest rate cutting as it can .
Its target for the federal funds rate is about zero , so it has turned to other tools , such as buying longer - term debt securities , to get the economy going again .
But the efficacy of those tools is uncertain , and there are risks associated with them .
In many ways today , the Fed is in uncharted waters .
So why should n’t the Fed just keep cutting interest rates ?
Why not lower the target interest rate to , say , negative 3 percent ?
It may have been the most expensive game of rock , paper , scissors ever played .
Takashi Hashiyama , president of Maspro Denkoh Corporation , an electronics company based outside of Nagoya , Japan , could not decide whether Christie 's or Sotheby 's should sell the company 's art collection , which is worth more than $ 20 million , at next week 's auctions in New York .
He did not split the collection -- which includes an important Cézanne landscape , an early Picasso street scene and a rare van Gogh view from the artist 's Paris apartment -- between the two houses , as sometimes happens .
Nor did he decide to abandon the auction process and sell the paintings through a private dealer .
Instead , he resorted to an ancient method of decision - making that has been time - tested on playgrounds around the world : rock breaks scissors , scissors cuts paper , paper smothers rock .
In Japan , resorting to such games of chance is not unusual .
" I sometimes use such methods when I cannot make a decision , " Mr. Hashiyama said in a telephone interview .
" As both companies were equally good and I just could not choose one , I asked them to please decide between themselves and suggested to use such methods as rock , paper , scissors . "
