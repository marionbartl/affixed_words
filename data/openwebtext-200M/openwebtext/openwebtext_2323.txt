The Dainese Airstream Course D - Nect ( left ) and the Nolan N102 N - Com . *
Photo : Thomas Hannich * Riding a motorcycle while talking on the phone is just plain dumb .
But if you really must take that call , Mr. President , please consider a Bluetooth helmet .
Some connected headgear can even tie in to your GPS and MP3 player , pausing tunes for directions on long trips .
Might we suggest " Freebird " ?
Nolan N102 N - Com
$ 740
Every new N102 works with Nolan 's N - Com connection kits , so if you 're not ready to ride into debt , you can get the base helmet for $ 350 and add Bluetooth when the next paycheck rolls through town .
Modular models like this — where the entire front flips up to expose your face — are in vogue only with the AARP set , but as the demographic profile of the classic Cadillac owner proves , old men know how to live it up :
This incredibly nerdy brain bucket is also incredibly comfortable and incredibly capable .
Wired : More hookups than JDate : Bluetooth , intercom , even a 3.5 - mm jack for your iPod.
Quick - release chin strap is mega - convenient .
Flip - front easily accommodates bifocals .
Volume control .
Tough paint hides scratches well .
Can I get this Geordi La Forge - style flip - down sunshade installed on my skull ?
Tired : Noisy , but all modulars are .
Microphone boom requires constant relocation when taking the helmet on and off — and apparently makes you sound like you 're trying to eat it .
Ca n't we get some Bluetooth stereo ?
Fulfills its destiny as the Winnebago of the helmet world by being one of the largest headpieces on the road .
Garmin Zumo 550
$ 964 , garmin.com
The fullest - featured , most motocentric GPS on the market , the Zumo 550 can do it all : MP3 player , Bluetooth integration with your cell phone , traffic monitoring ( optional ) , satellite radio ( optional ) , and many other functions to explore before you hit the road .
It 's also water - resistant , so if you 're brave enough to ride in a deluge , your GPS will be there to guide you , turn by slippery turn .
Wired : Left - hand - mounted hard buttons give quick access to zoom , volume , and ... uh ... " square " ?
( It 's the compass . )
More mounting options than a [ bleeep ! ] : brackets for your car and bike , plus the wiring for both .
Tired :
Text - entry screen is alphabetical instead of QWERTY , which is just A - B - C - Dumb .
Battery life tops out at about two hours .
Optional features can rack up quite a bill — and the Zumo is already expensive .
Dainese Airstream Course D- Nect
$ 599 , dainese.com
The Airstream Course is Dainese 's premier skull shield , sharing its shell with the models pro racers use ; the D - Nect version adds Bluetooth .
Despite it having fewer connectivity options than the Nolan , we found ourselves grabbing the Airstream more often .
Why ?
It 's simply better at its primary job : motorcycle helmet .
It 's lightweight , comfortable , and quiet .
No , it wo n't jack into your MP3 player , and yes , the interface is maddening — but after a few hours in this composite sanctuary , we really did n't feel the need to call anyone to complain .
Wired : Gorgeous lines draw more compliments than a playoff ring .
Outstanding ventilation and polystyrene foam liner keep your head cool — until someone cuts you off .
Top - mounted spoiler stabilizes your noggin at speed .
1-900 operators reported excellent sound quality .
Rear reflective patch makes up for the too - stealthy matte paint job .
Tired : Limited techno- functions :
All it does is pair with your cell phone or GPS .
One - button interface responds only to Dainese 's Morse Code-ish tap - language .
Available in any color you like , so long as it's black .

Although there are still some conflicting stories about how the ever - popular cupcake came about , it ’s generally agreed that they got their name by the method they were made :
One cup of butter , two cups of sugar , three cups of four , and so on , all in nice even cup - based measures .
Eventually , it seems like younger generations that have become removed from the baking process only saw the product , and assumed that they were named because they were all baked in little cups , thus their small size and shape .
These days , most people just think of cupcakes as miniature cakes , and not much more .
If you ask me , the cupcake still has a bit more evolving to do , and the next step is pretty clear , is n’t it ?
Naturally , it only makes sense that they become literal cups made out of cake !
Browsing through a quirky little junk store , a pile of silicon ice cube trays and various molds caught my eye , and I dug in , thinking of the adorable frozen shapes I might plop into cold drinks .
However , it was the shot glass mold that grabbed my attention , and after confirming that it was oven safe up to about 500 degrees , I began scheming my grand cupcake plan .
Going with nontraditional Asian flavors , I whipped up a quick matcha - flavored batter , pouring it into the molds and placing a sheet pan underneath just for insurance .
As predicted , it did bubble up but not over , and so the mushroomed ends simply needed a trim once cooled .
The tricky part came when it was time to remove them .
Despite a liberal spray of cooking oil with flour , those cakes refused to loosen their grip on the silicon , and my first victim tore horrifically .
Thinking on my toes , I tossed the remaining cups into the freezer , forgot about them for a few hours , and was able to take them out intact once fully frozen .
Filled to the brim with sweet adzuki bean mousse , the presentation was almost as good as the taste !
This is one format that the frosting - lovers among us would adore , since the deep pocket allows for far more filling than any standard cupcake .
While it may take a bit more effort to make , this latest evolution of the cupcake might be it ’s most impressive yet .
I wo n’t tell if you just use this mousse in any old cake though , since it ’s far too good to be contained to just one type of baked good !
Adzuki Bean Mousse
2 Cups Cooked Adzuki Beans
6 Ounces ( 1/2 Package ) Firm Silken Tofu
1/4 Cup Plain Soymilk
1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
1/2 Cup Dark Brown Sugar , Packed
1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar
2 Tablespoons Instant Clear Gel
Toss your cooked beans and tofu into a food processor or blender , and crank up the power .
Once the mixture is mostly pureed and there are no more chunks of tofu remaining , add in the soymilk and vanilla , and pulse to combine .
In a separate bowl , mix together both sugars and the instant clear gel , and slowly sift these dry ingredients into your machine while the motor is running .
Once fully incorporated , continue blending for a minute or two to dissolve the sugar , scraping down the sides as needed , until the mixture feels mostly smooth and slightly thickened .
Pipe into or on top of cupcakes , or eat with a spoon -
Those beans make it much healthier than your average mousse , after all !

A very brief article to explain what 's happening in the world of MooTools , and provide users with some links so they can get further information if they feel they need it .
So , what the heck is going on
Recently , a few users have been concerned that newcomers to MooTools might not easily be able to find their way around the MooTools community .
As one of the developers , I kind of disagree , but there is one thing I think we all agree on ;
It probably would n't hurt for us to communicate with everyone a little better . ;)
Along with the 1.2 release , we 've changed up the site and moved away from SVN development .
We 've also removed Trac and the official forum in exchange for GitHub , Lighthouse , Google Groups , and other MooTools user maintained forum solutions .
There is a ton of reasoning behind all the outsourcing and changes ( including the simpler site , removal of the forums , switch to git development , etc ) and if you like , you can read more about them ...
Is anyone actually writing any code ?
Currently , we are working on getting the 1.2.1 release out as soon as possible .
It focuses on bug fixes to some of the most important core components and documentation errata , ( including a hack - less Class.js with returned Safari 2 support , sorry about that by the way ! )
Expect this release within the next few weeks .
Post 1.2.1 , we will be simultaneously working on 1.2.x and 1.3 .
Any 1.2.x releases after 1.2.1 will focus on ' core ' and ' more ' bug fixes and maybe a few minor ' more ' enhancements .
As for 1.3 , I do n't want to promise to much yet because we are n't yet sure what will make it in , but just know that we have some really exciting things in store for this release ! :D
I wish there was a book about MooTools
There is !
Check out Aaron 's new book , MooTools Essentials .
More information is available over at his MooTorial and here are some direct links to both the PDF and the Paper Back .
I bought the book early and I think it 's a really excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn the ins and outs of MooTools , and how to get the most out of it .
PS : pages 94 - 95 are some of my favorites ; ) .
Conclusion ?
Sure , why not ...
I encourage everyone to participate with and contribute to the community as much as possible .
I really like the Google Group and think the wiki on GitHub has a lot of potential to be a real nice tool for users .
Also check out and contribute to the unofficial forum .
( Thanks for all your hard work over there guys ) .
Here are some links :
I must have missed something ...
If you feel you need more information on something , or I was n't clear enough on something else , let me know in the comments , otherwise , please let me get back to work !
( on both MooTools , and my real job .
Yes , believe it or not , the developers actually need to have real jobs too ! )
ciao for now ...

I think this is McCain 's key problem right now .
Here 's a sample of some recent poll data .
First , Obama 's net favorability is through the roof .
Rasmussen has him at +13 , Hotline / Diageo at +14 , but others like Fox and ABC News have it at something larger than +25 .
Second , most of the public polls give a sense of how the country views the candidates , and these show Obama doing very well .
An overview :
- Hotline / Diageo has shown McCain 's advantage on " who 's most prepared to lead " vary between 3 and 8 points this week .
On a question so crucial to the central logic of the McCain candidacy , this is no advantage at all .
- ABC News / WaPo shows that Obama has a +14 advantage over McCain on who 's the " stronger leader . "
Obama has a +3 advantage on who would better handle an " unexpected major crisis . "
- Fox asks an interesting question .
If you had to make the " toughest decision " in your life , who would you go to ?
A month ago , McCain had a 16 - point advantage .
Now , it 's - 1 .
Fox also shows Obama with a + 7 advantage on who has " better judgment . "
These numbers are horrible for McCain .
All of them speak to core qualities we expect a President to possess - not to mention the central premises of the McCain candidacy .
Strong leader , able to handle a major crisis , somebody you 'd go to for the toughest decision in your life because you know he has good judgment .
Right now , that man is Barack Obama - not John McCain .
This is a clear indication to me that , as of today , the country is comfortable with the idea of Obama as President .
If it remains comfortable with that idea come Election Day , he will win .
This is an extraordinary turnaround .
I know there is a lot of disagreement over why this has occurred .
My opinion is that something like this is what happens when a major economic event fundamentally favors one candidate over the other , which is exactly what we have seen .
This is a banking crisis that started at the end of an unpopular Republican administration .
It 's not surprising that the public 's opinion of the Democratic challenger has significantly improved .
Through their actions , both candidates have probably reinforced the dynamic - but those actions were largely induced by that crisis .
It 's easy to look cool , calm , and collected when you have the wind at your back ; it 's much harder when it 's blowing in your face .
McCain 's job over the next three weeks is to change this perception .
If he is to have any chance of victory in an anti-Republican year like this , he needs to be seen as the one " ready to lead " and Obama " unready . "
Generally speaking , there are three ways to do this .
First , he can make himself look more presidential ; second , he can make Obama look less so ; third , he can employ a combination of the two .
The third way is ideal , and has been done in the past .
Bill Clinton did it in 1992 and 1996 ; George W. Bush did it in 2004 .
However , despite its many attempts over the last few weeks , the McCain campaign has not hit upon a strategy that does this .

Farm workers use a forklift to unload boxes of pumpkins coming in from the fields at the Will - O - Bett Farm East Berwick , Pa. , Tuesday afternoon , Oct. 14 .
2008 , before they are stacked and loaded onto trucks for shipping up and down the east coast from the Carolinas to Massachusetts .
Each box contains 40 pumpkins and the farm has been picking this year 's crop for the past six weeks .

Until she was 11 months old , Aleanie Remy - Marquez could have starred in an advertisement for breast milk .
She took to nursing easily , was breast - fed exclusively for six or seven months , and ate little else even after that .
She was alert and precocious and developed at astonishing speed , her mother said , sitting at four months and walking by eight months .
But once Aleanie started putting weight on her feet , her mother noticed that her legs were curving in a bow shape below the knees .
Doctors diagnosed vitamin D - deficiency rickets , a softening of the bones that develops when children do not get enough of the hormone form of vitamin D  a crucial ingredient for absorbing calcium and building bone , and the one critical nutrient that breast milk often cannot provide enough of .
“ I thought I was doing the best thing for her , ” said Stephanie Remy - Marquez , of Hyde Park , Mass. , after blood tests showed her daughter had no detectable vitamin D. X - ray images of the baby ’s wrists and knees showed the edges of the bones and growth plates as blurry and fraying instead of crisp and sharp .
“ Breast milk is supposed to be an entire meal , dessert and drinks included , ” Ms. Remy - Marquez said .
“ I thought it was the ultimate cocktail . ”
Most site admins go about their business in secret , which makes it difficult for enthusiastic outsiders to make the leap from user to site owner , since they can't get the benefit of the accrued knowledge of others .
Now that has changed with TorrentFries - a unique website demystifying the running of a tracker .
CurlyFries has been running a tracker for around two years .
His site is called ‘ TorrentFries ’ and already you ’re reading this saying “ Who ?
I ’ve never heard of this site ? ” and quite rightly so .
Although CurlyFries is a real site admin ( as are his pair of co-admins ) , for security reasons they ’re using pseudonyms .
CurlyFries describes himself as idealistic and unmotivated , OnionRings is a general Linux and security geek , while Ketchup is “ the only one that is n’t too lazy busy to deal with the finances and research . ”
TorrentFries is the codename for a medium - sized tracker that thousands are using right now , and the inspiration behind a brand new site which is a must - read for potential tracker owners of the future .
The TorrentFries blog is a unique insight into the inner-workings of running a tracker , via a retrospective look at the actual developments in the two year lifespan of a real - life site .
“ We need more trackers out there , and it ’s up to you to make them , ” says Curly Fries .
“ So , learn from my mistakes and the things I ’ve accidentally done right and you ’ll do just fine . ”
The first post on TorrentFries sets the scene and provides some of the background , with further posts covering many aspects of running a BitTorrent tracker .
From conception , to choosing the right software , staff management , contingency plans , finance , and techniques for getting traffic to the site .
Further updates are promised at regular intervals .
TorrentFreak caught up with CurlyFries who told us : “ I think it ’s something that the torrent community has needed for a while . ”
Indeed , the site truly is unique and a very interesting read , invaluable for anyone looking to expand their knowledge before taking the plunge into tracker ownership .
Torrent Freak spoke with someone taking his first steps as a site admin and asked him what he thought of the site : “ I ’m pleased to see this blog .
I ’ve lurked on the TBDev site for a while but found it a bit intimidating and felt embarrassed of my noob - ness so I ’m happy to get these tips . ”
CurlyFries is promising an update every 5 days to the site , until he runs out of things to say .
4 Weather Libraries for Ruby and Rails Developers
By Peter Cooper
Want to retrieve weather conditions in your Ruby script / application ?
There are four great solutions : WeatherMan , RWeather , rubyweather , and the Yahoo Weather Ruby API .
RWeather
RWeather , by Carlos Kozuszko , is a Ruby wrapper for the Weather XML data feed from The Weather Channel 's weather .com .
Carlos has put together a basic tutorial / overview of the library 's use .
Currently it has two main features : searching for locations , and then retrieving the current weather for locations of your choice .
It 's a nice , simple library .
WeatherMan
WeatherMan , by Jared Pace , goes a little deeper than RWeather .
Jared wanted to add the ability to retrieve forecasts to RWeather , but upon finding no easy way to integrate it with RWeather 's structure , he decided to produce WeatherMan instead ( also his first ever gem release ! ) .
Jared says :
WeatherMan implements most of the weather .com XML API .
It it based in part on RWeather but adds some functionality and is structured slightly differently .
With it you can search for locations , get current conditions and forecasts for a location , and access the promotional links that weather .com asks you to display when using the API .
WeatherMan requires the installation of the xml - simple gem beforehand , but otherwise generally appears to offer a much wider range of features than RWeather .
Jared 's example code samples are compelling in their power and simplicity .
rubyweather
rubyweather is a lot older than WeatherMan but offers some of the same functionality .
As with RWeather and WeatherMan , it uses Weather .com 's data .
Full documentation is available at http://rubyweather.rubyforge.org/
Yahoo !
Weather API
Want to get weather from a source that is n't weather.com ( as with the three libraries above ) ?
Yahoo ! has an option .
yahoo - weather provides an object - oriented interface to the Yahoo !
Weather XML RSS feed .
You can quickly install with gem install yahoo - weather and the code examples given within the official documentation will get you up and running in no time .
I find the simplicity of Yahoo's offering very attractive , and you do n't need to be signed up or registered in any way - you can get going in as long as it takes to copy and paste some code !

Are Ex-Smokers Even More Likely to Gain Weight Than Previously Thought ?
We ’ve blogged several times here about the rise in American obesity and its various causes .
From one of those earlier posts :
Why has the U.S. obesity rate risen so much ?
Many , many answers to this question have been offered , most of them having to do with changes in diet and lifestyle ( and , to some degree , the changing definition of “ obese ” ) .
There is an interesting paper by the economists Shin - Yi Chou , Michael Grossman , and Henry Saffer that sorts through many factors ( including per capita number of restaurants , portion sizes and prices , etc. ) and concludes — not surprisingly — that the spike in obesity mostly has to do with the widespread availability of very cheap , very tasty , very abundant food .
They also find that a widespread decline in cigarette smoking has helped drive the obesity rate .
This seems very sensible , since nicotine is both a stimulant ( which helps burn calories ) and an appetite suppressant .
But Jonathan Gruber and Michael Frakes have written a paper that calls into doubt whether a decrease in smoking indeed causes weight gain .
So does smoking less lead to weight gain or does n’t it ?
A new paper ( gated ) in the International Journal of Obesity argues that not only does smoking less lead to weight gain , but that the effects have to this date been underestimated — primarily because , as Michael Finke , one of the authors , explains , “ smokers are not like nonsmokers . ”
From the introduction of their paper :
Adult obesity rates in the United States have increased by more than 50 percent , whereas tobacco use among adults decreased by about 44 percent since 1970 .
There is strong evidence that smoking is inversely related to body mass index ( B.M.I. ) .
However , smokers tend to consume diets that are higher in fat and lower in nutritional quality than nonsmokers .
Smoking and unhealthy diet choice may reflect a preference for the present consumption .
Smokers appear to exhibit a higher rate of time preference through myopic decision - making in multiple domains .
If smokers are more present - oriented , and if activities such as healthy diet and exercise require placing a greater value on future well - being , it is possible that the past estimates of the relation between smoking and B.M.I. suffer from an omitted variable bias .
This study attempts to correct this bias by including time preference through the use of a composite index of behaviors that reflect a preference for either future or present well - being .
This argument has a lot in common with several arguments we put forth in Freakonomics : that the kind of person more likely to do X is also more likely to do Y .
Humanists may find this unsettling : it is perhaps more comforting to think that our individual choices are , well , individual .
But the empirical evidence continues to point in the other direction .

Despite laws that punish marijuana cultivation more strictly than murder in some states , Americans spend more on illegal drugs than on cigarettes .
And despite official disapproval of pornography , the US leads the world in export of explicit sex videos , according to Reefer Madness : Sex , Drugs and Cheap Labour in the American Black Market , by Eric Schlosser .
Although the official American economy has been suffering a downturn , the shadow economy is enjoying unprecedented levels of success , much in the way that the prohibition period fuelled the illegal markets in the 30s .
Schlosser found that three specific industries accounted for a major portion of this boom .
No aspect of farming has grown faster in the US over the past three decades than marijuana , with one - third of the public over the age of 12 having smoked the drug .
While the nation 's largest legal cash crop , maize , produces about $ 19bn ( £ 11.9 bn ) in revenue , " plausible " estimates for the value of marijuana crops reach $ 25 bn .
Steve
White , a former coordinator for the US drug enforcement administration 's cannabis eradication programme , estimates that the drug is now the country 's largest cash crop .
Marijuana Belt
Schlosser writes : " Although popular stereotypes depict marijuana growers as ageing hippies in northern California or Hawaii , the majority of the marijuana now cultivated domestically is being grown in the nation 's mid-section - a swath running from the Appalachians west to the Great Plains .
Throughout this Marijuana
Belt drug fortunes are being made by farmers who often seem to have stepped from a page of the old Saturday Evening Post . "
Some of the most expensive crops are grown indoors on the west coast using advanced scientific techniques but the American heartlands account for the largest volume .
Some estimates suggest 3 million Americans grow marijuana , although mostly for their own or their friends ' use , but between 100,000 and 200,000 are believed to do so for a living .
The laws against the drug are strict .
There were 724,000 people arrested for marijuana offences in 2001 and about 50,000 are in prison .
Commercial growers can serve sentences far longer than those for murder , but the high risks appear to have had little effect on production or availability : 89 % of secondary school students surveyed indicated that they could easily obtain the drug .
The annual number of hardcore video rentals in the US has risen from 79 m in 1985 to 759 m in 2001 .
Hardcore pornography in the shape of videos , the internet , live sex acts and cable television is now estimated to generate around $ 10bn , roughly the same amount as Hollywood 's US box office receipts .
Americans spend more money at strip clubs than at Broadway , regional theatres and orchestra performances combined .
The industry has mushroomed since the 70s , when a federal study found that it was worth little more than $ 10 m .
Now the US leads the world in pornography ; about 211 new films are produced every week .
Los Angeles area is the centre of the film boom and many of those in the trade are otherwise respectable citizens .
Nina Hartley , a porn star , told Schlosser : " You 'd be surprised how many producers and manufacturers are Republicans . "
The majority of women in the films earn about $ 400 a scene .
At the moment , there is a surplus of women in California hoping to enter the industry .
The internet has provided a fresh and profitable outlet .
In 1997 about 22,000 porn websites existed ; the number is now closer to 300,000 and growing .
More than a million illegal farmworkers are estimated to be employed in the US , with the average worker being a 29 - year - old from Mexico .
Surplus labour
The total number of illegal immigrants is estimated at about 8 million and many are being paid cash in a shadow economy .
Many live in primitive conditions : a survey in Soledad , in the heart of California 's agricultural territory , found that 1,500 of them , one - eighth of the town 's official population , were living in garages .
There are mutual economic benefits .
" Migrant work in California has long absorbed Mexican surplus labour , while Mexico has in effect paid for the education , health care and retirement of California 's farmworkers , " writes Schlosser .
" Maintaining the current level of poverty among migrant farmworkers saves the average American household around $ 50 a year . "
The advantages to the employer are clear , most notably in LA county , where an estimated 28 % of workers are paid in cash .
Schlosser believes that the shadow economy will continue to thrive as long as marijuana and pornography remain illicit .
" A society that can punish a marijuana offender more severely than a murderer is caught in the grip of a deep psychosis , " he concludes .
" Black markets will always be with us .
But they will recede in importance when the public morality is consistent with our private one .
The underground is a good measure of the progress and the health of nations .
When much is wrong , much needs to be hidden . "

Our intention is to stop the implementation of Internet Censorship in Australia .
In case you do n’t know what that means , or who it affects , it is the proposed plan of creating a compulsory internet filter which is intended on removing and banning the access to any website which is deemed “ inappropriate ” .
While the idea itself is intended to bring a safer environment for children on the internet , the filter brings about no concern for anybody else who uses the internet , and is a serious violation of our freedom of rights , speech and expression .
The idea is being implemented by Senator Stephen Conroy , the Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy , with the co-operation of our Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd .
The planned internet filters will disable our rights to view and access hundreds of thousands of web pages due to content that filters deem “ inappropriate ” .
The problem with this however is not only the accuracy of the filters which have been known to wrongfully block “ safesites ” , known to not block “ potentially harmful material ” , and have also shown that they cripple internet speeds .
Another website which has a belief similar to ours , http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/, posted a great example showing how the filtering system is a complete failure after a trial run by the government in Tasmania .
Despite this failure , the filter plan is still being implemented nationally into the future .
( The full write - up can be found here – Also , another similar write - up can be found here . )
The government however has stated that this “ Internet Filter ” will be compulsory , meaning everyone with an internet connection will be affected .
People who do n’t even have children in the house will have to suffer by being denied access to their own corners of interest on the internet – if it is deemed “ inappropriate ” for children .
There however is an inappropriate opt - out option – requiring you to register your details on a government register to monitor your internet usage , to see exactly why you did n’t want to use the internet filter , which is a blatant disrespect and law breaking of our privacy rights .
Our plan is a 3 stage approach in order to do our part to prevent this filter from being brought into place .
Stage 1 : Educate Ourselves .
Stage 2 : Educate Others .
Stage 3 : Peaceful Action .
By peaceful action , we are advocating the use of letters sent to your Minister of Parliament or Letters to the Editor in your local and national newspapers .
Any peaceful , non-violent / non - harmful expression of interest is acceptable and encouraged .
WE ARE NOT advocating the use of violence , threats and other harmful means of expression .
They will block any sites they find INAPPROPRIATE , including :
– Limewire and Torrent sites ( CONFIRMED – any sites for MP3 and movie downloads will be BLOCKED )
– Youtube ( Music videos and movie clips , can be used on YouTube in the US where Youtube is based , but break Australian copyright – BLOCKED )
– Myspace ( Blogs that offend the Government , music and videos – BLOCKED )
– Facebook ( Blogs and videos – BLOCKED )
– Wikipedia ( Articles on suicide , euthanasia , and descriptive photos in articles , copyrighted photos and song samples – BLOCKED )
– Your favourite Forums ( Anything with an unlicensed song or video , or discussion of topics not suitable for “ children ” – BLOCKED )
– Any site people can have their say about anything on – BLOCKED
– Anything the Government disagrees with – BLOCKED
– Anything “ inappropriate for children ” ( We wo n’t even get told why a site would get blocked , it will just go – BLOCKED ! )
So please , we ask you , do your part into stopping this for the good of our country , and for our rights to freedom .
POSTERS
To spread the word in public , we are creating new posters which you can print out and stick around publicly to raise awareness , and others which you can send over the internet .
You can find these posters here .
PAMPHLETS
We have pamphlets created for you to print out and to hand out in the public .
The pamphlets would be more effective than a stand - alone image , as they offer specific details on what is being blocked .
Different pamphlets will be created over time to attract different audiences .
You can find the pamphlets here .
CONTACTING
If you wish to contact one of your Local MP ’s through a letter , or would like to contact Stephen Conroy himself , here are some helpful links as well .
A guide and some help for writing a letter to your MP + help on getting their contact details .
Contact details for Stephen Conroy ’s office .
IRC CHAT
If you would like to engage in discussion with members of the community who are fighting against the planned filter , feel free to join us in discussion on our IRC Page at irc://irc.rizon.net:6667 / #ausrage or at irc://irc.rizon.net/#ausrage

As for Bush and Cheney , I think they are finally starting to realize that in order to win a war , our troops have to actually fight and kill the enemy .
Prior to the surge , it almost read as if any of our troops who wanted to even holster a weapon had to go through a 19 point checklist before he / she could even fire a shot .
My main gripe about the surge is that it was n't started sooner .
We could have saved a lot of lives had we done it .

So , in your view , it should be like this ...
Make health care a benefit of the rich .
Everyone else just get 's sick and dies .
Keep supporting the terrorist by buying their oil .
Stop mothers from working , they should be at home raising the kids anyway .
College is like health care , only the rich should be allowed to go .
Let 's start up MORE slimy mortgage brokers , and break the economy even MORE !
Let 's LOWER the minimum wage ,
If you can't live off $ 5.00 / hr ( $ 200.00 / week ) , then you should live on the street .
Lets keep paying our executives more and more , and let them oursource all our manufacturing , technical and skilled positions overseas .
Everyone else can get a job at McDonalds for $ 5.00 / hr
Let 's keep spending and cutting taxes !
That 's the solution to the future .
Stop SAVING .

Why did they do this ???
Qwest refused to participate in the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretap program ...
... the government then punished the telco by holding back lucrative government contracts .
Verizon said it had received FBI administrative subpoenas , called national security letters , requesting data ...
So your little brother says " no , I 'm not taking out the trash and he does n't get icecream because of it .
Then you get asked to take out the trash ...
What would you do ??
Verizon 's response of " it would slow efforts .. blah blah blah .. " would be like you saying " sure because it 's trash and it should go outside instead of stay in the house , I do n't care about icecream "

2 edits qworster Member Here 's what bothers me here ...
What really upsets me is how selfish so many of you are !
Your attitude seems to be : " I 've got MINE , so FUCK YOU ! "
This is really bothersome to me !
Right now , we 're fighting a war to promote american democracy in the Middle east .
So many of you here seem to think that it 's FINE to help out people you 'll never know , yet you say : " FUCK YOU " to people that live right down the STREET from you !
America was born to be a charitible , caring country - yet I see very little of that charity in many posts here !
What happened to caring about your fellow man ?
Is that second sports car or HDTV so important to you that you have no problem telling those less fortunate then you to go SCREW themselves ?
Facts are , that Americans are the richest people in the world .
Fact is also are that Americans GIVE the SMALLEST percentage of their income to charity then any other first world country !
Facts ALSO are that EVERY OTHER first world country in the world also believes that the health of their citizens is a BIRTH RIGHT , while here in America almost 40 million have no health insurance !
MILLIONS of children go hungry every night RIGHT HERE !
HOW DARE that you greedy consumers ignore their plight !
Why do you think that the USA is so hated abroad ?
It 's because they SEE our greed !
They SEE YOUR GLUTTONY !
THEN you claim that socialism is bad ...
Let me clue the herd of you into something ... ANYTHING can be good or bad if overused , INCLUDING CAPITALISM !
Here in the USA , capitalism is like a runaway train , and MILLIONS are suffering because of it !
The divide between the haves and have nots has NEVER been greater - the top 2 % of Americans control something like 95 percent of the wealth in this country - and so many of you here think that 's AOK ???!
Maybe it has n't affected you yet , but eventually it will - and YOU 'll be the one suffering .
I 'm sure your HDTV in every room will really help you out then ... RIGHT ???
I pity the lot of you .....

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Progress Energy ’s Florida utility filed for a construction license with federal regulators to build two nuclear reactors in Levy County , Florida , to help meet the state ’s long - term need for electricity , the company said on Friday .
The filing was the second filed this week at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as U.S. utilities seek to take advantage of nuclear - specific federal loan guarantees and production tax credits made possible by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
Progress seeks permission to build two Toshiba Corp ’s Westinghouse 1,100 MW AP1000 reactors near its Crystal River nuclear power plant at a total cost of $ 17 billion for the generating units and needed transmission upgrades .
The estimate includes land , plant components , financing costs , construction , labor , regulatory fees and reactor fuel for two units and about 200 miles of transmission lines and equipment , Progress said in a statement .
Progress , the state ’s second largest utility , said additional nuclear power is key to help meet Florida ’s long - term energy needs and Gov. Charlie Crist ’s strategy to address climate change .
Last month , Florida regulators approved Progress ’ need request to build the new reactors .
The utility commission has now agreed that there is a need for four new reactors to add more around - the - clock power in the state .
In March , the panel granted a need request from FPL Group , the state ’s largest utility , for two new South Florida reactors , costing more than $ 12 billion .
Progress filed a site certification application with the Florida environmental regulators in June .
A decision is expected next year .
Progress , which serves 1.7 million customers in the state , said Florida ranks third nationally in per capita energy consumption .
Average homes have grown in size by 50 percent in the past 30 years and consume 30 percent more electricity .
Progress has purchased about 5,000 acres in Levy County , but has not committed to build the reactors .
The NRC has said the combined construction and operating license application review takes about 42 months .
The NRC has now received 11 applications to build 18 reactors as utilities work to meet a deadline to qualify for nuclear financial incentives .
The NRC has said that between 2007 and 2010 it expects to receive 23 applications to build 34 new reactors .
On Monday , Ameren Corp filed for an application to build a new nuclear power plant in Missouri .

In an interview that aired on ABC ’s World News Tonight Bill Clinton denied that he is angry at Barack Obama , but offered very little in terms of an endorsement and enthusiasm for the Democratic nominee .
Clinton denied that he is still angry , “ I ’m not , and I never was mad at Senator Obama .
I think everybody ’s got a right to run for president if he qualifies under the Constitution , and I would be the last person to ever begrudge anybody their ambition , and he was a superbly gifted candidate in this election , and had a great operation .
They thought this thing through , and it ’s a contact sport …
The only thing I ever got mad about was people in your kind of work pretending that she started this stuff . ”
Clinton refused to comment on whether or not he had anything to do with his wife ’s loss , because he said it interferes with the issue of who should be elected in November .
He said that he will talk about it when the election is over .
Clinton blasted former friend Jim Clyburn and blamed him for hurting his standing with the African - American community .
He also blamed the media , “ I got bad press , because I told the truth that there was a different standard applied to the finest candidate I ever supported . ”

Clinton was asked if Obama is ready to be president , and said , “ You can argue that no one is ever ready to be president …
He has shown a keen strategic sense in his ability to run an effective campaign .
He clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them , which is an important part of being president , and he is smart as a whip so there is nothing that he ca n’t learn . ”
Two things are made clear in this interview .
Bill Clinton still has some issues with Barack Obama , and he blames the media for his wife ’s loss in the Democratic primary .
The reality is that Clinton was banished to the rural white campaign stops because he could not stop putting his foot in his mouth .
I think bad campaign strategy cost Hillary Clinton the Democratic nomination , but her husband certainly did n’t help .
It is obvious that Bill views his wife ’s defeat as personal rejection of his presidency .
President Clinton could be a valuable asset for Obama this fall , but judging from this frosty interview , I would n’t expect too much support for Obama from him this fall .
Watch the interview
An interesting general election is bound to take place in Kentucky as everyone is waiting to know all that is going to unfold on 3rd November 2020 .
With two candidates coming to the forefront , the outcome cannot be anticipated with a narrow majority of 53 - 47 for the Republicans .
So to get the complete picture , let us learn more about these candidates and how things are doing so far .
1. Amy McGrath
The Democratic establishment has put its weight behind Amy McGrath , a former Marine Corps fighter pilot .
While her previous victory was a close encounter with Charles Booker , the Democratic side is sure about placing her at the helm of things .
McGrath has called herself a “ fiscal conservative ” in 2017 as she stood as a moderate Democrat by positioning herself in Kentucky .
Through time , she managed to climb the ladder and reach the top .
Looking into her 20 - year tenure will give you a brief idea about Amy McGrath as an individual .
She was the first woman to fly a combat mission for the Marines , and she subsequently flew 88 more , soon after retirement in the year 2017 , McGrath was chosen as the Democratic nominee for Kentucky ’s sixth congressional district .
But the outcome bore no fruit as she narrowly lost to Republican incumbent Andy Barr .
2. Mitch McConnell
From the Republican side , we have Mitch McConnell , who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 .
Since then he has been re-elected five times , which eventually made him the longest - serving senator from Kentucky .
Under his leadership , the Senate was known for its record - setting judicial appointments even confirming the President ’s 200th judicial nominee .
Before running for Congress , McConnell served as Jefferson County Judge and Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Gerald Ford .
The nickname of “ Grim Reaper ” is something that is widely used to describe Mitch McConnell .
In fact , he has embraced the name by telling people to think of him as the guy who is going to ensure that socialism does not land on the President ’s desk .
With all that in hand , Mitch McConnell has placed himself forward as a confident individual who wants to win the race .
Conclusion
According to Cook Political Report and Sabato ’s Crystal Ball , the Kentucky race is likely to turn towards the Republican side .
If that seems to be the outcome , then the main reason might be due to the points put forward by Mitch McConnell .
In recent times , his team has spoken widely about McGrath ’s support for President Trump ’s impeachment , her opposition to the border wall and her record on the topic of abortion .
Regardless of all that , we will have to wait to know more about the outcome .

More from Alan Parsons ( Part 1 was here ) , via MT reader Adam , his all time best recording tips : 1 . Keep cable runs short particularly low impedance I.e. guitars and mics .
It WILL affect the sound .
Having said that I do n't believe expensive cables offer significant improvement .
2 .
Even the best instruments and recording equipment will probably sound like crap in the wrong hands .
The reverse can also be true .3 .
Do n't suck the life out of a recording by overuse of limiting and compression .
4 .
Go for performance not perfection .
5 . Log EVERYTHING on a recording so that anyone can pick up where you left off .
Particularly tracks that should not be used - better still , get rid of them .6 .
Always consolidate tracks ( in other words all tracks should have the same start and finish times ) so that they can be loaded onto a different platform .
Give every track a meaningful name .
7 .
Even if your ideas are making all the difference , make the other person think they were theirs .
8 .
The two most important things on a great record are : 1 . The Song. 2 . The Song.9 .
Never trust anyone in the music business with a vowel in their name .
10 .
The check is NOT in the mail .
Thanks Alan & Adam .

Armed with the App Store and a whopping zero dollars to spend , I took a crack at finding the best free iPhone productivity applications available right now .
I came away with five solid -- if flawed - - apps for productivity - minded cheapskates .
Four of the five tools on this list had their share of limitations and bugs to work out , which made me shy away from testing paid productivity apps .
That said , of the twelve free productivity utilities I looked at , the five here were the clear - cut leaders .
If you 've got a better alternative to any of these productivity tools , please give us your recommendations in the Comments section below .
And if you 're more of a slacker , see our list of 17 free iPhone Apps that let you do fun stuff -- such as interact with music in cool ways and pick a good place to eat .
All of the following apps were tested on a first - generation iPhone with the 2.0.1 firmware .
It should be noted that during testing , several EDGE network issues came up with both my iPhone and those of coworkers with the 3G iPhone ; they reported slower - than - usual 3G connectivity and had to rely mostly on EDGE speeds , as well .
1. PageOnce Personal Assistant
Website | App Store link ( requires iTunes )
In the realm of free applications , no " killer productivity app " for the iPhone exists , but PageOnce Personal Assistant is as close as it gets .
Rather than providing its own set of services , PageOnce Personal Assistant aggregates your online accounts and feeds them to your iPhone in one handy , streamlined interface .
However , those feeds are limited to read - only status .
It 's still a handy app for seeing your bank balance ( no payments or transfers , though ) ; looking at what 's coming up on your Netflix queue ; reading your MySpace , Digg , and Twitter feeds ; seeing how many minutes you 've used up on your monthly cellular account ; viewing your cable bill ; and scanning your Gmail , Yahoo Mail , and other Web - based e-mail inboxes ( no sending messages , though ) .
I did see a few notable omissions to PageOnce 's otherwise impressive lineup of online partners .
For example , PageOnce has no Facebook integration , which is especially surprising given the numerous references on the PageOnce site to getting your Facebook feed through the app .
In addition to the read - only limitations , I noticed a bit of a lag time between signing up for feeds online and having them work on my iPhone .
Also , I really hope PageOnce has airtight security ( the PageOnce site claims it does ) , due to the amount of personal information submitted to get the full range of offerings .
Also , as our Ed Albro points out , it 's much easier to just check your e-mail inbox than to use the limited read - only feed on PageOnce .
2. Evernote
Website | App Store link ( requires iTunes )
With Evernote , gone are the days of e-mailing things to yourself just to get them off your phone and onto your computer .
One of the first apps I loaded onto my iPhone , Evernote lets you send written notes , photos ( taken from both within the application and stored in your iPhone 's photo album ) , and voice memos to an online repository that you can access anywhere with a Web connection .
Evernote 's free version limits your uploads to 40 MB per month , while Evernote Premium increases your upload limit to 500 MB per month for a $ 5 monthly or $ 45 yearly fee .
For the casual user , though , the free version should offer plenty of storage .
I had some problems and delays uploading images during my testing over an EDGE network ; text uploads , on the other hand , worked without a hitch .
I was able to access sent notes on my Web - connected desktop almost immediately .
3. ReQall
Website | App Store link ( requires iTunes )
To - do list applications abound in the iTunes App Store , but ReQall for the iPhone is a veritable list - making and reminder - creating suite .
It combines to - do lists , shopping lists , and voice memos , and it syncs them to your online ReQall account so that you can access them from outside your iPhone .
The service will even convert your voice notes to written ones , a handy spin for impatient touch - screen typists .
ReQall is also useful for groups or work situations , provided your friends or coworkers sign up for the free service as well ; a People tab lets you share your entries with selected contacts .
ReQall also alerts you to items on your to - do lists in several ways , thanks to integrated functionality with instant - messaging clients ( AIM and Yahoo Messenger ) , Firefox , text messaging , and e-mail .
You can get reminder blasts through each of those media , as well as pop - up reminders on your iPhone screen .
I experienced a few lag - time issues when testing the app , but no real deal - breakers .
For instance , the text - to - voice feature was accurate in my testing , but conversion from text to voice took about 10 minutes over EDGE .
Also , there 's inexplicably no way to edit a to - do or shopping entry from your iPhone once you 've saved it , even to add the day and time the task is due .
You can , however , edit and manage your saved entries on ReQall 's nicely designed Web site .
The current iteration of ReQall is free , but according to its
Web site , the company will start charging for it soon .
4. YPMobile
Website | App Store link ( requires iTunes )
YPMobile puts searchable Yellow Pages listings right on your iPhone free of charge , saving you from having to lug the Yellow Pages around with you .
In addition to searching for specific business names , YPMobile can also search by category : restaurant types , dry cleaners , barber shops , and the like .
Provided you allow YPMobile to use your current location data , your search results display in order of the businesses nearest to your current location , which is a great touch .
Each listing offers the business 's address and phone number ( you tap the number to call them ) , as well as a user rating based on a five - star scale .
You can add listings to your " Plan " for the day by hitting a plus button at the bottom of the screen , and you can bookmark and share business listings by adding them as a favorite .
YPMobile 's usefulness does n't stop there , thanks to an events tab that lists upcoming concerts and happenings .
Of the batch reviewed here , it 's the most bug - free .
5. Instapaper
Website | App Store link ( requires iTunes )
Instapaper is a way to create offline versions of your favorite Web articles , allowing you to read them on your iPhone while you 're on an airplane , in the subway tunnel , or otherwise out of signal range .
However , in order to save a list of pages to read , you 'll need to plan ahead and visit Instapaper.com beforehand using mobile Safari , choose your content , and then launch the Instapaper app to read it offline .
I only wish it had integrated functionality with the iPhone 's mobile Safari browser ; namely , the ability to save offline versions of articles by simply tapping a button within Safari .
After performing that rather irritating ritual ( it 's much less frustrating to use your laptop or desktop to save your content with the Instapaper site ) , the Instapaper app displays a list of all the pages you 've saved .
However , clicking on my entries brought up another buggy usability issue : an error message that read , " Sorry , this page is not available offline . "
That 's not entirely accurate , because tapping the " Text " button at the top of the screen brought up an offline version of each saved page .
Once you get around the bugginess and the hoop - jumping , Instapaper is a nice way to read long articles offline , but the development team has a few kinks and usability issues to work out .
Got a better free iPhone productivity app to recommend ?
Let us know about it by posting a comment below .

BBC News , Ashkelon , southern Israel
Dr Lobel says his hospital treats hundreds of Gazans every year Crying out in pain , Ahmed lies in a hospital bed in Barzilai Medical Centre , his blood - encrusted lower limbs heavily bandaged .
Two weeks earlier , the 17 - year - old became another victim of the violence between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants when he lost his left leg , he says , in an Israeli missile strike against militants in Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip .
At first , he was taken to Gaza 's Shifa hospital , but with the territory 's health system under severe strain after months of Israeli blockade and internal strife , his only hope for life - saving treatment lay in Israel itself .
" We got our permit from the Israeli authorities within 24 hours , " said Ahmed 's father , Muhammad .
" An ambulance took my son from Shifa to the Erez crossing , where he was transferred to an Israeli ambulance and brought to Barzilai .
I used to work in Israel so I was n't afraid , but for him it is his first time , " he said .
Since his arrival at the medical centre in Ashkelon , Ahmed has undergone three operations and he is awaiting a fourth .
' No distinction '
While some 1,600 Gazan patients had permit requests denied by Israel in 2007 , more than 7,000 were allowed in for medical treatment - a 50 % increase on 2006 - according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
MEDICAL PERMITS FROM GAZA 2006 : 4932 granted ; 538 denied 2007 : 7176 granted ; 1627 denied Source : WHO However , WHO says the proportion of permits denied also increased , from 10 % in 2006 to 18.5 % in 2007 .
Under the 1994 Israeli - Palestinian peace accords , the Palestinian Authority assumed responsibility for health services in the West Bank and Gaza .
However , with tertiary care virtually non-existent in Gaza , Palestinians there are forced to seek such treatment in Israel or beyond .
Barzilai is one of three hospitals in Israel to which most of the cases come , but its proximity to Gaza - just 12 km ( seven miles ) - means it gets those which are most severe .
" We treat hundreds of Gazans here each year , " says Dr Ron Lobel , Barzilai 's deputy director .
He says there are some five to 15 Gazan patients there at any given time .
" Most are extremely ill , a lot have bullet wounds , but we also treat Palestinians with cancer , kidney and liver diseases who can't get treatment in Gaza . "
He says doctors never ask patients how they got their injuries or if they belong to a militant group .
" Even if they 're terrorists they 're treated like any other person being brought into the emergency room - we make no distinction between treating Israelis or Palestinians . "
Most treatment is funded by the Palestinian Authority 's health department , although many cases are treated by Israel for free .
Ironically , Barzilai 's closeness to Gaza also means the hospital is within range of militants ' rockets .
" It 's absurd , " says Dr Lobel .
" We 're treating Gazans while coming under fire from their own back yards . "
In February , a rocket landed near the hospital 's emergency room on the same day that a Palestinian woman from Beit Lahiya in Gaza gave birth there to premature twins .
Tough process Although Ahmed 's transfer went smoothly , it can be a different experience for many other cases .
Applying for treatment in Israel from Gaza is a complicated process - a patient is first put in touch with the Palestinian Referral Abroad Department ( RAD ) , which has to arrange an appointment with an Israeli hospital before issuing a referral abroad request ; the patient must then contact the Palestinian health District Co-ordination Office ( DCO ) , which in turn asks the Israeli health DCO for a permit to pass through Erez crossing .
The Erez Crossing is the only way out for Palestinians seeking treatment From there the request is sent to the office of the Co-ordinator of Activities in the Territories ( West Bank and Gaza ) , where Israel 's domestic security service examines whether the patient poses a security risk .
If the permit is granted , the patient goes to the Palestinian side of the Erez crossing , where a Palestinian Liaison Officer co-ordinates with an Israeli Liaison Officer to get the patient across .
Even at this point , a patient might end up not crossing if delays there mean they have missed their allotted hospital appointment time , or if the Israeli side of the crossing closes for security reasons .
If a patient fails to cross , he or she must start the referral process again from the beginning .
According to the WHO , 32 Gazans died between October 2007 and March 2008 while waiting for travel permits .
" WHO believes there is a right for everybody to get health care , " said Mahmoud Dahar , the organisation 's director in Gaza .
" Israel has the most sophisticated security measures at the Erez crossing , so if people are going to carry out attacks , they will be stopped there .
No requests should be turned down . "
' Loophole exploited '
But Israel says it has to balance Gaza 's humanitarian needs with its own security .
" The Israeli policy is to facilitate all the medical needs for Gaza , " said Maj Peter Lerner , spokesman for the Co-ordinator of Activities in the Territories .
The terrorists make life very difficult for genuine medical cases
Maj Peter Lerner Office of Co-ordinator of Activities in the Territories " The only reason a permit would be denied is for security concerns . "
He says militants have repeatedly tried to exploit Israel 's humanitarian policy to carry out attacks in Israel .
In June 2007 , two Palestinian women who had received medical entry permits were arrested at the Erez crossing after it was discovered they planned to blow themselves up in an Israeli hospital , Israeli authorities said .
In 2004 , a female suicide bomber who claimed she had surgical plates in her legs blew herself up at the crossing after bypassing the metal detector , killing four Israelis .
" This is why the crossing can't be the first point of verification , there has to be some sort of clearance process beforehand , " said Maj Lerner .
The crossing itself has been bombarded over 200 times by mortars , rockets and sniper fire since last June , automatically closing every time .
" It 's a dilemma we 're dealing with - the terrorists make life very difficult for genuine medical cases , but at the end of the day the vast majority who need treatment in Israel are actually approved . "

What are these ?
Without a doubt , the most crowded booth at E3 was the one which featured Harmonix ’s latest creation , Rock Band 2 .
Even though the show was significantly scaled - back this year , there was still always a crowd gathered around the stations where you could jam on plastic instruments and bring out your inner Bon Jovi .
The TGR crew got a little time both on the show floor and behind closed doors with the new title , and we came away from our time only wanting more .
There are so many things that make the Rock Band experience unique , and to truly give you the full picture , we have to take them one by one .
The instruments , set lists , and gameplay are all integral parts to the rock star fantasy , and Rock Band 2 once again nails every aspect perfectly .
The Harmonix crew knows what it takes to make a top - notch music game , and they are proving it once again .
First off , the instruments , those plastic , button - fretted , rubber - padded tools that helped establish the first Rock Band as a force in the rhythm game genre .
Both the drums and guitar have been given some subtle tweaks , and those who want to bring out their inner Keith Moon will be happy with some major overhauls to the skins , making them quieter and more realistic than ever before .
The team is sticking with the Fender Stratocaster model , but this year ’s version introduces a new Sunburst wood grain look , creating a very classy look and feel .
The buttons have been made quieter and the strum bar is now “ less mushy , ” to use the terminology of our Harmonix representative , an effort to make strumming feel more precise and in line with what players have come to expect from their fake guitars .
Also , the hassles of calibrating audio and visual lag are gone , as the new guitar features a built - in lens and microphone that can sync it up automatically .
All you have to do is start the diagnostic , hold the guitar so that it has a clear line of sight with your TV , and wait .
Of course , for the purists there will still be the option to manually calibrate the settings , but for those who felt frustrated because they believed things were never quite right before , this new system will remove all the guesswork .
All in all , the guitar looks , feels , and handles even better than before , and will be considered a major upgrade for those disappointed in the first game ’s offering .
The drums have also seen a major overhaul .
At first glance , the new “ standard ” drum set does n’t appear that much different from what you ’ve come to expect .
It ’s still four pads and a kick pedal , but when you look closer , that ’s when the differences start to stand out .
This time around , Harmonix has introduced a thicker rubber pad , making the drums immensely quieter than before .
No doubt your family , neighbors , and anyone you play with online will be pleased to hear that the assault on their ears is now over , as the new pads are so quiet , you can hardly hear them .
They ’re also velocity - sensitive , meaning that you will get a different sound depending on how hard you wail .
This will obviously be good news to the more accomplished drummers who may want to create a crescendo drum roll or really get that extra “ oomph ” out of a cymbal crash .
Also improved , the bass pedal is metal reinforced to prevent breaking , and it now snaps securely onto the bottom of the set so no more falling foot pedals as you try and move the kit from one side of the room to the other .
Of course , Harmonix could have been satisfied to stop here with the new features , but they wanted more .
On the back of the drums are special input ports which were explained to be for cymbal attachments ( Mad Catz is making the official cymbals , which will be sold separately ) , or a second kick pedal .
Our demo guide actually took a jab at Activision , asking why the “ other guys ” were only including two cymbals on their drum set when a real setup has three .
Oh snap , geek war .
One thing to note , the new cymbals will not add notes to the song , but rather reassign already existing pads .
So instead of having to worry about four pads , three cymbals , and a kick pedal , you ’ll more realistically be concerning yourself with snare and tom drums , a couple cymbals , and a high - hat and bass drum .
Of course , that ’s really plenty to worry about anyway .
For those who really want to take their drumming to the next level , Rock Band 2 will introduce the “ Ion Drum Rocker , ” a kit which , when plugged into an Alesis “ drum brain , ” can be turned into a genuine electronic drum set .
Basically , the best way to describe the Ion set is that it takes the standard drums and turns them up to 11 .
If Rock Band inspired you to take a shot at playing drums for real , then the Ion kit , while expensive , will be a sound investment toward your future as the next Neil Peart .
Honestly , the franchise seems more drum - centric than ever , as it also include a drum trainer which will teach you basics , like rhythms and beats , to more advanced concepts , such as drum fills for various styles of music .
If you ’re serious about your training , then this new feature very well could transform you from a wannabe skin - slapper into a genuine drummer .
Very cool , indeed .
But all the fancy plastic instruments and good intentions are n’t worth squat if the music sucks , but you should know by now that you need n’t fear such things when Harmonix is on the job .
The crew has secured some giant acts for the upcoming release , even debuting a few new acts .
Guns ‘n Roses , a rhythm game staple , will be featuring a brand - new track from the as - yet unreleased Chinese Democracy album , and first time acts such as Bob Dylan ( “ Tangled Up in Blue ” ) as well as AC / DC ( “ Let There be Rock ” ) , who fans have been clamoring for since the very first Guitar Hero game .
Also , the developers are promising that all current Rock Band DLC , as well as “ almost all ” of the songs from the original game will be forward - compatible , meaning you can simply download them all into Rock Band 2 and not have to worry about any disc swapping .
When pressed about what they meant by “ almost all ” of the original content coming over , the Harmonix representatives played coy , but considering the fact that they are promising to have around 500 total songs available by the holidays , chances are you wo n’t miss one or two tracks from the original game ’s soundtrack .
So with all these new instruments and great songs , you likely start to wonder how the game will actually work .
Will it be the standard list progression through the songs we ’ve become accustomed to in single - player , or is it set up more like multiplayer ’s World Tour mode where you tackle set lists of varying lengths and difficulties ?
The answer lies somewhere in the middle , as the new setup is a sort of hybrid of what we ’ve seen before , trying to bring the best of both worlds .
World
Tour is back and it ’s better than ever .
You are no longer restricted to certain instruments and a band leader , meaning anyone in your group can jump on any instrument for any song .
So if you have a particular bandmate who can hit the high notes , put that person up front for Boston ; if someone in the group excels at tricky guitar solos , let that soul tackle the thrash metal songs .
You have complete freedom now , and like Dave Grohl , you can pretty much just go and play whatever instrument you want .
Also , you can now finally take your World Tour online , joining up with friends around the world to form the most rollicking band in all the land .
If you ’ve got an all - star lineup from around the world , you can bring all those folks together to make your very own supergroup .
For those who love the World Tour format , but prefer to play alone , Rock Band 2 is introducing a new Solo Tour that fits more closely into the World Tour mode .
You ’ll now be playing set lists and confronting more realistic challenges ( what band worth their salt only plays one or two songs in a set anyway ? ) , all in the name of making a name for yourself as a great and worthy rock star .
If at any time you get tired of career progression , there are other new modes to keep you entertained as well .
Instrument - specific challenges allow you to replicate the more traditional feel of rhythm games , taking you up through the set list in order from least to most difficult for a specific instrument .
As you progress , you unlock new challenges for not just the instrument you ’re playing , but others as well , so if you get stuck , you ’ll be able to route around the song that ’s giving you trouble .
The game is featuring artist - specific challenges , so for example , if you ’ve download the " Best of The Who " track pack , there will likely be a challenge waiting for you .
These new tasks are added automatically once the game detects you have the proper content , meaning you now have yet another incentive to buy more music ( as if you needed one ) .
Basically , the new challenge mode allows you to steer clear of boring songs , meaning that if you are taking the guitar path , you wo n’t be forced to do a lot of annoyingly simple songs late in the set list that are geared more for drums or bass just as you ’re gearing up for the big tasks .
For those wanting to prove they rock the hardest , the game also features a brand new “ Battle of the Bands ” mode that will pit you against your friends and the world at large in daily challenges .
These tasks may be simple high score affairs , or they could be note streak or solo challenges .
The game is set up so that you first have to achieve a score higher than that of anyone on your friends list before you can take on the world at large , and daily rankings will show you who the best of the best is .
Think of it as conquering the local scene before you move on to playing arena shows .
We wrapped up our time with Rock Band 2 by gathering up our instruments and taking on Bon Jovi ’s “ Livin ’ on a Prayer , ” the karaoke classic .
As The Sassy Lassies ( the arbitrary name I had assigned to our band ) rocked out to levels as yet unknown , the whole Rock Band experience came together once more , reminding me not only of why I play this game in particular , but why I love games in general .
September ca n’t come soon enough ( unfortunately PS3 and Wii owners will have to wait a bit longer ) for this latest opus of gaming to be unleashed on the world .
Rock Band is back , and you ’re going to want to be a part of its return .

" It looks like Australia has smashed the current world record and should now hold the title for the most number of people ever to participate in a stiletto sprint , " Australian representative for Guinness World Records , Chris Sheedy , told The Age .
From this morning 's Playbook , under the heading " A PRESCRIPTION FOR McCAIN , from one of the smartest Bushies , " emphasis added :
I personally would make a lot of ‘ accidental ’ straight talk on the plane with reporters .
Oh no .
McCain was chatting with the press , slipped up and called the Paulson proposal totally lacking on detail at best and nothing more than bailout of Wall Street fat cats at worse .
Oh no .
McCain said it is time for a recusal by Paulson given that he is conflicted five ways from Sunday .
Let staff say that they will see about clarification .
Let McCain come back and say that he wo n't apologize and in fact it is worse than what he said the first time . …
And you also could guard against underwhelming debate performances , which McCain needs to be worried about given his ability in that regard and his history of performance .
The tactics that got them to mid-September in a tie are not going to get them to 50 percent plus one in November .
They need … an eye toward driving out the range of contrast that makes McCain different from Obama ( action - oriented rhetoric v. grand prose ; accessible v. uppity ; humble servant of country v. arrogant ) .

From the Bible on up , Christian fiction has been one of the world 's most popular genres .
I do n't have a magic access code to Nielsen BookScan , but I can confidently estimate that every book Tyndale publishes sells at least 50,000 copies within six months ( possibly excepting the Bible . )
Even Random House has its own Christian imprint , WaterBrook Press .
Imagine : the company Bennett Cerf started in 1927 to publish illustrated editions of , the company that made it legal to publishin the United States , the company that gave away free two - volume boxed sets of gay old Marcel Proust ' swith every catalog order !
And now -- the company that brings you Desire and Deceit : The Real Cost Of The New Sexual Tolerance !
A quote from the blurb : Random House admits it : But we were talking about Christian fiction .
Since money dictates importance , we are thus talking about Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins 'series .
Have you ever been curious about theseries ?
I have !
I tried reading one of the books once but could n't get past I think thirty , forty pages .
The only plot points I remember are : ( 1 ) everyone gets sucked up into Heaven and ( 2 ) Captain Rayford Steele sometimes has lustful thoughts about his flight attendant , which means he stays on Earth for seven years of torture .
This is what America wants to read .
This is what has probably kept the publishing industry alive for the past ten years .
LaHaye and Jenkins , terrified about the money train stopping , even published a sequel to , one set in the thousand - year reign of Christ over Earth ( SPOILER : Jesus wins . )
Is n't the point of the thousand - year reign of Christ the absence of all conflict and narrative complexity ?
Fortunately , you do n't have to actually read through these books .

Myth : Poor people and minorities are committing the most crime .
Fact :
The rich commit far more crime than the poor .
Summary
The upper class commits far more crime than the lower class .
Street criminals stole $ 15.3 billion in 1993 , but white collar - criminals embezzled $ 200 billion .
Street criminals murdered 23,271 people that year , but the decisions of profit - driven corporations murdered at least 318,368 ( through pollution , consumer and worker safety violations , etc. )
Corporations deserve blame for these deaths because they lobby for and enact policies which drive up these death rates .
Virtually all other rich countries have higher safeguards and lower death rates .
Arguments
Say the word " criminal , " and the image that comes to the mind of most people is a street criminal usually poor , usually black , usually armed with a gun .
In terms of sheer damage , however , the crimes of the poor do not even begin to compare with the rich .
In 1993 , the property loss to theft and robbery amounted to $ 15.3 billion .
( 1 ) But white - collar embezzlement costs about $ 200 billion a year !
( 2 ) So conditioned are we to ignore the crimes of the middle and upper classes that the FBI does not even list this statistic in its authoritative annual report , Crime in the United States .
The very way we think of crime is racist and classist to its core .
The same is true of murder .
Officially , the FBI counted 23,271 murders in 1993 .
( 3 ) But a truer figure would run at least 318,368 , even by the incomplete and conservative count listed below .
Society has simply conditioned us not to think of the deaths caused by corporations as murder .
For example , when a criminal breaks into someone 's home and shoots a family of six , we have no trouble identifying that as mass murder .
But what about the mine disaster that kills 26 miners -- after the owners had committed 1,250 safety violations in the last 13 years ?
( 4 ) If the mine owner callously and knowingly risks human lives in his pursuit of profits , should n't he then be guilty of murder ?
Murder is defined as " unlawful killing with malice aforethought . "
Clearly , a mine owner who has been lawfully warned that his mines are unsafe has the requisite foreknowledge of likely death .
And the mine owner who would then choose to ignore those warnings in his quest for profits clearly displays the requisite malice towards his fellow human beings .
An analogy best describes this similarity .
Suppose someone puts out a $ 100,000 contract on your life , causing a gangster to show up at your door one day and kill you .
He may not have known you , or held a personal grudge against you .
He did it for the money -- that is , with cold - blooded malice aforethought .
The same is true of a businessman who desires to earn an extra $ 100,000 in profits when scientists have already warned him that this action will drive up the percentage of worker or consumer deaths .
Three objections are commonly raised to the above argument .
Some object that a street crime is different because it is terrifying , direct and real in a way that work is not .
But this only begs the question : which would you rather be killed by , a street criminal or an unsafe job ?
Others object that job deaths are accidental , even negligent , but not criminal .
But our society has a long tradition of finding people guilty for criminal negligence ( such as drunk drivers who kill , or restaurants that fail to put out the " wet floor " sign ) .
Even so , it can not be negligence if scientists , experts or regulators have repeatedly warned the perpetrator .
Others object that if workers do not want to work at dangerous jobs , they should simply find another .
Unfortunately , the job market is ruled by the mathematics of displacement .
If you quit a dangerous job to take a safe one , you have removed a safe job opening from the job market and replaced it with a dangerous one .
Since people must either work or starve , they must take whatever jobs are available .
And with an unemployment rate of 5 - 6 percent , job seekers actually find themselves competing for these jobs .
To put it another way , suppose that 30 percent of the jobs in the economy were dangerous .
The solution is not to rotate the workforce in and out of those jobs .
Nor is the solution to let workers compete for the safer jobs , leaving the bottom 30 percent of workers stranded in dangerous ones .
The only real solution is to lower the percentage of dangerous jobs to zero .
And that is something only managers and owners can do .
Corporations not only expose workers to danger , but consumers as well .
Scientists have long warned corporations that air and water pollution kills a certain percentage of the population ( mostly through higher cancer rates ) .
So do cigarettes , cars without safety features like air - bags , defective silicon breast implants , unsafe nuclear waste disposal , chemical food additives and pesticides , inadequate health care , inadequate disaster and emergency services , poverty , poor education and training the list goes on and on .
So how do corporations get away with it ?
In 1992 , corporations formed 67 percent of all Political Action Committees ( the lobbyist organizations that bribe our Congress ) and contributed 79 percent of all " soft money " to national political parties .
( 5 ) These corporate lobbyists have persuaded Congress to scuttle pro-consumer , pro-labor and pro-environmental safeguards , even though this results in a higher percentage of disease and death .
Indeed , the statistics below reveal that the U.S. has some of the highest death rates and pollution rates in the industrialized world .
This returns us to the definition of murder : " illegal killing with malice aforethought . "
If Congress rules that these fatal practices are not illegal , then corporations may claim that they are not guilty of murder .
But let 's revisit the hypothetical $ 100,000 contract put out on your life .
Suppose that the gangster accepting the contract first visits his local member of Congress , and bribes him to make contract murder legal before going ahead with terminating you .
Should society let this gangster off the hook for murder because of this technical loophole ?
The following is a closer look at the statistics of how Americans are really murdered .
This is obviously an incomplete list , but the tally below easily dwarfs the FBI 's official murder count of 23,271 .
THE REAL MURDER STATISTICS
In 1992 , nearly 70,000 Americans were killed from job - related accidents or work - related illness and desease .
Another 13.2 million suffered non-fatal injuries or illness , at a cost of $ 170 billion to the economy .
( 6 ) Although some accidents are obviously inevitable " acts of God , " a large portion are surely preventable .
When industry pushes the pace of production to the limit , cuts safety corners , lobbies Congress for budget cuts in OSHA ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration ) and urges extensive safety deregulation , then a certain percentage of these deaths are attributable to profit - driven managers and owners .
Throughout this analysis , we will be conservative , counting only 10 to 25 percent of the total deaths as industry - responsible .
In this case , that amounts to 17,500 work - related deaths .
Pollution is another way that industry kills .
Since 70 percent of all Americans consider themselves pro-environmentalist , environmental legislation tends to pass by wide margins in Congress .
But corporations know how to resist these laws .
For example , the original Clean Air Act ( 1970 ) called for the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate hundreds of known air pollutants .
But by 1990 , after twenty years of corporate stalling , dodging and fighting in the courts , the EPA had managed to issue regulatory standards for only seven pollutants .
( 7 ) Furthermore , corporations are quite successful in lobbying exemptions into environmental laws .
In 1990 , the Clean Air Act was revised by Congress ; environmentalists wanted a clause to reduce industrial cancer risks to one - in - a- million .
" The Senate bill still has the requirement , " said environmental lobbyist Richard Ayres at the time .
" But there are forty pages of extensions and exceptions and qualifications and loopholes that largely render the health standard a nullity . "
( 8 ) And when the Republicans took over Congress in 1994 , Newt Gingrich invited corporate lobbyists themselves to write the texts of environmental legislation .
But pollution kills .
The National Cancer Institute has conducted a massive , county - by - county study of cancer in the U.S. , in an effort to locate the nation 's " cancer hotspots " .
Dr. Glenn Paulson summed up the results this way : " If you know where the chemical industry is , you know where the cancer hotspots are . " ( 9 )
Another study has linked high local cancer rates to hazardous waste sites .
A team of researchers identified 593 such hazardous waste sites from the Environmental Protection Agency 's National Priority List for cleanup under the Superfund .
They found that hazardous waste site counties had significantly higher death rates for six types of cancers for white men , and another six types of cancers for white women ( including breast cancer ) , than non-hazardous waste site counties . ( 10 )
The same correlation exists between breast cancer rates and the nuclear industry .
In 1990 , the National Cancer Institute conducted a study of cancer mortality rates near nuclear facilities .
Using data from that study , Drs. Ernest Sternglass , Jay Gould and Joseph Mangano found that 18 percent of the U.S. female population lives in or adjacent to counties that have nuclear reactors .
This 18 percent of the population accounts for 55 percent of all breast cancer deaths .
Nationally , breast cancer declined 4 percent over the period of the NCI 's study , but for these women , the breast cancer rate rose 9 percent .
Prior to start up of nuclear operations in the 107 " nuclear counties " of the NCI 's analysis , cancer mortality in these mainly rural counties was 1 % below the rate experienced by the U.S. as a whole .
After start - up , cancer mortality in these counties increased to 2 % above the national rate .
According to a sophisticated study by the Natural Resources Defense Council , some 64,000 people may die prematurely every year from particulate air pollution .
It reports that tens of thousands of these deaths could be averted if the Environmental Protection Agency set stringent health standards for fine - particulate pollution . ( 11 )
Many Americans are unaware that the U.S. is the most polluting society in the First World .
In some areas , like the emission of greenhouse gases , it even outdoes the environmentally ravaged former communist countries .
Click here to see the full statistics .
Unsafe consumer products are another way that industry kills .
Each year there are about 21,700 consumer product deaths and 28.6 million injuries , at a total cost of $ 200 billion .
Yet corporate lobbyists effectively blocked the creation of a Consumer Protection Agency under President Carter , and have continually pushed for safety deregulation and defunding of the Consumer Product Safety Commission , which inspects 15,000 products a year . ( 12 )
Perhaps the biggest consumer killer is cigarettes .
The American Cancer Society reports that " smoking is related to about 419,000 U.S. deaths each year . "
( 13 ) Some might argue that this is a personal choice , more appropriately labeled " slow suicide " than " murder . "
However , the tobacco industry spikes its cigarettes with added nicotine to make them more addictive .
And it aggressively advertises to teenagers , using cartoon characters like " Joe Camel , " or enviable adult images like the " Marlboro Man . "
Teenagers are targeted to replace the older customers the industry kills off .
According to a 1994 Gallup poll , 75 percent of all smokers admit they are addicted , and 81 percent say they would not start smoking again if they had to do it over .
This no longer sounds like a personal choice .
Furthermore , second - hand smoke also kills about 3,000 nonsmokers a year .
( 14 )
The cancer risk of smoking cigarettes has been known for decades , but it was n't until 1992 that the Environmental Protection Agency classified Environmental Tobacco Smoke ( or ETS ) as a Class - A carcinogen .
The Centers for Disease Control report that 88 percent of all Americans have cotinine -- a by - product of ETS -- in their blood .
Their survey shows that 43 percent of U.S. children ( aged 2 months through 11 years ) live in a home with at least one smoker , and that 37 percent of adult non -tobacco users live in a home with a smoker or are exposed to ETS at work . ( 15 )
One example especially clarifies how Americans are really murdered each year : unnecessary surgery .
Health care experts have long known that many doctors have a financial incentive to recommend surgery ; in 1975 , this resulted in 3.2 million unnecessary operations .
Obviously , surgery is a radical procedure , and a certain percentage of these patients die as a matter of course .
Dr. Sidney Wolf estimates that about 16,000 people died unnecessarily that year , at a cost of $ 5 billion .
( 16 ) ( Even the most conservative estimates for that year were 12,000 deaths . )
Since 1975 , things have only gotten worse .
One notorious example is the C-section .
In 1970 , Caesarean births comprised 5.5 percent of all births ; by 1988 , they had soared to 24.7 percent .
The optimal rate is 12 percent , according to a scale devised by Dr. Edward Quillan , dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California . ( 17 )
Unnecessary prescriptions are also an excellent way for health care providers to turn a profit .
Dr. George Silver , a professor at the Yale University School of Medicine , estimates that 22 percent of the nation 's 6 billion doses of antibiotic medicines are unnecessary , resulting in 2,000 to 10,000 deaths a year .
Silver 's estimates are extremely conservative ; other authorities put the deaths somewhere between 30,000 and 160,000 . ( 18 )
Poverty also kills .
The American Journal of Epidemiology reports that " a vast body of evidence has shown consistently that those in the lower classes have higher mortality , morbidity , and disability rates . "
( 19 )
This is because the poor suffer more polluted , stressful and unsafe work and living environments ; they have less preventative health care , less post - health care , less education about safety and health issues , less nutritious meals , less creature comforts like heating or air - conditioning , less recreational opportunities , less tools to ease their standard of living , less isolation from sick and infected people , and less contact with people who could direct them to solutions .
Although affluent blacks enjoy the same good health as affluent whites , there are more blacks in poverty than whites ( 33.1 percent compared to 12.2 percent ) .
( 20 ) And for this reason , the average black life span is about seven years shorter than the average white life span ( a statistic that does n't change even when factoring in the murder rate ) . ( 21 )
Some might object that America 's poor are significantly richer than the poor of other countries .
However , researchers have discovered that it is not only absolute poverty that kills , but relative poverty as well !
Drs. Bruce Kennedy , Ichiro Kawachi and Deborah Prothrow - Stith conducted a study at the Harvard School of Public Health that found that the gap between the rich and the poor matters .
" We found that mortality was strongly related to inequality in the distribution of income , but not to the median income or per capita income of a state , " says Kennedy .
( 22 ) States with the most income inequality had higher death rates of heart disease , cancer , homicide , tuberculosis , pneumonia and high blood pressure .
The Harvard team concluded that if U.S. inequality were reduced from 30 % to 25 % on the Robin Hood index ( about where it is in England ) , deaths from coronary heart disease would be reduced by 25 % .
( 23 )
In 1993 , the U.S. suffered 489,970 deaths from coronary heart disease ; a quarter of that would represent 122,493 lives saved . ( 24 )
A separate study by the California Department of Health Services made the same findings .
They found high levels of income inequality and high death rates in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Kentucky and New York .
Conversely , they found comparatively low levels of income inequality and low death rates in New Hampshire , Utah , Wisconsin , Iowa and Hawaii .
By both measures , New Jersey and Connecticut were in the middle .
Interestingly , the principal researcher in the California group , Dr. George A. Kaplan , says : " The evidence in these two studies suggests that the increased death rates in those states are not due simply to their having more poor people .
Income inequality seems to be increasing mortality rates among nonpoor people as well , and we are investigating that possibility . " ( 25 )
That said , we can now show that the U.S. has the highest level of income inequality in the industrialized world :
Inequality of income , 1991 ( 100 = most inequality , 0 = least inequality ) ( 26 ) United States 99 Canada 83 Netherlands 82 Switzerland 79 United Kingdom 78 Germany 66 Norway 60 Sweden 60
The U.S. also has the greatest poverty rate in the industrialized world :
Poverty level , 1991 ( 27 ) United States 17.1 % Canada 12.6 United Kingdom 9.7 Switzerland 8.5 Germany 5.6 Sweden 5.3 Norway 5.2 Children under the poverty level , 1991 ( 28 ) United States 22.4 % Canada 15.5 United Kingdom 9.3 Switzerland 7.8 Sweden 5.0 Germany 4.9 Norway 4.8
Not surprisingly , we also have some of the very worst death rates in the industrialized world .
Let 's start with infant mortality :
Column 1 - Infant Mortality : Number of deaths of infants under 1 year per 1,000 live births .
Column 2 - Feto - infant Mortality : Number of late fetal deaths plus infant deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live births plus late fetal deaths .
Column 3 - Postneonatal Mortality : Number of postneonatal deaths per 1,000 live births .
Mortality rates ( per 1,000 ) , 1990 ( 29 ) Infant Feto- infant Postneonatal Japan 4.60 8.38 1.99 Finland 5.64 8.76 1.91 Sweden 5.96 9.50 2.46 Hong Kong 6.13 10.23 2.33 Singapore 6.67 10.65 2.01 Canada 6.82 10.72 2.21 Switzerland 6.83 11.42 3.05 West Germany 6.98 10.37 3.44 Norway 7.02 11.55 3.10 Netherlands 7.06 12.74 2.42 France 7.33 13.66 3.79 East Germany 7.33 12.73 2.84 Denmark 7.39 12.03 2.84 Northern Ireland 7.47 11.45 3.48 Scotland 7.73 12.92 3.35 Austria 7.84 11.39 3.41 England and Wales 7.88 12.44 3.32 Belgium 7.94 15.58 4.05 Spain 8.07 13.30 2.95 Australia 8.17 12.06 3.31 Ireland 8.20 14.25 3.57 New Zealand 8.31 12.37 4.24 Italy 8.53 13.96 2.08 United States 9.22 13.21 3.38 Greece 9.32 16.39 2.81 Israel 9.84 13.96 3.46 Cuba 10.74 22.67 3.91
According to a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control , infant mortality rates were 60 percent higher for women living below the poverty line compared with women living above the poverty line .
The study found that poverty was " as large " a factor as a pregnant mother 's cigarette smoking or inadequate medical care .
( 30 ) In 1992 , there were 34,628 cases of infant mortality .
( 31 )
If the U.S. were to reduce this rate from 9.22 to 7 per 100,000 , then it could save the lives of 5,600 infants a year .
Another study by the CDC found that black women died from complications of pregnancy , childbirth and puerperium three and a half times more often than whites ( 18.1 to 5.0 per 1,000 , age - adjusted ) . ( 32 )
If the black rate were lowered to the white rate , the lives of 17,600 women a year would be saved . ( 33 )
Death rate of 1 - to - 4 year olds ( per community of 200,000 per year ) ( 34 ) United States 101.5 Japan 92.2 Norway 90.2 Denmark 85.1 France 84.9 United Kingdom 82.2 Canada 82.1 Netherlands 80.3 Germany 77.6 Switzerland 72.5 Sweden 64.7 Finland 53.3
Death rate of 15 - to - 24 year olds ( per community of 200,000 per year ) ( 35 ) United States 203 Switzerland 175 Canada 161 France 156 Finland 154 Norway 128 Germany 122 Denmark 120 United Kingdom 114 Sweden 109 Japan 96 Netherlands 90 Note : the murder rate for the above age group is 48.8 per 200,000 .
Even subtracting this entirely still puts the U.S. near the top of the list .
Premature Death ( years of life lost before the age of 64 per 100 people ) ( 36 ) United States 5.8 years Denmark 4.9 Finland 4.8 Canada 4.5 Germany 4.5 United Kingdom 4.4 Norway 4.3 Switzerland 4.1 Netherlands 4.0 Sweden 3.8 Japan 3.3 Life Expectancy ( years ) ( 37 ) Men Women Japan 76.2 82.5 France 72.9 81.3 Switzerland 74.1 81.3 Netherlands 73.7 80.5 Sweden 74.2 80.4 Canada 73.4 80.3 Norway 73.1 79.7 Germany 72.6 79.2 Finland 70.7 78.8 United States 71.6 78.6 United Kingdom 72.7 78.2 Denmark 72.2 77.9
And this is to mention nothing of the 40,015 who died from AIDS in 1993 .
( 38 ) True , AIDS is incurable at the moment , but that could very well be the result of opposition by Congressional conservatives against increasing AIDS research .
Furthermore , the AIDS rate can be significantly reduced by education about prevention .
However , conservatives have opposed funding such education as well , with the result that large portions of America remain ignorant about the basics of this modern plague .
THE GRAND TOTAL
The above list of how Americans are really murdered is far from complete , but it gives us a start in comparing the official murder rate to the real one .
Once again , this is how the FBI counted murders for 1993 :
FBI Murder Count , 1993 ( FBI ) Guns 16,200 Cutting or stabbing 2,960 Blunt objects 1,020 Personal 1,160 Strangulations , Asphyxiations 442 Fire 209 All others 1,280 ---------------------------
Total 23,271
Now let 's calculate the real rate .
To be certain , not even the most aggressive programs can completely eliminate job accidents , pollution and infant mortality .
Therefore , we can list only a percentage of the total fatalities , on the grounds that these abnormally high rates can be reduced with properly funded programs .
For most cases I will use only 25 percent of the total fatality rate .
Keep in mind that the total fatality rates used here are extremely conservative ones , and the list itself is very incomplete .
Partial and conservative list of actual murder counts ( early 1990's ) : Cause Deaths Portion of total
-------------------------------------------------------
Job-related deaths 17,500 ( 25 percent of total ) Particulate air pollution 20,000 ( of 64,000 ) Consumer products 5,425 ( 25 percent of total ) Cigarettes 104,750 ( 25 percent of total ) Second - hand smoke 3,000 ( 100 percent of total )
Unnecessary surgery 16,000 ( 100 percent of total )
Unnecessary prescriptions 2,000 ( lowest estimate ) Infant Mortality 5,600 ( Rate reduction from 9.22 to 7 percent ) Coronary Heart Disease 122,493 ( 25 percent of total )
Black pregnancy deaths 17,600 ( Rate reduction from 18.1 to 5.0 per 1,000 . )
AIDS 4,000 ( 10 percent of total )
---------------------------------------------------------
Total 318,368
The real murder rate is at least 13 times the official one .
It should be noted that this list does not count all the general deaths attributable to poverty , which would add hundreds of thousands more to the final count .
In closing , the middle and upper class are guilty of hypocrisy when they single out lower class crime for especial criticism .
The tools that the upper class uses -- lobbyists , deregulation , safety shortcuts , heightened production quotas -- do not seem as terrifying as the tools that a stereotypical criminal uses -- guns , knives , fists , etc .
But the results are just as deadly , and far more widespread .

A $ 50 billion plan to build new rail , busways , streetcars and cycling amenities will double the number of Toronto - area transit trips in 25 years .
The plan , released today by Metrolinx , includes no recommendations for road tolls or other taxes to pay for the transit improvements that are being called the most ambitions of our life time .
The experience of the other cities shows it is best to offer transportation alternatives before asking people to pay new fees , Metrolix chair Rob MacIsaac said .
Most of the proposals for improvement to GO Transit , TTC , and regional services were contained within Ontario Government MoveOntario2020 plan announced last year .
But the regional connections have been refined , he said .
When implemented in 25 years , 75 per cent of Toronto area residents would live within two kilometres of a dedicated transit line .

Lance Armstrong will make his much - anticipated return to professional cycling with Kazakhstan 's Astana team .
The Luxembourg - based team is run by Armstrong 's friend and former sporting director Johan Bruyneel , who helped the American win all of his seven Tours .
The 37 - year - old Armstrong will race in Australia in January but was cautious about aiming for an eighth Tour win .
" I will try to be as prepared as possible .
I do n't know that that equals victory , " he said in New York .
" I have a fair bit of confidence , but not that kind of confidence .
I do n't know , honestly .
I 've been off the bike three years .
I 'll be nearly 38 years old , so I honestly do n't know . "
606 : DEBATE
Why risk losing the best rider in the world to accommodate a guy who 's only likely to be around for one year ?
Tom F - BBC Sport Armstrong also suggested he might be tempted to race in the 2010 season as well .
" I do n't want to box myself in here , " he said .
" It 's open - ended .
I see one season but I would n't want to rule out a second season .
I will take it season by season . "
Armstrong , a survivor of testicular cancer , will start the six - day Tour Down Under race around South Australia , centring on Adelaide , on 20 January and is also planning a global summit to raise cancer awareness in Paris after next year 's Tour .
" I look forward to 2009 , I look forward to racing again , " said Armstrong .
" I cannot guarantee an eighth Tour victory , but I can guarantee you the ' Live Strong ' message will touch all aspects of our society .
" It 's not very often someone gets a chance to spend three or fours years away from something , step back , and then say to themselves , ' I sort of miss that , I 'd like to go back and do that again . "
With his career dogged by doping allegations , Armstrong will undergo a testing programme developed and headed up by U.S. anti-doping expert Don Catlin when he returns to cycling .
But the former head of the World Anti-Doping Agency Dick Pound demanded any testing should be conducted by an International Olympic Committee or WADA accredited laboratory .
" If it 's not an ( IOC ) accredited laboratory the mere fact scientist X says ' I think Lance is ok ' ( means nothing ) , " said Pound .
The Kazakh - financed Astana team suffered two high - profile doping scandals in 2007 and were barred from this year 's Tour de France despite a substantial overhaul in team management .
Kazakh rider Alexandre Vinokourov , the old Astana team leader , tested positive for blood doping after winning a time - trial stage of the 2007 Tour , and was subsequently sacked and banned for a year .

Astana 's current leader Alberto Contador , 2007 Tour de France winner and only the fifth rider in history to win all of cycling 's three major Tours when he won the Tour of Spain , has previously hinted the American 's presence could cause conflict .
But the Spaniard said suggestions he would leave Astana were " too premature " .
" I am going to calmly talk to the team and depending on how it goes , we will see what we do . "
And Armstrong said he was looking forward to racing with the Spaniard .
" Alberto is the best rider on the planet right now , " he said .
" We have to understand that , have to respect that .
I 'm not sure I can ride that fast right now .
I hope it works out . "
One rider who believes there could be problems for the Astana team is the Republic of Ireland 's 1987 Tour winner Stephen Roche .
" I could see ( Contador ) walking away .
He 's finally getting credibility and now next year everybody will be talking about Armstrong .
It 's going to be very difficult , " Roche told BBC Radio 5 Live .
The 49 - year - old , whose racing career spanned 13 years , was also asked whether Armstrong had a chance of winning the Tour .
" I do n't think so , " he replied .
Bruyneel said he was honoured and looking forward to working with Armstrong again , 10 years after being asked to direct the rider 's US Postal Service team .

" What we saw from 1999 to 2005 was arguably the most exciting time in professional cycling and I know Lance will bring the same level of charisma , passion and influence to the team , sport and global cancer community , " he said .
Armstrong nearly lost his life to cancer before battling back to win his first Tour in 1999 .
International Cycling Union president Pat McQuaid told BBC Radio 5
Live he did not think Armstrong 's " primary motivation " was to win the Tour.
McQuaid said : " I think he has done as much as he can with his cancer foundation in terms of knowledge of it in the US and now he wants to globalise the foundation using the sport of cycling .
" Winning the Tour is secondary but I think he has every intention of trying to do it . "

What are these ?
In an afterword to his 2005 novel STATE OF FEAR ( 1 ) , Michael Crichton called attention to the sudden appearance and continuing use of “ crisis ” in the headlines of American newspapers .
He attributes it to a deliberate attempt to keep the American people in a panic to pave the way for the growth of government powers and a transfer of legislative power from the Congress to “ the experts ” in the bureaucracy and the Universities .
During the Clinton and Bush administrations we have faced a constant stream of these crises .
The Social Security crisis , the Global Warning crisis , the Terror War crisis with its stepchild Iraq crisis , followed by the Iran nuclear crisis .
And now the Financial Meltdown crisis .
The curent problems in the financial services industry are real and they are serious .
They were also predictable , preventable , and brought on either deliberately or thoughtlessly by the Bush and Clinton administrations and the Federal reserve under both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke .
And now the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve are using the ' crisis ” to increase the power of the agencies which caused it .
After the election of 1994 , which returned a Republican majority to the Congress in part because of a stumble by the stock market amd a fear of “ stagnation of the economy ” , the Federal Reserve began lowering interest rates .
The move did revive the stock market , but the decline of the American economy and the loss of manufacturing continued .
In fact , for several years , the increase in stock market prices had been driven almost entirely by speculation , just as the stock market growth of the 1920s had been .
The economist John Kenneth Galbraith , in his study of the great crash of 1929 pointed out , as speculative market–a “ bubble ” – can only end in a crash .
If it crashes early , it is serious but manageable .
But the longer it is allowed to go on , the greater the crash .
( 2 ) .
In a market driven by speculation , the buyer of stock is not interested in deriving income from dividends or using his puchase as a way of securing his wealth .
He is interested only in the fastest possible increase in value in the shortest possible time .
A speculative market will continue to rise as long as the price is constantly increasing , that is , as long as there are other speculators who will buy your stock for more than you paid .
The open domination of the stock market in the 1990s by “ day traders ” was a tell - tale sign that this was a “ bubble ”
And when a the price stops rising , the collpase is not to a reasonable price but a complete collapse ( 3 ) .
In 1995 , the Clinton administration and the Federal Reserve should not have lowered the interest rate , but instead endured a downturn to prevent the current crisis .
But the Federal Reserve went on lowering the interest rate .
When the market stumbled again , it went on lowering the interest rate .
The stock market did not respond , but a new “ bubble ” in the real estate market was created , and encouraged by the Bush administration and by the Federal Reserve , which went on cutting interest rates and encouraging banks and insurance companies , to engage in making or investing in increasingly risky loans and speculators and home owners to borrow money they knew they could not repay .
In this crisis , created by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department , the Fed and the Treasury have shown neither repentence nor a commitment to change their behavior .
Instead they are continuing to offer the financial institutions low cost loans and asking for the power to fiddle with the economy some more without any oversight by either the congress or the courts ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
Two days ago , I wrote an article , “ Crunch Time for the Candidates ” in which I said that the declaration of this crisis and the demand that the Congress grant unrestricted power to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department , and the demand that congress act within days , were manufactured to commit the two major party candidates for President to the policies of the Bush administration .
I said that it was time for the candidates to stand against an immediate bailout , to modify their promises if necessary , and to unite their respective parties behind them .
Both have failed the test .
Senator Obama has issued a statement in which , while he offers some criticism , assumes that the Bush request , with minor tweaking will be passed and does not imply a serious investigation of the causes of the crisis before major new powers are granted to the Federal Reserve and the executive branch .
Instead of offering meaningful alternatives ( including doing nothing ) , he follows the leadership of the Democratic majority leaders in Congress rather than assuming leadership himself .
What they want is minimal congressional oversight , a number of additional regulations and a limit on CEO salaries of those receiving funding from the government , possibly a first step by the Democratic Party in adding a Maximum Wage Law to the Minimum Wage Law already on the books .
Senator McCain joins Senator Obama in proposing new regulations , although he is vaguer about what the regulations should be , and in calling for congressional oversight .
But his major efforts with regard to the crisis still seem to be focused on putting some people in prison and firing some others .
Senators Obama and McCain are right that there are certainly criminal acts to be uncovered in the financial services industry .
But to return to 1929 , Galbraith points out with regard to the crimes of the bankers and the businessmen of that time , that there is always embezzlement and fraud going on in the market place .
But there is always more crime in good times than in bad , and that the embezzlement and fraud of the 1920s did not cause the crash , but were exposed by it .
We have all noticed this with the cases of World .
Com and Enron .
There was criminal activity in the two corporations , and when the stock dropped and the embezzlement and fraud could not be easily covered up , some people went to prison .
But their actions , however reprehensible , did not cause the stock to go down .
The fall of the stock revealed the crimes .
As for more regulations , we need to face the fact that regulations to prevent the crisis ( and , for that matter , the great crash of 1929 ) are already in existence .
That they were not properly used might justify some firings , but the firing of a few individuals would not guarantee that their replacements would do a better job .
The Federal Reserve system has been around since 1913 ( [ link edited for length ] ) , the F.D.I.C. since 1933 ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
They are supposed to prevent crises , not demand more powers to deal with one .
In the 1988 edition of his book , Galbraith still believed that the regulatory system might still be sufficient to prevent another Great Depression “ Yet all this reinforcement notwithstanding , it would be unwise to expose the economy to the shock of another major speculative collapse .
Some of the new reinforcements might buckle . ” ( 4 ) Well , budkle they did .
And now it is proposed to prop them up to pretend , again , that all is well .
The proposals of McCain and Obama about Congressional oversight sound hollow in light of the fact and Senator Dodd , the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee admited that he was taken completely by surprise by the bailout of AIG , and then announced , Joined by Senator Judd Gregg , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , that all the shoes had dropped , and there would be no more bailouts ( [ link edited for length ] .
If there is to be Congressional oversight , it should not be tacked on to a massive bailout .
It should begin with a thorough investigation of why all the regulations and all the regulators put in place to prevent this kind of collapse not only allowed but encouraged the behavior which it was meant to guard against .
Congress should not be signing off on a bailout of the negligent regulators , it should be considering scrapping the system and taking a more active role in issuing currency and regulating its value , as is its constitutional duty .
In June , I wrote an article saying that the United States in drifting toward dictatorship largely because of the irresponsibility of the Congress ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
This article can be regarded as part two of the same discourse .

' Unfit for Command ' author : Obama favors killing living babies David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Jerome Corsi , co-author of the book Unfit for Command which swiftboated John Kerry in 2004 , has now leaped into the 2008 campaign with Obama Nation , a book which Media Matters finds " contains numerous falsehoods about Sen. Barack Obama . "
" I wrote the book because of Obama 's far - left politics , " Corsi told the hosts of Fox & Friends on Tuesday .
" I mean , the idea that we 're going to have windfall profits and take from the oil companies and distribute thousand - dollar checks to poor people is radical redistribution of wealth . "
" This book is full of innuendos , misstatements , lies , " former Walter Mondale campaign manager Bob Beckel retorted , challenging Corsi 's accusations that Obama has never proved he stopped using drugs in college and that he regarded Malcolm X as his " mentor . "
" You say whatever is necessary to get you power , " Corsi insisted , charging that Obama is a diehard left - wing radical who is concealing his true beliefs by pretending to be a moderate .
" Take this black liberation theology , which is a revolutionary theology that blacks need to organize around a figure to get rid of us , the capital imperialists . "
Beckel later asked , " You say that Barack Obama supported a bill to allow mothers to kill their babies even after they were born .
...
Do you actually believe that to be true ? "
Corsi insisted that after an incident in Illinois where an infant had survived for 45 minutes following a late - term abortion , Obama had " said that woman had an absolute right to abortion , to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion . "
" That is patently untrue , " Beckel countered , to which Corsi replied , " You have n't looked at the case . "
According to Seth Colter Walls , the " infanticide " charge against Obama stems from his " present " vote on a bill debated in Illinois in 2001 that " would have required that any ' viable ' fetus surviving a late - term abortion receive sustaining medical care ( something which opponents of that bill said was already required by a 1975 bill in the state ) . "
Media Matters further explains that Obama's " present " vote was the result of a deliberate strategy worked out in concern with Planned Parenthood : " We at Planned Parenthood view those as leadership votes , " Pam Sutherland , the president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council , told ABC News .
" We worked with him specifically on his strategy .
The Republicans were in control of the Illinois Senate at the time .
They loved to hold votes on ' partial birth ' and ' born alive ' .
They put these bills out all the time ... because they wanted to pigeonhole Democrats .
...
He came to me and said : ' My members are being attacked .
We need to figure out a way to protect members and to protect women . ' "
Beckel then offered to " give you a couple of other Corsi comments , just so people can understand the person writing this book . "
He cited three examples , seemingly taken directly from a 2004 Media Matters article , where they appear as follows : Corsi on Muslims : " RAGHEADS are Boy -Bumpers as clearly as they are Women - Haters -- it all goes together "
Corsi on " John F*ing Commie Kerry " : " After he married TerRAHsa , did n't John Kerry begin practicing Judiasm ?
He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish .
What religion is John Kerry ? "
Corsi on Senator " FAT HOG " Clinton : " Anybody ask why HELLary could n't keep BJ Bill satisfied ?
Not lesbo or anything , is she ? "
" They 're old comments , long ago apologized for , " Corsi insisted with a trace of embarrassment .
" You 're going back to things that are ancient . "
" You say you have 600 sources , " Beckel concluded .
" Most of those sources are people who have right - wing agendas .
...
If you 're holding out here to be an expert on Barack Obama ... you have to understand why some of us question ... not only your book but also your history . "

Partial transcript BECKEL : Let me make a couple other points you make in this book .
You said that Barack Obama supported a bill to allow mothers to kill their babies even after they were born .
Now , are they going to use knives , guns or how are going to do that ?
Do you actually believe that to be true ?
CORSI : It 's true .
BECKEL : Oh , come on .
CORSI : Bob , I quoted him from the Illinois Senate floor .
This was a case of a baby that survived an abortion attempt -- late term , forced labor abortion -- and the nurse who is very famous out in Illinois held this baby for 45 minutes , took it from the linen closet .
The baby had down syndrome until the baby died .
BECKLE : The baby died .
CORSI : And Obama , on the floor of the Illinois State Senate , said that woman had an absolute right to abortion , to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion .
BECKEL : That is patently untrue .
CORSI : Well , you have n't looked at the case .
I 'm sorry .
Fl. man charged with Obama assassination threat Associated Press
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email This UPDATE : Click here to read the Secret Service affidavit .
MIAMI - A man who authorities said was keeping weapons and military - style gear in his hotel room and car appeared in court Thursday on charges he threatened to assassinate Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Raymond Hunter Geisel , 22 , was arrested by the Secret Service on Saturday in Miami and was ordered held at Miami 's downtown detention center without bail Thursday by a federal magistrate .
A Secret Service affidavit charges that Geisel made the threat during a training class for bail bondsmen in Miami in late July .
According to someone else in the 48 - member class , Geisel allegedly referred to Obama with a racial epithet and continued , " If he gets elected , I 'll assassinate him myself . "
Obama was most recently in Florida on Aug. 1 - 2 but did not visit the South Florida area .
Another person in the class quoted Geisel as saying that " he hated George W. Bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the president 's head , " according to the Secret Service .
Geisel denied in a written statement to a Secret Service agent that he ever made those threats , and the documents do n't indicate that he ever took steps to carry out any assassination .
He was charged only with threatening Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , but not for any threat against President Bush .
Geisel 's court - appointed attorney declined comment .
The charge of threatening a major candidate for president or vice president carries a maximum prison sentence of five years .
The Obama campaign declined comment Thursday on the alleged threat .
In the interview with a Secret Service agent , Geisel said " if he wanted to kill Senator Obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle , but then he claimed that he was just joking , " according to court documents .
A search of Geisel 's 1998 Ford Explorer and hotel room in Miami uncovered a loaded 9 mm handgun , knives , dozens of rounds of ammunition including armor - piercing types , body armor , military - style fatigues and a machete .
The SUV , which has Maine license plates , was wired with flashing red and yellow emergency lights .
Geisel told the Secret Service he was originally from Bangor , Maine , and had been living recently in a houseboat in the Florida Keys town of Marathon , according to court documents .
He said he used the handgun for training for the bail bondsman class , had the knives for protection and used the machete to cut brush in Maine .
In the affidavit , the Secret Service said Geisel told agents that he suffered from psychiatric problems including post - traumatic stress disorder , but he could n't provide the names of any facilities where he sought treatment .
" You can't be a rational person six days of the week and put on a suit and make rational decisions and go to work and , on one day of the week , go to a building and think you 're drinking the blood of a 2,000 - year - old space god , " comedian and atheist Bill Maher said earlier this year on " Late Night With Conan O'Brien . "
On the " Saturday Night Live " season debut last week , homeschooling families were portrayed as fundamentalists with bad haircuts who fear biology .
Actor Matt Damon recently disparaged Sarah Palin by referring to ...
Joe Biden gave a speech today in Cincinnati where he ripped into the failed Bush / McCain foreign policy , and laid out clearly the different approach he and Obama would take to keep us safe and regain our good standing in the world .
This week , John talked about the judgment required to be Commander in Chief .
He ’s right : nothing is more important than judgment .
But time and again , on the most critical national security issues of our time , John McCain ’s judgment was wrong .
John is more than wrong -- he is dangerously wrong .
On a question so basic , so fundamental , so critical to our nation ’s security , we ca n’t afford a Commander - in Chief so divorced from reality and from America ’s most basic national interests .
Full transcript below the fold :
Later this week , Barack Obama and John McCain will come together to debate a president ’s most important responsibility : how to keep Americans safe and America secure .
It will be their first presidential debate – but in many ways it ’s a debate we ’ve been having as a nation for the past eight years .
And the outcome of that debate has already been decided .
Now , just as most Americans believe we are on the wrong track at home , so too have they come to the conclusion that we ’ve been heading in the wrong direction abroad .
Our country is less secure and more isolated than it has been at any time in recent history .
This administration has dug America into a very deep hole around the world at a time our leadership is needed to meet the challenges of the 21st century .
“ A central question for this election is which candidate will keep digging that hole … and which candidate will dig us out of that hole – indeed which candidate has the judgment and the vision to renew the promise of America in the world .
It wo n’t surprise you who I believe that candidate is : Barack Obama .
But it is equally clear who that candidate is not : John McCain .
… the policies he would pursue as president would be wrong for America – nowhere more so than with our security and standing in the world .
This week , John talked about the judgment required to be Commander in Chief .
He ’s right : nothing is more important than judgment .
But time and again , on the most critical national security issues of our time , John McCain ’s judgment was wrong .
Right after the terrorists attacked us on 9 - 11 , John responded by urging that we consider attacking countries other than Afghanistan , including Iraq , Iran and Syria .
In the run up to the war in Iraq , John insisted that we would be greeted as liberators … that we did n’t need a lot of troops … that victory was imminent .
Then , he said he was n’t worried about Afghanistan … that we would “ muddle through ” … and he declared Afghanistan to be “ a remarkable success .
In John ’s judgment , there is nothing to talk about with Tehran .
And he has one idea for dealing with Russia : kick it out of the Group of Eight nations .
In John ’s judgment , it is not the federal government ’s responsibility to protect us here at home .
He voted again and again against fully funding cops and firefighters … against interoperable communications so that our first responders can talk to each other … against screening more cargo on planes and ships … against better security for our tunnels , trains , ports and chemical plants .
It is John ’s judgment that six years into the war in Iraq , we should keep spending $ 10 billion a month … indefinitely … at a time Iraq is running an $ 80 billion surplus .
And John McCain continues to insist , against all the evidence and all the facts , that Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism … and not the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan where the people who actually attacked us on 9 - 11 reside and are regrouping .
John is more than wrong -- he is dangerously wrong .
On a question so basic , so fundamental , so critical to our nation ’s security , we ca n’t afford a Commander - in Chief so divorced from reality and from America ’s most basic national interests .
Time and again , Barack Obama has demonstrated the judgment we need in our next president … and the vision to see over the horizon .
Seven years ago , Barack Obama opposed one of the most disastrous decisions in the history of American foreign policy : the diversion of our military might , our resources and focus from Afghanistan to Iraq .
He was profoundly right .
Now , he is right again : Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly .
He will be as careful getting out as George Bush and John McCain were careless getting in .
He knows we should not keep spending $ 10 billion a month indefinitely while the Iraqis are running a $ 79 billion surplus – which is why he will start to shift responsibility to the Iraqis … bring our combat brigades home over a period of 16 months … lead a diplomatic surge with the world ’s great powers and Iraq ’s neighbors to press for a political power sharing agreement … and keep a residual force in Iraq to destroy any remaining terrorists , train Iraqis and protect our personnel .
Barack Obama understands what John McCain does not : the next President must be more than the Commander - in - Chief for Iraq .
He must be Commander - in - Chief for America ’s security around the world .
Mark my words : if , God forbid , there is another major attack on America , it will not come from Iraq .
It will almost certainly come from the Afghanistan - Pakistan border – where the Bush / McCain approach let down our guard and let our enemies off the hook .
And unlike John McCain – who opposed Barack Obama ’s call to take out the high - level terrorist targets in Pakistan and called it “ bombing our ally ” – we will not tolerate a terrorist sanctuary in Pakistan .
If Pakistan cannot or will not act , we will take out high - level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our sights .
Barack Obama has been clear : no country poses a greater security challenge to the United States , Israel and our allies than Iran .
Under the policies George Bush has pursued and John McCain would continue , Iran , not freedom , has been on the march .
Iran is much closer to the bomb ; its influence in Iraq is expanding ; its terrorist proxy Hezbollah is ascendant in Lebanon ; its ally , Hamas controls Gaza and launches rockets at Israel .
Beyond bluster , what would John McCain actually do about these dangers ?
He does n’t say .
The worst nightmare for a regime that thrives on isolation and tension is an America ready , willing and able to engage .
Since when has talking removed the word “ no ” from our vocabulary ?
It ’s amazing how little faith John McCain has in himself and in America .
So ask yourself : based on the judgments they have made and the policies they have proposed , which candidate is more likely as president to end the war in Iraq responsibly … to focus America ’s full might on Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan … to unite our allies in dealing effectively with Iran and Russia … to renew the promise of America in the world ?
The answer is clear .
There ’s a short list of the forces shaping the 21st Century .
No one country can control these forces , but more than any other country , we have an ability to affect them – if we use the totality of our strength .
That means maintaining the finest fighting force in the world – not pushing it to the breaking point … rebuilding our alliances , partnerships and international institutions – not disparaging them … strengthening our diplomacy -- not disdaining it … and using our economic might , not putting it in jeopardy .
Barack Obama understands that strength and wisdom go hand in hand … that the power of our example is as important and the example of our power … and that its only leadership when others join us in the struggle for freedom , security , prosperity , and progress .
Barack Obama will keep our citizens safe .
He will keep our country secure .
And he will answer the yearning , at home and around the world , for an American foreign policy that is once again as good and strong as the American people .

Ad Council
In case you ’ve had your head in a bucket for the last month or so and have n’t noticed what ’s going on in the world of US government economic policy :
Major financial institutions have been collapsing left and right .
Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch for pennies on the dollar , thanks to a subsidy provided by Uncle Sam .
Before that , Bear Stearns got similar treatment , being bought for pennies on the dollar by JP Morgan Chase .
AIG , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac all got bailed out by the Federal Reserve — money was pumped into them so they ’d stay afloat , thus insulating them against the consequences of their own incredibly stupid actions .
All this crap is the result of tons of bad , awful investments , offering terrible loans to abysmal - risk borrowers .
Much of the reason for that is Clinton - era policy that encouraged loaning money so people who ca n’t afford to buy homes and expand marginal businesses would then buy homes and expand their marginal businesses , specifically to help urban development .
While the Bush administration has done nothing to correct the matter , as far as I ’m aware , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s statements to the effect that George W. Bush should apologize to the American people for “ causing ” the current financial crisis are somewhat off the mark .
. . . to say nothing of the forty years or so of piss - poor economic policy under a long line of crappy Presidents before Clinton came on the scene , all of which set the stage for Clinton ’s gaffe .
Now , Ben Bernanke ( chairman of the Federal Reserve board ) and Henry Paulson ( Treasury Secretary and IMF board member ) are trying to harangue Congress into approving a $ 700 billion bailout for more failing organizations considered “ too big to fail ” by supposed fiscal wizards like them .
Let ’s have another , more literal look at that number :
$ 700,000,000,000.00
It ’s a big number .
The US government could save about a hundred billion dollars and still give every motherfucker in the United States $ 2,000 .
The US government could save about a hundred billion dollars and still give every motherfucker in the world $ 100 .
Every .
Mother .
Fucker .
In . The .
World .
One hundred dollars .
Shit .
Do you have any idea how long $ 100 can feed a kid in Darfur ?
Seriously , that is an insane amount of money for what amounts to a one - shot corporate subsidy .
Anyone seriously considering supporting this deal must not have had to buy his or her own milk for at least twenty years .
They all probably have maids pour their cereal for them so they do n’t even have to look at the milk jug , or for that matter the refrigerator .
No , scratch that .
I bet cereal ’s too gauche for them .
They must have Eggs Benedict every morning , cooked over their $ 100 - bill - fired stove by diligent and internationally respected four - star chefs .
Seriously , folks — $ 700 billion .
I guess maybe it takes at least a trillion to start looking like real money to a Congresscritter these days .
Read this advice for communicating with Congress .
It ’s okay , I ’ll wait .
Done ?
Okay , good .
Now , find a contact number for your Representative and give him or her a call .
Tell him or her how much you hate this idea , and how he or she has lost your vote if he or she votes for this piece of shit idea .
Seven hundred billion dollars .
Criminy .
Of course , when you call , you should be polite and essentially formal about it .
Try something akin to :
Hello , my name is [ your name here ] and I am a constituent of [ representative ’s name here ] .
I am calling today to urge [ him / her ] to oppose the seven hundred billion dollar bailout .
My vote this November may depend on how [ he / she ] votes on this issue .
Thank you .
Make sure you read the page about how to communicate with your Congresscritters .
Do n’t use the tone I use for most of this SOB entry .
You want to be considered an important constituent , and not a “ crank ” ( i.e. , someone smarter than anyone in Congress ) who ’d never vote for your incumbent Congresscritters in the first place .
Petrobras CEO José Sergio Gabrielli was flush with bullish insights when he stopped by the Journal 's New York office last week to talk about the Brazilian oil company .
One reason for Mr. Gabrielli 's optimism is last year 's discovery of the offshore Tupi field , which is said to contain between five billion and eight billion barrels of black gold .
Another , equally important reason is that , according to Mr. Gabrielli , neither environmentalists nor Brazilian politicians have raised concerns about exploiting oil in the waters off the Brazilian coast .
That 's quite a contrast with attitudes in the U.S. , where offshore exploration and development has been all but shut down save in the Gulf of Mexico .
One company official explains the difference by saying that Brazilians understand the importance of energy to their future , while Americans do not .
I have another theory .
And mine fits the pattern of resource development – or lack thereof – all over the Western Hemisphere .
It comes down to this :
Where government has the property right , restrictions on development tend to be low .
But when the private sector is the owner , environmental concerns blossom .
Exhibit A is Petrobras .
Not only did Mr. Gabrielli say there is no appetite for stopping offshore projects in his country .
He went further .
" Brazil has one of the freest and most investor - oriented regulation in the world .
Even freer than the United States of America , " he said , referring to the climate for oil exploration .
Sarah Palin has spoken .
Ms. Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , has been kept largely under wraps since she was named to the ticket nearly a month ago : she has not had a single news conference , and she has canceled all but one of her fund raisers , where she might have to answer impromptu questions .
And reporters traveling with her have expressed frustration that she declines to answer the questions they call out to her at every stop .
But on Thursday , despite the McCain - Palin campaign saying they would suspend campaigning until Congress had dealt with the financial crisis , Ms. Palin made a campaign stop at ground zero in Lower Manhattan , and finally “ fielded ” four questions , according to a reporter in the small pool of journalists assigned to accompany her .
“ Notice I wrote ‘ fielded ’ since she did n’t exactly answer them , ” the reporter , Ken Vogel of Politico , wrote in his notes sent out to other reporters following the campaign .
Her answers dealt mostly with her approach to terrorism , but she also declined to endorse Senator Ted Stevens , her state ’s beloved elder statesman now on trial for corruption -– and up for re-election .
Ms. Palin opened saying : “ Every American student needs to come through this area so that , especially this younger generation of Americans is , to be in a position of never forgetting what happened here and never repeating , never allowing a repeat of what happened here .
“ I wish every American would come through here , ” she continued .
“ I wish every world leader would come through here , and understand what it is that took place here , and more importantly , how America came together and united to commit to never allowing this to happen again .
And just to hear from and see these good New Yorkers who are rebuilding not just this are but helping to rebuild America has been very , very inspiring and encouraging .
These are the good Americans who are committed to peace and security and it ’s been an absolute honor getting to meet these folks today . ”
First question : “ Do you agree with the way the Bush administration has carried out the war on terror ?
Is there anything you would have done … ”
Ms. Palin interrupted to answer : “ I agree with the Bush administration that we take the fight to them .
We never again let them come onto our soil and try to destroy not only our democracy , but communities like the community of New York .
Never again .
So yes , I do agree with taking the fight to the terrorists and stopping them over there . ”
“ Do you think that our continued military presences in Iraq and Afghanistan have inflamed Islamic extremists ? ” another reporter asked .
“ I think our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan will lead to further security of our nation , again , because the mission is to take the fight over there .
Do not let them come over here and attempt again what they accomplished here , and that was some destruction .
Terrible destruction on that day .
But since Sept. 11 , Americans uniting and rebuilding and committing to never letting that happen again . ”
“ Do you support the re-election bids of embattled Alaska Republicans , Representative Don Young and Senator Ted Stevens ? ”
“ Ted Stevens ’ trial started a couple of days ago , ” she said , “ We ’ll see where that goes . ”
She ignored a follow - up question about whether she would vote for them .
And last , “ What do you think of the bailout package before Congress ? ”
“ I do n’t support that until the provisions that Senator McCain has offered are implemented in Paulson ’s proposals . ”
Expert : McCain campaign hoping to appeal to ' latent racism ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 21 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow found it hilarious on Monday that the McCain - Palin campaign is now accusing Barack Obama of being a socialist , but she also suggested that there may be " a method to this madness , " in the form of an attempt to whip up racism and resentment of the poor .
Sarah Palin recently stated , " Taking more from ... a small business owner , or from a hard - working family and then redistributing that money according to a politician 's priorities , there are hints of socialism in there . "
John McCain similarly charged in a radio address last Sunday that " Barack Obama 's tax plan would convert the IRS into a giant welfare agency , redistributing massive amounts of wealth . "
" ' Welfare ' ?
Where 'd that come from ? " asked Maddow , calling it " the great racially - divisve codeword from the 80's and 90's -- that has no bearing whatsoever on Barack Obama 's tax policies . "
Maddow suggested , however , that the use of words like " socialism " and " welfare " may indicate the McCain campaign is attempting to evoke the " Bradley effect " -- the possibly mythical idea that black candidates poll higher than their actual support because racist Democrats are ashamed to admit they 're not willing to vote for their own party 's candidate .
Maddow then turned to Melissa Harris - Lacewell .
a Princeton professor of politics and African - American Studies with whom she has previously discussed the Bradley effect , and asked if that might be the intention .
" I do n't think that that 's what 's going on , " Harris - Lacewell replied cautiously .
However , she stated emphatically , " I do think that John McCain and Sarah Palin are clearly , as a context of their campaign , trying to use race as a wedge issue . "
" That 's what ' welfare ' is as a code word , " she continued .
" It 's not quite the same thing as trying to induce a Bradley effect , but it is hoping that there is enough latent racism left in the system that they can use that to defeat Barack Obama . "
Black officials have recently been expressing dismay at what they see as appeals to racism by the McCain - Palin campaign .
Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer recently defended McCain from these charges , saying that " he has been scrupulous in eschewing the race card " and calling it " Orwellian for him to be now so widely vilified as a stoker of racism . "
In the same column , Krauthammer mocked Rachel Maddow 's suggestion that Republican attacks on ACORN represent an " unstated appeal to racial prejudice . "
Lacewell - Harris , hwoever , did not see an appeal to racism as likely to succeed , because Obama currently enjoys broad - based support and great popularity among voters in all categories .
" I think it 's maybe a little bit unfair to think of white Americans as all being represented by the folks that are showing up at the Palin rallies , " she stated .
Lacewell - Harris also found the attacks on redistribution odd , considering that the Republicans have been redistributing wealth upward from the middle class to the wealthiest Americans for the last eight years .
" It 's just a very strange thing , " she stated , " to watch a very wealthy candidate sort of laugh about the idea of sharing , you know , a few of his seven houses with the rest of the country . "

Michigan Messenger :
Last week we reported about Republican plans to use home foreclosure lists to block voters from the polls after James Carabelli , chair of the Macomb County Republican Party , told Michigan Messenger that on election day Republican volunteers will " have a list of foreclosed homes and make sure people are n't voting from those addresses . "
Republican leaders have since disavowed plans to use foreclosure lists as part of their plan to challenge the eligibility of some voters , but an attorney for the party , Eric Doster , did confirm that the party would use returned mail to challenge voters based on residency .
As veteran Republican activist Allen Raymond told Michigan Messenger in a recent interview , holding down Democratic turnout is a key part of Republican strategy for victory in November .
Raymond knows about Republican campaign tactics .
For almost a decade he managed campaigns for Republicans running for state and national office .
In the 2002 New Hampshire elections , he ran a phone - jamming operation aimed at blocking elderly people from arranging rides to the polls , an illegal action that he says was approved by the highest levels of the party .
He spent three months in federal prison .
Earlier this year Raymond published a book about his life and work as a Republican operative , titled " Confessions of a Republican Operative : How to Rig an Election . "
As for our report that the Michigan GOP planned to use foreclosure lists to block likely Democratic voters , Raymond said : " It 's a very good tactic .
It works . "
" It is actually a very smart thing to do , " he went on , " particularly in this climate with so many foreclosures . "
For Republicans , he said , targeting the foreclosures would be a cost - effective and " probably " legal method of reducing Democratic votes .
If he were still in the election business , he said , " I 'd be doing that all day long . "
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The creators are billing it as one of the coolest hostels in the world and it's undoubtedly one of the most novel overnight stays you are ever likely to experience .
Welcome to the Jumbo Hostel -- an old Boeing 747 which is being converted into a 25 - room hostel at the Stockholm - Arlanda airport .
The Jumbo Hostel is currently being refurbished and will open for business in December 2008 .
more photos »
The idea is the brainchild of Swedish businessman and entrepreneur Oscar Dios , who has been running hostels in Uppsala , Sweden for the past five years .
Renovation work is underway on a plane which used to carry in excess of 350 passengers .
Jumbo Hostel is scheduled to open for business in December 2008 and will provide accommodation for up to 85 guests .
CNN spoke to Dios about how he got the project off the ground .
" We were looking to expand the business but it was more or less impossible to find reasonably priced housing at the airport .
And you cannot build a new house and run a hostel because it is too expensive , " he said .
It was in 2006 that Dios first heard about the Boeing 747 , which was for sale .
Formerly flown by the now defunct Transjet Airways , the plane was wasting away in a hangar at Arlanda airport and had n't flown since 2002 .
" The plane was in a terrible state when we first saw it , " he said .
" But we contacted the owners and gave them a fairly good offer , I think . "
Although he was n't prepared to let on exactly how much he paid for the old Boeing , Dios confirmed that the price tag was a six - figure sum ( in euros ) .
Dios took possession of the 1976 Boeing 747-200 -- one of 393 built by the company until 1991 -- in June 2007 and by December he had reached agreement with the airport authorities about his unique proposal .
In August 2008 the plane was finally moved to its permanent home at Arlanda airport 's main entrance , where it will now stay .
Apart from the engines being removed from the wings before purchase , the plane , from the outside , looks almost exactly as it did when it was grounded .
The interior , for obvious reasons , is a different matter .
Dismantling and stripping out all the old equipment and instruments started earlier this year .
The final phase of refurbishment is nearing completion and Dios says it complies with the same building regulations required for a house .
There will be two types of accommodation .
A basic room will be roughly six square meters in size with sleeping space for three adults .
It will cost € 110 ( $ 150 ) per night .
But if you fancy splashing out , you can book the top deck , complete with the cockpit suite , which comes with a private bathroom and panoramic views of takeoffs and landings .
Dios envisages newlyweds taking advantage of this more expensive option , which costs € 500 ( $ 700 ) .
If you do n't want to spend a whole night on board you can hop on and relax in the cafe suite for a couple of hours at a cost of € 25 ( $ 35 ) .
This will also afford you the opportunity of striding out onto the wing and taking in the views of the bustling airport .
While most large commercial planes end up in vast aircraft boneyards , some , like the Jumbo Hostel , find new lives .
New York based urban architects Lot-ek plan to create a library in Guadalajara , Mexico , made by recycling 200 Boeing 727 and 737 fuselages .
And Californian millionaire Francie Rehwald has started building a house from the parts of another scrapped 747 .

Despite rescuers still hammering and shoveling at debris , hopes of finding anybody alive under the sludge , mud and mining waste in northern China after a landslide that killed at least 56 have faded .
Anzeige
The landslide that plowed into buildings Monday in a valley in Shanxi province 's Xiangfen county also injured 35 others and trapped an unknown number of people under the rubble , local officials said .
A low - rise office building , a market and some houses were knocked down by the rapid surge of mud and mining waste , which formed a wall measuring three - stories high and 660 yards ( 600 meters ) wide , according to media reports .
State - run media had initially reported that there were hundreds of people missing , but later cited authorities as saying the figure could not be determined while an investigation was continuing .
Anzeige
The official Xinhua News Agency cited local government official Lian Zhendong as saying rescuers had searched through 70 percent of the rubble .
But local officials said Wednesday they feared the chances of survival were slim .
„ There were survivors on the first day and on the second day , but from day three , it 's very likely that anyone we find in the future will be dead already , “ said a woman surnamed Dong who heads the propaganda department of Xiangfen county .
Dong told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that more than 2,000 police , firefighters and villagers were mobilized in the search , but conditions were difficult .
Anzeige
„ There is mud everywhere , “ said Dong , who was speaking from the site where excavators and front loaders were lifting earth and debris .
„ It is very hard for the machines to drive through the mud . “
Also hampering rescue efforts were the rough terrain , poor telecommunications and heavy rainfall , which halted only on Wednesday , Dong said .
Like many Chinese officials , she refused to give her full name .
The accident underscores two major public safety concerns in China : the failure to enforce protective measures in the country 's notoriously deadly mines , and the unsound state of many of its bridges , dams and other aging infrastructure .
Anzeige
A preliminary investigation showed that the landslide was caused by the collapse of a dam used as a retaining wall to enclose tailings from an iron mine , said Wang Dexue , deputy head of the State Administration of Work Safety .
„ It is an illegal company that was using the abandoned dump to get rid of its production waste , “ Wang said in an interview broadcast on state television .
Heavy rains caused the already overloaded dump to breach , Wang said .
Xinhua said the State Council , China 's Cabinet , will open an investigation into the cause of the landslide while nine people suspected of being responsible for the incident , including the owner of the mine , were detained .
Xinhua said several officials , including the local head of the work safety administration , the village Party secretary and village chief have already been sacked for negligence .

A California appeals court has ruled that homeschooling of children is illegal unless their parents have teaching credentials from the state .
“ California is now on the path to being the only state to deny the vast majority of homeschooling parents their fundamental right to teach their own children at home , ” said Michael Smith , president of the Home School Legal Defense Association .
The court overturned a lower court ’s finding that homeschooling did not constitute a violation of child welfare laws .
“ California courts have held that … parents do not have a constitutional right to homeschool their children , ” Justice H. Walter Croskey said .
The decision stunned parents of the state ’s roughly 166,000 homeschooled children .
While the court claimed that it was merely clarifying an existing law and not making a new one , the decision leaves the parents of homeschooled children at risk of arrest and criminal prosecution .
“ At first , there was a sense of , ‘ No way , ’ ” homeschool parent Loren Mavromati said .
“ Then there was a little bit of fear .
I think it has moved now into indignation . ”
Parents ’ reasons for homeschooling their children range from religious beliefs to dissatisfaction with the education received at public or private schools .
But according to the court , all California children between the ages of 6 and 18 must attend either a full - time public or private school or be taught by a tutor credentialed for their specific grade level .
“ A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school children in good citizenship , patriotism and loyalty to the state and the nation , ” Croskey wrote .
California ’s largest teachers union welcomed the decision as did the Children ’s Law Center of Los Angeles .
According to the law center ’s executive director , Leslie Heimov , children should not be educated at home , because they need to be “ in a place daily where they would be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their ongoing safety . ”

Ageing Mars rover to embark on epic two - year journey to giant crater ... despite wobbly wheel
The ageing but intrepid Mars rover Opportunity is set to embark on a two - year mission it may never complete - a seven - mile journey to a crater far bigger than one it has called home for two years , NASA have revealed .
The golf - cart - sized robot with a wobbly front wheel climbed out of Victoria crater earlier this month and scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California are steering the probe toward a crater more than 20 times larger , dubbed Endeavor .
Great Endeavour :
An artist 's impression of the Mars rover Opportunity , which will make a seven - mile journey from one crater to another over the next two years
But with the rover able to travel only 110 yards per day , the mission control team at JPL said it could take two years for Opportunity to reach its destination .
There is no guarantee the vehicle will survive the trip .
Opportunity , like its twin rover Spirit , semi-idle for the moment on the opposite side of Mars , is well past its original three - month life expectancy .
The seven - mile stretch between Victoria and Endeavor craters matches the total distance the rover already has covered in the four - and - a - half years since landing on the planet .
' We may not get there but it is scientifically the right direction to go anyway , ' said Steve Squyres of Cornell University , the principal science investigator for the project .
' This crater ( Endeavor ) is staggeringly large compared to anything we 've seen before . '
An image taken from the Mars rover Opportunity of a meteorite
The two rovers arrived on Mars in January 2004 to begin an ambitious geologic expedition aimed at finding signs of water , and by extension determining whether the planet was ever sufficiently moist to support life .
The probes are equipped with a range of sophisticated laboratory equipment and cameras to explore rocks and soil on the Martian surface .
Scientists are eager to get a glimpse into Endeavor , a bowl measuring 13.7 miles across , where they expect to find a much deeper stack of rock layers than those at Victoria .
' But even if we never get there , as we move southward we expect to be getting to younger and younger layers of rock on the surface , ' Squyres said .
Mars ' Victoria Crater where the rover Opportunity has spent the past four years .
It is now being moved to the Endeavour crater , which is 20 times bigger
There are also small rocks strewn about the surface on the route , which appear to have been dug up by meteor impacts farther away .
This will give scientists the chance to examine material that otherwise would be too deep to reach .
Opportunity still has the use of all six of its wheels , though the right front wheel can no longer be steered .
Self - navigation software for both rovers was updated in 2006 .
The two probes also benefit from high - resolution pictures of the planet 's surface from NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , which can be used to help JPL teams steering the rovers avoid potential obstacles .
How to handle an unsolved murder , Old Testament style .
Deuteronomy 21:1-9 :
" If in the land which the Lord your God gives you to possess , any one is found slain , lying in the open country , and it is not known who killed him , then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure the distance to the cities that are around him that is slain ; and the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer which has never been worked and which has not pulled in the yoke .
And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
And the priests the sons of Levi shall come forward , for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the Lord , and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled .
And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley , and they shall testify , ' Our hands did not shed this blood , neither did our eyes see it shed .
Forgive , O Lord , thy people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and set not the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel ; but let the guilt of blood be forgiven them . '
So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst , when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord . "
( Revised Standard Version . )
Got that , everybody ?
So .
There are two things that immediately leap to mind about this passage .
Okay , three things , since the very first thing that leaps to mind is a totally baffled , almost hallucinatory , " What the fuck ? "
It makes so little sense that it almost does n't parse at all .
When Ingrid first read it to me ( it 's the opening quotation to the book she 's reading , " Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets " ) , I thought I was hearing it wrong .
It reminds me of nothing more than the Prophets Row scene in " Life of Brian . "
" At this time , a friend shall lose his friend 's hammer .
And the young shall not know where lieth the things possessed by their fathers that their fathers put there only just the night before , about eight o'clock . "
But I think we can take that as a given .
So after the hallucinatory bafflement fades a bit , here 's what immediately leaps to mind about this passage .
One :
This sure blows to smithereens any ideas about the Bible being eternal , perfectly true forever , as useful a guide today as it was when it was written .
As Ingrid pointed out :
How exactly would this principle operate for an unsolved murder today , in , say , New York City ?
If a body washed up in the East River , would they measure whether it landed closer to Manhattan or Brooklyn to decide which city had to slaughter the heifer ?
Would the mayor have to personally do the slaughtering , or would it be okay for the city council to take care of it ?
Or could it be delegated to a special department : a Department of Unsolved Murder Heifer Slaughtering , to replace the Cold Case Squad ?
And given the number of unsolved murders in New York City every year , would they have to keep a special feedlot to raise cows specially for the unsolved murder sacrifices ?
Two :
How was this ever useful ?
Even at the time it was written ?
Even in the Bronze Age ?
What a weird version of justice this is .
Somebody was murdered , you can't punish the person who did it -- so you punish a cow ?
And what a weird vision of God it is .
Why do the city elders have to explain to God that they were n't responsible for the murder ?
Does n't God already know ?
Besides , is God really going to feel better about the injustice of an unpunished murder because an unworked cow gets slaughtered in an unplowed river valley ?
And if they did n't perform this ritual , would God really punish an innocent city just because it happened to be the closest to where a dead body was found ?
( And in fact , as Ingrid pointed out :
How would the elders know that the murder was n't committed by someone in their city ? )
And I 'm back to my totally baffled , " What the fuck ? "
Ingrid keeps saying that I have to be fair : that I have to remember the time and place this was written , and not judge people with a Bronze Age view of the world from my own modern perspective .
They did n't have the information or understanding about how the world works that we have today , but that did n't necessarily make them stupid or crazy .
Grossly mistaken , yes , but not stupid or crazy .
But in a way , that 's exactly my point .
So much of the Bible is written with this sympathetic - magic , burnt - offering , appeasing - the- temperamental - Gods mentality of thousands of years ago .
I mean , fending off the wrath of your god for an unpunished murder by sacrificing a cow ?
With all the weird details about exactly what kind of cow , and where ?
It 's like the Greek or Norse myths .
We 're not talking about a metaphorical scapegoat here , people .
We 're talking about an actual , literal scapegoat .
Or , in this case , a scapecow .
Now , a lot of progressive Christians would no doubt respond by saying , " You 're not supposed to take the Bible literally .
It 's a divinely inspired metaphor , a history of an evolving understanding of God over the ages .
Not all Christians are fundamentalists , and it's unfair to critique all Christianity based on a literal interpretation that many of us do n't adhere to . "
My usual response to that argument -- and the response of countless other atheists -- is , " If you 're going to cherrypick your sacred text , how do you decide which parts are divinely inspired and which parts are human error ?
And if you 're deciding just by using your own instinct and judgment , rooted in the morals of your society , then how is your sacred text any different from any other book of philosophy or history or guidance , where you take what you need and leave the rest ? "
I will , in fact , make that argument again here .
In fact , I just did .
But there 's something else I want to say as well .
And that 's this :
How is this passage a useful guide -- even as a metaphor ?
What is the general principle of life that we can take from this passage ?
That when you can't punish a wrongdoer , it 's an acceptable substitute to punish someone else instead ?
Or to go through a formalized ritual of punishment that bears no real connection with justice , but looks sort of like it ?
Or is the principle at work here a basic " appeasement of God " concept ?
That God is angered by the injustice of an unpunished murder ... and therefore you have to give him sacrifices to chill him out , even if you had nothing to do with it ?
It 's not just that this passage is completely useless as a literal guide to modern law enforcement .
( Although I am getting a kick out of imagining the " Law & Order " episode where the real killer is never found , and Jack McCoy has to go out to the slaughterhouse to wash his hands over a dead cow and remind God that it was n't his fault . )
It 's completely useless as a metaphorical guide to justice .
It 's completely useless as any kind of guide to anything .
I can get more inspiration and guidance from an episode of " Project Runway " than I can from this irrelevant , batshit , Bronze Age guide to life .

A conspiracy theory that says government agencies are using jets to dump poisonous heavy metals into the atmosphere moves today from the realm of late - night talk radio call - in shows to the Shasta County supervisors chambers .
The Shasta County Board of Supervisors , acting as the Air Pollution Control Board , will hear at its 1:30 p.m. meeting a presentation by Dane Wigington and others about “ heavy metal contamination ” — referred to by some as the “ chemtrails ” conspiracy .
Wigington , a 46 - year - old renewable energy consultant from Bella Vista , like a growing number of conspiracy theorists , thinks a government cabal is using jets to dump metals into the atmosphere to combat global warming — or for other , more nefarious purposes .
The theorists say the contrails of the jets provide the most visible evidence of the dumping , since on clear days , the vapor trails are unnaturally slow to dissipate and often appear in gridlike patterns .
But the proof locally is in soil and snow samples , Wigington said .
Area scientists have taken more than 40 samples in the north state , including on the sides of Mt. Shasta , and all of them showed abnormally high levels of heavy metals like aluminum , he said .
The metals are new and in places where they should n’t be , he said .
The dumping may also be contributing to disastrous weather patterns , Wigington said .
“ It ’s tough not to connect to that with what happened in June with the 3,000 - plus lightning strikes we had , ” he said , adding that it ’s important the public hear more about the alleged dumpings ’ detrimental effects on the environment .
“ This is certainly a public health hazard . ”
Shasta County Supervisor Mark Cibula said he requested that the board discuss the matter after receiving requests from community members .
Other board members also have expressed interest on the topic , he said .
Although he ’s not sold on the conspiracy , Cibula said , he thinks it ’s appropriate to hear what Wigington ’s group has to say .
“ Let ’s look at the information and see what we ’ve got there , ” Cibula said .

How much is inside Ramen noodles ?
Top Ramen is the king of noodles .
With a reputation built on eight - for - a - dollar , ten - for - a - dollar , and even 12 - for - a - dollar packaged soup ,
These affordable three - minute meals have supplied life - giving nutrients to innumerable college students .
However , having graduated from the University and forged a respected status in my community , I usually opt for a somewhat classier brand of instant noodle : Sapporo Ichiban .
I refer to it as " the gentleman 's noodle " .
Like all instant ramen , the Sapporo Ichiban package is actually a food kit , containing both a tough block of tangled wheat noodles and a foil envelope containing 8 grams of salt and leek chips .
These futuristic blocks of nutrition were developed by JAXA ( the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency ) in 1974 .
Ramen production started slowly , at only a few dozen blocks per month .
Despite their premium price , the portability and convenience was inescapable .
They caught on immediately with Japanese executives , jet - set businessmen , politicians and anyone else who needed to eat " at the speed of space " .
Increased production and overseas competition allowed the price to fall , eventually allowing middle class families and urban professionals to embrace noodlemania .
In 1981 , the familiar ramen block was joined by a flavor envelope , bolstered by the " Spice it UP ! " and " Em Es Gee ! " Marketing campaigns .
No one seemed to mind that ramen simplicity had become a little less simple .
Everyone associated the little foil envelopes with good times .
The dimensions of the Ramen block are easy to measure : 4 " long , 4 ½ " wide and 1 " thick .
But how long are the noodles within , or is the block really one long noodle , carefully folded in the best traditions of foodigami ?
On Saturday afternoon , we decided to find out .
Mark and I boiled some water and dropped in a block of ramen .
In two minutes , the ramen had softened .
We knew then we were very close to unlocking their secrets .
A close examination revealed that there were many separate noodles , dozens of them !
Mark tried eating directly from the aluminum platter , just like those first JAXAnaughts .
The next step was to stretch out the noodles and measure them .
We moved the noodles outside and began laying them out in a nearby parking lot .
Before we got very far , Tom , Amy , Steve and Elise stopped by to help .
It was a slow , tedious job , but with everyone pitching in , it went by really quick .
It was fun working in a group with the whole gang , just like performing surgery at the hospital !
In fifteen minutes , nearly all the noodles were stretched out .
Finally we were finished , and it was time to measure the noodles .
There were 156 !
The longest were about 25 ½ " long , with an average length of 13 " .
The final numbers were tallied and calculated : 2,049.5 inches of noodle , more than 170 feet !
The next time you are in the mood for a long lunch , cook yourself some instant Ramen , the longest lunch !

Can you believe those ramen noodles claim to have three servings per container ?

The odds are that the victor of the American presidential election on 4 November will secure a clean - cut victory in the electoral college - an absolute majority of 270 votes or more .
But that is n't a guaranteed result .
The closer the election gets - and right now the polls have it very tight indeed - the greater the chance that a tie of 269 to 269 will occur .
Nancy Pelosi :
The next president of the United States ?
There are dozens of ways for the College to tie , given the 51 moving parts : the 50 states ( each state assigned a number of electoral votes equal to the total of its House and Senate delegation ) and the District of Columbia , assigned three electoral votes by constitutional amendment .
However , most of the ties are nonsensical , since most states have an established tilt to one party or the other .
California will not go Republican , and Texas will not vote for the Democrat .
Yet take a look at the current electoral college map , which is based both on historical trends and this month 's polls :
The totally safe and likely states for Obama have 200 electoral votes .
For McCain , the similar total is 174 .
Leaning to Obama at present are Iowa , New Mexico , and Wisconsin , bringing the Democrat to 222 .
McCain has a slight edge for now in Florida , Missouri , and North Carolina , which would push him up to 227 .
That leaves in the toss - up category seven states with a total of 89 votes : Colorado , Michigan , Nevada , New Hampshire , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Virginia .
How it might happen Given the results in 2000 and 2004 , when Michigan and Pennsylvania voted Democratic , it is not unreasonable to assign them to Obama , bringing him to 260 , just 10 votes short of the White House .
While Obama has a real chance to win in Colorado , Ohio , and Virginia , all three states have tended to vote Republican in many or most election years .
So what happens if a tie occurs ?
In two words , a mess
If McCain wins them , while Obama carries two small toss - up states , where recent surveys have given him a tiny edge , Nevada and New Hampshire , the 269 -269 tie results .
Alternatively , let 's suppose McCain manages to carry New Hampshire - a Kerry state in 2004 , but one that has given McCain key primary victories in 2000 and 2008 .
In this case , if McCain also wins Nevada , and Obama wins Colorado ( while our other assumptions remain the same ) we again end up with the 269 -269 result .
If you mix and match states on the map , in fact , you will quickly see that it relatively easy to produce a tie in the electoral college .
So what happens if one occurs ?
In two words : a mess .
Under the constitution , the election for president is thrown into the US House of Representatives , while the Senate picks the next vice - president ( the Senate 's presiding officer ) .
The ' unit rule '
But while the Senate simply requires a majority of its 100 members to select the vice - president , the House must vote by states , with each state delegation having a single vote , and a majority of the states ( at least 26 of 50 ) required to agree on the winner .
Thomas Jefferson :
The unit rule was fairer in 1800 than it is today
This is called " the unit rule " .
The founding fathers centred the idea on the fact that the nation was a confederation of states rather than a pure democracy of individual voters .
Just as the electoral college is state - based , the House selection of the president in the case of deadlock revolves around the states .
The unit rule has been employed twice in US history , in the long - ago elections of 1800 , when Thomas Jefferson emerged as president , and 1824 , when John Quincy Adams was elected .
Both elections were controversial , but not mainly because of the unit rule .
Two centuries ago , the unit rule was less undemocratic since population disparities among the handful of states were smaller , and Americans were much more accepting of elite control and a lack of popular sovereignty .
The United States of 2008 has very different values .
Think about what House selection of a president would mean today .
Gargantuan California would have the same single House vote in choosing the new president as sparsely populated Wyoming , even though California has about 70 times its population .
The votes of the mega-states of Florida , New York , and Texas could be cancelled out by the tiny populations of Montana , Rhode Island , and South Dakota .
Furthermore , large state delegations could internally deadlock via tie votes .
Some large states might be deprived even of their single vote for the presidency .
Tens of millions of people could be disenfranchised in this fashion .
Equal pigs Meanwhile , all the small states with single House members will certainly be counted .
The smaller the House delegation , the more likely the state 's House members will be able to reach agreement or at least finish their tally .
All pigs would be equal , but in this odd Orwellian case , the tiny pigs would be more equal than the huge ones .
How could a president elected in this fashion govern effectively ?
The turmoil would be an international embarrassment , at the very least
If the public reaction to the Supreme Court 's Bush v Gore decision in 2000 was bitter , one can scarcely imagine the outrage that would greet a modern application of the unit rule .
By the way , well over 90 % of the American people are unaware of this constitutional provision .
So if a 269 - to - 269 tie occurs , what is the likely outcome ?
On the surface , one would think Barack Obama would be likely to capture the Presidency - and that would be my early bet .
Already , Democrats control a majority of 27 states '
House delegations , and the party is expected to pick up additional seats this November - perhaps pushing a couple of other state delegations their way .
But it may not be so straightforward .
The new Congress would take up the matter quickly in early January , but would have to produce a result by Inauguration Day ( 20 January ) .
Suppose some large state delegations reach an impasse ?
Suppose some of the more conservative " Blue Dog " Democrats decide to break with their party and vote the way their districts or states did , presumably for John McCain ?
The turmoil would be an international embarrassment , at the very least .
If a stalemate results , the constitution provides that the vice - president - elect would become acting president until the gridlock is broken .
Presumably , that would be Joe Biden since Democrats are expected to have a comfortable majority in the new Senate .
However , what if the Senate gets tied up in parliamentary knots ?
It 's been known to happen .
Then America is likely to get its first female President , at least until the deadlock is broken .
No , she wo n't be named Hillary Clinton , nor will the acting chief be Sarah Palin .
Next - in - line will be the Speaker of the House , Democrat Nancy Pelosi .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama has opened an 8 - point lead over Republican John McCain two weeks before the U.S. presidential election , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Tuesday .
Obama leads McCain 50 percent to 42 percent among likely U.S. voters in the latest three - day tracking poll , up from a 6 - point advantage for Obama on Monday .
The telephone poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points .
“ It was another very big day for Obama , ” said pollster John Zogby .
“ Things clearly are moving in Obama ’s direction . ”
It was the second consecutive day that Obama gained ground on McCain as the two head into the final sprint to the November 4 election .
Obama , an Illinois senator , expanded his lead among two key swing groups .
His advantage with independent voters grew from 11 to 15 points , and his edge with women voters grew from 8 to 13 points .
Obama also took a lead among voters above the age of 70 and expanded his lead among Hispanics and Catholics .
His support among Republicans grew from 9 percent to 12 percent a day after he received the endorsement of Republican former Secretary of State Colin Powell .
“ Maybe this is the Powell effect , ” Zogby said .
“ That was n’t just an endorsement , that was a pretty powerful statement . ”
McCain narrowly trails Obama among men and saw his lead among whites drop from 13 points to 9 points , 51 percent to 42 percent .
Zogby said Obama was doing better than 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry among crucial sub -groups .
“ He is clearly outperforming Kerry , ” Zogby said .
“ But two weeks is a lifetime in politics . ”
This was the first time Obama has stretched his advantage over McCain , an Arizona senator , to more than 6 points since the tracking poll began more than two weeks ago .
Obama ’s edge had been between 2 and 6 points in all 15 days of polling .
Some other tracking polls have showed the race tightening in the last few days .
But with the help of his huge spending advantage , Obama has maintained an edge on McCain in key states .
The poll , taken Saturday through Monday , showed independent Ralph Nader gaining 2 percent support .
Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney and Libertarian Bob Barr each registered 1 percent support .
The rolling tracking poll surveyed 1,214 likely voters in the presidential election .
In a tracking poll , the most recent day ’s results are added while the oldest day ’s results are dropped to monitor changing momentum .

The U.S. president is determined by who wins the Electoral College , which has 538 members apportioned by population in each state .
Electoral votes are allotted on a winner - take - all basis in all but two states , which divide them by congressional district .
As we ’ve been noting , a lot about the Paulson / Bush bailout plan only makes sense if you assume the US Government is going to be paying premium prices for worthless or near worthless securities .
And Here Fed Chief Bernanke seems to be saying precisely that .
From MarketWatch …
Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke said that criticism of the $ 700 billion plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson overlooked a key ingredient : it is designed to avoid forcing banks to sell or value their mortgage assets at a “ fire - sale ” price .
In a harsher tone than he has ever used in testimony , Bernanke spelled out the benefits that would accrue when the government can buy these mortgage assets at close to “ hold to maturity ” prices instead of the fire - sale price .
Banks would have a basis for valuing the assets and wo n’t have to use fire - sale prices and their capital wo n’t be unreasonably marked down , he said .
Liquidity should begin to come back to the markets and uncertainty should dissipate .
Credit markets should start to unfreeze , he said .
If the assets are purchased near the true hold to maturity prices , taxpayer losses should be minimal , he said .
As I read this , what we ’re doing is taking a trillion taxpayer dollars to recapitalize these companies .
The upside is that taxpayers break even if … and this seems like a pretty crazy if … these really are good investments rather than worthless paper .
And the only issue is getting past this period of panic till they stabilize to the prices the taxpayers bought them for .
What am I missing ?
Late Update : TPM Reader JR sends in this explanation …
Bernanke ’s point is that for accounting purposes , banks are forced to write down their assets to market price .
That causes a cycle of de-leveraging , in which banks try to increase their capital base by cashing in other assets , which makes their partner banks illiquid , in a cycle .
Bernanke is arguing that the government needs to make the market price equal the inherent value .
Then , banks will be able to stop the damaging process of de-leveraging .
A well - designed auction can indeed estimate the inherent value .
But you ’re right at the end – there ’s very little upside for the taxpayer .
Bernanke is suggesting that a well designed auction should minimize downside risk .
I think I ’m saying the same thing as you , but I really think that you ’re being too liberal in your description of these assets as worthless .
And TPM Reader EP adds this …
I saw your piece on Bernanke ’s testimony regarding the mortgage bailout .
The problem with fire - sale prices is that not enough liquidity will be freed up .
A long term hold strategy works better and will probably help buffer against a radical downturn in the near future .
However , I do n’t agree with paying “ hold to maturity ” premiums for these assets across the board .
Some of the real estate securing these loans are never going to come back , and I do n’t think a 20 - 30 year strategy is in the best interests of this country right now .
The final number is somewhere in the middle between say , 25 cents on the dollar , and $ 1.50 on the dollar .
Doing a loan - by - loan analysis to see where each loan balance falls in relation to an approximate value would take too long .
Better to agree on a number – say 50 cents or 60 cents – that gives added liquidity , unloads the bad loans that are sucking up capital in analysis and collection costs , and lets banks lend more money .
I was at [ major national bank ] last year , and this year moved to [ major national bank ] .
As a salesman I can say it has been extremely difficult to qualify borrowers for loans .
Rates have not been very high , but downpayment , liquidity , and credit restrictions , plus the elimination of many of the awful loan programs ( like stated income ) , have succeeded in weeding out bad borrowers .
The good borrowers are waiting on the sidelines to see how much lower prices will go before committing to a loan .
We are also requesting a lot more documentation from borrowers to prove what they say in the loan application .
Appraisers are isolated from the sales process .
These are all good things , even if they are a little bit of an over - reaction .
I think the bailout plan , modified with Dodd ’s suggestions , will work , so long as oversight is ongoing , and bank management is given enough incentive financially to keep up the recovery process .
Penalizing bank management is counter - productive .
A punishment will just send many otherwise intelligent people to move on , leaving the mess with less - qualified people to manage .
I do n’t normally like printing so many emails stacked on top of each other .
But I ’m finding a lot of these very clarifying .
So I ’ll add TPM Reader JL ‘s note too …

A look at some of the claims made in Friday night 's debate between presidential candidates Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain :
POLITICS BLOG :
The debate as it unfolded
Economy
The claim : Obama said the financial meltdown on Wall Street was caused by " eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush , supported by Sen. McCain . "
The facts : McCain voted against two of the most important parts of President Bush 's policy — the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts .
He supports them now and says that he will keep the tax cuts in place if elected president .
Earmarks
The claim : McCain said Obama " asked for $ 932 million in earmarked and pork - barrel spending " since becoming a senator in 2005 .
Obama said earmarks account for $ 18 billion in federal spending , a small fraction of the federal budget .
The facts : Earmarks are the special - interest spending provisions inserted into spending bills by members of Congress .
Obama requested $ 860.6 million in earmarks for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 , according to the non-partisan watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Like most lawmakers , he successfully obtained a fraction of them : $ 98.6 million of the $ 321.8 million he requested in 2008 , for example , the group said .
Obama correctly noted he did not make any requests for earmarks for the 2009 fiscal year that begins Oct.
1 . Taxpayers for Common Sense says earmarks in the current fiscal year totaled $ 18.3 billion .
The White House 's Office of Management and Budget , which uses a slightly different definition of earmarks , put the total at $ 16.9 billion .
The total amount of federal discretionary spending ( not including mandatory spending on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare ) is about $ 1.2 trillion a year .
Obama 's voting record
The claim : McCain said Obama has the most liberal voting record in the Senate .
The facts : Obama was ranked the most liberal senator by the National Journal for 2007 .
He was ranked 16th out of 100 senators in 2005 , his first year in the Senate , and tied for 10th with one other senator in 2006 , the magazine 's annual analysis shows .
Iraq and Afghanistan wars
The claim : McCain said Obama voted against funding for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Obama said McCain predicted U.S. forces would be greeted as liberators by Iraqis .
The facts : Obama was one of 14 senators who voted against a $ 120 billion bill to fund war operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in May 2007 .
Obama said at the time and repeated during the debate that he voted against that funding bill because it did not include a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq .
Obama did vote in favor of other Iraq spending bills .
McCain did say that U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators — a common view , particularly among Republicans at the time — including in a March 2003 appearance on MSNBC .
Iran Revolutionary Guard
The claim : McCain criticized Obama for opposing a Senate measure calling on the Bush administration to declare Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization .
The facts : Obama has said , as he did in response to McCain , that he opposed an amendment to a Pentagon authorization bill that called for designating Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization because the measure may have implied an endorsement of military action against Iran .
Both Obama and McCain missed votes last year on that amendment and on the bill containing it , however .
Both Obama and McCain were co-sponsors of a separate bill that would have called on the Bush administration to designate Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization .
The measure also would have tightened U.S. sanctions on Iran and penalties on U.S. firms doing business in Iran through subsidiaries .
The bill did not pass , although the House passed a similar measure on Friday .
Diplomatic talks with Iran
The claim : Obama was put on the defensive by McCain for saying the United States should be willing to talk to Iran without preconditions .
In response , Obama said former secretary of State Henry Kissinger endorsed his position .
McCain said Kissinger did not mean president - to - president talks .
The facts : Kissinger said in a CNN interview that aired Sept. 20 : " I am in favor of negotiating with Iran . "
He said he would do it at a very high level almost immediately .
" I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of State level , " he said .
As for conditions , he said : " But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations .
We ought , however , to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government . "
ON THE WEB : Read transcript of Kissinger 's remarks
Russia - Georgia conflict
The claim : McCain criticized Obama 's response to the conflict last month between Russia and Georgia , saying Obama called for restraint on both sides .
McCain said that was " a little bit of naïveté . "
The facts : Shortly after the conflict erupted , Obama released a statement condemning the violence .
" Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint , and to avoid an escalation to full scale war , " the statement said .
It went on to say that " Georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected . "
Bush had a similar statement that day ; White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called on " all parties , Georgians , South Ossetians and Russians to de-escalate the tension and avoid conflict , " and " restart their dialogue . "
Taxes
The claim : McCain said Obama " has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $ 42,000 a year . "
The facts :
The 2009 budget resolution , a non-binding document that Obama supported , assumes that all of President Bush 's tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 .
That would cause taxes to rise on middle - income taxpayers .
However , Obama has said he would continue Bush 's tax breaks for those making under $ 250,000 a year .
Health care
The claim : Obama said he would " make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage . "
The facts : Obama says his health care plan would make health insurance available to everyone , not actually cover everyone .
His plan would require coverage for all children — but adults could still choose not to have health insurance .
FactCheck.org , a non-partisan project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania , reported that experts it consulted estimated between 15 million and 26 million people would not buy health coverage under Obama 's plan because it does not require them to do so .
Total costs of Obama 's plan — or McCain's , for that matter — are difficult to determine because many specific details are left out .
Afghanistan
The claim : McCain repeated his charge that Obama has not held any hearings on Afghanistan as chairman of a key Senate subcommittee with jurisdiction over Europe and NATO .
The facts :
While McCain 's charge is true , it 's also true that Obama 's running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , tends to hold the major hearings at the committee level as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , rather than leave that to subcommittees .
When the full panel held a hearing on Afghanistan and NATO 's role there in January of this year , Obama was at a Democratic debate in California .
Most drugs of abuse decrease the generation of new neurons in the brain , but the effects of marijuana on this process , called neurogenesis , had not been clear .
In a paper appearing online on October 13 in advance of print publication of the November issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation , Xia Zhang and colleagues from University of Saskatchewan show that a potent and synthetic cannabinoid promotes neurogenesis .
This drug also exerts anti-anxiety and antidepressant - like effects .
The researchers suggest that there is a positive correlation between increased adult neurogenesis and modified behavior following chronic cannabinoid treatment .
These data expand the existing knowledge about the positive roles cannabinoids and their receptors play in brain processing and medicine .
Moreover , cannabinoids are perhaps the only illicit drug that can enhance adult neurogenesis and subsequently modify behavior .
Reference : Cannabinoid promotes embryonic and adult hippocampus neurogenesis and produces anxiolytic - and antidepression - like effects .

BATTLE PLAN FOR THE 50 STATES
PART 1 of 2

" The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined .
Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite . "
– James Madison , " Federalist No. 45 , " Jan. 26 , 1788
Last week , with the blessing of Bush and most of the U.S. Congress , the robber banker barons threw gasoline onto a bonfire .
The financial Mt. Vesuvius has n't blown yet , but it will , and what was done last week and most likely through today , will be horrific .
America has crossed the Rubicon .
Rage continues to build across this country with good reason .
It was building back in October , 2003 , when I wrote my column , It 's All Over Grab the Muskets .
Change comes one city , one town , one county at a time .
If you do n't try , the bad guys win by default .
Great success has come from groups and organizations all over this country on issues like Agenda 21 because all politics are local .
We have two levels of government : federal and state .
If the states of the Union do not step up to the plate come January and repel the destruction of their sovereignty by the federal machine , they will become nothing more than occupied territories .
The citizens of the states : Your time has come to either step up to the plate or submit to human bondage .
I know that millions of caring , decent Americans are trying to fight this leviathan monster out of Washington , DC. , but as time has shown , between a completely broken judicial system , rotten career politicians and ignorant , uninformed , disinterested and special interest group voters , we are losing ground .
As we continue to see the shredding of the Bill of Rights , Americans are becoming more afraid of the federal government .
Take this 13:23 minute video .
Watch it .
What you see are Americans who have invested time and money into making a short film because they see the real time danger facing this republic by a growing police state under the guise of " for our own good " agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Americans continue to see the brutality out there by paramiliarized law enforcement against we the people for exercising peaceful assembly .
Years ago , I brought to readers attention the treason by darling of FAUX News , Oliver North :
" 1987 : Then U.S. Attorney General William French Smith blew the whistle on a fairly low ranking Marine officer by the name of Oliver North .
According to Smith , Lt. Col .
Oliver North directly helped draft a plan in 1984 to impose martial law in the United States in the event of an emergency .
This secret plan would suspend the U.S. Constitution and turn over control of the government to the little known agency at that time : FEMA .
This plan would appoint military commanders to run state and local governments .
Implementation of this plan would have been triggered by violent and wise spread internal dissent , disagreement with government policy or national opposition to any U.S. military invasion abroad .
Essentially , it amounted to a complete and total suspension of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights . "
As we all saw with Katrina , the military was brought in and the inalienable rights of the American people were simply stomped on .
In the same link above , I brought your attention to a look into the future regarding military control of the civilian population :
The next real war we fight is likely to be on American soil .
Our civilian - military face - off ( November 30 , 1997 )
" One startling quote in this article is from Admiral Stanley Arthur , Commander of U.S. naval forces during the Gulf War , where he says , " Today the armed forces are no longer representative of the people they serve .
More and more , enlisted as well as officers are beginning to feel they are special , better than the society they serve . "
" When you turn to page two of this story , the headlines read , " Bill of Rights no obstacle for the Corps . "
Another disturbing quote jumps out at you , " Because of the rising potential for civil disobedience within the inner cities it is ' inevitable ' the U.S. military will be employed more often within American borders . " ...
Why the concern that there is a potential for civil disobedience by Americans ?
Where did this come from ? .....
" Further into this shocking story : " ... Major Reeves notes , when faced with violating doctrine or violating the law , some Marines chose the latter course and detained suspects and conducted warrant less searches .
Indeed , with characteristic Marine Corps bluntness , the major states that , " in interviews with Marine officers involved in domestic peacekeeping missions with officers responsible for articulating the Marine Corps ' policy on domestic peacekeeping , it became apparent to the author that Marines took whatever action was necessary .
At times , these actions required Marines to violate U.S. law .
" Similarly , Marine Capt .
Guy Miner reported in the Gazette that Marine intelligence units were initially worried by the need to collect intelligence on U.S. citizens , which would violate a 1981 Executive Order , but that " this inhibition was quickly overcome .... "
And to chill you even further , " To enable the Marines to execute these new domestic missions in the same way that they do abroad , Major Reeves calls for major alternations in U.S. laws .
" Experience from the Los Angeles riots , " he warns , " demonstrated the need to grant U.S. Marine forces the legal right to detain vehicles and suspects , conduct arrests , searches and seizures in order to accomplish the peacekeeping mission . "
Go ahead , print out the newspaper and read it .
If this does n't give you the daytime version of pavor nocturnus , then you do n't grasp the severity of the problem .
We are seeing more and more domestic spying on Americans , no knock searches killing innocent people , warrant less searches on flimsy probable cause and ' civilian check points ' on our roads and highways .
The misnamed ' Patriot Act ' continues to be abused by federal dragoons .
This is NOT the America thousands spilled their blood for on the battle fields during the Revolutionary War .

In my last column , I once again covered the National ID and it 's real purpose .
Coming on the heels of this massive financial melt down that will only get WORSE going into next year , consider this headline :
Brigade homeland tours start Oct. 1
" 3rd Infantry ’s 1st BCT trains for a new dwell - time mission .
Helping ‘ people at home ’ may become a permanent part of the active Army .
" They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack . "
It all sounds quite innocent with the mission of " helping " Americans .
Just like Katrina .
Benevolent mother government .
Until you remember the plan Oliver North drew up and the previously mentioned blue print for the Marines to inject themselves into the civilian sector .
All triggered by " violent and wise spread internal dissent , disagreement with government policy or national opposition to any U.S. military invasion abroad " or " rising potential for civil disobedience within the inner cities it is ' inevitable ' the U.S. military will be employed more often within American borders . "
A substantial number of Americans believe this is a gross misuse of our military under The Posse Comitatus Act , a United States federal law ( 18 U.S.C. § 1385 ) passed on June 16 , 1878 , prohibiting most members of the federal uniformed services ( the Army , Air Force , and State National Guard forces when such are called into federal service ) from exercising nominally state law enforcement police or peace officer powers that maintain " law and order " on non-federal property ( states , their counties and municipal divisions ) .
In other words , the PCA limited to a great degree the powers of the federal government to use active military for law enforcement .
There have been more laws enacted by Congress over the years explicitly allowing the military to be used in certain domestic scenarios .
Legal hawks say the most significant is the ' Military Support for Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act of 1981 ( “ MSCLEA ” ) , the purpose of which is to allow the exchange of information and services between military and law enforcement " when necessary " to protect the people and interests of the United States .
Major Craig T. Trebilcock , U.S. Army Reserve , penned a paper titled , ' The Myth of Posse Comitatus ' , in October 2000 , where he said : " Is the Posse Comitatus Act totally without meaning today ?
No , it remains a deterrent to prevent the unauthorized deployment of troops at the local level in response to what is purely a civilian law enforcement matter . "
Really ?
Did you forget New Orleans and WACO , Major Trebilcock ?
His paper was a justification for use of military within the states of the Union for " domestic terrorism . "
It is far too easy for these types of laws to end up being used against the civilian population as evidenced by the rise of Adolph Hitler .
For an excellent overview of how Hitler took power , mirroring what we have seen the past seven years , see here .
As I said earlier , the rage has been growing exponentially over the past two decades as government becomes more oppressive and now with these monstrous bail outs , looting and pillaging we the people until we end up in rags , the people are really getting steamed :
Mad as hell - taxpayers lash out
We asked you what you had to say about the bailout , and we heard you loud and clear : ' No way !'
" NO NO NO .
Not just no , but HELL NO , " writes Richard , a reader from Anchorage , Alaska .
" This is robbery pure and simple , " Anna from Denver posted on CNNMoney.com 's TalkBack blog this weekend .
" It 's our money !
Let these companies die , " added Claudio from Plainville , Conn . "

DENVER 
In a modern production studio about a mile from where the Democrats were opening their convention here Monday , a SWAT team of Republican operatives dispatched to crash Senator Barack Obama ’s party was reveling in its accomplishments .
Two new advertisements devised to stoke the sore feelings of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s devotees were widely covered online and on cable news channels ; a news conference the Republicans produced with former Clinton supporters who said they were now backing Senator John McCain drew a standing - room - only crowd of reporters ; and a “ Happy Hour for Hillary ” cocktail party was planned , to be followed by an appearance by Mr. McCain on “ The Tonight Show With Jay Leno . ”
The opposition party once more or less ceded the stage to the convening party during its convention , under the assumption that breaking into the news coverage would be next to impossible .
Over the past few presidential election cycles , as Washington became more bitterly partisan , that began to disintegrate , helped along by a proliferation of ravenous new media outlets that created growing opportunities to spread negative messages .
But on the first day of the Democratic convention , it was clear that this year will break new ground , with each side planning a full - bore run during the other ’s convention .
Matt McDonald , who is overseeing the Republican effort , said he was “ pleasantly surprised ” by the party ’s success in inserting itself into the biggest week of the Obama campaign .
“ Any time we can get our side of the story out , ” Mr. McDonald said , “ that ’s a good thing . ”
It 's very important for people to realize that the McCain - Palin ticket is explicitly running on war against Iran .
If McCain - Palin is elected , there will be war .
If Obama - Biden is elected , there is a tiny chance there wo n't be .
In terms of the future , this is the critical issue to be decided .
Someone - probably Scheuneman - wrote Palin's op - ed / speech on this .
It could not be clearer :
" We gather here today to highlight the Iranian dictator 's intentions and to call for action to thwart him .
He must be stopped .
The world must awake to the threat this man poses to all of us . "
She and / or McCain will launch a pre-emptive strike on Iran .
This much we know .
It is n't a matter of if but when .
For McCain , it is a matter of fighting wars to win , instead of accepting any limits on American power .
For Palin , it is a matter of theological destiny .
For Americans , it may be a decision about whether America will start a Third World War or try to prevent it .

The old man paused , smiled and picked up his cup .
I do n't remember how I got to talking to him at the library 's cafeteria , but there I was , wolfing down the sandwich on which I 'd put ketchup .
One buys sandwiches at the library for the same reason we look at our cellphones even when we know there 's nothing there .
Then we put ketchup on it and wolf it down , or unlock the thing and play with a couple of buttons and then put it back in our pockets again .
It 's a pretense .
" I do n't get that type of music " , he said .
" Never got past the first track of any record ever ... " Ah yes , we both had been standing at the bargains shelf , looking at $ 1 CDs , and I had picked up a Jazz one .
It had a black & white photo of a man in a checked jacket holding a saxophone on the cover looking .. well , looking blank .
But I too had never gotten past the first track of any jazz record myself .
And here was Bob saying the exact same thing .
" Coincidence ! " , I said to myself , as I filled it in my trip report .
The console blinked and the detailed - incident - report indicator flashed on .
I flipped the device to voice mode and started narrating the incident in detail - where I 'd landed , what I looked like , when it was , how I met the man in the library named Bob , and what his thoughts about music were .
My next case was an investigation .
A senior agent had died recently , somewhere in Ardennes , in 1941 .
This was surprising , because the agency has all sorts of protocol and regulations & permissions in place just to avoid this specific type of event .
Contaminating a timeline by choosing it to be your final resting place is strictly frowned upon .
Influencing is allowed , interference is not .
Time is a place you can visit but not stay - Agency motto .
I had been in a future time at that time , sneaking some hashes into certain bankchain thus short - circuiting the spiralling growth of a certain family - run business .
The agency believed in redistribution whenever possible , and interference in events before they were extensively manifest .
Actual interference needed approvals .
Influencing by nipping in the bud was supervisor - sanctioned .
I remember a couple of us had visited his graveyard , in the middle of a war , to see if we could make some sense of the act .
We found a minimal grave with the most basic headstone .
The epitaph , also carved crudely and in a hurry , read " God split himself into myriad parts so that he could have friends " , which was decidedly weird for that age .
Scans revealed skeletal remains which matched our agents ' , and spectral scans confirmed it .
A Timeline Archive Search Report flagged the epitaph to be the contaminant .
Nobody 'd 've noticed anything odd about the grave or its contents at this time or place , but someone could find the epitaph anachronistic , said The TASR .
It said it should n't exist until 1973 .

The Prince of Wales criticized the green building industry for relying on eco-gadgets like wind turbines and solar panels while ignoring inefficient buildings .
The heir apparent to the British Crown , His Royal Highness , The Prince of Wales has called on developers to use traditional methods and materials alongside the best in “ eco-technology ” to solve the problem of creating environmentally friendly properties instead of opting for “ slick , highly marketed techno - fixes . ”
In the foreword to a green supplement in the magazine House & Garden , the Prince wrote :
“ Why , I must ask , does being ‘ green ’ mean building with glass and steel and concrete and then adding wind turbines , solar panels , water heaters , sedum roofs , glass atria – all the paraphernalia of a new ‘ green building industry ’ – to offset buildings that are inefficient in the first place ?
“ That many of these add - ons are mere gestures , at best , is now clear , as their impacts on home energy consumption can now be measured and usually offer scant justification for the radical nature of the design . ”
In his years as heir apparent , the Prince of Wales has often shared his views on architecture and urban planning , claiming to “ care deeply about issues such as the environment , architecture , inner-city renewal , and the quality of life . ”
In his book , A Vision of Britain , Charles was critical some aspects of modern architecture , stressing traditional urbanism , the need for human scale , and the restoration of historic buildings as an essential element of new development and sustainable design .
Prince Charles ’ remarks received a mixed welcome from industry groups .
Paul King , chief executive of the UK Green Building Council , said the remarks would provoke a healthy debate but risked undermining the efforts of the UK ’s emerging green building industry .
King said , “ In a way he is right – there are examples of high - profile buildings being passed off as ‘ green ’ , when the most important thing is to reduce environmental impacts through good design in the first place . ”

This election has got me plumb tuckered out .
My fatigue undoubtedly stems from the fact that I check the polls more than once a day , that I now know how many electoral votes New Mexico has , and that I have developed carpal tunnel syndrome from registering fake voters for Acorn .
Now look , I have said from the very beginning that I ’m rooting for the black guy in this thing .
Why ?
Because I find it funny to say , “ I ’m rooting for the black guy . ”
It makes me sound both progressive and ignorant in the same breath , a combination I find irresistible .
I also happen to find him the better candidate , as well as the only remaining candidate who , to my knowledge , has never called his wife a cunt .
Which , in my mind , is a plus .
And the election has been good for my own marriage because it ’s given my wife and I something to talk about for the first time in … ever .
I tend to goad her on whenever she starts talking about the election because when she ’s talking about her dislike for the Republicans , she ’s ignoring her own dislike for me .
Which is great .
But enough ’s enough .
I feel like the kid who ’s been given free run of the candy shop and ate himself sick .
This election has gotten me nauseous .
It ’s just not fun anymore .
The fact that I now even know enough about Acorn to make a joke about them proves it .
The fact that any of us is now familiar with the term “ first dude ” further proves it .
I will be so happy on November 5th when I can finally turn my attention away from electing the leader of the free world and return it to the financial apocalypse currently underway .
Whoever wins , Barack or Methuselah , is going to find himself in a biblical - sized shit storm upon taking the oath .
Just to put all of this in perspective , not only has our economic meltdown taken a backseat to formerly obscure domestic terrorist / Chicago “ citizen of the year ” Bill Ayers , but I feel like NOBODY is talking about the fact that Lindsay Lohan totally came out of the closet !
What ’s the matter with this country ???
When did our national priorities get so completely and totally fucked ?

The icy waters off Scotland 's northern tip are no place for pleasure craft .
But they 're ideal for power - generation systems that harness the restless fury of the sea — which is why the European Marine Energy Centre has set up shop in the Orkney Islands .
Think of it as the Bonneville Salt Flats of hydrokinetics : EMEC offers companies a place to try out their clean tech .
The center 's remotely operated vehicles film underwater , and microphones will eventually monitor for noise pollution .
First in was Dublin - based OpenHydro , which recently began trials on its second turbine ( shown here raised for inspection ) .
Carbon - free hydrokinetic power could ultimately provide up to 20 percent of the UK 's electricity needs .
But environmental concerns may still sink the effort : Critics warn of industrialized coastlines and harm to sea life .
The US faces similar challenges — without a testing facility .
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has okayed a pilot marine - power project for Makah Bay , off the Washington coast , but environmental approval is still pending .
By the time the inevitable court battles are resolved , the waves may be lapping at our doorsteps .

A game that 's both minimalist and challenging , yet also could have done with some further development before release .
The biggest request I 'd have would have been the inclusion of some more sound effects .
Even though the game lacks any real visual quality , adding in some audio cues for when your avatar jumps or lights up a panel would have at least sold the cartoon art style a lot more .
An example of this would be some hydraulic or mechanical movement noises for when the robot moves .
I 'm not going to be deducting points based on my suggestions , but this a very quiet game and if it were n't for the soundtrack to serve as filler , the lack of any real audio design is very disappointing to say the least .
Speaking of the music , that in itself needs to be changed ; it 's too aggressive for this kind of game , and it lacks any real identifiable melody .
For a puzzle game which does n't utilize any flashy effects or contain any real sense of pacing , you need to utilize a track that 's catchy in order to keep the players entertained at times when they 're struggling to pass a certain part of the game .
This might sound trivial at first , but look at games like Tetris and Dr. Mario ; people come back to those game alone for its music .
Not to mention it also adds replay value .
The controls are halfway decent ; it 's simple enough and most of it is self - explanatory , even if you exclude the tutorial stages which generally teach you what to do .
But I would have added tool tips which appear when leaving the mouse over the buttons ( that the player uses to control their avatar ) to not only serve as a reminder later on , but to also visualize which direction they 'll be facing when selecting the left and right buttons in particular .
I know the game does n't penalize you for replaying the stage , but when you 're setting up a very long cue of commands , in combination with the isometric perspective approach with the graphics , having that extra information could benefit players who do n't have a keen sense of direction quite a lot .
The " buttons " also seem to be stubborn , and like to stick .
It 's not the worst thing in the world , but when I tried to drag a button away from the command queue , a few times it ended up popping up elsewhere and would end up causing a hiccup somewhere in the playback unexpectedly .
I would n't say to remove the drop 'n drag style of how you actually play the game , but the secondary ability to simply click a movement to be able to remove it would have been a great work around .
It also would in being able to delete multiple commands in succession a lot faster too .
Other than that , I do n't have much else to say .
For a game for keeping yourself busy during , say , your breaks at work , lightBot is perfect .
I think you 've caught onto that idea , seeing you 've already developed mobile ports .
In retrospect though , this particular version is really only worth checking out for the medals .
Since it 's a pretty short game , I 'd recommend people to avoid using a guide in order to get that sense of satisfaction ; the game is built around utilizing and [ ultimately ] exploiting its limited movement , and it does challenge your sense of programming skills .
So it 's a nice exercise with faux game development , albeit at a very entry level .
Not too bad , but overall this feels as if its been rushed .
' Devils ' Trails '
Are World 's Oldest Human Footprints Scientists verify that the world 's oldest footprints are in Italy .
Oct. 14 , 2008  --
It 's official : the oldest human footprints ever found are 345,000 years old , give or take 6000 .
Known as the " devils ' trails " , they have been preserved in volcanic ash atop the Roccamonfina volcano in Italy .
The prints were first described to the world by Paolo Mietto and colleagues of the University of Padova in Italy in 2003 after amateur archaeologists pointed them out .
At the time , the team estimated that the prints were anywhere between 385,000 and 325,000 years old , based on when the volcano was thought to have last erupted .
Now , Stéphane Scaillet and colleagues at the Laboratory of Climatic and Environmental Sciences , France , have used argon dating techniques to verify the prints ' age .
" Their more rigorous methods confirm that these are the oldest human footprints ever found , " says Mietto .
The new findings also confirm that the owners of the footprints were Homo heidelbergensis .
Trail blazers
The excavations should help reveal a trail that was used by early humans .
Mietto says that based on their stride , the people responsible were walking , not running .
What 's more , the prints are in both directions : leading to the volcano and away from it .
Their owners were therefore not running away from a volcanic eruption and the prints must have been left some time after the event .
Dating experiments have not always confirmed suspicions .
In 2003 , a team discovered 40,000 year old footprints preserved in volcanic ash in southern Mexico .
But when a separate group dated the Mexican prints using the argon technique used by Scaillet , they found that they were 1.3 million years old .
Since this was before modern humans evolved in Africa – the team concluded that they could n't be human footsteps after all .

DEBKAfile
August 8 , 2008
Georgian tanks and infantry , aided by Israeli military advisers , captured the capital of breakaway South Ossetia , Tskhinvali , early Friday , Aug. 8 , bringing the Georgian - Russian conflict over the province to a military climax .
Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin threatened a “ military response . ”
Former Soviet Georgia called up its military reserves after Russian warplanes bombed its new positions in the renegade province .
In Moscow ’s first response to the fall of Tskhinvali , president Dimitry Medvedev ordered the Russian army to prepare for a national emergency after calling the UN Security Council into emergency session early Friday .
Reinforcements were rushed to the Russian “ peacekeeping force ” present in the region to support the separatists .
Georgian tanks entered the capital after heavy overnight heavy aerial strikes , in which dozens of people were killed .
Lado Gurgenidze , Georgia ’s prime minister , said on Friday that Georgia will continue its military operation in South Ossetia until a “ durable peace ” is reached .
“ As soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations . ”
DEBKAfile ’s geopolitical experts note that on the surface level , the Russians are backing the separatists of S. Ossetia and neighboring Abkhazia as payback for the strengthening of American influence in tiny Georgia and its 4.5 million inhabitants .
However , more immediately , the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the Caspian region .
The Russians may just bear with the pro-US Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili ’s ambition to bring his country into NATO .
But they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of Western oil companies , including Israeli firms , to route the oil routes from Azerbaijan and the gas lines from Turkmenistan , which transit Georgia , through Turkey instead of hooking them up to Russian pipelines .
Saakashvili need only back away from this plan for Moscow to ditch the two provinces ’ revolt against Tbilisi .
As long as he sticks to his guns , South Ossetia and Abkhazia will wage separatist wars .
DEBKAfile discloses Israel ’s interest in the conflict from its exclusive military sources :
Jerusalem owns a strong interest in Caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the Turkish terminal port of Ceyhan , rather than the Russian network .
Intense negotiations are afoot between Israel Turkey , Georgia , Turkmenistan and Azarbaijan for pipelines to reach Turkey and thence to Israel ’s oil terminal at Ashkelon and on to its Red Sea port of Eilat .
From there , supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the Far East through the Indian Ocean .
Aware of Moscow ’s sensitivity on the oil question , Israel offered Russia a stake in the project but was rejected .
Last year , the Georgian president commissioned from private Israeli security firms several hundred military advisers , estimated at up to 1,000 , to train the Georgian armed forces in commando , air , sea , armored and artillery combat tactics .
They also offer instruction on military intelligence and security for the central regime .
Tbilisi also purchased weapons , intelligence and electronic warfare systems from Israel .
These advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the Georgian army ’s preparations to conquer the South Ossetian capital Friday .
In recent weeks , Moscow has repeatedly demanded that Jerusalem halt its military assistance to Georgia , finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations .
Israel responded by saying that the only assistance rendered Tbilisi was “ defensive . ”
This has not gone down well in the Kremlin .
Therefore , as the military crisis intensifies in South Ossetia , Moscow may be expected to punish Israel for its intervention .

Today we 're going to pick up virtually any consumer magazine or open any Internet news website and read about a frightening new threat :
That radiation from cell phones is dangerous , perhaps causing brain tumors or other cancers , maybe even cooking your brain like an egg or like popcorn .
Most people have no knowledge of science other than what they hear on the news , so we have a whole population growing up with this understanding .
Is the fear justified ?
Do cell phones have the potential to cause physical harm , or are they completely safe ?
Or , like so many other questions , is the truth somewhere in the middle ?
Let 's take a closer look at exactly what kind of threat is being reported .
A recent article on CNN.com quotes Dr. Debra Davis , Director of the University of Pittsburgh 's Center for Environmental Oncology , saying that " You 're just roasting your bone marrow " and asking " Do you really want to play Russian roulette with your head ? "
The article goes on to give five recommendations for limiting your exposure to cell phone radiation :
Using a headset , using the speakerphone , getting a different phone , and so on .
CNN followed up with another article with more quotes from Dr. Davis , this time saying that children are especially at risk because their brains are still developing , so they should be allowed to use cell phones in emergencies only .
As the director of an oncology center , she must have all kinds of experience treating cancer patients , and since she 's going on CNN to talk about cell phone risks she must have a lot of experience dealing with cancer caused by cell phones .
Right ?
Well , you 'd think , but apparently CNN is not quite that particular about their guests .
Dr. Davis ' Ph.D. is in " science studies " , whatever that is , and she is neither a medical doctor nor does she have any specialization in physical sciences like radiation .
Now , I 'm not trying to disrespect Dr. Davis — she has a fine background loaded with experience and all sorts of publications and accolades in her field — but I do want to draw attention to the fact that when CNN brings a doctor onto television to talk about a health problem , you should n't take anything for granted .
You 're the one who assumed that she treats cancer patients and has seen harmful effects from cell phone radiation .
The fact is that the only danger Dr. Davis actually cited was that " since cell phones have only been in widespread use for 10 years or so , the long - term effects of their radiation waves on the brain has yet to be determined . "
Neither she , nor CNN , cited a single case of harm being caused by a cell phone , nor did they present any theoretical arguments indicating any plausible danger .
Dr. Davis is also dramatically wrong on one very significant point :
That there has not yet been time for long - term studies to have been conducted , or that the question of cell phones and cancer is otherwise inadequately studied .
In fact , the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published the results of a massive study in Denmark that followed the cancer histories of 420,000 cell phone users over 13 years .
You'd think that someone in Dr. Davis ' position would know about that , or at least take the slightest trouble to search for studies before going on CNN to proclaim that no such studies exist .
The study 's main interest was to search for increased incidences of brain or nervous system cancers , salivary gland cancer , and leukemia .
The study concluded :
Risk for these cancers ... did not vary by duration of cellular telephone use , time since first subscription , age at first subscription , or type of cellular telephone ( analogue or digital ) .
Analysis of brain and nervous system tumors showed no statistically significant [ standardized incidence ratios ] for any subtype or anatomic location .
The results of this investigation ... do not support the hypothesis of an association between use of these telephones and tumors of the brain or salivary gland , leukemia , or other cancers .
The lack of any connection is not surprising , given that no plausible hypothesis exists for how a cell phone could cause tissue damage .
RF below the visible spectrum , which includes the frequencies used by cell phones and all radio devices , is not ionizing radiation and so has no potential to damage living cells or break any chemical bonds .
Microwave ovens , which operate just above cell phones on the frequency scale , work by oscillating such an extremely powerful field back and forth , causing the water molecules to rub against each other and create heat by friction .
Cell phone signals are three orders of magnitude weaker , too weak to move the water molecules , and do not oscillate to cause friction .
Scratch the heat hypothesis , scratch the ionizing radiation hypothesis , and there are no plausible alternatives .
Of course it 's not possible to prove that there is no potential for harm , but all sources of harm known or theorized to date are clearly excluded .
So if that 's true , how did the story get started ?
How did cell phones causing cancer become one of our pop culture myths ?
It started in 1993 , when a guy named David Raynard went on CNN's Larry King Live to talk about his lawsuit against the cellular phone industry over the death of his wife from brain cancer , who used a cell phone .
Certainly we all sympathize with Mr. Raynard , but that does n't make him right .
Unfortunately for rationalism , being on Larry King was all the credibility the story needed to become a popular belief .
Despite Mr. Raynard 's claim that his wife 's tumor was in the same shape as the cell phone antenna , the case was thrown out for a lack of evidence .
Another reason the belief persists is that it is constantly being promoted by companies selling quack devices claimed to protect consumers from any potential threat .
Spreading fear is a major marketing angle that they employ .
Cardo Systems , a maker of cell phone headset , broadly promoted as the best way to minimize danger of radiation , famously released a set of hoax videos on YouTube showing people popping popcorn by setting some kernels on a table between several activated cell phones .
When nailed for the hoax by CNN , Cardo 's CEO claimed that the videos were meant only as a joke and that the thought of scaring people into thinking that cell phones could pop popcorn never entered their minds .
You can judge the credibility of that statement for yourself .
There are also a number of videos on YouTube showing eggs being hard boiled merely by placing them between two activated cell phones for a few minutes .
This claim has also been thoroughly debunked .
The British TV show Brainiac even tried it with 100 phones .
The result ?
Zippo .
It did n't change the egg 's temperature at all .
Raw as ever .
Some of these companies selling products to protect you have sections on their websites where they cite official statements reiterating that there is no proof that cell phones are safe .
They also tend to cite one particular study , known as the Guy study and published in Bioelectromagnetics in 1992 .
You might remember Guy 's co-author C.K.
Chou , an RF scientist who did some research we examined in our episode about The Hum .
The Guy study exposed rats to high levels of RF for 22 hours a day for two years .
18 of the exposed rats developed tumors , while only 5 of the control group did .
The cell phone accessory companies stop there , but you have to dig deeper to find that other researchers have been unable to replicate these results , and the conclusion was that the tumor incidence , while statistically significant , was not shown to have been caused by the RF .
In fact , another study also published in Bioelectromagnetics by Adey et. al. exposed rats to a chemical carcinogen and then exposed some of them to RF .
Dr. Adey actually found fewer tumors in the RF exposed rats , but again the result was not large enough to draw conclusions .
Even in the harshest of animal studies , no evidence has been found to link cell phone radiation to health problems .
We may quarrel with these companies ' ethics in promoting fear to sell their products , but that does n't mean that the products are n't a wise precaution .
It ca n't hurt to be safe rather than sorry , can it ?
Well , you will be sorry if you spend any of your hard - earned money on a product intended to protect you from cell phone radiation , and you hear what the World Health Organization has to say on the matter .
Their summary on such devices says :
Scientific evidence does not indicate any need for RF - absorbing covers or other " absorbing devices " on mobile phones .
They can not be justified on health grounds and the effectiveness of many such devices in reducing RF exposure is unproven .
So far , the science that 's been done pretty much supports the default skeptical position .
When we hear a claim like " cell phone radiation causes cancer " , we assume the null hypothesis until evidence is presented that supports the claim .
And to date , all the good evidence supports the null hypothesis , not the claim .
Maybe tomorrow things will change , and we 'll find that cell phones are harmful , or that 60 - cycle electrical outlets are harmful , or that traveling faster than 30 miles an hour is harmful .
An open skeptical mind is open to any good evidence supporting any claim .
But for now , I 'm going to continue enjoying the usefulness of my iPhone , and be damn glad there 's a tower in my neighborhood .

Scientists have created a 3 - Dpicture of a luminous and mountainous site on the moon that holds promise as apossible future location for a lunar colony .
The spot , near the moon 's southpole , is called the " peak of eternal light " because it isalmost continuously exposed to sunlight .
Researchers created the new 3 - D image using data taken bythe Advanced Moon Micro - Imager Experiment ( AMIE ) camera carried by the EuropeanSpace Agency 's SMART - 1( Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology ) robotic moon mission .
" AMIE is not a stereo camera , so producing a 3 - D modelof the surface has been a challenge , " said ESA researcher Detlef Koschny .
" We ?ve used a techniquewhere we use the brightness of reflected light to determine the slope and , bycomparing several images , put together a model that produces a shadow patternthat matches those observed by SMART - 1 . "
Koschny plans to present the images Sept. 26 at the EuropeanPlanetary Science Congress in M?nster , Germany .
During its orbits around the moon , which lasted from November 2004 until September 2006 , AMIEtook a total of 113 images of the peak , located close to the rim of the Shackleton Crater on the lunar south pole .
In all but four of the images , thepeak was illuminated by sunlight .
The peak of eternal light could bea promising spot for a future manned moon landing or even a lunarcolony , because the near - continuous sunlight that shines down couldgenerate a constant electricity supply .
In addition , the shadowed cratersnearby are in perpetual darkness and may hold water ice deposited overmillennia by impacting comets and hydrogen and oxygen particles contained inthe solar wind .
To create the 3 - D map of the area , the team , led by Bj ? rn Grieger of ESA ?s European Space Astronomy Centre inMadrid , analyzed five images taken from different angles .
By comparing theimages , and mapping all of their pixels onto a grid , the researchers calculated the angles of the peak 's slopes and produced a topographical model .
After its years in orbit , theSMART - 1 satellite eventually crashedinto the moon as planned in September 2006 .

I ’m not suggesting there ’s nothing good about a free - market economy , nor am I suggesting every insurance company or investment firm is run by greedy executives , but there have been snake - oil salesmen preying upon the unwary since before the dawn of history as nearly as I can determine .
In case you wonder if deregulation is the pivotal policy that led to the collapse onWall Street , here 's a quick , easily - grasped explanation that should help you grasp why that lofty " ideal " has failed in our never - quite - ideal real world .
Are you surprised that some have tried to use the crisis for their own political or financial gain ?
We left foxes guarding the chicken coop .
It 's time for a carefully considered change .
• END Golden Parachutes --
Taxpayer dollars should not be used to reward the irresponsible , greedy Wall Street executives who lobbied for deregulation and engineered this disaster .
Those who have earned millions must return their salaries as a starting point ... imagine if that money might be used to PAY those loans down .
• TAXPAYERS , Not Just Wall Street --
Any bailout plan must include a payback strategy for taxpayers who are footing the bill and aid to innocent homeowners who are facing foreclosure .
• Bipartisan Oversight -- $ 700,000,000,000 is a staggering amount of money involved , and since it 's coming from taxes the source MANDATES bipartisan expert oversight to ensure accountability .
Followup to : The Rhythm of Disagreement
At the age of 15 , a year before I knew what a " Singularity " was , I had learned about evolutionary psychology .
Even from that beginning , it was apparent to me that people talked about " disagreement " as a matter of tribal status , processing it with the part of their brain that assessed people 's standing in the tribe .
The peculiar indignation of " How dare you disagree with Einstein ? " has its origins here :
Even if the disagreer is wrong , we would n't apply the same emotions to an ordinary math error like " How dare you write a formula that makes e equal to 1.718 ? "
At the age of 15 , being a Traditional Rationalist , and never having heard of Aumann or Bayes , I thought the obvious answer was , " Entirely disregard people 's authority and pay attention to the arguments .
Only arguments count . "
Ha ha !
How naive .
I can't say that this principle never served my younger self wrong .
I can't even say that the principle gets you as close as possible to the truth .
I doubt I ever really clung to that principle in practice .
In real life , I judged my authorities with care then , just as I do now ...
But my efforts to follow that principle , made me stronger .
They focused my attention upon arguments ; believing in authority does not make you stronger .
The principle gave me freedom to find a better way , which I eventually did , though I wandered at first .
Yet both of these benefits were pragmatic and long - term , not immediate and epistemic .
And you cannot say , " I will disagree today , even though I 'm probably wrong , because it will help me find the truth later . "
Then you are trying to doublethink .
If you know today that you are probably wrong , you must abandon the belief today .
Period .
No cleverness .
Always use your truth - finding skills at their full immediate strength , or you have abandoned something more important than any other benefit you will be offered ; you have abandoned the truth .
So today , I sometimes accept things on authority , because my best guess is that they are really truly true in real life , and no other criterion gets a vote .
But always in the back of my mind is that childhood principle , directing my attention to the arguments as well , reminding me that you gain no strength from authority ; that you may not even know anything , just be repeating it back .
Earlier I described how I disagreed with a math book and looked for proof , disagreed humbly with Judea Pearl and was proven ( half ) right , disagreed immodestly with Sebastian Thrun and was proven wrong , had a couple of quick exchanges with Steve Omohundro in which modesty - reasoning would just have slowed us down , respectfully disagreed with Daniel Dennett and disrespectfully disagreed with Steven Pinker , disagreed with Robert Aumann without a second thought , disagreed with Nick Bostrom with second thoughts ...
What kind of rule am I using , that covers all these cases ?
Er ... " try to get the actual issue really right " ?
I mean , there are other rules but that 's the important one .
It 's why I disagree with Aumann about Orthodox Judaism , and blindly accept Judea Pearl 's word about the revised version of his analysis .
Any argument that says I should take Aumann seriously is wasting my time ; any argument that says I should disagree with Pearl is wasting my truth .
There are all sorts of general reasons not to argue with physicists about physics , but the rules are all there to help you get the issue right , so in the case of Many - Worlds you have to ignore them .
Yes , I know that 's not helpful as a general principle .
But dammit , wavefunctions do n't collapse !
It 's a massively stupid idea that sticks around due to sheer historical contingency !
I 'm more confident of that than any principle I would dare to generalize about disagreement .
Notions of " disagreement " are psychology - dependent pragmatic philosophy .
Physics and Occam 's razor are much simpler .
Object - level stuff is often much clearer than meta - level stuff , even though this itself is a meta - level principle .
In theory , you have to make a prior decision whether to trust your own assessment of how obvious it is that wavefunctions do n't collapse , before you can assess whether wavefunctions do n't collapse .
In practice , it 's much more obvious that wavefunctions do n't collapse , than that I should trust my disagreement .
Much more obvious .
So I just go with that .
I trust any given level of meta as far as I can throw it , but no further .
There 's a rhythm to disagreement .
And oversimplified rules about when to disagree , can distract from that rhythm .
Even " Follow arguments , not people " can distract from the rhythm , because no one , including my past self , really uses that rule in practice .
The way it works in real life is that I just do the standard first - order disagreement analysis :
Okay , in real life , how likely is it that this person knows stuff that I do n't ?
Not , Okay , how much of the stuff that I know that they do n't , have they already taken into account in a revised estimate , given that they know I disagree with them , and have formed guesses about what I might know that they do n't , based on their assessment of my and their relative rationality ...
Why do n't I try the higher - order analyses ?
Because I 've never seen a case where , even in retrospect , it seems like I could have gotten real - life mileage out of it .
Too complicated , too much of a tendency to collapse to tribal status , too distracting from the object - level arguments .
I have previously observed that those who genuinely reach upward as rationalists , have usually been broken of their core trust in the sanity of the people around them .
In this world , we have to figure out who to trust , and who we have reasons to trust , and who might be right even when we believe they 're wrong .
But I 'm kinda skeptical that we can - in this world of mostly crazy people and a few slightly - more - sane people who 've spent their whole lives surrounded by crazy people who claim they 're saner than average - get real - world mileage out of complicated reasoning that involves sane people assessing each other 's meta-sanity .
We 've been broken of that trust , you see .
Does Robin Hanson really trust , deep down , that I trust him enough , that I would not dare to disagree with him , unless he were really wrong ?
I can't trust that he does ... so I do n't trust him so much ... so he should n't trust that I would n't dare disagree ...
It would be an interesting experiment : but I cannot literally commit to walking into a room with Robin Hanson and not walking out until we have the same opinion about the Singularity .
So that if I give him all my reasons and hear all his reasons , and Hanson tells me , " I still think you 're wrong , " I must then agree ( or disagree in a net direction Robin ca n't predict ) .
I trust Robin but I do n't trust him THAT MUCH .
Even if I tried to promise , I could n't make myself believe it was really true - and that tells me I can't make the promise .
When I think about who I would be willing to try this with , the name that comes to mind is Michael Vassar - which surprised me , and I asked my mind why .
The answer that came back was , " Because Michael Vassar knows viscerally what 's at stake if he makes you update the wrong way ; he would n't use the power lightly . "
I 'm not going anywhere in particular with this ; but it points in an interesting direction - that a primary reason I do n't always update when people disagree with me , is that I do n't think they 're taking that disagreement with the extraordinary gravity that would be required , on both sides , for two people to trust each other in an Aumann cage match .
Yesterday , Robin asked me why I disagree with Roger Schank about whether AI will be general in the foreseeable future .
Well , first , be it said that I am no hypocrite ; I have been explicitly defending immodesty against modesty since long before this blog began .
Roger Schank is a famous old AI researcher who I learned about as the pioneer of yet another false idol , " scripts " .
He used suggestively named LISP tokens , and I 'd never heard it said of him that he had seen the light of Bayes .
So I noted that the warriors of old are often more formidable intellectually than those who venture into the Dungeon of General AI today , but their arms and armor are obsolete .
And I pointed out that Schank 's prediction with its stated reasons seemed more like an emotional reaction to discouragement , than a painstakingly crafted general model of the future of AI research that had happened to yield a firm prediction in this case .
Ah , said Robin , so it is good for the young to disagree with the old .
No , but if the old guy is Roger Schank , and the young guy is me , and we are disagreeing about Artificial General Intelligence , then sure .
If the old guy is , I do n't know , Murray Gell - Mann , and we 're disagreeing about , like , particle masses or something , I 'd have to ask what I was even doing in that conversation .
If the old fogey is Murray Gell - Mann and the young upstart is Scott Aaronson , I 'd probably stare at them helplessly like a deer caught in the headlights .
I 've listed out the pros and cons here , and they balance as far as I can tell :
Murray Gell - Mann won a Nobel Prize back in the eighteenth century for work he did when he was four hundred years younger , or something like that .
Scott Aaronson has more recent training .
... but physics may not have changed all that much since Gell - Mann 's reign of applicability , sad to say .
Aaronson still has most of his neurons left .
I know Aaronson is smart , but Gell - Mann does n't have any idea who Aaronson is .
Aaronson knows Gell - Mann is a Nobel Laureate and would n't disagree lightly .
Gell - Mann is a strong proponent of many - worlds and Aaronson is not , which is one of the acid tests of a physicist 's ability to choose correctly amid controversy .
It is traditional - not Bayesian , not even remotely realistic , but traditional - that when some uppity young scientist is pushing their chosen field as far they possibly can , going past the frontier , they have a right to eat any old scientists they come across , for nutrition .
I think there 's more than a grain of truth in that ideal .
It 's not completely true .
It 's certainly not upheld in practice .
But it 's not wrong , either .
It 's not that the young have a generic right to disagree with the old , but yes , when the young are pushing the frontiers they often end up leaving the old behind .
Everyone knows that and what 's more , I think it 's true .
If someday I get eaten , great .
I still agree with my fifteen - year - old self about some things :
The tribal - status part of our minds , that asks , " How dare you disagree ? " , is just a hindrance .
The real issues of rational disagreement have nothing to do with that part of us ; it exists for other reasons and works by other rhythms .
" How dare you disagree with Roger Schank ? " ends up as a no - win question if you try to approach it on the meta - level and think in terms of generic trustworthiness : it forces you to argue that you yourself are generically above Schank and of higher tribal status ; or alternatively , accept conclusions that do not seem , er , carefully reasoned .
In such a case there is a great deal to be said for simply focusing on the object - level arguments .
But if there are no simple rules that forbid disagreement , can't people always make up whatever excuse for disagreement they like , so they can cling to precious beliefs ?
Look ... it 's never hard to shoot off your own foot , in this art of rationality .
And the more art you learn of rationality , the more potential excuses you have .
If you insist on disagreeing with Gell - Mann about physics , BLAM it goes .
There is no set of rules you can follow to be safe .
You will always have the opportunity to shoot your own foot off .
I want to push my era further than the previous ones : create an advanced art of rationality , to advise people who are trying to reach as high as they can in real life .
They will sometimes have to disagree with others .
If they are pushing the frontiers of their science they may have to disagree with their elders .
They will have to develop the skill - learning from practice - of when to disagree and when not to .
" Don't " is the wrong answer .
If others take that as a welcome excuse to shoot their own feet off , that does n't change what 's really the truly true truth .
I once gave a talk on rationality at Peter Thiel 's Clarium Capital .
I did not want anything bad to happen to Clarium Capital .
So I ended my talk by saying , " And above all , if any of these reasonable - sounding principles turn out not to work , do n't use them . "
In retrospect , thinking back , I could have given the different caution : " And be careful to follow these principles consistently , instead of making special exceptions when it seems tempting . "
But it would not be a good thing for the Singularity Institute , if anything bad happened to Clarium Capital .
That 's as close as I 've ever come to betting on my high - minded advice about rationality in a prediction market - putting my skin in a game with near - term financial consequences .
I considered just staying home - Clarium was trading successfully ; did I want to disturb their rhythm with Centipede 's Dilemmas ?
But because past success is no guarantee of future success in finance , I went , and offered what help I could give , emphasizing above all the problem of motivated skepticism - when I had skin in the game .
Yet at the end I said : " Do n't trust principles until you see them working , " not " Be wary of the temptation to make exceptions . "
I conclude with one last tale of disagreement :
Nick Bostrom and I once took a taxi and split the fare .
When we counted the money we 'd assembled to pay the driver , we found an extra twenty there .
" I 'm pretty sure this twenty is n't mine , " said Nick .
" I 'd have been sure that it was n't mine either , " I said .
" You just take it , " said Nick .
" No , you just take it , " I said .
We looked at each other , and we knew what we had to do .
" To the best of your ability to say at this point , what would have been your initial probability that the bill was yours ? " I said .
" Fifteen percent , " said Nick .
" I would have said twenty percent , " I said .
So we split it $ 8.57 / $ 11.43 , and went happily on our way , guilt - free .
I think that 's the only time I 've ever seen an Aumann - inspired algorithm used in real - world practice .
Our time is a precious commodity that we ca n’t afford to waste .
It is a finite resource that is used up whether we like it or not .
If we do n’t choose to spend it in a particular way , the world around us will choose for us .
WE CAN ’T AFFORD TO LET THIS HAPPEN !
Here are 15 simple , yet essential ways that you can live your life more deliberately and stop letting your destiny be decided for you .
1. Choose your work
This may sound overly simplified , but it is relevant none the less .
How many of you are doing what YOU want to be doing ?
There may be some of you who are exactly where they want to be , but I suspect that many are not .
Whether you hate your job , like it but wish you were doing ____ or just do n’t like your daily routine , it is up to you to actively change your circumstances .
I think that many of us have been burned in the past when we attempted to land our ‘ dream job ’ .
We might feel as though we ’ve ‘ given it our all ’ and just ca n’t do it .
Well I ’m here to tell you that if you settle now , you will feel stuck and unsatisfied the rest of your life .
This is not to say that ‘ if you do n’t do ____ you will never be happy ’ .
Instead I am just sharing a truth of the human heart .
We are passionate beings that need to satisfy our visions of who we want to be and if we settle for a version of ourselves that is below this standard , we will always live in regret .
2. Stop Hanging out
‘ Free Time ’ is a wonderful thing .
The only problem is that it is not actually free .
One way or another , we had to earn it .
So to let this finite recourse just slip away is a terrible thing .
I think it is essential for all of us to have down time .
Even time where we are just watching the clouds go by .
I would just like to encourage you to make sure that the results of this time spent are positive .
Make sure that you are truly benefiting from it .
Because if you find that you are just wasting your time or ‘ killing time ’ , then you seriously need to re-think the way you relax .
3 . Eat deliberately
Our diet has a tremendous effect on our health .
Not just the ‘ how long we live ’ kind of health , but , more importantly , how we feel every hour of every day .
So the next time you buy your food at the grocery store , try to think about what kinds of foods will help promote good , clean , consistent energy and all around health .
4. Actively help others
There ’s no question that we , as human beings , should help one another .
This is a given .
But if we are n’t actively doing so , we will not have a choice in how we want to help .
This is a common area where our society does n’t live deliberately .
We just do our own thing and then hope to be in the right mindset when a need comes our way .
This is often a cause for frustration .
The fact of the matter is : we are not always ready to help .
Maybe our health is bad or we ’ve been overworked and just do n’t have the energy .
Do yourself a favor and actively help others when YOU are in your best condition .
You will be more helpful to the receiving party and will enjoy the process much more .
5 . Give yourself an allowance
Just like our time , our money will just slip through our fingers if we let it .
Most people will pay their bills before they do anything else .
This is fine , but not the best way to go .
Almost every financial adviser you talk to will tell you to pay yourself first .
If you do n’t , you may never truly get paid .
One common argument to this idea is that you may not have enough to pay your bills if you do n’t pay them first .
This can be true , but is not as common as you may think .
Picture your money as a pizza with 3 slices .
One slice is for essential items like your bills , another is for savings ( paying yourself ) and the last slice is for miscellaneous purchases .
This miscellaneous area is full of things that you may not even remember buying .
Things like eating out instead of eating in or buying that $ 5 cup of coffee once or twice a week .
By the end of the month these things add up and you will see that the money to pay yourself is usually there , it ’s just being wasted instead of invested .
6 . Have mini tasks ready for unexpected downtime
Throughout the day we are presented with little bits of downtime .
10 minutes here , 15 minutes there .
Not very much time on their own , but noteworthy if added together .
So instead of just ‘ killing ’ this time , try to come up with a few small tasks that can be worked on when the moment presents itself .
If you do this , you will have found a great tool to chip away at larger tasks , a little bit every day .
7. Play hot potato with your To - Do’s
One of my technology consulting clients uses my services to help him to be more productive .
One of his struggles is in trying to stay on top of all his emails .
He receives hundreds a week and always gets behind .
What I taught him was to treat every email as a hot potato .
Once it is passed to him he has to pass it back as quickly as possible or he will get ‘ burned ’ .
This analogy can be used in every area of productivity .
It ’s nothing new , but is a great way to look at the tasks that come your way .
All too often we let things get backed up and then feel overwhelmed as we try to play catch up .
So instead of allowing this to happen , treat every new ‘ to - do ’ as another hot potato that needs to be taken care of RIGHT NOW .
The more you get into this habit , the less behind you ’ll be and the more productive you ’ll become .
8 . Cut the fat
One of the greatest enemies of living deliberately is clutter .
These unnecessary objects in our lives prevent us from moving throughout our lives with a quick , light efficiency .
Simplify now and create the necessary habits to stay streamlined .
The lighter your load and the less ‘ stuff ’ you have to take care of , the more time and energy you ’ll have to focus on the more important things in life .
9 . Back up your data
This might sound like an ‘ out of place ’ tip , but this could n’t be further from the truth .
We all have computers and most of us have data on these computers that is quite important .
And from my experience as a tech , most of you are n’t backing up some , if not all , of that precious data .
Since we are talking about not letting life happen TO you , I felt it was very fitting to bring this up .
Because once you ’ve gone through one instance where you ’ve ‘ lost it all ’ in a hard drive failure , you will know what I mean when I tell you that this is a completely preventable mess to be in .
There ’s nothing more frustrating than losing your files and knowing that you are the only one to blame .
So do n’t let this life disaster happen to you .
Keep your files backed up and sleep easy at night .
10 . Capture your memories
It ’s widely known and accepted that life is n’t about the destination but about the journey itself .
So why do we rush through this time without capturing the wonderful moments and memories that we encounter .
I would suggest that you make it a high priority to take many pictures and keep many journals or your journey .
15 minutes a day is all it takes to capture some of the key experiences that you can later remember and share with future generations .
This is also important for our ability to remember where we came from .
Knowing where you ’ve been will help you see how far you ’ve come .
11 . Get out of debt
Debt is slavery .
You have to work off the money you owe or you ’ll be in trouble .
Of course I ’m not talking about your mortgage or even most car payments .
But taking out a loan so you can get a new ‘ toy ’ to play with is a big NO NO .
It ’s not worth it .
Just like clutter can cause resistance to your attempts to make progress in your life , so too can debt be a barrier to making the most out of your time and energy .
12 . Physically push yourself
I could have said ‘ Exercise ’ , but I do n’t think this is accurate enough .
Many of us may walk or run every other day or so and this is good .
But I find that many of those same people are n’t really pushing themselves to get stronger and healthier .
It ’s easy to get comfortable in our exercise routines and stop breaking a sweat .
We need to consistently push our bodies past this point of comfort to continue to reap the full benefits that come from exercise .
And if you are n’t getting any kind of workout , well , then , START .
Exercise is one of the best fuels for our motivation .
Without it we are putting ourselves at a huge disadvantage .
13 . Never stop learning
One of my clients is a 90 year old writer who is sharp as a tack .
When I first met her I figured she was in her 70’s , but even then she seemed to be no more than 50 years old in her mind .
When I asked her how she stayed so sharp she replied , “ I never stopped writing . ”
Our minds are muscles that need to be consistently worked out .
Once we stop challenging them , they will only grow weaker .
Just like my client , ‘ never stop writing ’ .
14 .
Be a proactive sleeper
Sleep affects every aspect of our being .
Our minds and our bodies can either thrive or struggle based on the amount and consistency of sleep we get each night .
So in light of this I find it amazing how many people make sleep an afterthought in their lives .
They go to bed ‘ whenever ’ and do n’t realize how much their actions affect how good that sleep really is .
But the fact is , everything from how much exercise we get each day to what and when we eat our meals , has a tremendous affect on how well we sleep .
So make it a high priority to find a sleep routine that works for you and stick with it .
Your motivation and all around well being depends on it !
15 . Dream big with every intention of pursuing
People always say that children ‘ have such a big imagination ’ , as if adults do not .
The fact is that you never lose your ability to imagine , only your ability to believe the ‘ impossible ’ .
When you are a child you can believe that going to the moon is possible .
As an adult you become aware of all that is required to accomplish such a feat and how small your chances are of doing so .
But here ’s the question :
Do people go to the moon ?
Now this is an extreme example , but I want to challenge you to not let your ability to ‘ be realistic ’ stand in your way of reaching for the stars .
If everyone did this we would live in a much less amazing world .
But this is only half of the equation .
Notice I did n’t just say ‘ Dream big ’ .
I added the second part because , if left out , you will just be doing what 99{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} of the rest of the world does .
It is not uncommon for someone to dream big , but rarely do they have any intention of forming a plan , putting in the time and making it a reality .
You can be different !
You can be one of the few that actually pursue your dreams with every intention of attaining them .
Whether it ’s going to the moon or starting your own business , your biggest limitation starts with you .
You may not have total control over your destiny , but if you ’re not deliberately living your life , you are just handing the keys over to someone else .

So you want to be one of the few , the proud , the Linux kernel developers do you ?
Well , it ’s not easy .
But , if you ’ve got the right stuff , Linux is looking for a few good programmers .
On August 13th , the Linux Foundation , the nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting Linux , published a guide to how to participate in the Linux kernel community .
This 30 - page ebook , How to Participate in the Linux Community , was written by noted Linux authority and executive editor of LWN. net ( formerly Linux Weekly News ) Jonathan Corbet .
The book got its start , Amanda McPherson , Linux Foundation vice president of marketing and developer programs , explained at the Linux Foundation ’s April meeting in Austin Tex .
There , McPherson said , several hardware and software developers talked about their troubles in finding who they should talk to in the Linux community to address their concerns , or , for that matter , how they could contribute to Linux .
One of the results was the Linux Application Checker , which enables ISVs ( independent software vendors ) to more easily create applications that will run on multiple Linux distributions and the other is Corbet and the Linux Foundation ’s new Linux Developer Network book
In this book , according to the Foundation , “ Readers will learn why contributing code to the mainline kernel is desirable , how the contribution process works , and how to avoid common pitfalls along the way .
Since the Linux kernel depends on outside contributions for its continued success , it ’s vitally important to make participating in that community easy for new developers .
While the kernel community is thriving with more than 1,000 developers at more than 100 companies contributing just last year , the Linux Foundation , in collaboration with its vendor and technical advisory councils , wants to encourage participation through education and promotion . ”
This is not a programmer ’s guide to the kernel .
Instead , it ’s a discussion of the process by which the kernel is developed ,
It includes sections on the kernel release cycle and the mechanics of merge windows ; how early - stage planning works ; what ’s involved in the coding process , including patch requirements and review , and how to work with patch reviewers .
It also addresses how to manage patches with Git , the Linux kernel version control system .
In a statement , Corbet said , “ While the Linux kernel development process is quite open , it can sometimes be surprising or intimidating to new developers .
This guide should help aspiring kernel developers and their managers understand how kernel development works , how to avoid common pitfalls and how to join our community in making the kernel better for everybody . ”
In an e-mail interview , Corbet expanded on just what you need to actually help develop Linux . “ ?
In general , it ’s a matter of what sort of work you want to do .
If you want to replace the core VM ( Virtual Machine ) page replacement algorithms , you need to have quite a bit of experience behind you .
If you want to contribute certain kinds of documentation , you may not need any development experience at all . ”
“ In general , ” Corbet continued , “ somebody who wants to do development work needs a solid understanding of the C language and some understanding of systems - level programming .
But nobody starts out as an experienced Linux kernel programmer ; that kind of ability comes from actually working in the community and looking at a lot of code .
Developers with some background , some talent , and a willingness to learn will become experienced kernel developers soon enough .
“ More than anything else , ” Corbet added , would be kernel developers need “ A desire to learn .
Everything else , really , is best learned directly from the community . ”
You should also be aware that at the top level , Linus Torvalds has his own sometimes brutally frank way of managing Linux development .
Linux development is not for wusses .
Want to know more ?
You can comment on the guide in the Linux Developer Network and post questions in the forum devoted to Linux development .
The Linux Foundation plans on translating the book into other languages including Chinese , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish .
Translations in other languages will follow .

Some things Sarah Palin is clueless about :
The United States ' current national security policy .
Who attacked us on September 11 , 2001 .
What the Vice President of the United States actually does .
That saying we might have to go to war with Russia is a real bad idea ( funny , cause I thought the view of Russia from Alaska would have given her some perspective on this ) .
And now today , we find out that Palin is even clueless about her own Campaign Manager , Rick Davis :
How is it possible that some people think this woman is an acceptable choice for VP , let alone as a potential president ?
Her complete lack of information is terrifying .
Just like George W. Bush , she is a dangerous combination of arrogance and ignorance .
Like Barack said at the convention , " eight is enough . "
Oscar - winning animator Hayao Miyazaki foregoes computer graphics and returns to the pencil and crayon for his latest film , an East - meets - West nod to Hans Christian Andersen 's " The Little Mermaid " .
Anzeige
Already a hit in Japan , „ Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea , “ opened Sunday at the Venice Film Festival , where it is competing for the coveted Golden Lion .
„ Ponyo “ tells the story of a goldfish who longs to become a girl after getting a glimpse of the human world when she is rescued from a jam jar by 5 - year - old Sosuke , a boy who lives on a cliff above the sea .
As in „ The Little Mermaid , “ Ponyo's transformation is opposed by her father , an underwater sorcerer who was once human , and she must make a sacrifice , in this case her magical powers , to become human .
Only true love can guarantee her transformation .
Anzeige
The film draws easy comparisons to „ The Little Mermaid “ and „ Finding Nemo . “
But unlike „ The Little Mermaid , “ Miyazaki 's underworld setting is not pristine .
And unlike „ Finding Nemo , “ he does n't create an environment that approaches realism .
„ The sea is something that is so very complicated .
I just thought it would be great to draw it by crayon , “ Miyazaki told a news conference Sunday .
While he said that digital techniques are useful , they have at times become excessive .
„ I think animation at times needs the pencil and needs man 's drawing hand , “ Miyazaki said .
Anzeige
Miyazaki 's animation depicts layers of sea life churning one over the other .
Waves transform into fish and back again , schools of fish surge as if a wave .
Details keep it real and modern : a passing frigate in the background , a knocked - over flowerpot in a storm , a broken piece of ramen noodle on the coffee table .
Miyazaki acknowledged inspiration from the Hans Christian Andersen story , but said the similarity was only glancing .
He said he was always bothered even as a child that Andersen 's mermaids were deprived of souls .
„ Ponyo “ is set in modern - day Japan and Ponyo of course is no mermaid .
She is a goldfish , with human face , whose transformation into a girl is evolutionary : first sprouting hands and feet that resemble those of a chicken and become more human as the affection between her and Sosuke grows .
Anzeige
Ponyo is all soul , showing her human side as she clings toddler - like to her first human possessions – a blue bucket , a towel and a lamp – and interacts tenderly with a human infant .
The movie 's final message is one of absolute , unconditional love and acceptance .
In the closing scene , the 5 - year - old Sosuke pledges his love to Ponyo , be she fish , human , or something in between .
„ Ponyo “ has been reported to be the 67 - year - old Miyazaki 's last film , but he suggested other projects were in the works – though that he would rely increasingly on contributions from his staff .
„ I am 67 years old , when I do my next work , I 'll be more than 70 , so I probably will have to have help from the younger generation , “ said Miyazaki , who took home the lifetime achievement award from Venice in 2005 .
In Japan , Ponyo had taken in 11.46 billion yen ( US $ 104 million ) from its July 19 opening to Aug. 24 , which its distributor said was behind the pace of Miyazaki's Academy Award - winning „ Spirited Away , “ which reportedly took in some 30.4 billion yen ( approximately US$ 300 million ) .
„ Ponyo “ is being distributed in the United States by Disney , but no release date has been set .
It will begin rolling out in European markets toward the end of the year .

While jams and other consumer products are strictly regulated and are required to pass stringent tests before they can be sold , tobacco has no restrictions and manufacturers can , and do , add anything they want into the product .
A new editorial discusses the issues surrounding tobacco regulations and how the industry could be more effectively governed .
“ The establishment of regulation is a political process and occurs slowly .
However , with the gradual but prolonged and massive epidemic of tobacco - related diseases , regulation of the industry ’s products – specifically the constituents of tobacco smoke – has to begin now ” , says author Dr. Nigel Gray , member of the World Health Organization ’s ( WHO ) Tobacco Regulation Study Group . *
Despite the complexities of regulating cigarette manufacturing , the Tobacco Regulation Study Group , or TobReg , has proposed practical means to begin the progressive process of tobacco regulation .
As a first step , it has suggested setting mandatory levels for some of the major carcinogens and toxicants in cigarettes .
In addition , regular reviews must also be conducted as initial toxin levels are considered generous by industry standards for many countries .
“ There is no need for an expensive bureaucracy to oversee this regulation .
Countries can simply mandate TobReg ’s recommendations and publicize them as advice from the world ’s central public health board .
Countries without cigarette manufacturing facilities can simply refuse to import cigarette that do not meet these standards ” , says Dr. Gray .
He adds , “ International standards are highly desirable as large amounts of cigarettes are traded between countries with differing national standards .
It is timely for WHO to set standards and offer world leadership – particularly as their Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is now in its implementation process , albeit much slower than most public health advocates would desire .
Singapore , Australia and New Zealand are ideally placed to pioneer the introduction of these measures . ”
COMMENTARY :
One reason the debate question , “ Is terrorism warfare or crime ? ” irks me is that it is patently both .
Take Colombia ’s sad experience as a particularly prima facie example .
All but the most ritually blind Marxists now concede Colombia ’s “ leading insurgent army , ” the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , is a narcotics cartel with a residual political agenda .
Of course they would n’t mind being the Colombian government , which may or may not differentiate them from American mafiosos , but during the decades of Colombia ’s heinous violence , whatever social idealism powered FARC has decayed .
In Colombia , Marx became Murder Inc .
The Colombian people knew it .
In early February 2008 , the New York Times quoted a Colombian citizen who was participating in an anti-FARC demonstration held in downtown Bogota .
“ The FARC made themselves into criminals a long time ago , ” declared Martin Orozco , identified by the reporter as a surgeon .
“ We are simply tired of this [ i.e. , FARC ’s violence ] . ”
In some ways , this is old truth rediscovered the hard way .
There ’s often a fine law between smuggling and rebellion - the line is there , but thin .
The Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) - which became a de facto U.S. and NATO ally in 1999 - had intimate ties with Balkan smugglers and criminal groups .
This intelligence analyst ’s rule of thumb holds true for Macedonia , Pakistan , the Philippines , the Horn of Africa , Chad , Sudan and even Iran .
It certainly holds true for Iraq , where small crimes empower al Qaeda ’s mass murder .
In an interview last week , Gen. David Petraeus , commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq , told me : “ We have , in fact , put considerable emphasis on how al Qaeda , in Iraq , generates resources .
And they do it , again , like a mafia does , that we would be familiar with .
It ’s through extortion of successful businesses ; extortion of money for protection rackets , or what have you ; insisting that a cell phone business , for example , give them a cut of their profits or they ’ll blow the cell phones down - cell phone towers down ; taking a cut out of the cement business , the real estate business , the financial businesses and so forth . ”
The “ special groups ” that connect to Iran also connect to local crime in Iraq .
More often than not , Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Militia operated as a criminal gang in neighborhoods it controlled in eastern Baghdad and southern Iraq .
Again , this is n’t news .
In August 2004 , I had open source reports cross my desk in Baghdad where Iraqis referred to the Mahdi Militia as “ gangsters . ”
Do n’t blame that on translation from the Arabic to English .
I personally heard an Iraqi describe Sheik al - Sadr ’s militia as criminals .
Stopping the crimes financing the terrorists wo n’t defeat terrorist organizations .
However , focused countercrime operations will crimp their finances and , to use a term I heard a police counterterror officer use , “ pressurize ” the terrorists ’ environment .
Gen. Petraeus ’ “ Anaconda Strategy ” in Iraq employs a number of anti-crime measures and anti-corruption measures , each one applying pressure to a terrorist organization .
The Taliban tried a similar cell phone tower extortion racket , but it backfired .
StrategyPage reported on June 15 that the Taliban were expanding “ their extortion campaign , demanding that businesses pay ‘ protection money ’ to avoid being attacked ” and an effort by the Taliban “ to control cell phone use has quickly evolved into just another extortion campaign . ”
In several rural areas in Afghanistan , the Taliban launched a campaign to shut down cell phone service at night .
However , tribes in the area ( who are often pro-Taliban ) wanted “ the cell phone service in order to stay in touch with friends , family and the few government services that are available . ”
The Taliban attacks angered the tribes , which “ demanded that night service be restored .
It was .
But then , noting that there were several cell phone companies operating in southern Afghanistan , the Taliban went to the different companies and offered not only ‘ protection , ’ but damage to a competitor , for a price . ”
There is a case to be made that the Taliban ’s strategic depth is n’t Pakistani territory .
Sure , tribal connections protect the Taliban , but money powers the organization , and increasingly that money comes from criminal enterprise and specifically the opium trade .

WASHINGTON — A decade ago , Sen . John McCain embraced legislation to broadly deregulate the banking and insurance industries , helping to sweep aside a thicket of rules established over decades in favor of a less restricted financial marketplace that proponents said would result in greater economic growth .
Now , as the Bush administration scrambles to stabilize a tumultuous Wall Street , the Republican presidential nominee is scrambling to recast himself as a champion of regulation to end “ reckless conduct , corruption and unbridled greed ” on Wall Street .
“ Government has a clear responsibility to act in defense of the public interest , and that ’s exactly what I intend to do , ” a fiery McCain said at a rally in Tampa on Tuesday .
“ In my administration , we ’re going to hold people on Wall Street responsible .
And we ’re going to enact and enforce reforms to make sure that these outrages never happen in the first place . ”
McCain hopes to tap into anger among voters who are looking for someone to blame for the economic meltdown that threatens their home values , bank accounts and 401 ( k ) plans .
But his past support of congressional deregulation efforts and his arguments against “ government interference ” in the free market by federal , state and local officials have given Sen.
Barack Obama an opening to press the advantage Democrats traditionally have in times of economic trouble .
In 2002 , McCain introduced a bill to deregulate the broadband Internet market , warning that “ the potential for government interference with market forces is not limited to federal regulation . ”
Three years earlier , McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then - Sen .
Phil Gramm , R - Texas , who now is an economic adviser to his campaign .
The Gramm - Leach - Bliley
Act aimed to make the country ’s financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression - era walls between banking , investment and insurance companies .
That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market .
But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments .
McCain now condemns the executives at those companies for pursuing the ambitions that the Gramm - Leach - Bliley
Act made possible , saying that “ in an endless quest for easy money , they dreamed up investment schemes that they themselves do n’t even understand . ”
He said the misconduct was aided by “ casual oversight by regulatory agencies in Washington , ” where he said oversight is “ scattered , unfocused and ineffective . ”
“ They have n’t been doing their job right , ” McCain said Tuesday , “ or else we would n’t have these massive problems on Wall Street , and that ’s a fact .
At their worst , they ’ve been caught up in Washington turf wars instead of working together to protect investors and the public interest . ”
Tuesday , Obama seized on what he called McCain ’s “ newfound support for regulation ” and accused his rival of supporting “ a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy . ”
In a speech in Golden , Colo. , Obama blamed the economic crisis on an “ economic philosophy ” that he said McCain and President Bush supported blindly .
“ John McCain has spent decades in Washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers , ” he told a crowd of about 2,100 at the Colorado School of Mines .
“ So let ’s be clear :
What we ’ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed . ”
Obama released a TV ad that mocks McCain for saying Monday that “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ” and asks :
“ How can John McCain fix our economy if he does n’t understand it ’s broken ? ”
He also poked fun at McCain for proposing a commission to examine the crisis , calling that “ the oldest Washington stunt in the book . ”
“ This is n’t 9/11 .
We know how we got into this mess , ” Obama said .
“ What we need now is leadership that gets us out .
I ’ll provide it , John McCain wo n’t , and that ’s the choice for the American people in this election . ”
Obama reiterated his economic proposals : a stimulus plan and protections for struggling homeowners .
Over the long term , he proposes enhancing regulations of the financial markets , including creating an advisory panel to regularly update the president .
McCain ’s proposed changes for the system were equally vague .
“ There will be constant access to the books and accounts of our banks and other financial institutions , ” he said .
“ By law , it will reduce the debt and risk that any bank can take on .
And above all , I promise reforms to prevent the kind of wild speculation that can put our markets at risk , and has already inflicted such enormous damage across our economy . ”
McCain stumbled Monday when the financial crisis peaked , first saying the “ fundamentals ” of the economy were strong .
After being hammered by Obama and the Democrats — “ What economy is he talking about ? ” Obama asked — he said that he knows the economy is in crisis , but that the basis of the American economy , the American worker , is strong .
By Tuesday , McCain had retooled the message further , and tried to wrap the financial meltdown into his campaign ’s greater message about changing “ the way Washington does business . ”
I would like to diverge a little from past articles and give a little background on how these stories evolve and eventually get published ; a little behind the scenes perspective , if you will .
The output of these stories has slowed since the c2k8 hackathon .
At the rate I 'm going , c2k9 will be just around the corner after I 'm done .
Read on to get the scoop and more from the c2k8 developers :
Ryan McBride ( mcbride@ ) noticed that I was slowing down a bit after Part 5 and asked how long it actually takes to publish an article , " an hour ? " .
He asked in earnest but it made me realise that people do n't know how much is actually involved in publishing an article .
Ryan and I are pretty close so he only got a light Judo whippin ' .
Actually , it takes a few days to get everything just right , not including writing the actual article .
I also have to sift through all the photos and do the flickr thing but other than that it 's just me , my X40 , vi , lots of coffee and a relaxing couch to hunker down in .
Oh , and this is all done in my spare time .
When I think that I 'm ready to put up an article , I log into Undeadly and submit a story .
An automated email is then sent out to all the undeadly editors so that they are notified that an article has been posted for review .
The editors are really thorough at finding the typos , grammar and syntax errors besides helping to improve the article and linkify man pages .
English is not one of my strengths and so I 'm extremely grateful for their help .
Thanks Jason Dixon , Johan M:son Lindman , Paul ' WEiRD ' de Weerd , Janne Johansson , Mike Erdely , Owain Ainsworth , Marco Peerboom and Ray Lai .
Now back to some more c2k8 coverage .
If you did n't know already , both David Gwynne ( dlg@ ) and Marco Peerboom ( marco@ ) have also done presentations on the subject .
The sensors framework in OpenBSD is awesome !
Think of all that sensor tools in OpenBSD : sysctl ( 3 ) , systat ( 1 ) , sensorsd ( 8 ) , ntpd ( 8 ) , and snmpd ( 8 ) besides remote monitoring tools .
The number of supported drivers that hook into OpenBSD 's sensors framework is really impressive .
Here is what Constantine had to say about his work and time at the c2k8 hackathon :
At c2k8 , Theo suggested that I take a look into the ipmi( 4 ) , specifically , on why it appears to have started to conflict with acpi( 4 ) on some machines .
Not having any machines with IPMI at home , I ‘ booked ’ some of the server machines downstairs from the hackroom .
After enabling IPMI in all of the machines which I could lay my hands on , it just worked .
But it exposed and reminded me of one expected behaviour that was new to 4.3 , specifically , the delayed ipmi0 thread .
It creates the ipmi0 sensors after the system goes multi-user , so that you do n't have to wait in your console during the boot time until ipmi discovers all of its sensors ( can take a minute or two on many machines ) .
It was a delay that was very apparent during the boot time .
Anyhow , our sensorsd lacked support for hotpluggable sensors , and these ipmi( 4 ) sensors are in a sense hotpluggable , since they are not present when sensorsd is started from the rc( 8 ) script . ldattach ( 8 ) , and after testing it out , the hotplugging functionality was committed .
The only case which turned out not to have been tested is when sensorsd starts with no sensors available .
Luckily , one of the sparc64 machines downstairs , which kettenis@ was using earlier , turned out to not have any sensors , and I 've noticed a small bug in the new logic , which was quickly fixed .
( Of course , testing the no-sensors scenario was also possible on those machines that do have sensors , by disabling them , but since most machines have so many sensors , disabling them may take a bit of time , and after all , testing in real - life conditions is always more fun than simulating such conditions . )
By the way , you can still compile and run the new sensorsd on OpenBSD 4.1 , since there were no changes to the underlying API since the introduction of the two - level addressing ( although the ABI did change for 4.2 ) .
After our IPMI specialist marco@ arrived , we 've tried figuring out what might be the problem with ipmi on certain machines .
I took some of marco 's suggestions about the timing in the delay function , but it did n't appear to make much difference .
The matter was complicated by not having ready access to those problematic machines , and the whole problem was n't too clear either , so we 've left it for some other time to figure it out .
As a summary , ipmi( 4 ) is once again enabled , and now you can once again get sensorsd to automatically report on any state changes in ipmi( 4 ) by automatically starting sensorsd from the system startup script , by specifying sensorsd_flags= " " in /etc/rc.conf.local .
Hotpluggable timedelta sensors are now fully supported by sensorsd , too , of course .
Constantine .
Gordon Willem Klok ( gwk@ ) has been working on old Macs , AMD 's powernow , amd64 and i386 setperf and ACPI .
I do n't have any old Macs but I do have him to thank for setperf and ACPI .
Unfortunately , I did n't see Gordon that much at the hackathon .
I think that he had another conference that he was committed too right in the middle of c2k8 .
As such , I only found two pictures of him throughout the event and sadly I did n't get an opportunity to talk with him .
Nevertheless , here is what Gordon had to say about his work and time at the c2k8 hackathon :
During c2k8
I chose to work on something that I had been meaning to do for a long time : allow the openbsd enhanced speed step driver to make use of ACPI .
The original speed step driver made use of values found in data sheets , however more than a few years ago Intel stopped publishing the values in the processors data sheets requiring the drivers to retrieve state information from ACPI .
The problem is that the ACPI cannot directly support changing the core frequency of the processor using powernow or enhanced speedstep as ACPI has no notion of processor registers , only addresses in memory or I /O ports .
Intel suggested a solution to the bios makers consisting of code running in SMM that mimics the original speedstep which the operating system used by writing to an I/ O port on the south bridge , Intel solution was then to have the SMM code trap writes to this I/O port and then write the correct values into the registers the downside being that transitioning to SMM is very expensive compared to the speed of a native EST change .
I wrote the code for setting the _PDC and altered the est driver to interface to the acpicpu code much like the powernow drivers do for AMD processors , however it did not work at first .
canacar@ and I poked around examining the AML then jordan@ arrived , and I showed the problem to him and he quickly realized the problem was a missing opcode that OpenBSD 's AML interpreter did not implement .
Jordan created a patch to implement the missing opcode and then my code could do its thing , my x60 test machine could now find and use 4 states .
I took another day or so to clean this proof of concept up into committable code for the amd64 port and finish a version that will work on i386 which I will soon be mailing to tech for the i386 architecture so please watch for it and test .

Thanks to Constantine and Gordon for their great work with IPMI , ACPI , sensors and the other tools that take advantage of them for our benefit .

The map has been updated since this post was made !
The new , improved version is here Some time ago , a person named Katharine Gates designed a map of human sexuality .
Her Web site appears to be defunct now , but the map has recently gained exposure in other places
My first impression upon seeing this fetish map was that it was woefully incomplete .
About the same time as I became aware of this attempt to map the range of human fetishes and sexual activity , I also saw a conversation on another forum in which a woman was complaining that she wanted to spice up her sex life , but she did n't want to domuch , because if she did too much too fast then by the time she was 30 she'd have done every sexual act there was to do , and where would she be able to find sexual ideas after that ?
That particular conversation , and another with an 18 - year - old who claimed to be " bored with sex " because he'd " done it all , " got me to thinking about the range of the human sexual condition ( vast beyond all reckoning ) and the range of sexual things many peoplethere is ( tiny ) .
I wanted to try my hand at designing a fetish map that would be a bit more complete than Ms. Gates ' , and I thought , why not do it as an actual map ?
One of the ideas I wanted to convey was how small most folks ' sexual experience is , how small most folks ' conception of the whole range of sexual expression is , and how vast therange of sexual expression is .
And , I thought , a map of an imaginary world might be a way to do that .
So here it is , the first version of what I 'm sure will be many revisions of the Land of Human Sexuality .
( Clicky on this map to see a bigger version .
A much , much , much , MUCH bigger version . )
The land of most folks ' awareness is the Island of Mundania and the surrounding islands .
Across the Straits of Fear is the portion of the continent that folks are generally aware of to some extent ( gay sex , threesomes , light bondage , and so on ) .
Beyond the Great Barrier Mountains and the Lesser Barrier Mountains , which demarcate the limits of common knowledge of different fetishes , lie the more exotic forms of sexual expression ( natori , shibari , cosplay , fisting , puppy play , and so forth ) .
In the frigid arctic wastes to the far north are those activities which only a very , very tiny percentage even of veteran , seasoned kinksters finds appealing ( nullification , erotic cannibalism , necrophilia , and that sort of thing ) .
There 's no particular meaning to the size or color of the various areas ; it'd be an impossible task to try to , for example , figure out how many furries there are compared to how many folks are into TENS units .
Likewise , some of the activities listed could reasonably belong to more than one classification , and some things ( like " gay sex " ) are within the realm of knowledge of most folks but are n't really activities ( most sexual activities not requiring physical possession of a penis or a vagina can be done by people of any sex or sexual orientation ) .
Nevertheless , when folks think of " sexual things to do , " gay sex does seem to be considered its own thing , even though it 's not actually an activity by itself , so it's on the map - - right across the Straits of Fear .
Anyway , I 'd love to hear feedback and commentary on this map .
I 'v actually been working on it for quite a long time , and I suspect it 's still a work in progress -- Ithere are things I 've forgotten .
( It 's hard work trying to remember every form of fetish out there ! )
The V&A Museum has paid slightly over £ 50,000 at auction for the original drawings of the Rolling Stones logo , devised by British designer John Pasche in 1970 , it announced last night .
Pasche was studying at London ’s Royal College of Art when Stones frontman Mick Jagger , disappointed by the designs put forward by record label Decca , began looking for a design student to help create a logo .
The logo was commissioned for £ 50 , but the Rolling Stones were so pleased with the design they gave Pasche a bonus of £ 200 .
Pasche had already decided to sell the drawing at a US auction house when the V&A enquired about borrowing it for an exhibition .
On learning the work was for sale , the museum lodged a winning bid of $ 92,500 on Saturday , half of which was provided by the Art Fund charity .
The inspiration for the eventual logo , which took Pasche around two weeks of work , has never been in doubt .
“ I wanted something anti-authority , but I suppose the mouth idea came from when I met Jagger for the first time at the Stones ’ offices .
I went into this sort of wood - panelled boardroom and there he was .
Face to face with him , the first thing you were aware of was the size of his lips and his mouth . ”

I ’ve lately been thinking about Twitter .
I wanted some way to quickly post tweets from the command line .
But I also wanted to be able to receive them in a non-intrusive way on all my machines .
And I wanted to work with Twitter and Identi.ca both .
Nothing quite existed to do that , so I wrote Twidge .
Twidge is a command - line Twitter client .
It can be run quite nicely interactively , with output piped through less .
Or you can run it as a unidirectional or bidirectional mail gateway .
Or you can use its parser - friendly output options to integrate it with shell scripts or other programs .
It ’s got an 11 - page manual ( which is also its manpage ) .
User - friendly in the best tradition of command line programs .
And it ’s released today .
The source packages include the debian / directory for you to use for building them , but I ’ve also posted an i386 binary that runs on etch and sid on my webpage , until it gets out of NEW .
See the homepage for more info .
Oh , it ’s written in Haskell , by the way .
Even in tough budget times , there are lines that can not be crossed .
So I was startled by this tidbit reported recently by The Associated Press : When Sarah Palin was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , the small town began billing sexual - assault victims for the cost of rape kits and forensic exams .
Ms. Palin owes voters an explanation .
What was the thinking behind cutting the measly few thousand dollars needed to cover the yearly cost of swabs , specimen containers and medical tests ?
Whose dumb idea was it to make assault victims and their insurance companies pay instead ?
Unfortunately , her campaign is shielding the candidate from the press , so Americans may still be waiting for answers on Election Day .
The rape - kit controversy is a troubling matter .
The insult to rape victims is obvious .
So is the sexism inherent in singling them out to foot the bill for investigating their own case .
And the main result of billing rape victims is to protect their attackers by discouraging women from reporting sexual assaults .
That ’s why when Senator Joseph Biden , the Democratic vice - presidential nominee , drafted the 1994 Violence Against Women Act , he included provisions to make states ineligible for federal grant money if they charged rape victims for exams and the kits containing the medical supplies needed to conduct them .
( Senator John McCain , Ms. Palin ’s running mate , voted against Mr. Biden ’s initiative , and his name has not been among the long list of co-sponsors each time the act has been renewed . )

Reupholstering an old piece of furniture is a great way to update it and help it to match with your decor .
One of the most fun parts of upholstering is choosing the fabric .
There are many different types of upholstery fabrics available to choose from .
Here the benefits and downsides of some of the most popular upholstery fabrics to help make your decision easier and to be sure that you get a fabric that is perfect for your room .
Although leather is more expensive than other types of upholstery fabric it is extremely durable and can last for years .
It also brings a certain elegance to a piece of furniture and helps it to look upscale and classic .
Leather is one of the most popular choices in upholstery fabric because of its durability and simply because it looks beautiful .
Although vinyl upholstery fabric may seem like a good alternative to leather , it actually can be quite uncomfortable to sit on .
Not only that but over time it has a tendency to crack as it ages which means it wo n't last nearly as long as many other types of upholstery fabric .
The main benefit of choosing vinyl for your upholstery fabric is that it is easy to clean ; however the uncomfortable texture and relatively short lifetime should be considered before choosing vinyl for your furniture .
Linen is probably not the best choice for upholstery fabric for most people .
Linen wrinkles easily and also takes a lot of care to help keep it clean .
The fibers in linen can have a tendency to stretch which means it will also require extra care to help keep its shape .
When it comes to upholstery fabric there are much better choices than linen .
Denim or heavy cotton fabrics are a great choice for upholstering a piece of furniture .
Cotton fibers are durable and tough and stand up well to most types of cleaning solutions and to every day wear and tear .
Look for cotton fabric or denim that is color fast for ease of cleaning .
After you 've upholstered the furniture consider treating the fabric with a stain resistant spray to help protect it .
This is a guest post by Maciej Pasternacki , a Google Summer of Code student who created CL - OpenID .
The summer is gone ( September does n’t count as summer ) , and so is the Google Summer of Code 2008 program .
My Summer of Code project was CL - OpenID , an implementation of OpenID for Common Lisp , and its a pleasure to me to announce CL - OpenID version 1.0 Release Candidate 1 .
I would like to specially thank my mentor Anton Vodonosov .
He ’s put a lot of effort into this project and I enjoyed a lot working with him .
CL - OpenID is an implementation of the OpenID Authentication 2.0 standard , and is compatible with OpenID Authentication 1.1 .
Both Relying Party , and OpenID Provider are implemented .
The package is only a Release Candidate , as I feel it ’s a bit too early to call it version 1.0 .
The code needs some time to rest : there remain a few rough edges to be dealt with , and I would feel better having a better test coverage .
It would be also great to have at least one real , working application .
The API is almost completely stable .
Version 1.0 may export some additional symbols , but what ’s exported now will keep being available .
The code is available under the terms of the Lisp Lesser GNU Public License , which is Franz , Inc. ‘s preamble to the GNU LGPL version 2.1 , developed specifically for Lisp applications to clarify C- oriented terms and other details .
A brief summary of the official announcement :
Finally , I ’d like to thank everybody involved in the development of OpenID .
OpenID tries to solve a tough problem , and even though it ’s not perfect , it seems to be doing a great job .
We have not seen the last of the witch hunter .
We know Pastor Thomas Muthee was back in Wasilla this past weekend , and I posted a link previously of Sarah Palin recounting the time that Pastor Muthee had prayed over her , but now a video of the actual event has surfaced .
Do not , I repeat do not watch this if you plan on sleeping any time soon .
It ’s a long clip , but here are the highlights :
2:57 – First mention of Sarah
5:00 – We need God to ‘ take over the education system . ’
5:27 – We need God to ‘ take over the media ’ and Hollywood itself .
6:08 – We need the government run by born - again Christians .
6:58 – Praying for Sarah to become governor ( Does n’t this impact their tax - exempt status ?
Anyone ? )
7:12 – Sarah herself enters and is “ prayed upon ” .
8:38 – Another witchcraft reference .
Oh boy .
The suspension of Mcain ’s campaign , the beyond devastating Couric interview , Return of the Witch Hunter and the takeover of every facet of society by God , and the ( strangely credible these days ) National Enquirer releasing a story about an affair with Todd ’s business partner … all in 24 hours .
Not a good day for the McCain - Palin campaign .
It appears as if Pastor Muthee is working hard to fulfill the vision statement of his church , known as “ The Prayer Cave ” :
“ Touching lives for total community transformation , thereby taking cities and nations . ”
Resistance is futile , Wasilla .
You have been assimilated .
I wonder if Palin mentioned “ taking cities and nations ” for God during her chat yesterday with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai ?
I ’ll be sleeping with the lights on tonight .

The dirty secret of your NHS
Under the pretence of recycling , NHS computers have been dumped in Ghana , where their hard drives are mined of your confidential data by criminal gangs ... while children die melting down the highly toxic empty shells .
Special Live investigation by Jonathan Green
We arrive shortly after the fight .
The boy had grovelled in the dirt for mercy , whimpering as blood dripped from his cracked skull .
With the computer monitor that had been broken over his head lying on the ground nearby , filthy children with glassy - eyed stares and twisted smirks had stood over him .
Burning off the plastic insulation from computer wiring to get the copper at a dump in Accra , Ghana
Some of them had laughed at him as the tears rolled down his dirty face .
The boy had been beaten in a vicious quarrel over a length of copper wire probably worth less than 50p .
We were drawn to this place by a doomsday column of black smoke .
It darkens an already brooding sky to the east of the city of Accra in Ghana , West Africa .
Heads down , looking as inconspicuous as possible , we darted through swarms of beggars and ragged children on the road near Agbogbloshie Market .
' Keep smiling , ' said my guide Mike , as we tried to ignore hateful glances from angry - looking men in one of the dangerous slums .
' There are gangsters here , guys from prisons with machetes and cudgels who do n't want to be found or photographed .
Put the camera away .'
We crossed a polluted river that was swarming with clouds of flies and mosquitoes and reeked of human excrement and urine .
Then a metallic , sulphurous tang filled my throat , making me gag .
As we drew nearer , my right eye began to prickle oddly , then it became harder to draw breath .
Where we were heading was highly toxic , even from half a mile away .
We turned off the bustling main road down a rutted , muddy track .
Gangs of youths gave us hostile glances .
One group sat on their haunches , sucking on marijuana joints and eyeing us from behind dark glasses .
We pressed on .
Shortly afterwards , we arrived in a poisonous , post - apocalyptic hell - a sprawling , toxic dumping ground stretching for a mile or two .
This is the final resting place for your old TV , computer or mobile phone .
Piles of cracked computer monitors sit in rancid pools of noxious green slime .
The circuit boards and innards of old PCs leak toxic mercury , beryllium and cadmium , poisoning the earth .
Underfoot , my boot crushes a cathode ray tube , releasing a puff of glass particulates around my ankles .
The air is poisoned , thick with the highly toxic burning lead and plastics .
My lungs begin to ache .
Scampering over these mounds of decaying computers are red-eyed gangs of wild , young boys in rags with names such as Schoolboy and Blackie .
It 's like William Golding 's Lord Of The Flies , the allegorical novel about a group of English schoolboys stranded on a desert island after a plane crash who make a disastrous attempt to govern themselves , leading swiftly to violence and murder .
Fights over the spoils of trashed computers break out hourly .
At the scene of the earlier scuffle is Kofi Wiafe , a skinny 13 - year - old who seems subdued compared to the other boys .
He comes from the north of the country .
He is just one of hundreds of young boys from poverty - stricken backgrounds who are drawn here to scavenge metal from e-waste , as it's called .
Some come from as far afield as Nigeria , Togo and Ivory Coast .
At the dump , Kofi is known as Schoolboy because he arrived here after running away from home dressed in his school uniform , the only clothes he had .
Thames Gateway NHS
Trust computers found at the site
He takes us past the whimpering boy into the lawless heart of the dump .
' The fight was nothing , ' he says , as he limps along among the broken glass and jagged metal in flip - flops .
' I 've seen worse .
' The whites of his eyes are so bloodshot it looks like they 're bleeding .
He blinks back constant tears .
There 's a dirty , blood - encrusted bandage around the shin of his left leg that hides a septic , pus - filled sore .
He cut his leg on a computer monitor he was smashing open with a rock to get the copper wire inside .
We negotiate a swampy puddle , empty computer cases placed as stepping stones , as the rank water emits oily , burnt - plastic fumes .
' I can't run any more , ' says Schoolboy .
' My lungs hurt when I do .
I have a headache and I feel sick and I can never sleep .
At night my heart beats so hard it feels like it 's going to fall off .
But even if I 'm sick I have to work , otherwise I do n't eat .
I hate it here .'
Who is exporting this toxic junk and causing the misery ?
We find a clump of old monitors on the edge of one of the squalid slums that ring the dump site and are shocked by what we see .
Stamped clearly on the monitors in blue lettering is the name of the previous owner : Thames Gateway NHS Trust .
Worse still , confidential information about British patients is turning up on these old computers .
A few days later , we bought a computer containing medical information alongside 5,000 names and addresses of patients in England .
The computer was just one of a stack of old NHS machines , clearly marked with the names of the various NHS trusts to which they once belonged .
One of the computers we bought for £ 75 showed the prescriptions issued to patients by a pharmacy in Leeds , West Yorkshire : Viagra , disulphuram for alcohol dependence , the anti-psychotic drug quetiapine and midazolam for anxiety and insomnia .
It also revealed the patient 's date of birth and personal information .
' This information can be used for all sorts of terrible things : extortion , blackmail , breaking into bank accounts , ' says Jim Puckett , head of the Basel Action Network , which campaigns to get the e-waste trade stopped .
' It 's dangerous . '
The desperate situation here is part of a pattern all over the globe - First World nations dump their electronic rubbish on developing countries , poisoning communities , polluting water sources and causing birth defects , mental retardation and , ultimately , death .
This is happening in India , Pakistan , China and other parts of Africa .
There is a spiteful cynicism to the trade in Ghana , where once Europeans rapaciously stripped the continent of slaves , gold and salt .
Today , the ships bring cargo in rather than out , dumping toxic waste where once they plundered .
My guide , Mike Anane , is founder of Ghana 's League Of Environmental Journalists .
We examine the NHS monitors .
' It 's scandalous , ' he says .
One of the old NHS computers that Live discovered on sale in Ghana
' The British NHS 's job is to save lives , and here it is killing children in Africa .
It is a huge part of the problem at these hazardous waste sites .
And here we are talking about computers that come from British doctors who have taken the Hippocratic Oath to save lives . '
Crouched around small piles of old electronics , boys in filthy trousers take crude home - made hammers to monitors and computer cases .
When the screens break open there 's a dull ' whump ' followed by the sound of tinkling glass .
Schoolboy says he has seen boys lose fingers and others go blind .
None can afford a trip to the hospital , let alone tetanus injections or even antibiotic cream .
All over this desolate wasteland , between the mounds of old computers , the boys tend fires that spew acrid black smoke .
We walk to a fire where a huddled group of boys are sullenly stoking a metal pan that splutters with a molten metal .
Streaming black smoke roars from the fire and drifts over to the slums where Schoolboy lives .
' It 's lead , ' the boys tell us , dead - eyed .
' The British NHS 's job is to save lives , and here it is killing children in Africa '
They 're feeding the fire with shattered cathode ray tubes .
The average computer monitor contains about 5Ð7 lb of lead .
Another fire is fed with tangled , spaghetti - like clumps of wires ; they 're burning the plastic - encased copper to get at the precious metal .
This releases a carcinogenic cloud of toxins .
' The very worst thing that can be done with toxic waste is to burn it in uncontrolled conditions , ' Jim Puckett tells me later .
Puckett 's life has been threatened several times in Nigeria and China , where he has filmed the human cost of this trade .
' Combustion releases toxic metals - lead , beryllium , cadmium , mercury - into the atmosphere .
Likewise , burning creates some of the most carcinogenic and toxic substances known , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , dioxins and furans .
Just the lead alone released by such burning will have a devastating impact on the development of children and their central nervous systems .
We can expect more infant mortality , birth defects and brain dysfunction within just a few years , particularly among those living near the dumps and working in this nightmarish recycling business . '
Burning lead is extremely hazardous .
Scientific studies have shown that those exposed to lead poisoning are more likely to be aggressive and impulsive .
In fact , US economist Rick Nevin believes high violent - crime statistics can be directly traced to lead .
He has researched this link in nine countries .
' It 's stunning how strong the association is , ' he has claimed .
Children search for computer components in piles of filth
' Sixty - five to 90 per cent or more of the substantial variation in violent crime in all these countries was explained by lead . '
It 's one explanation for why fights break out with such regularity here at the dump .
In the dead of night , lorries arrive at Agbogbloshie , often with their headlights off .
They dump cracked and broken old computers and TVs .
We 're told it 's much too dangerous to visit the dump at night to witness this .
' After dark you are playing with your life , ' says Mike .
' There are seriously tough and dangerous people involved in this . '
At 6 am in the grey light of dawn , and sometimes earlier , gaggles of boys acting like vultures swarm over the circuit boards and cracked monitors from the previous night 's illegal dumping .
The crazed scramble for anything of value begins .
From the age of four , these young boys scavenge metal for muscular men in their early twenties .
They are Fagin - type characters .
' They beat us when they think we have stolen their copper , ' says Israel , a filthy 14 - year - old .
As I photograph a pile of old , yellowing monitors , several men start shouting , eyes blazing with indignation .
One , in wraparound shades and a football shirt , is clearly the leader .
' You !
White man !
Get away from those . '
After some placatory words that ease the hostility , we discover that he calls himself Sharp Dollar .
He runs a fleet of seven carts made from old car wheels and rusty metal , which the boys in his employ use to haul out junk .
Around here that 's like having a fleet of Mercedes .
' Business is good , ' he says , allowing himself a grin .
According to some reports , it 's possible to extract more gold from a ton of electronic circuitry than from 17 tons of gold ore .
Like other dealers , Sharp Dollar has an old - fashioned red scale next to a rusty container .
He pays the boys two Ghanaian cedis - just under £ 1 - for 1lb of copper .
For Schoolboy that could be several days ' work and countless monitors to crack open .
Later , Sharp Dollar sells each pound of copper for 25 cedis , around £ 11 .
A shadowy group of buyers from all over the world descends upon the site to exploit this ultra-cheap labour .
All the boys know the person known as the Chinaman who comes round demanding sackloads of circuit boards .
Later in the day I meet Suresh , from Delhi , India .
Despite his expensive trainers and stylish T - shirt , he looks like an 18th - century slavemaster as he stands on top of an old freezer , directing the ragged boys with curt commands .
They are covered in soot and sweat , loading his truck with the scrap .
It 's slavery by any other name .
But Suresh is n't concerned about human rights .
' We have to watch them , ' he says , irritably .
' Other boys come and steal the things we 're trying to load onto the lorry . '
He says the scrap metal is bound for Dubai , where he can get a high price for it , although he wo n't admit how much .
' We come here ten times a week , ' he says , with a wolfish chuckle .
' Recycling is good business !'
You will probably use your computer for about three or four years - more if you really do n't mind using an outdated machine .
After that it 's likely it'll join the 6.6 million tons of e-waste that Õs unaccounted for every year in the EU alone .
' This information can be used for all sorts of terrible things : extortion , blackmail , breaking into bank accounts '
Governments around the world became so concerned about the dumping of hazardous waste from First World countries in developing ones that in 1989 they agreed an international treaty , the Basel Convention , which was supposed to combat this .
There are now 170 countries involved in the treaty ; Great Britain is a signatory , and so is Ghana .
The only three countries that have signed it and not ratified it are Afghanistan , Haiti and the United States , the biggest dumper of toxic e-waste in the world .
Despite this effort , though , the illegal trade continues to thrive , as unscrupulous traders exploit loopholes in the law , which is rarely enforced anyway .
They do so under the guise of exporting working computers to Africa .
Jim Puckett is disgusted .
' The discovery of toxic computer monitors from the NHS dumped in Ghana is exactly the sort of horrific irony that typifies the flood of toxic electronic junk we now see flowing down the global gutters to places like Ghana , ' he says .
' Well - meaning consumers Ð you , me and our doctors even Ð can no longer simply hand over our toxic junk and look the other way or we 'll be unwitting accomplices in what really amounts to a global crime .
' Often this ugly toxic trade is justified by pretty words like ' recycling ' , ' helping the poor ' or ' bridging the digital divide ' , but make no mistake - it is dumping on our neighbours , it is illegal , it causes death and disease , and it must be stopped . '
At the heart of the problem is a global scam .
' Middlemen go round to schools or banks and offer to take away their old computers for a £ 5 recycling fee , ' explains Puckett .
They are told the PCs will be disposed of environmentally , or , if they are still usable , given to charities in the developing world .
' The middlemen then sell container loads to traders in countries such as Ghana , filling them 25 per cent with stuff that works , and 75 per cent with stuff that 's broken , which would be illegal to dump in the US or the UK . '
Stoking a fire of computer parts
In Ghana , the broken junk can be dumped for free .
The middlemen get away with the scam by pretending all the computers are usable .
By shipping them to Ghana they save a small fortune , as it would cost a considerable amount to scrap them in countries such as the UK , where they would have to be disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner .
Ghanaians accept the situation because they get some working computers .
' For everybody it 's a win -win , but the environment bears the cost , ' says Puckett .
No one knows how much turns up in developing countries , as the trade is illegal and the true figures are hidden .
However , in Africa , Ghana 's near neighbour Nigeria is also home to a thriving illegal dumping trade .
Professor Oladele Osibanjo , director of the Basel Convention Regional Co-ordinating Centre in Nigeria , estimates that half a million computers arrive there every month .
' When you are poor you accept anything , ' he says .
And every time technology takes another leap forward - making working electronics obsolete - it 's people in the developing world who bear the cost .
' In the West they are switching to digital TV from analogue .
That means tons of old TVs will probably head straight to Nigeria in the coming months . '
For years , Osibanjo has been campaigning to stop the trade , but despite telling companies of the death they were exporting to Africa , it was only when he told them sensitive data from hard drives was falling into the wrong hands that they began to attempt to restrict their practices .
' In Nigeria we found sensitive documents from the World Bank and we found stuff from child - protection services in the US , where children had been taken away from families , ' he says .
' IBM did n't really care about the waste issue , but once we told them about data from their hard drives that can be used for all sorts of terrible things - from extortion to hacking into bank accounts - they did something at last . '
Benjamin thinks for a minute , and then his face cracks into a grin .
' Ah , you want unformatted hard drives , eh ? 'he says , pulling a mobile phone out of the back pocket of his jeans .
' You want MasterCard , Visa numbers ?
Bank account details and addresses ?
No problem . '
One of scores of second - hand computer shops on Darkuman Road , the western outskirts of Accra , Ghana
Benjamin is one of a number of faceless middlemen in Ghana who buy and sell computers .
He knows that many are looking for computers with unwiped hard drives that contain sensitive information that can be used to extort money , steal someone 's identity or even rummage in someone 's bank account .
He offers us unformatted hard drives for £ 20 each .
' No guarantees , though , ' he says .
We have made our way to the port of Tema , near Accra , where thousands of containers are unloaded every day .
A corrupt port official let us in to see for ourselves the container after container of electronics .
Outside the port 's security perimeter , makeshift stalls have been set up on every street , selling battered Pentium II and III computers for around £ 75 each .
On a rough patch of reddish dirt , under flapping awnings , men are plugging PCs into car batteries and installing pirated versions of Windows software .
Seated behind a bank of computers under a whipping plastic sheet , wearing a vibrant patterned blouse and dripping with gold jewellery , is Michelle ( she refused to give her full name ) .
She has a thick north London accent .
She used to work at King George Hospital in Ilford , north east London , taking blood samples and performing other administrative duties , before realising she could make a killing in the burgeoning computer - export business .
' I have a container full of computers at the docks that I have to pay duty on , ' she says .
' But more are arriving every day . '
A cursory look at her computers reveals where they 're from : Wakefield and Pontefract Community Health NHS Trust , South West Yorkshire Mental Health NHS Trust , Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust .
In fact , directly from hospitals all over the UK .
They would be prime targets for fraudsters .
' Yeah , ' says Michelle .
' I have n't touched the hard drives . '
One computer is password - protected .
' No problem , ' says one of her co-workers , who whips off the cover and prises a battery out with a screwdriver .
' Not password - protected any more .
Ha !'
Returning to Agbogbloshie , we decide to follow the blackened run-off from the dump to its ultimate destination .
A lagoon near the dump has been turned an inky black .
Its contents flow into a rusty pipe a foot in diameter that leads out to sea .
A thundering cascade of tar - coloured toxic water , millions of gallons , flows into the Gulf of Guinea and the South Atlantic , turning the sea black .
A forlorn band of people from the suburb of Korle Gonno , a fishing community , are scratching around in the rubbish trying to find fish to eat .
Fifty yards away the pipeline pumps its deadly cocktail into the ocean .
Olu Kweik , 27 , is a fisherman like his father and his grandfather before him .
These days his nets are full of garbage , old TV monitors , circuit boards and other junk .
' The nets are twice as heavy these days , ' he says .
' Not with fish - that is about half of what it was - but with rubbish .
We can't work or make money .
We are starving . '
He is with 20 other people , who begin to argue in the background about how to divide up the fish they 've picked out of the rubbish over the past two hours , which now sits in a large steel bowl .
Away from all this suffering and misery , and not far from where the new £ 15 million presidential palace is being constructed , are the government buildings .
Ghana 's Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is a magisterial edifice housing a warren of offices .
' Fifty yards away the pipeline pumps its deadly cocktail into the ocean '
We ask to speak to someone about the dire situation we 've witnessed , but the security guard on reception says that the media spokesperson is away at World Environmental Day in Wellington , New Zealand , and is unable to talk .
However , when we go back outside , we find him , laughing and joking with some colleagues in a leafy glade not far from his office .
Caught , he reluctantly agrees to speak .
For half an hour , EPA press spokesperson Anthony Abadidoo , a long - limbed , wry man in an open - necked plaid shirt , sits at his desk dodging , ducking and feebly trying to joke his way out of my questions .
He refuses to let me record our conversation .
' This is not a crisis , ' he says .
Then he uses the standard phrases of bureaucrats the world over .
' We are putting in a process ; I have to talk to the guy who is working on this , but he has been away on vacation .
We need to do a baseline study to show us guidelines on how we should deal with this waste . '
It 's not exactly convincing .
' I will not put a deadline on when we are going to sort this out , ' he declares .
' I will not stick my neck out .
If I do , people will say I am not straightforward and that I am a liar . '
After all this , he concludes , ' Progress has to come through a long and crooked process . '
Then he stands up awkwardly and grasps my hand .
' And , thank you for the grilling , ' he says politely .
Luke Upchurch , of UK - based Consumers International , which represents more than 220 consumer groups in 115 countries , is more concerned .
' It 's a disgrace that the Basel Convention is not being policed , ' he says to me later .
' The legislation is there Ð it just needs to be enforced . '
In the meantime he is fighting to get electronics giants to take responsibility for their products .
' Companies such as Sony and LG need to have a proper policy in place to dispose of computers , cellphones and old TVs , in the same way that car batteries or ink cartridges are processed . '
Two miles from the dump is a rare patch of beach that is unpatrolled by the security guards who protect tourists and businessmen at the ritzy hotels from the slum children .
It 's known locally as Boola beach ; Boola meaning rubbish .
The currents are too dangerous for swimming , but on Sunday it 's thick with children from the slums who feel it 's worth risking the dangerous currents just to be able , for once , to wash off the toxins from the dump and swim in the sea .
We find Schoolboy and his friends , all in ragged shorts , lying in the sand .
It 's the first time I ''e ever seen them smile .
Covered in salt and sand , they start to speak about their dreams ; how they want to be soldiers , policemen , racing drivers .
Schoolboy says
he wants to be an airline pilot .
He tells me he sees planes flying over the dump , going far away .
' I would like that job , ' he says .
But mostly he would just like to go home .
' I 'm saving up to get out of here , ' he continues .
' It 's all been a mistake - it 's horrible . '
He needs about £ 10 for the bus journey back up north .
But that could take weeks of breaking monitors and melting circuit boards .
Even then he is n't hopeful he 'll be able to make such a grand sum of money .
When I leave Ghana , I fly over the dump site and see the ground turned black and the smouldering fires sending poisonous smoke up into the sky .
After just a few days there my heart races at night , my skin itches and I can't sleep , and there 's a heaviness to my breathing .
A small taste of what the boys forced into these conditions have to endure .
I imagine Schoolboy down below looking up at the plane , thinking about his own escape .
But all I can see from the air is that the deathly black slick running into the sea from the dump site now reaches Boola beach .
The one place Schoolboy can escape to is also being poisoned - the toxins are in everything he comes into contact with .
There is no escape .
CONFIDENTIAL PATIENT INFORMATION - ON SALE IN GHANA ...
Live found a stack of NHS computers for sale on the street in Ghana .
They were being sold for £ 75 each .
The machines were clearly marked with stamps from various NHS Trusts , including Gateshead Primary Care Trust , Northumbria Healthcare Trust and NHS Shared Services .
We bought five of these PCs and sent the hard drives to a leading cyber security and computer analysis laboratory , Net Mon Gmbh , based in Zurich , Switzerland .
Most of the hard drives were empty , but one contained medical records relating
to patients based in Leeds .
It came from a computer marked Northumbria Healthcare Trust , although the data found did not relate to its patients but to customers of a pharmacy that had used the computer after the trust had disposed of it .
There were two key databases on this computer .
One held 9,042 names
and addresses of patients .
The other database held 4,330 records of the medicines issued to these patients by a Leeds - based pharmacy between July 30 , 2002 and August 23 , 2007 .
The information is so highly personal we have chosen to reproduce only prescription details here and have disguised the patients ' names .
If you cross-reference the databases you can also identify patients ' names , dates of birth , home addresses and doctors .
Some of the medicines issued are used to treat serious diseases such as alcoholism , depression , anxiety and schizophrenia .
Some data had been deleted from the hard drive and was recovered using special software , but a lot of the information was present at start - up .
Joyce Robins , a co-director of Patient Concern , said it was most alarming that such data was found on a computer that ended up in Ghana .
' When I get rid of a computer the first thing I do is take out the hard drive and smash it , but clearly this has n't happened .
It does n't fill me with much hope for the future over the security of our health information . '
Northumbria NHS
Trust explained that it destroys all the hard drives of its old computers and then has a contract with National Computer Recycling ( NCR ) to dispose of the rest .
Yvonne Storey , a spokeswoman for Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust , said : ' The PC you found in Ghana was one that we sent to the NCR .
The hard drive would have been removed by ourselves as a matter of course .
The worst thing from our point of view is that our stickers were still on the computer .
We would have expected NCR to have removed them so that the computer was an entirely blank case .
But this has not happened in this instance .
NCR has denied that this computer went to Africa , but it confirmed that it had received it from our Trust .
' Concerning Africa , we would not have a problem with this computer being there as long as it was being used properly . '
NCR was also responsible for the PCs from the other trusts we found in Ghana .
Darren Fraser , sales director for NCR , said their refurbished PCs were supplied with clean hard drives , and that he does n't know how some ended up in Africa .
' Our company is not involved in exporting IT equipment , ' he said .
' We do , however ,
sell working computers to brokers and individuals in the UK .
It 's possible we would have sold these computers to someone and they might have sold them on to Ghana .
If somebody exports these refurbished computers abroad we do n't know what happens to them and we do n't need to know what happens . '

Palin-McCain
Sarah Palin promises a " Palin and McCain administration " on the stump in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , where she was talking about small businesses .
And the reportage from the scene does suggest that the crowds are , still , coming for the bottom of the ticket .
O. Kay Henderson reports that the rally began with chants of " We want Sarah . "
" I look up , about five minutes into McCain 's address and see a steady stream of people walking out of the rally .
They just came to see Palin apparently , " she writes .
Researchers at the University of Rochester 's Eastman School of Music and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences have developed a unique test for perfect pitch , and have found surprising results .
Their research shows that perfect pitch — the ability to recognize and remember a tone without a reference — is apparently much more common in non-musicians than scientists had expected .
Previous tests have overlooked these people because without extensive musical training it's very difficult for someone to identify a pitch by name , the method traditionally used for identifying those with perfect pitch .
The new test can be used on non-musicians , and is based on a technique to discern how infants recognize words in a language they 're learning .
The findings will be presented at the International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition in Sapporo , Japan on Aug. 25 .
" Tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music , which really limits the pool of candidates you can test , " says Elizabeth Marvin , professor of music theory at the world - renowned Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester .
" That means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general . "
The findings are part of a larger investigation into perfect pitch at Rochester .
While Marvin has been studying musicians with perfect pitch for many years , her research with Elissa Newport , professor of brain and cognitive sciences , began when Newport looked into research on pitch perception in animals and found that absolute pitch , the scientific name for perfect pitch , is widespread in the animal kingdom even though it 's very rare in humans .
Humans are unique in that we possess the ability to identify pitches based on their relation to other pitches , an ability called relative pitch .
Previous studies had shown that animals such as birds , for instance , can identify a series of repeated notes with ease , but when the notes are transposed up or down even a small amount , the melody becomes completely foreign to the bird .
This holds true for almost all animals , but not humans , which suggests that , ironically , common relative pitch hearing may require more brainpower than perfect pitch .
advertisement
To explore the cognitive basis for perfect pitch , Marvin and Newport wanted to test the basis for pitch perception and memory in people who had never been musically trained in order to get a better idea of exactly how common perfect pitch is in humans .
Estimates of how many people have perfect pitch have always been unreliable because non-musicians have no way to identify a note , whether they recognize it or not .
Newport has worked for decades to understand how infants come to make sense of the jumble of sounds spoken to them , and one of her former students , Jenny Saffran , had begun to use their experimental materials to study pitch perception in infants .
Marvin and Newport , working together , created a pitch - based test similar to these language - based tests .
Both musicians and non-musicians listened to groups of three notes , with the groups played in a continuous stream in random order for 20 minutes .
Just as the human mind quickly begins to identify new sound sequences ( words ) in a foreign language , the students learned to identify the groups of notes embedded in the stream .
Crucially , however , the test made it very difficult for a student to identify and remember the names of particular notes because the notes were constantly coming in the 20 - minute stream .
Marvin and Newport then tested the students .
They replayed the note groups , plus new groups the students had n't heard before , and asked the students if each group of notes was familiar or unfamiliar .
The critical feature of the test was that the team transposed some of the original note groups to a different key without the knowledge of the students .
Students who unconsciously used perfect pitch to identify notes stumbled over the transpositions .
They heard them as a new group of notes they 'd never heard before .
Students who relied on relative pitch , however , heard the transposed notes and automatically and unconsciously recognized them as familiar — the notes seemed to be of the same group heard before .
The test corresponded well with the results of conventional tests for perfect pitch in musicians , which strongly suggests the new test works .
But to the surprise of Marvin and Newport , there were a number of nonmusicians who used perfect pitch to identify groups of notes but did not know they had perfect pitch .
The team is now investigating the other cognitive abilities of this new group of listeners with perfect pitch , to determine what might distinguish them from the more numerous listeners with only relative pitch perception .
Marvin and Newport are also planning to investigate a controversial hypothesis that native speakers of tonal languages like Chinese , which utilize pitch to distinguish different words , have their perfect pitch abilities enhanced by their language 's necessary attention to pitch .

The GeoEye satellite that Google will use to provide mapping imagery at 50 - centimeter resolution successfully blasted into space today .
So do n't leave your underwear lying all over your lawn .
Andy Plesser of Beet .TV put together a cool video animation ( below ) .
Stephen Shankland of CNET has the story :
GeoEye - 1 will orbit 423 miles above Earth , but it will be able to gather imagery with details the size of 41 centimeters ...
Google , though , is permitted to use data only with a resolution of 50 cm because of the terms of GeoEye 's license with the U.S. government .
Each day , the satellite will be able to gather a high - resolution " pan-sharpened " format surface area equal to that of about New Mexico , the company said .
" The GeoEye - 1 satellite has the highest ground resolution color imagery available in the commercial marketplace and will produce high - quality imagery with a very accurate geolocation , " said Google spokeswoman Kate Hurowitz , adding that most commercial satellite imagery has a resolution of 60 cm .
" It is our goal to display high - resolution imagery for as much of the world as possible , and GeoEye - 1 will help further that goal . "

Before considering whether this week ’s outcome means the commissions are out of commission or not , was n’t there supposed to be a tradition called an Olympic Truce , whereby active hostilities were supposed to stop for the duration of the Games ?
But of course , the best time to start a war  whoever did it , about which I suspect it ’s wise to be agnostic until we know more  by surprise attack is to do it when nobody ’s expecting it .
Laws of war , indeed !
Wars are the province of the ruthless , not the congenitally law - abiding .
Ah , well !
At least it ’s a lesson , for those inclined to learn .
As to the verdict in the case of Salim Hamdan , reportedly Osama bin Laden ’s paid driver from 1997 to late 2001 , the lessons may not be so obvious .
It seems to me there are several possible explanations for Hamdan , the first Guantanamo prisoner to be tried by the military commissions finally put in place after fits , starts , and rebuffs from the judicial branch , was sentenced to 66 months for the relatively minor count on which he was convicted  while being acquitted on the more serious charge  when the prosecution had sought a whopping 30 - year sentence .
And as is usually the case with human beings , the motives may be mixed and the explanations may overlap one another .
( And I may have missed seeing the most obvious one . )
It is possible , of course , that the decision simply reflects a display of straightforward and honorable behavior on the part of the military officers involved .
Hamdan was obviously not a key terrorist mastermind , but even by being a salaried driver in it only for the money , as he claimed , he had contributed to terrorist activities .
Given that he had already served six years at Guantanamo , and the judge had announced that five of those years would be counted toward whatever sentence was handed down , keeping him locked up another six months seemed about right .
It would convey to whoever cared to get the message that the senior military officers on that jury thought Hamdan was a small fry , and maybe a waste of the military judicial system ’s time and resources .
I have posited in the past that a latent sense of honor still lurks in the psyches of some military officers , even in this time of the kind of quasi - warfare with hard - to - identify enemies that tends to make honor seem antiquated or irrelevant  and been criticized by people who suggest that by the nature of what they do they are all scoundrels .
I would suggest , however , that few human beings can be painted in such black - and - white terms .
Most of us have mixed or confused motives for what we do , especially when quick decisions are required ; soldiers are trained to obey or follow their training without thinking too much .
And it is also possible for a person who has done any number of suspect or dishonorable things to do the honorable thing on other occasions , especially if the situation includes some time for reflection .
So straight honor , it seems to me , is a possible hypothesis .
There may also have been a motive to try to save the still deeply flawed military commission system for dealing with suspected terrorists being held at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay .
It shows that in the first test of the system , the result was a verdict that seems roughly fair , not as harsh as most neocons might have desired , yet not the summary dismissal the ACLU types might consider appropriate .
If the military commission is seen as yet another flawed system in a world where all human systems have some flaws , but one able to produce fundamentally fair results , it might yet survive as the most practical way out of the ongoing embarrassment to the U.S. government represented by Guantanamo .
Measured against anything resembling an ideal institution of justice , or even against the flawed and inconsistent U.S. civilian justice system , the military commission system , created by 2006 legislation in the wake of Supreme Court decisions invalidating the previous system , comes up pretty short .
It still allows hearsay evidence and secret documents the defense in some cases may not be able to see , let alone challenge .
It seemed so rigged that Col. Morris Davis , formerly the chief prosecutor , quit last October because he " concluded that full , fair , and open trials were not possible under the current system . "
However Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , who served as judge , went beyond the formal rules to make the trial of Hamdan as fair as possible .
And the jury of six senior military officers , in a split verdict , found Hamdan guilty of supporting terrorism , but not guilty of conspiring to commit terrorism .
Given that Hamdan was a paid driver for Osama bin Laden from 1997 to 2001 , that ’s a reasonable conclusion .
One could argue , as some have , that charging a paid lackey , even one who would have had to have some inkling of what bin Laden was up to , with " war crimes " is unjustified and maybe somewhat silly .
However , it ’s difficult to deny that by driving and protecting the leader he did support terrorism .
At the same time , it seems unlikely that he conspired to commit terrorism .
That does n’t seem hard to explain .
It was the sentence the jury announced the next day that seemed most surprising and / or interesting .
As noted above , the judge had earlier agreed to count five of the six years Hamdan has spent in Guantanamo against his sentence .
He could be free to return to his wife and children in Yemen soon .
It is unclear , however , whether President Bush might continue to detain him on the basis of his designation as an " enemy combatant . "
His lawyers also say they will appeal the verdict to a federal appeals court .
So almost seven years after 9/11 , and the appropriate retaliation or recompense or punishment that Guantanamo and the military commission system were supposed to be about , there may be miles to go before we sleep .
It seems to me , however , that there ’s another plausible hypothesis for the nature of the decision .
It is just possible that the military  or at least those involved in this particular trial  were sending a signal to the civilians in the Bush administration , or at least those disappointed at the " leniency " of the sentence , that the military commission system was n’t going to give them what they wanted .
Keep sending us Guantanamo stumblebums and we ’ll keep giving them patty - cake sentences .
You can get those , and perhaps stiffer sentences , from civilian courts and juries that are more likely to be impressed by government witnesses mumbling the sacred words " national security " to explain why , even though the evidence they ’re able to present seems thin , these are really bad dudes .
I ’d just as soon they blew up the military commission system and put these cases directly into civilian courts rather than dignifying an organization , al - Qaeda , that may be on the decline anyway , as the Number One Threat to this oh - so - vulnerable republic .
The metaphor of war was never a good one for meeting the challenge posed by non-state terrorist outfits , even if success might involve the occasional military - style foray .
How others will react , I do n’t know .
At stake , of course , are future trials of detainees accused of much more serious crimes , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged 9/11 mastermind .
These will present the system with more difficult challenges , including the potentially inflammatory one of how much information acquired through " aggressive " interrogation or torture can be used in the trial .
How much discretion will military judges in future trials have or care to exercise ?
And , of course , most of those future trials will be conducted under the auspices of a new administration , and neither Obama nor McCain is likely to be a carbon copy of the Bushies on this issue .
Have I missed anything ?
Or rather , how many obvious things have I missed ?

Well folks , we ’re almost to a done deal ( certainly closer than Thursday ) .
The Hill papers are reporting that they ’re getting closer in both the Senate and the House to the needed votes to pass the new bailout bill .
Roll Call gives the most frank assessment of what happened over the weekend in an article entitled “ Same Bailout , New Dynamic ” ( subtitle : Outrage Prompts Sales Effort ) .
All the late - night talks , last - minute demands and dramatic pronouncements aside , the fundamental structure of a $ 700 billion Wall Street rescue plan that Congress spent the weekend wrangling over has not changed significantly from the outline proposed by a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members last Thursday .
“ This is in essence the same , ” said Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) , who attended those talks .
. . .
Assuming enough House Republicans agree to vote for the package , it appeared that the House could vote as early as today , while the Senate might have to wait to take it up Wednesday after Rosh Hashana on Tuesday .
“ If it does n’t pass , we should n’t be in Congress , ” a confident Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) said on Sunday , adding that he thought the measure would pass with broad bipartisan support in both chambers .
Members and staff disagreed about why the bones of the package stayed the same but took so long to hash out .
Negotiators on Saturday added a mortgage insurance program to the proposal at the request of rebellious House Republicans , though that plan is unlikely to be used by failing companies given the Treasury ’s ability to take bad debt off the books of troubled financial firms .
That means the high - stakes negotiating sessions over the weekend served mainly to generate buy - in and political cover for Republicans and Democrats .
Some Democrats said the time between Thursday and Sunday was largely wasted on back - and - forth talks that yielded few changes .
In addition , there was the distraction of presidential nominee Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) inserting himself into the mix , they said .
“ They were very close to an agreement on Thursday , ” one senior Senate Democratic aide said .
“ Then John McCain blew into town and blew things up for three days .
Now , they have virtually the same agreement now that they had before , with a couple of options in it that [ Treasury Secretary Henry ]
Paulson will never use . ”
One Senate Democratic leadership aide echoed that notion , saying , “ This is largely based on the draft we had Thursday morning . …
Once we got past the McCain shenanigans , the legislative process took over and people worked very hard to work out an acceptable agreement . ”
. . .
House Republicans proposed a mortgage insurance idea so Wall Street could fund its own bailout .
House Democrats proposed a pay - as - you - go trigger requiring a fee on financial firms if the bailout results in losses for the Treasury .
The political goal was the same — both sides wanted to be able to tell constituents that Wall Street , not average citizens , would pay for the bailout .
But neither proposal won out — the mortgage insurance idea will largely be a side option for the Treasury secretary , and Paulson reportedly already rejected the proposal in internal Treasury talks this summer .
. . .
A senior House Democratic aide at press time estimated that Democrats could wrangle about 125 votes for the plan , meaning GOPers would need to find nearly 100 supporters in their ranks if the numbers remained unchanged .
" Everything that he wished for was done right down to the last .
It was only right for us to carry out his final wishes . "

Palin also said she was disappointed that she was disinvited to a rally to protest Ahmadinejad 's attendance at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly next week .
The event was originally billed as a joint appearance with Palin and Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , who sought the Democratic presidential nomination .
Palin was disinvited after Clinton withdrew .
" Unfortunately , though some Democrat partisans put politics first and now no elected official will be able to appear at that ' Stop Iran ' rally , Iran 's pursuit of these weapons should concern all Americans ; this should not be a matter for partisan politics , " Palin said .
Not much of a silver lining to the credit crunch
14 Oct 2008 , by Nigel Stanley in Economics
I detect the start of ‘ credit crunch – it ca n’t be all bad ’ sentiments .
Some of it is entirely justifiable schadenfreude at those losing their telephone number sized bonuses , though I expect they will soon get round this .
It ’s a pity we cannot use the Freedom of Information Act to demand a transcript of the discussions in the middle of the night where Sir Fred Goodwin is reported to have demanded a big pay - off before agreeing to stand down from RBS .
In passing let me award him a “ They Just Do n’t Get It ” gong .
Of course it has brought much of the neo-liberal consensus crashing down , and discombobulated the advocates of the minimal state and deregulation .
This is a real gain .
Just as the banking crash will be discussed by economic historians for years to come , it is likely that it will also be seen as the end of a political era .
Just as Thatcher and Reagan replaced the post - war consensus in the wake of 1970s stagflation and the oil shock , their time has now come to an end .
And to be honest I am sure I am not the only person to have been caught up by the sheer excitement of being in the middle of such momentous events .
But while there is some fun to be had from neo -libs and new - Labs nationalising banks , it is also causing hardship .
It was of course right to nationalise Bradford and Bingley and arrange the shot - gun marriage of HBOS and Lloyds - TSB , but there will be job losses .
B&B headquarters are in Bingley and the H bit of HBOS in Halifax .
Even if all job losses are voluntary this will still hit their local economies .
Many staff are likely not just to suffer job insecurity , but to have saved through share schemes that are now either worth nothing ( B& B ) or have tanked ( HBOS ) .
All this is before we find out how deep the effect of the financial crisis will be on the ‘ real ’ economy – a phrase , incidentally , with which I ’m increasingly unhappy , as it seems to me Bingley is a real place and people who work for B &B real people .
There is clearly going to be a recession and unemployment is going to rise , even if no - one really knows how deep and how high they will respectively go .
Yet I have heard and read people who think this will not be all bad .
‘ People will start to be judged by what they do , rather than what they own ’ and ‘ there will be an end to shallow celebrity culture ’ are just two sentiments .
Both are unlikely in my view .
They are based on an assumption that the misery will be shared out .
It wo n’t .
Those who are unlucky enough to lose their jobs will find that benefits are very low – the result of the anti-scrounger consensus .
People look more to escapism when times are tough , not less .
At least in the 1930s they had Busby Berkeley while we have Britney Spears .
Adam has already blogged about Conservative calls to end employment protection and Nicola has added their threats to the minimum wage .
These are calls to increase inequality , not solidarity .
And during the most recent recessions was precisely when the right managed to persuade people in the middle that they had more in common with the well - off than with the poor .
They also showed that while the vast majority of the unemployed are decent law - abiding people , crime does go up when unemployment rises .
It may be that we get out of the coming recession in a way that does make for a fairer society and a stronger , more sustainable economy but it ’s going to be an extremely rough and unpleasant ride .
While in Aspen last week for a fundraiser at the Aspen Institute , Republican Presidential hopeful John McCain met for breakfast with Texas billionaire oil man turned wind energy advocate T. Boone Pickens .
The pair chatted for a few minutes in front of cameras , and then they met privately for more than an hour .
The issue of alternative fuels came up for McCain Thursday as well , during a forum at the Aspen Institute .
In the past , McCain has said that he opposes tax breaks for wind and solar development because they interfere with the market .
Asked about that Thursday , McCain said he has a long record of support for alternative fuels .
Asked specifically if he was for renewing tax breaks for wind and solar that expire this year , he surprisingly said , “ of course . ”
I say surprisingly because in the eight times the Senate has voted on extending the renewable energy production tax credits and the renewable energy investment tax credits in the past year , Senator McCain has been absent each time .
As far as I can tell , that is an 0 - for - 8 record .
Not exactly the type of record that could in any way justify Sen.
McCain saying that “ of course ” he supports renewable energy tax credits .
In a statement , Pickens said :
“ It was a pleasure to sit down with Senator McCain and discuss firsthand an issue that is America ’s top priority : ending our dependence on foreign oil , which today is approaching 70 percent …
During the meeting I reiterated the urgency of the situation .
I told him that any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our foreign dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 % in the next 10 years ( on top of conservation that is beginning to happen ) , must utilize proven and available technologies and be 100 percent comprised of American resources …
While I can not speak for the Senator , my sense is that he was interested and encouraged by the work we are doing and recognizes that citizen education and citizen involvement is key to changing course and actually developing a real energy policy with teeth that will help this country from our current disastrous path . ”
While I appreciate the sentiment of Mr. Pickens and certainly applaud his push , I hope he is correct in his assessment of the Senator .
Because extending those tax credits may once again come down to a single vote in the Senate , and there is a very real chance that Senator McCain would once again have an opportunity to vote on those credits .
And who knows , maybe he ’d even show up to vote .

Perverse US Dollar Rally Prelude to Financial System Collapse
More crucial than ever , observers must take the broader perspective that avoids overhearing the party on Wall Street .
They know not what they celebrate .
It is their demise .
They rejoice over the collapse of mortgage bonds and now the mortgage centrifuge with a big fat fanny .
They rejoice over collapse of Lehman Brothers .
They rejoice over the disaster du jour offered at the financial lunch table .
In the past two months , a remarkable sequence of events has taken place regarding US $ - based bonds .
They have been called home , a demand to be brought back to US shores .
While Wall Street and the key financial USGovt ministries celebrate the rise in the USDollar that results immediately , few seem to realize that something much more important is happening .
Imagine a company calling to the corporate laboratory all defective devices , in order to prevent them from exploding in customer faces .
The lab sends the collection of destructive items into a remote abandoned field so they can explode safely .
That is the analogy , except that the US financial arena cannot explode the USTreasury Bonds and USAgency mortgage bonds safely .
As they crater , implode , or default , the system is killed .
In all likelihood the Bank For International Settlements in Basel Switzerland ordered the United States to call in USTreasurys and USAgencys , the bond instruments , the financial weapons of mass destruction .
The BIS ordered the financial leadership to call their damaged risky debt securities home , so that they can explode on US soil , so that their greatest concentration rests on US soil , so that the maximum loss occurs to US institutions , so that the risk can be kept to a practical minimum for foreign nations .
The benefits given to Americans are two - fold , one a bizarre paradox , the other an open door to steal .
THE BIZARRE USDOLLAR RALLY
When the USTreasury Bonds were purchased with powerful bids in a gigantic display by major global central banks ( excluding Russia , China , Arabs ) , the USDollar broke through resistance levels easily .
The volume was just too significant .
The initial big move from 73 to 77 in the US $ DX index was powered by the unprecedented central bank purchase of USTBonds in July and August , as they tripled their usual volume pace .
This is a vividly clear illicit market override .
The latest big move from 77 to over 80 has been powered by the formal bailout of Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac .
To call nationalization of this cratered corrupt colossus a positive for the USDollar is like calling the death of all your children a positive since it consolidates the family fortune .
Take a close look at details of the bailout .
Hidden from view is a giant severance package for Fannie Mae's CEO Daniel Mudd and Freddie Mac's CEO Richard Syron .
They are to receive $ 14 million and $ 9.2 million respectively .
They managed the corruption and slush funds well , supplying amply the USGovt friends and syndicate alike .
Mission accomplished !
In truly perverse fashion , only in America , the USDollar is rallying as a prelude to a US financial system breakdown .
Call it a blowoff top !
The Wall Street carnival seems to celebrate anything to lift the USDollar , even recession and the death knell for USTreasurys .
Nationalization is never a positive for financial prospects .
A powerful reversal comes when intervention ammunition wanes and the reality of US bank system implosion returns .
The rally could reach the 82 mark , if the reversal pattern reaches full completion .
The three major factors pulling the US $ down are the bank losses , the housing decline , and the job loss situation .
Nothing has changed with these factors , except they have worsened !
My position is unshakable .
The financial structure of the Untied States is besieged by powerful bankrupt insolvencies .
1 ) USGovt federal deficits are exploding , from war , from handouts , from recession , from bailouts .
2 ) US trade deficits are chronic and have risen over $ 60 billion monthly , soon to worsen from the US $ rise rendering harm to exports .
3 ) US banks are insolvent , with congames the only force forestalling bankruptcy as they continue to distort their balance sheets , while showing inability to raise needed cash in their replenishment .
4 ) US homeowners are now increasingly living with loans that reflect negative equity , as the proportion sits around one third in such upside - down living rooms .
In the next few months , all four wrecked pillars will worsen dramatically .
Fundamentals drive the USDollar lower .
An assault on the USTreasurys will put the US$ into No Man 's Land .
The most dangerous reaction investors can make now is to believe the USDollar has begun a major new upleg .
The second most dangerous reaction is to sell gold or silver into this climax of fraud , manipulation , bankruptcy , and protected larceny .
The sun is soon to set on the Fascist Business Model network .
Those who put leverage into their portfolios have forfeited their freedom to hold .
The father of a friend down here in half sunny , half rainy Costa Rica just lost his $ 250 k silver account .
He had told me of his father 's strong belief in silver and the wrecked US $ condition , but he was not even aware that his father had a silver futures account , not physical silver bullion or coins .
He owned paper silver , bound by the illusion of wealth .
Now Dad has no silver at all , as he liquidated after a few margin calls .
A piece of the inheritance is gone .
My Dad has significant bank deposits , which might be under a different strain as banks drop like flies this winter .
My advised strategy since the beginning of the year has been to hold silver or gold in physical form , for at least one third of accounts , maybe more .
The uplift coming this autumn and winter will be historic , as new chapters will be written on the global financial rehabilitation and remake .
The world is planning the post - US era , amused by the celebration taking place on Wall Street .
It will wind down soon enough .
The next chapter will be characterized by isolation , retribution , receivership , dismissed government , overriding supply contracts , and redrawn lines .
LICENSE TO STEAL
A time limit has been granted , with high likelihood via order given by the most powerful bank in the world .
The US has been ordered to bring its bonds home , to be buried under an avalanche of nationalized debt , foreign vengeance , and bank system collapse .
During that period of time , Wall Street has been given a free ride , a blank check , a certificate of impunity , to rig markets for their own gain , to pull credit from client accounts for their own gain , to do whatever they can to force liquidation of positions , to basically rape & pillage private accounts .
The fraud has been protected by regulators at the Securities & Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , each staffed by Wall Street mafiosi .
They are taking full benefit of the granted OPEN WINDOW TO STEAL , pulling gold below 750 and pulling silver below 11 .
The total split , the bifurcation described last week , has become even more laughable , stark , and obvious of Wall Street corruption of the precious metals market .
The gold & silver owned ( on paper ) by folks has been taken .
Since through corruption of the precious metals market , where supply is largely unavailable , call it theft , robbery , larceny .
Call a spade a spade !
Wall Street loves an investor panic .
Do not give it to them .
What infuriates me is the impunity .
Wall Street firms have a license to corrupt markets and take money from people and businesses , as they are forced into liquidation or shrunk positions , often with credit pulled tactically .
The regulators are sitting on their hands , permitting it all during this climax events of a fiesta .
Banksters at the BIS are taken care of banksters inside the Untied States .
A climax of theft is nearing an end .
THE DOOR SHUTS VERY SOON
On the week of September 15 thru 19 , some initial events are anticipated to occur .
An important event schedule will be initiated .
The party and celebration and corrupt raids should come to an end abruptly .
Many possible events are offered in conjecture in the September Hat Trick Letter , due out late this weekend .
In all , 13 powerful shock wave events are suggested as possible .
Foreigners are watching the tainted party , viewing it as staged atop the heavily listing Titanic vessel .
The four pillars of insolvency , plus the looming credit derivative roof crumple , seem not to matter .
The entire global playing field , related to commerce and finance , is soon to be reshaped , with the Untied States becoming a bit player , or not invited .
The turkey carving is nigh .
When the events begin to unfold , one event will lead to another .
Just like the Iraq War , a schedule does not adhere to a calendar , but rather to events .
One event leads to released new pressures , factors to be made clear , obstacles to be removed ( possibly forcibly ) , and the next event unfolds .
My view of the sequence very simple is to reveal the big picture , RECEIVERSHIP & DEFAULT .
The gold & silver prices will rocket higher .
Part of the event schedule , down the road in time , not at an early stage , is the launch of the gold - backed Russian currency and the gold - backed Gulf dinar .
These are not new news items , but well advertised and fully ignored by a dismissive US failing financial fortress .
The gold & silver prices have become laughable .
Very little supply was available in the low 800s for gold .
Very little supply was available at 13 for silver .
Now prices are lower .
One should try to imagine the building rage by angry foreign owners of physical gold & silver , who look at the price schemes dominated by paperhangers on Wall Street , who use the printing press and electronic switchboards to create new counterfeit supply to sell .
Foreigners seek justice , to stem the corruption , to stem the threat to global stability , both financially and militarily .
Do Americans have much of any idea of the foreign perspective ?
Do they know about violated NATO treaties , and poking the Russian bear with sharp sticks repeatedly ?
Americans are soon to be given a fresh course in receivership .
The opening salvo was Fannie Mae and the fat little brother Freddie Mac .
Never in modern history has a widened pattern of nationalization been favorable to a currency !
Note that the Credit Default Swap on the USTreasury Bond itself has moved up 3.5 basis points in the last week to a record 18 basis points .
In April it was 6 bpts .
This is record territory .
German Bund CDSwap protection costs only 8 bpts .
The USTBonds have suffered from greater risk after assuming the Fannie & Freddie risk .
The risk of USTBond default is next .
Watch the CDSwap continue to rise , as the rest of the bailout candidates knock at the door .
The precedent has been set .
The door is open .
The die has been cast toward deep decay of socialism .
Add to insolvency exported fraud and aggressive military behavior , and the prescription for foreign reaction is huge .
It is coming !
US BANKS READY FOR NEXT SHOCK
The end of the third quarter is coming , less than three weeks away .
In Q2 the investment community was told that first quarter bank losses were the peak .
Early in Q3 , the investment community was told that again , bank losses had peaked , the worst behind us , the solutions have been forged .
What a continuing crock !
As we come toward the end of Q3 , losses previewed by JPMorgan and Lehman Brothers will serve as opening salvos .
Much worse news comes .
Over a month ago , my chart analysis suggested the BKX bank stock pattern might soon reveal a pennant pause pattern as the quarterly end approached .
We are here .
The triangle pennant is forming , although it is a clear one .
While all eyes are on Lehman , the big failure is likely to be Merrill Lynch .
Both firms have failed to find idiots in SKorea to bail them out .
The discovery phase was way too ugly , and they were too smart .
Next the banksters from New York will turn to severe accounting distortions , sleight of hand , and other devious deceptions .
The Lehman quarterly report was the biggest disaster imaginable , even though it was loaded with garbage methodology laced with hokus pokus .
The last resort is liquidation , the dread by Wall Street banksters , since one failure could easily result in another rapidly .
A liquidation fire sale of Lehman assets lies directly ahead , a huge threat to the congame .
The Wall Street firms , since the Bear Stearns kill job , are all aligned in similar fashion , long US $ , long USTBonds , short gold , short silver .
A liquidation would force a big move in the reverse direction .
The latest economic myths are two : the USDollar is stronger and price inflation is gone .
Neither is true .
The foreign currencies have moved down , as their economies have slowed , as their own bank distress is evident .
The US $ is a giant beneficiary of global debt liquidation , hardly a strength .
The US $ rally is actually a signal of its imminent implosion or disappearance .
As for price inflation , it is raging at 12.5 % from the 2Q2008 according to Shadow Govt Statistics .
The official heavily distorted CPI has posted back to back months above 5 % .
Suppressing the gold price via paper games does not constitute a repeal of price inflation .
The biggest story on the price inflation front is the nationalization bailout of Fannie & Freddie mortgage giants .
Even with no additional bailout beneficiaries ( losers ) such as General Motors or airline firms or even Citigroup , the price inflation inside the USEconomy will be magnificent next year .
Some analysts expect the doctored CPI to rise above the 10 % level .
Higher prices could come from storm effects .
Hurricane Gustav inflicted some damage , but nothing significant .
Hurricane
Ike heads toward the heart of the oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico , due to hit this weekend .
Storm surge waves of over 15 feet ( five meters ) are forecast between Galveston and Houston Texas .
Next year , look for a parade of lawsuits to be delivered as further tidal wave assaults on Wall Street .
The Auction Rate Security case , successfully won , was just the beginning .
In one year , look for most Wall Street firms to disappear .
They have no business left , only managing liquidation , directing accounting fraud , and soliciting sucker bagholders to donate to their corrupt cause .
This picture aint New York City , but it do n't look good .

World of Warcraft has announced a new " Recruit - a - Friend " initiative , designed to rope in those few people who still talk to their spouses and significant others after 8 p.m. instead of beating pretend demons with sparkly weapons .
The deal is this :
If a current player can convince someone to sign on for a two - month tour of fantasy duty , they get a free zhevra mount .
I should explain a couple of those words for the sweet innocents who have managed to avoid the tawdry , painted World of Warcraft .
Alt Text Podcast
Download audio files and subscribe to the Alt Text podcast .
First : zhevra .
A zhevra is a zebra with a horn .
Like a unicorn , but a zebra .
That 's kind of a theme with Warcraft :
Take a normal animal , paste on an extra body part or two , and give it a fantasy name .
A zebra with a horn is a zhevra , a crocodile with six legs is a crocolisk , a two - headed buzzard is a bonestripper .
There 's some fantasy precedent for this , but I 'm going to be disappointed if the upcoming Warcraft expansion has me fighting three - eyed yaks ( yakaboos ) and nine - armed octopi ( nonopi , or possibly octoplarghs ) .
As for the mount part , characters in Warcraft can learn to ride an animal , but not until level 30 .
Starting characters might be able to conjure fireballs or summon a demon , but put them in front of a horse and it's like integral calculus to a sleepy stoat .
" Horse , huh .
How does this work ?
You ... I go on top of it ?
Like above it ?
And it moves ?
I 'm not ... screw it , I 'll walk . "
Once characters reach level 30 , though , they 're not limited to horses .
Depending on your character 's race and reputation , you might end up riding a wolf , a ram , a dorky - looking bird , a dorky - looking mechanical bird , an elephant ( sorry , elekk ) or something even stranger .
Get enough Warcraft characters together on their mounts and it's like I Ran the Circus without the Three - Snarper - Harp .
So , to sum up :
If you get one of your friends to shell out for two months of Warcraft , your character will get to ride a completely cosmetic zebra with a horn instead of whatever it 's riding now .
It 's a sign of Warcraft 's unrelenting brain - grip that this is incredibly compelling .
World of Warcraft 's developers have mastered the unholy art of in - game bribery .
They have discovered that players will do any number of stupid , tedious things in order to earn perks that have no effect on the game .
Just this week I 've been fighting in battlegrounds – special areas where armies clash and 12 - year - olds question each other 's sexuality – over and over just for a chance to win a tiny little flying dragon .
This dragon does n't fight on my behalf or give me powers or anything .
He just follows me around .
In real life I try to avoid being tailed by parasitic flying creatures , but in the game I seek it out , even though I hate battlegrounds .
And really , what does my little dragon tell the other people in the game ?
The same thing it tells you – I spent too much time playing Warcraft .
This is n't so bad , mostly because the other players spend too much time playing Warcraft as well .
The zhevra mount , however , tells people : " Not only do I spend too much time playing Warcraft , I hassle those with enough wisdom to avoid it . "
It 's sort of like helping out a drug baron , except at least drug mules generally get some cash out of the deal .
This is as if someone said : " Hey , if you board a plane with this condom full of cocaine stashed someplace unmentionable , I 'll give you a stylish cravat . "
I can only hope that this will serve as a cautionary tale to those who , unlike me , have managed to resist the massively multiplayer siren song that Warcraft continues to sing .
But if it does n't , and you decide to sign up for the game anyway , let me know .
Those zhevra mounts are pretty boss .

Born helpless , nude and unable to provide for himself , Lore Sjöberg eventually overcame these handicaps to be thankful that at least they did n't call it a zebracorn .

A Sober Warning About Indiana Jones ' Fedora
Comcast has become the latest ISP to shut down access to Usenet newsgroups as part of a voluntary agreement to try and fight child porn online .
Users of the ISP giant found themselves unable to access Comcast 's newsgroups over the weekend , and the company has posted a notice on its web site saying that its newsgroup service has been discontinued .
Comcast , along with 17 other cable providers across the US , first announced that it would no longer offer Usenet access to subscribers in July of this year .
The voluntary measures were part of an agreement among the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( NCTA ) , the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) , and the National Association of Attorneys General ( NAAG ) in order to take part in an " industry - wide attack on child pornography . "
The cable providers that made the pact cover 87 percent of US homes , so this is no small agreement — everyone from Comcast to Time Warner to Cox has signed on .
Additionally , Verizon announced that it was going to block access to the entire alt . * hierarchy in June , and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger asked members of the California Internet Service Provider Association to consider blocking newsgroups that contain child porn as well .
Comcast 's message to Usenet users
Usage of Usenet has declined significantly in recent years — it was much more popular in the early days of the Internet in the 80s and 90s — and has largely been replaced by message boards and mailing lists .
Amid the warez and other binaries groups rife with copyrighted content is still a lot of perfectly legitimate , innocent , and relevant dialog occurring across the newsgroups , however , with only a few problem areas causing headaches .
As we have suggested in the past , this form of overzealous approach could turn into a trend that enables governments to regulate content that is arbitrarily deemed harmful to the public good or even commercial interests .
In fact , Comcast 's Help & Support section makes it clear that its move to block newsgroups is more about offloading responsibility than actually trying to fight child porn .
In response to a question over whether Comcast offers newsgroups service , the company advises interested subscribers to choose from one of several third - party newsgroup providers .
Of course , you 'll have to pay extra for that and Comcast 's monthly fees wo n't be going down in order to compensate for the loss of a service that 's not being replaced ( a Comcast spokesperson told Ars that it was considered a " complimentary service " that has seen a decline in popularity ) , but you can still get access to newsgroups if you really want them for a few more dollars a month and a little bit of extra effort — two things we do n't see stopping child pornographers anytime soon .

Fighting Escalates Between Russia and Georgia Bush says Russia 's actions are ' unacceptable in the 21st century . '
TBILISI , Georgia , Aug. 11 , 2008  -- President Bush held a press conference Monday denouncing Russia 's escalation of violence in the former Soviet republic of Georgia .
In a Rose Garden statement , he pressed Moscow to accept an immediate cease - fire and to pull back its troops from the conflict zone .
" Russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people .
Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century , " Bush said .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili signed a cease - fire pledge Monday , and at Georgia 's request , the U.N. Security Council in New York called an emergency session -- the fifth meeting on the fighting in as many days .
Russian armored vehicles charged into Georgian territory on two fronts today , seizing a military base and four cities , despite diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting and Georgia 's president signing a cease - fire agreement .
The Russian offensive had troops poised just inside the rebel province of South Ossetia at the border of central Georgia , but in a surprise maneuver , Russia sent armored units across the border into western Georgia .
A top Russian general told ABC News that the army had no intention of invading Georgian territory .
The invading tanks spilled out of Abkhazia , a second province that has broken away from Georgia , to seize a Georgian military base and a couple of towns near the Black Sea .
Georgian officials and the Echo Moskvy radio station later reported that Russian troops had also surged across the South Ossetian border and taken the town of Gori in central Georgia , a move that could split Georgia in half .
An ABC News team left Gori just hours before the Russians arrived and reported the town was nearly empty except for Georgian soldiers , who were streaming out of town on armored personnel carriers and pickup trucks , yelling that the Russians were coming .
Saakashvili visited the town briefly with the French foreign minister before he was bundled into a car and driven away amid rumors of an imminent attack .
The few civilians who remained ran from the streets in panic .
The two - pronged offensive came , despite calls by the European Union to halt the fighting and despite rising tensions between Russia and the United States .
The military showdown has triggered a war of words between Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Bush , who was attending the Beijing Olympics , told NBC Sports that the Soviet offensive was unacceptable .
" I 've expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia , and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of South Ossetia , " Bush said .
" I was very firm with Vladimir Putin . "
Bush said he made the same point later in a phone call to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev .
Vice President Dick Cheney was more blunt , telling Georgia 's president that " Russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States . "
Asked to explain Cheney 's phrase " must not go unanswered , " White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said , " It means it must not stand . "
White House officials refused to indicate what recourse the United States might have if the attacks continue .
Putin fired back at the U.S. today , indicating he was particularly upset at the American military for flying 2,000 Georgian troops from Iraq , where they were helping out their U.S. allies , back to Georgia .
" It is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but , essentially , are hindering us , " Putin said .
" I mean ... the transfer by the United States of a Georgian contingent in Iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone . "
Putin 's emotional speech said the U.S. was wrong to blame Russia for the outbreak of war .
" The very scale of this cynicism is astonishing -- the attempt to turn white into black , black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims , " he said .
The U.S. appears to have little leverage over Russia , however , in part because the Bush administration needs Russian cooperation in its negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program .
After Saakashvili signed a cease - fire agreement , he later held a news conference to accuse Russia of trying to overthrow his government .
" Russia made clear the goal of this operation is the regime change in Georgia , change of democratically elected government , " he claimed .
" It is quite clear what is happening .
We are in the process of an invasion , occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country . "
He called the Russian offensive a " pre-planned , cold blooded , meditated murder of a small country . "
Saakashvili compared Russia 's push to its invasion in 1968 of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan in the 1990s .
" As we speak , there are people being shot , killed , " he said .
He later added , " What else can happen for the world to wake up and see what 's at stake ? "
Russia and Georgia accused each other today of carrying out campaigns of ethnic cleansing of the breakaway provinces .
Despite facing an overwhelming military force , Saakashvili , when asked what he would do if Russian forces moved toward Tblisi , said , " We have no plan of surrender . "
EU officials hope to convince Russia to also sign the cease - fire deal .
The foreign ministers from the G - 7 , representing the world 's seven largest economic powers , called on Russia to accept the cease - fire with Georgia , following a conference of all the ministers , including U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Besides backing its Georgian allies , the U.S. is closely watching the conflict because of Georgia 's status as a major conduit of oil to Black Sea ports .
Any disruption to Georgia 's main pipeline could send world oil prices soaring again , and , in turn , kick up the price of gas at U.S. pumps .
So far , the pipeline has been untouched .
The outbreak of fighting has reportedly claimed the lives of 2,000 civilians caught in the crossfire , and thousands more are homeless , with many fleeing the area .
The capital of South Ossetia has been devastated by shelling .
Russia has deployed ships off the Georgian coast and claims to have sunk a Georgia missile ship , while swarms of Russian planes bombed sites near the Georgian capital of Tbilisi for the fourth straight day .
Russia claimed that Georgian artillery again shelled the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali , and claimed that two more of its planes have been shot down , bringing the total of lost Russian planes to four .
Russia insists that it was withdrawing from some of its positions in Georgia , but people remain fearful and expect more attacks .
The shooting began when Georgian troops moved last week to reassert control of its breakaway province , South Ossetia .
Georgian troops briefly occupied the South Ossetian capital before a powerful Russian force chased them back into Georgia .

Why Do n’t Hotels Use Roombas ?
My colleague Jeremy Greenwood has convinced me that advances in household technology have yielded tremendous benefits .
And I ’ll admit it : I love my vacuum - cleaning robot ( the Roomba ) .
Labor intensive vacuuming is , at least for me , a thing of the past .
But I just realized something rather odd : I have never seen a Roomba used to clean a hotel room .
Why ?
The puzzle only deepens when you realize that hotels are avid users of other labor - saving devices , including dishwashers , washing machines , and dryers .
Here are seven theories :
1. Quality : Hotel staff do a better job vacuuming than the robot can .
But any frequent hotel guest will object that current methods just are n’t that thorough .
2 . Demand : Hotels rarely vacuum the rooms .
( See # 1 . ) 3 . Social status :
Hotel guests do n’t want clean carpets , but rather they want people whose job is to clean up after them .
4 . Information asymmetry :
If clean carpets are tough to verify , then customers may rationally demand visible evidence that the carpets are being cleaned .
Seeing someone pushing around a big old vacuum - cleaner provides this information .
( And we are less resistant to technical change in the hotel kitchen or laundry , because those activities necessarily occur behind closed doors . )
5 . Unionization : Unions have sometimes resisted labor - saving devices .
Indeed , this is why I ’m not allowed to use a Roomba to spruce up my U. Penn office .
But it is hard to believe that hotel unions are as powerful as Penn ’s unions .
Beyond this :
Surely management can negotiate an efficient outcome , perhaps by sharing Roomba - generated cost savings with their workers .
6 . Capital - skill complementarity : This argument suggests that operating a Roomba is beyond the abilities of hotel cleaning staff .
But honestly , if even a Ph.D. economist can operate one , they are n’t that complicated .
7 . Capital scarcity : The Roomba — while labor - saving — is slow .
The scarce resource is not labor , but unoccupied hotel rooms , and anything that slows down room turnover is too costly .
I do n’t find any of these too compelling , but the most promising candidate is No. 7 , combined with the fact that implementing Roomba - based vacuuming will change the workflow of hotel cleaning staff .
Numbers 2 and 3 may also be part of the story .
But there must be a more compelling answer .
What is it ?

In a statement , John McCain has suspended his presidential campaign in order to come back to Washington and work on the federal bailout bill .
McCain called for a postponement of Friday ’s debate and called on Obama to do the same .
This is another attempt by the McCain campaign to portray McCain as a leader , and play politics with the issue .
McCain said , Tomorrow morning , I will suspend my campaign and return to Washington after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative .
I have spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of my decision and have asked him to join me .
I am calling on the President to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress , including Senator Obama and myself .
It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem . ”
He tried to position himself as a bipartisan leader , “ We must meet as Americans , not as Democrats or Republicans , and we must meet until this crisis is resolved .
I am directing my campaign to work with the Obama campaign and the commission on presidential debates to delay Friday night ’s debate until we have taken action to address this crisis . ”
McCain also invoked 9/11 , “ Following September 11th , our national leaders came together at a time of crisis .
We must show that kind of patriotism now .
Americans across our country lament the fact that partisan divisions in Washington have prevented us from addressing our national challenges .
Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again capable of leading this country . ”
This is a huge political gamble by McCain .
He is trying to get on top of the issue by putting Obama in a box .
If Obama agrees to postpone the debate , McCain looks like a leader .
If Obama insists that the debate goes forward , then McCain can paint Obama as putting politics over country .
This is an interesting flip for McCain considering that earlier in the week he was sending signals that he was not going to show up and vote for the bill .
I think this is a shallow attempt to play politics with a critical issue .
If McCain wants the bill passed , there is no need for such drama .
All McCain has to do is send the signal to the Republicans on the Hill that they need to support the bill .
My hunch is that Obama will agree to suspend the debate , which I think is strategically and politically the best move .
The debate could probably be moved to Monday with no problem .
McCain is trying to play politics here , but I think the Obama camp is too sharp to fall into their trap .
McCain ’s Full Remarks
By Dominic Holden , NORML Board Member
Originally published by the Seattle Stranger ’s Slog .
Last week White House appointee John Walters claimed on C - SPAN that finding people in jail for “ first - time nonviolent possession of marijuana … is like finding a unicorn … because it does n’t exist . ”
I had a hunch that some of the 775,138 people arrested for pot possession last year were actually unicorns …
But the drug czar probably assumed that it ’s a freebie to call people with criminal convictions anything he wants , because they ’re likely to be too ashamed to defend themselves .
That ’s certainly true , but it did n’t take me long to find credible people willing to vouch for the existence of first - time , non-violent marijuana offenders — excuse me , unicorns .
In just one hour , I ’ve found five people who have seen the Drug Czar ’s unicorns with their own eyes .
Here are Slog ’s exclusive unicorn reports :
Andy Robertson , criminal defense attorney for 10 years at the Rosen Law Firm in Seattle .
I have had it happen where [ my client ] goes to jail where they have one joint on them , and they have never gone to jail before .
This is their first and only brush with the law .
I do n’t think that I have ever had a case where the person charged for marijuana is anything but the most peaceful person you can imagine .
A judge who I spoke to recently said that about every afternoon , he ’ll put at least one person a day in jail for possession of marijuana or paraphernalia .
He ’s bee pro tem-ing for at least five years .
Sunil Abraham , public defender for the King County Defender Association .
When asked how many people he has personally encountered with no prior record who have served time in jail for a nonviolent marijuana - possession charge , here ’s what he said : I ’d say 50 people and they have all done time in jail .
I ’d guess that if you obtained the booking history for the last 100 marijuana arrests for somebody who has no criminal history , 80 percent of them do time in jail .
It may be one day , but they serve time in jail .
[ Police ] do n’t commonly arrest for marijuana and release ; you are going to go to jail .
Alison Holcomb , drug policy director of the ACLU of Washington .
According to data compiled by the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs and requested by the ACLU of Washington , Washington police agencies reported 11,553 arrests for possession of marijuana in 2007 .
Misdemeanor possession of marijuana carries a mandatory day in jail , and up to ninety .
Data obtained from the Washington State Patrol ’s Identification and Criminal History Section reveals that 3,588 convictions for misdemeanor marijuana possession were entered in Washington courts in 2007 .
Muraco Kyashana - tocha , works in the law offices of Jeffrey Steinborn and Douglas Hiatt , the city ’s leading marijuana - defense attorneys .
I know of two cases that were handled … in the last year .
They were both over in Redmond .
I know both of them by name .
One gram [ possessed ] by one of them , and 12 grams by the other one .
They were squeaky clean : no record no juvenile record .
I know a lot of people who went to jail while their case was processing .
They may be in jail over the weekend for three days .
A lot of the people charged with misdemeanor [ possession ] cannot afford $ 3000 - 5000 for legal representation , so they are doing time .
Jeffrey Steinborn , the city ’s leading marijuana defense attorney .
Walters is either shamefully ignorant , or intentionally lying to us .
Sometimes we get lucky because a big shot in white shirt shows up .
Sometimes the prosecutor will say the statute is mandatory , so they say , “ Fuck you , your client ’s going to jail . ”
Sometimes the judge will convert that to community service but the law says they can’t .
To avoid that day in jail is the exception rather than the rule .
Surely , more of these magical animals walk among us .

We were having a discussion , the other day , on the jQuery - dev mailing list concerning style and jQuery code .
There was some discussion about how it could be improved .
One of the points discussed was concerning the use of callbacks and jQuery ( this ) .
Callbacks ( passing in a function as the final argument to a jQuery method , to be called later ) are used all throughout jQuery code .
It ’s a rather core aspect of jQuery ( especially the use of closures to pass around information ) .
We began to wonder :
What would jQuery look like if there were no callbacks ?
A couple solutions were proposed but I posited one that , I think , promotes the idioms present in jQuery .
Its use is simple ( although its implementation is definitely a mind - twister ) .
Instead of using a callback you now using jQuery chaining to execute all the methods that you need .
Where previously you would ’ve done :
j Query ( " div " ) . hide ( " slow " , function ( ) { j Query ( this ) .addClass ( " done " ) . find ( " span " ) .addClass ( " done " ) .end ( ) . show ( " slow " , function ( ) { j Query ( this ).removeClass ( " done " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
You would now write :
j Query ( " div " ) .chain ( " hide " , " slow " ) .addClass ( " done " ) . find ( " span " ) .addClass ( " done " ) .end ( ) . chain ( " show " , " slow " ) .removeClass ( " done " ) .end ( ) .end ( ) ;
The end result is quite interesting .
It definitely moves jQuery farther into the land of a “ Domain Specific Language . ”
I wanted to put this code out there for people to try out and play with even though I have a number of reservations :
I ’m really not a fan of passing in a method name as a string argument , to another method .
This is used a lot in Prototype.js but it just never sat right with me .
The .chain ( ) method name probably is n’t right .
Some other name probably fits better here .
The fact that you lose out on the power of normal JavaScript is daunting ( you can no longer do something like : j Query ( this ) .
html ( j Query ( this ) .
attr( “ href ” ) ) – you ’d have to go back to using a callback ) .
Nevertheless
I think the result holds a lot of potential even if just as a proof - of - concept .
Those who say the World Trade Center site is changing at a glacial pace have no idea how right they are .
A fantastic landscape in Lower Manhattan  plummeting holes , steep cliffsides and soft billows of steel - gray bedrock , punctuated by thousands of beach - smooth cobblestones in a muted rainbow of reds and purples and greens  has basked in sunlight this summer for the first time in millennia .
This monumental carving was the work of glaciers , which made their last retreat from these parts about 20,000 years ago , leaving profound gouges in the earth and rocks from the Palisades , the Ramapo Mountains and an area of northern New Jersey known as the Newark Basin .
Plumbing these glacial features and souvenirs has been critical in preparing the foundation for Tower 4 of the new World Trade Center , being built by Silverstein Properties .
The concrete footings from which its columns rise must rest on firm bedrock .
Engineers need a clear understanding of the rock ’s contours .
NASA 's been tracking the thinning of the ozone layer the south pole for nearly 20 years .
In this slowed - down animation , you can watch the ozone hole 's average size each October .
Police officers in Sao Paolo , Brazil , pulled over a car during a routine document check and found that the driver owed $ 1.9 million in outstanding violations .
According to the BBC , Armando Clemente da Silva , 36 , had accumulated more than 1,000 speeding tickets and other traffic violations since 2001 , the year he bought the car .
Mr. da Silva said he had not received any penalty tickets because he had been too busy to register his car , the BBC reported .
So what was this monster machine Mr. da Silva used to rack up such a fine ?
A Lamborghini Gallardo ?
A Porsche Turbo ?
Probably not .
Although Brazilian authorities have not identified the vehicle , they said it ’s not worth more than $ 6,500 .
It has been impounded and will be returned to Mr. da Silva once all the fines have been paid off .
Today ’s Claim Chowder
Let ’s flag the most egregiously wrong rumor reports from the last few weeks .
Duncan Riley : $ 800 MacBooks
Jackass of the week honors go to Duncan Riley at Inquisitr , who a week ago launched the “ $ 800 laptop from Apple ” rumor .
Worse than merely printing a bogus rumor , today he ’s pointing to the new 24 - inch LED Cinema Display as proof that he was somehow right .
Today :
Finally , Jobs and his team announced a new 24 - inch LED - backlit Cinema Display . [ … ]
It ’ll be available in November for $ 899 — presumably making it the rumored $ 800 - range product first reported here last week .
Oh really ?
Here ’s what he reported there last week :
Some Apple retailers in the United States have been given price lists for a new Apple laptop line , and there ’s a big surprise : an $ 800 laptop .
The information comes from a source we would categorize as reliable , would have access to such information , and who has been accurate in the past .
Nothing about a new “ $ 800 range product ” .
What Riley reported a week ago was an “ $ 800 laptop ” .
And then in an update to the week - ago report , Riley rates the tip as follows :
We now rank this tip as close , but in the end not 100 % accurate .
That ’s not close .
That ’s totally and utterly wrong .
Riley is the one and only source for this $ 800 laptop rumor , it was n’t even close to true , and it is dominating post - event news coverage and quite possibly a significant factor in Apple ’s stock price dropping 5 points on the day .
Bonus jackass points to Sanford Bernstein financial analyst Toni Sacconaghi , who took Riley ’s unsourced rumor and published a detailed spreadsheet full of fantasy numbers proving that an $ 800 Apple laptop would fill the sky with rainbows from coast to coast .
Kevin Rose : Blu-ray
Over the weekend Kevin Rose told a live audience in London that the new MacBooks would support Blu-ray .
They do not .
And when asked about Blu-ray support in the Q&A session after the event , Steve Jobs said , “ Blu-ray is a bag of hurt .
The licensing of the technology is so complex that we ’re just waiting until things settle down and waiting until Blu-ray really takes off in the marketplace before we burden our customers with the cost of the licensing and the drives . ”
9to5 Mac : Black Plastic MacBooks
Last week , Cleve Nettles at 9to5 Mac wrote :
Boingboing ( and others ) did some analysis on the aluminum laptop in the Apple event invitation and concluded it was a regular MacBook .
It was n’t .
MacBooks will have black ( perhaps other colors — we have only heard black ) plastic outer shells .
The same type of plastic that is on the backside of an iMac .
The inside shell , around the keyboard and the screen will be aluminum and that one piece structure will be the skeleton of the laptop .
Given that the entire chassis is aluminum , but that the screen is surrounded by a black frame , Nettles could n’t have been more backwards if he ’d tried .
Mac Soda : iLife and iWork ’09
Mike Contaxis , three days ago at Mac Soda :
Mac Soda has heard that iLife ‘ 09 [ sic ] and iWork ‘ 09 [ sic ] are going to be announced this Tuesday at the MacBook event .
Similar to last year , when Steve introduced the iMac , and then branched off into the iLife and iWork updates , Steve is expected to do the same thing this year , announcing the iLife / iWork update with the introduction of the new laptops .
I called this one out as bullshit before the event even took place .
In addition to being factually wrong , the apostrophes preceding the “ 09 ”s are backwards .
COMMENTARY :
The Catholic bloc is the key swing vote in this year ’s election that will decide the next president of the United States - and shape our destiny in this watershed moment in history .
Catholics must support Sen. John McCain .
Both campaigns are courting Catholics vigorously .
Catholics constitute America ’s largest single religious denomination .
The church has 47 million adherents - nearly one - quarter of all registered voters .
In pivotal battleground states , such as Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan and Missouri , they form almost a third of the electorate .
Moreover , 41 percent of Catholics are independents .
Polls reveal many Catholics remain undecided .
They are also evenly divided : Catholic conservatives back Mr. McCain ; Catholic progressives champion Sen. Barack Obama .
“ Social justice ” Catholics believe Mr. Obama is their man :
In their view , he advocates the “ broader teachings ” of the church .
He puts national health care , a cleaner environment , ending the Iraq war and devoting more resources to the poor above the “ single ” issue of abortion .
However , this reasoning violates church doctrine .
Pope Benedict XVI has made it crystal - clear that abortion is the seminal moral challenge of our time .
It is not simply a “ single ” issue like guns , taxes or immigration .
It is equivalent to the Jewish question of the 1930s : Will we allow an entire category of people - the unborn - to be murdered because they are viewed as less than human ?
Pope Benedict rightly argues that legalized abortion asserts “ the law of the jungle over the rule of law ” ; the triumph of power , death and destruction over the weakest members of our society .
Abortion abrogates the most fundamental of all rights :
The right to exist in God ’s image and according to His divine plan .
This is why the church has explicitly - and repeatedly - stated that abortion is mass murder .
Catholics have a primary moral obligation to outlaw it .
Abortion is state - sanctioned infanticide ; abortion trumps all other concerns .
Mr. Obama is a staunch proponent of abortion rights - even at taxpayer expense .
He did not support the ban on partial - birth abortion .
Mr. Obama is so radical he opposed a bill that would provide legal protection and medical assistance to babies who survived botched abortions .
Mr. McCain , on the other hand , has a solid anti-abortion voting record .
He also vows to appoint conservative justices to the high court .
The current 5 - 4 liberal majority is teetering .
There will be one or two Supreme Court vacancies in the next president ’s term .
A McCain administration can finally achieve what the pro-life movement has sought for decades : the repeal of Roe v. Wade .
Mr. McCain is also a better advocate for the traditional family .
Like Mr. Obama , he opposes same - sex marriage .
Yet the Republican maverick promises to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act , which enables states that do not want gay marriage to maintain their laws .
Mr. Obama wants to repeal the legislation :
He is pro-gay rights in everything but name .
Even on the so - called Catholic “ social justice ” issues , Mr. McCain is stronger .
The Republican offers a health care plan that will significantly expand coverage to the uninsured , lower costs and create greater choice .
Mr. Obama promises the outdated liberal model of government - run health care .
The result will be more bureaucracy , a massive and expensive new entitlement program , and rationed care .
Catholic Democrats like to portray Mr. Obama ’s foreign policy as consistent with the church ’s teachings .
They are wrong .
Mr. Obama is not antiwar .
He favors adding more troops and resources into Afghanistan - a policy directly at odds with the Vatican .
He has also called for unilateral U.S. air strikes in Pakistan .
He is not a pacifist , but a liberal interventionist .
Many Catholics - including Pope Benedict - believe the Iraq war was a mistake .
The war , however , is nearly won .
The troops will be coming home .
We must now decide :
When and on what terms ?
Mr. Obama wants a military withdrawal by 2010 ; Mr. McCain a little later - perhaps by 2012 .
More importantly , Mr. Obama seeks to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory .
He will withdraw American power without ensuring a stable , democratic Iraq .
Catholics must therefore ponder : Should the immense sacrifice of American blood and treasure be in vain ?
Or should it be for the grander cause of freedom and American national interests ?
Progressives in the church are deluded if they believe Mr. Obama embodies Catholic social thought .
They confuse watered - down socialism for Catholicism .
The church stands for civilized decency and the natural moral order - as is seen through its implacable defense of individual dignity , human rights and the traditional family .
Mr. Obama ’s policies will only lead to more misery and impoverishment .
There is nothing “ just ” about them - social or otherwise .
As a devout Catholic , I too have some misgivings about the Republican nominee .
But there is no doubt that in this election one candidate better upholds many of the cardinal teachings of the Catholic Church : John McCain .

The Reverend Richard Hart will be sentenced later this month A vicar is behind bars after he admitted possessing more than 55,000 indecent pictures of children .
The Reverend Richard Hart , 59 , from Horsell , Woking , is the vicar of Beguildy , near Knighton in Powys .
He admitted 12 charges of making indecent images of children , four of taking indecent images and five of possessing images on his computer .
He was remanded in custody at Cardiff Crown Court and is awaiting sentencing .
He is suspended from church duties .
The court heard he had 44 images showing child sex abuse in the most serious Category 5 - with 52,240 in the least serious category , 2,419 in Category 2 , a further 684 in Category 3 and 1,445 in Category 4 .
The offences dated between 1991 and 2007 .
He has also been suspended from his position as chairman of governors at Beguildy Church in Wales school , where his wife Julie , 40 , worked part - time .
We have offered pastoral care and support to those affected and obviously the Church in Wales gives the highest priority to the care and protection to children and vulnerable members of the community
Canon Robert Jones Defence barrister John Ryan said : " Hart is on bail but wishes to begin his time behind bars today . "
He asked for a pre-sentence report to be carried out before he is given his prison term on 25 September .
Judge John Curran remanded him in custody to await sentence at Cardiff Crown Court .
Hart has been a vicar in Powys for more than 20 years .
After the case , Canon Robert Jones , the child protection officer for the Swansea and Brecon diocese of the Church in Wales , said : " We are deeply saddened and shocked that one of its clerics should plead guilty to such very serious offences involved indecent images of children .
" It is of particular concern that these offences should have occurred at a time when he held a very responsible and privileged position in one of our church communities . "
' Highest priority '
In addition to the court case , the matter is also being referred to a Church in Wales disciplinary panel , who will decide if Hart can remain a priest .
Canon Jones said : " At this moment in time , our thoughts and prayers are with the children who may have been directly or indirectly affected and the wider community in which they live .
" As a church we have co-operated with the authorities throughout this inquiry and we are very grateful to the police for their very thorough investigation .
" We have offered pastoral care and support to those affected and obviously the Church in Wales gives the highest priority to the care and protection to children and vulnerable members of the community .
" We regularly review our child protection policy which came into force 10 years ago to try to eliminate the possibility of people behaving in this way .
" No matter how stringent authorities try to make their child protection policies , these things can still happen .
We are making every effort to ensure the safety of children in our communities . "

What are these ?
By Brendan O'Neill
Whenever the debate about sex offenders rears its ugly head , we are reminded of this incident and its cruel irony : how protesters targeted a paediatrician ( a doctor who cares for children ) because his or her job title sounded vaguely like paedophile ( a sexual deviant attracted to children ) .
Last month , when education secretary Ruth Kelly was under pressure to reveal how many individuals on the Sex Offenders Register work in our schools , various newspapers revisited the paediatrician / paedophile story .
A columnist for the Independent criticised the tabloid attacks on Kelly , warning that we might once again end up with a " howling mob " consumed by a " paediatrician - bashing hysteria " .
The Glasgow Herald lamented the current " hysteria over alleged sex offenders " , and reminded us of the " illiterate lynch mob " that attacked the home of a paediatrician the last time there was such hysteria .
Who what where
The paediatrician incident is mentioned endlessly , but rarely examined in detail .
Commentators refer to it all of the time but do n't explain where and when it took place , and what exactly happened .
It was part of a wave of incidents sparked by Sarah Payne 's murder
In fact , it was a relatively minor incident , which has been exaggerated and distorted in the re-telling - and turned into a symbol of mass hysteria among the tabloid - reading sections of the population .
If you search the web or back issues of newspapers to discover the truth of the paediatrician - bashing incident , expect to be confused .
Some reports say a male paediatrician was attacked , others that it was a female paediatrician .
There are clashing reports of where the incident took place .
Some say it was in south Wales , others that it was in Portsmouth .
In an article in 2001 , the Daily Mail asked : " Who can forget the targeting of an innocent children 's doctor in Portsmouth by a populace too ignorant and enraged to recognise the difference between paedophile and paediatrician ? "
An online magazine , The Register , also says that it was in Portsmouth that " dictionary - starved and enraged mobs attacked a paediatrician " .
Yet on a discussion board of a website that focuses on strange events , one contributor says the incident took place in London .
Lynch mob
There are conflicting reports as to what happened .
A 2001 Guardian article says a female paediatrician was " hounded " from her home by her own " neighbours , who confused ' paediatrician ' with ' paedophile ' . "
Message on a balcony
According to some accounts she was asleep in the house while the mob vandalised it ; according to others she only discovered the vandalism upon returning from work .
Some say it was far more serious than just offensive graffiti .
In 2003 , a Northern Irish newspaper recalled the time that " Portsmouth became famous when paedophile - hunting locals chased a paediatrician down the street " ( there 's that mention of Portsmouth again ) .
This account suggests the paediatrician may have been in real physical danger .
A student newspaper at the University of Essex described how " a group of people in Portsmouth ... burned down a paediatrician 's office in righteous anger . "
On one online discussion board it said that " a howling mob stoned [ the paediatrician 's ] house and firebombed it " .
In the mainstream media , meanwhile , there are clashing reports over whether the paediatrician was attacked , hounded , chased or abused , but they all agree that it was an " hysterical mob " that did it .
Police talk
Just what is the truth ?
In August 2000 , a female paediatrician consultant called Yvette Cloete was indeed labelled a " paedo " after a campaign by the News of the World to name and shame paedophiles in the community .
The incident took place in Newport , Gwent , not in Portsmouth ( where there had been anti-paedophile protests after eight - year - old Sarah Payne was murdered ) or London .
It looks as though it was just a question of confusing the job title for something else - I suppose I 'm really a victim of ignorance
Yvette Cloete , speaking in 2000
It was no doubt a very distressing incident for Ms Cloete , who decided to move home shortly afterwards .
But there is no evidence that a mob was involved or of any threats or incidents of physical pressure or violence .
" Why let the truth get in the way of a good story ? " says Chief Inspector Andrew Adams , of Gwent Police , who was the liaison officer in charge when news of this incident broke six years ago .
He remembers very well that stressful night , when he gave 18 live interviews to various media outlets .
" There was no big mob , " he says .
" Nothing like that happened .
I know because I was there and I was involved .
The lady was not in her home when it happened .
She came home from work to see her door daubed with anti-paedophile graffiti .
" When we heard about it we set about dispelling the rumours that she or anyone else in that house was a paedophile .
We explained to the local community the difference between paediatrician and paedophile . "
Who did the graffiti ?
Mr Adams says he still is n't sure .
" We think it was youngsters , probably someone in the 12 to 17 age bracket . "
And the community was outraged by the incident and " supportive of the woman involved " , he says .
Nevertheless , the story has taken on a life of its own , transformed into a dire warning about hysterical mobs who threaten the fabric of our nation .
The irony is that some in the media , in challenging the scaremongering over sex offenders , indulge in some scaremongering of their own .
They raise fears about violent tabloid - reading protesters who will attack , hound and destroy a paediatrician - which seem to be just as unfounded as the fears about thousands of paedophiles stalking the land .
In his much - ballyhooed acceptance speech , Barack Obama declared that he would “ finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 ” .
If Obama wishes to be true to his promise , he could begin with his own running mate , Senator Joe Biden .
Biden and the ISI chief
Biden was one of several top Washington officials who met with Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad , the head of Pakistan ’s Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) on and around September 11 , 2001 .
The ISI is a foreign branch of the CIA .
“ Al - Qaeda ” is a covert operation that is managed by Anglo - American military - intelligence .
Ahmad , the “ 9/11 money man ” who delivered funds to alleged lead suicide hijacker Mohammed Atta prior to the attacks , met personally with Biden on September 13 , 2001 .
This case , detailed in Michel Chossodovsky ’s Political Deception : Missing Link Behind 9/11 , remains one of hundreds of smoking guns revealing direct US connections to 9/11 , for which Biden has never provided a credible explanation .
At the same time that he was meeting with a man directly connected to the alleged hijackers , Biden was among the loudest and most bellicose voices joining Bush - Cheney for the bombing of Afghanistan , in retaliation for 9/11 .
Biden expressed an interest in “ personally shooting Osama bin Laden ” .
Not surprisingly , John McCain expressed the same post - 9/11 bloodlust , in his infamous editorial , “ War is hell .
Let ’s get on with it . ”
Biden ’s tune has remained unchanged , to this day .
He wants to “ finish the fight against al - Qaeda and the Taliban ” , and ( in language that appears to be the new neoliberal “ talking point ” ) “ take out the ones who actually attacked us on 9/11 ” .
The fact that Biden and McCain , two major shills for the “ war on terrorism ” lie , are vying for White House power speaks for itself .
When recently confronted by an independent journalist about his meeting with Mahmoud Ahmad , Biden offered a series of non-sequitors , and then had his security guards escort the inquiring individual away .
Biden the insider
Dirty politics and back - door deals are nothing new for Biden , the perfect neoliberal establishment insider who has made a career of opportunism , obstruction , and political cover-up .
Biden , the senator of Delaware , the largest tax haven for corporations in the US , has played a key role in virtually every major US policy decision over the past two decades .
Every military conflict .
Supreme Court confirmations .
Cabinet confirmations .
Judiciary appointments .
Congressional probes ( cover-ups ) of major political scandals .
Biden , a longtime Council on Foreign Relations stalwart , is a leading architect of “ Homeland Security ” .
He considers his “ national security credentials ” to be “ unimpeachable ” .
Joe Biden and his longtime Senate colleague and war criminal / Keating Five “ friend ” McCain are as responsible for the current world crisis as anyone else alive .
Obama ’s bombastic deception
If Barack Obama genuinely wishes to “ take out ” those who “ actually attacked us ” on 9/11 , he would “ take out ” the legions of elite sponsors who have made his own rise to power possible .
He could begin with his own foreign policy guru , super - elite Zbigniew Brzezinski , the virtual creator of Islamic terrorism during the Carter administration , who suggested that a Pearl Harbor - like attack , a “ massive and widely perceived external threat ” would be useful ; the man whose vision of “ American primacy ” and destablization across the Eurasian “ Grand Chessboard ” has been a lifelong obsession .
Obama might also “ take out ” the Clintons , and other neoliberal bigwigs supporting his campaign , given the fact that they were instrumental in sowing the seeds of 9/11 throughout the 1990s .
Obama should “ take out ” members of Bush - Cheney , and members of Reagan and George H.W. Bush presidencies , and a worldwide legion of covert operatives , policy advisors , think tank figures ( Project for a New American Century , etc. ) , and oil executives who “ lit the match ” .
He might also tell the truth about the global war for oil .
Obama , of course , will do nothing of the sort .
( And Bush - Cheney will not be prosecuted , no matter what he and Biden say on the campaign trail to the contrary . )
Obama will do nothing .
He will leave intact the abomination of the Patriot Act , permit illegal surveilliance , torture and renditions .
He will endorse the cover -up of the 9/11 Commission , and deepen the militarization of the US homeland .
The winner of the 2008 election : the Big Lie
In the book The Iran - Contra Connection : Secret Teams and Covert Operations in the Reagan Era by Jonathan Marshall , Peter Dale Scott , and Jane Hunter , the authors describe how the combination of government recalcitrance and public acquiescence hampered attempts to limit presidential power and CIA abuses in the 1970s and 1980s .
One telling passage quotes Joe Biden :
“ And when legislators tried to write a new CIA charter to limit presidential powers and check abuses , [ President Jimmy ]
Carter ’s people fought every inch of the way .
Exhausted liberals caved in .
To complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union , that the proposed charter was too permissive , Senator Joseph Biden ( D - Del ) said , “ Let me tell you something , fellas .
The folks do n’t care .
The average American could care less right now about any of this .
You keep talking about public concern .
There ai n’t none . ”
Today , Bush - Cheney and the respective presidential campaigns hold the people of the world in even greater contempt .
The election is already over .
The bipartisan consensus responsible for the “ war on terrorism ” lie has never been more ironclad .
The next presidential administration will be a continuation of the Bush - Cheney nightmare — in substance , if not in style .
The only thing left to be decided ( besides the exact choreography of the final electronic vote fraud ) is which lie about “ change ” , which brand of poison to pour down the throats of the American populace .
Will it be the classic neoliberal establishment deception of Obama - Biden ?
Or the more overt insult and slap in the face , and the most cynical appeal to the lowest of lowest common denominators : the insane and deeply corrupt John McCain , and the deeply corrupt insane , willfully stupid ( George W. Bush - like ) , vitriol - spewing psychopath Sarah Palin ( whose chief qualification appears to be her direct criminal ties to Alaskan energy interests ) ?
The “ Big Lie ” comes with both .
THE TAX INCREASE MCCAIN DOESN ’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ….
Time ’s Joe Klein , in an effort to move away from “ the sewage that Steve Schmidt is shoveling , ” turns to an aspect of the healthcare debate that has n’t generated nearly enough attention .
John McCain wants to tax your employer - provided health care benefits .
He wants to replace those benefits with an insufficient tax credit — $ 2500 for individuals and $ 5000 for families ( the average cost per family for health insurance is $ 12000 ) .
There is a positive , progressive tax aspect to this : wealthier people should have to pay for health insurance themselves , without tax breaks from the federal government .
But make no mistake : this plan will do little or nothing for those who do not have insurance now — unless they are young and healthy — and it may well hurt a fair number of workers , especially unionized workers , who get gold - plated benefits from their employers .
It will certainly do nothing for families with members who have pre-existing conditions or children with special needs — because it makes no provision to regulate the insurers , forcing them to cover all comers at “ community ” rates that do n’t discriminate against the people who need health insurance most .
It is amazing to me that Obama campaign has let things go this far without pointing out that McCain — who opposes the energy bill because it would increase taxes on oil companies — is actually proposing a tax increase on health care benefits for American workers .
But that is precisely what the Senator from Arizona is doing .

You may not immediately recognize the name Weta Digital .
But you almost certainly know its work .
Weta is the New Zealand special effects shop that created the computer artistry for the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy and the 2005 version of " King Kong . "
The company was co-founded by Peter Jackson , the Academy Award - winning director of the LOTR series .
That kind of digital imagery requires a lot of computing power .
Weta recently announced the completion of a new " extreme density " data center featuring HP 's new 2 - in - 1 server blades , which combines two server in a single energy - efficient blade .
Weta is running four computing clusters , each equipped with 156 of HP 's Proliant BL2x220 c server blades , which hold spots 219 through 222 on the current Top 500 list of the world 's fastest supercomputers .
" The increased density of the blades allows us to add a significantly higher number of processors into a confined physical footprint while still managing within tight power consumption and cooling requirements , " Adam Shand , the acting CTO of Weta Digital , told VFX World .
That kind of density creates a cooling challenge .
" One of our most important decisions was to invest in water - cooled racks from Rittal , which allows us to precisely control the amount of cooling that a specific rack requires , " said Shand .
" The tangible benefit is that we can manage our energy costs at a very granular level .
Instead of the traditional and less responsive method of eliminating hot spots around cooling , these racks self - regulate the amount of cooling they require in real time , adjusting the waterflow and fan speeds as required . "
Shand says the New Zealand climate allows Weta Digital to use free cooling for a large portion of the year .
HP has posted a video on its web site in which Richard Taylor of Weta Digital discusses how the company uses HP 's blade servers in its work .

My Nano is ancient .
It does n’t even show video .
Every time my husband has asked me if I wanted to get a new one , I ’ve stoicly told him , “ no . ”
It plays music just fine .
There ’s no need to buy something new .
Plus , I do n’t want to instill in my children the idea that perfectly useful things need to be replaced just because something newer and shinier with more bells and whistles is available .
Yesterday , when the news started flying around about Steve Jobs introducing iTunes 8 and the new 4th generation Nano at Apple ’s September event , I kind of glossed over it .
My husband mentioned a few things about it last night , though , and I got curious .
Looks like Apple is further making good on the promises they made in 2007 to green their products and their processes .
What ’s greener about this new Nano than my ancient one ?
It has arsenic - free glass
It does n’t contain any PVC , mercury or brominated flame retardants
A metal casing that is very recyclable
Apple has been working on greening its act for the past couple of years .
In addition to making their products greener , they have been changing their packaging and shipping to more sustainable methods and say they are always looking to improve .
They also take back their products at the end of their life for free for recycling .
So what do you think ?
Are these measures admirable ?
I think they are .
But just because they are admirable does n’t mean I have to run out and buy a new Nano .
I ’m tempted , but I still think the greenest iPod is the one I already have – the old girl has nothing to worry about for now .

The organic & natural beauty market is increasingly saturated with new brands and products , and growing confusion about what ’s ok for you and what ’s not .
Now seems like a good a time to provide a basic outline of what you need to know .
In the posts to follow I ’ll cover these in more depth but here ’s a good starting point :
Natural : Widely defined as any substance harvested or derived from nature and then isolated , processed or purified by a variety of environmentally sound techniques including filtration , fermentation , distillation , expressing and other like processes .
Organic : Organic goes beyond and includes natural .
Simply stated , this refers to ingredients that are grown without the use of pesticides , synthetic fertilizers , sewage sludge , genetically modified organisms or ionizing radiation .
Most high - level organic brands have pending or achieved third - party certification .
Biodynamic :
Often thought of as the ultimate in the organic and natural world .
Biodynamic is a holistic , sustainable form of responsible agriculture that actually predates the organic movement .
As in organic agriculture , biodynamic cultivation enriches the soil and yields plants that have not been burdened with synthetic / chemical fertilizers or pesticides , sustaining and fostering a healthy ecosystem .
The soil the plants are grown in is clean and considered organic .
Only biodynamic fertilizers and natural pesticides are used to support abundant life in the soil and maximum plant health .
All plants are harvested at peak times during the day to preserve optimum benefits – usually at sunrise and moonrise .
This past weekend , undercover operatives from Greenpeace tested the DNA of fish served in several London - based restaurants that are part of a chain known as Nobu .
The restaurants are partially owned by actor Robert De Niro .
The tested fish were discovered to be endangered bluefin tuna .
In an incredibly stupid response , Nobu ’s principal manager has decided to label the endangered fish with an asterisk on the restaurants ’ menu , rather than stopping to serve it .
Do I think this response will ultimately be acceptable to the world community ?
Absolutely not .
If De Niro is as good at managing his restaurants as he is his acting career , then the appropriate action for this embarrassing incident should be a no- brainer .
But instead , De Niro ’s partner has shot them in the foot .
[ social_buttons ]
According to the Telegraph , Richie Notar , the chain ’s manager has said that an asterisk will now be put on the menu to aware customers of the fish ’s status .
They add the following : “ Mr. Notar said he would like to take bluefin off the menu altogether , but the move was being resisted by the chain ’s Japanese chefs who serve it in sushi and sashimi .
In Japan , bluefin is considered the most delicious of all tuna species . ”
I guess you have about the same size backbone as the fish you are serving , Mr. Notar .
In fairness to Notar , it is not illegal to sell bluefin tuna .
The Telegraph notes on the other hand that “ scientists have warned that fishing for bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic is taking place at levels far higher than stocks can stand .
A crisis meeting to discuss a possible ban on fishing takes place in November . ”
My guess is that De Niro ’s restaurant chain will suffer a serious decline in business because of Greenpeace ’s sting operation .
Whether or not the international community is as outraged as I am remains to be seen .
Hopefully De Niro will come forward and do the right thing .

A new study in the journal BMC Ecology indicates that coastal wolves in British Columbia switch to eating salmon in the fall as a primary food source , rather than deer .
Scientists arrived at this conclusion after analyzing wolf poop they collected over a four year span .
Among the thousands of stools that were collected by the researchers in the spring and summer months , 90 - 95 % of them contained some indications that wolves were eating deer as prey .
In the fall , however , this number dropped significantly .
About 40 - 70 % of the stools in this time of year indicated that wolves were dining on salmon .
So what ’s the big deal ?
In the past , it was thought that wolves only ate fish like salmon when other preferred food sources were scarce .
It makes ecological sense , however , that as salmon become available as a food source during their inland migration , many animals ( including wolves ) should take advantage of a free and easy feast .
Perhaps because dams have been built over time on rivers throughout the U.S. and Canada , subsequently blocking salmon from swimming upstream , it has been less obvious to us that wolves enjoy salmon .
We must not also forget that wolves were also on the brink of extinction in the United States – so it ’s been challenging to study them and their behavior in the States until recently .
The findings of this study suggest that our knowledge of wolves in the U.S. and Canada is still rather limited .
Until now , when we thought of wolves eating , generally we would think of a pack working together to take down elk or deer in places like Yellowstone National Park .
Or perhaps we might have also thought about the balancing act of populations that goes on between wolves and moose in Isle Royale National Park .
In short , our perception has been formed by a common reality we have witnessed through our cameras and binoculars in the modern era : wolves tend to eat large animals with hooves .
So by now understanding that salmon and fish are still an important part of the dietary mix for wolves in British Columbia , maybe it ’s now possible to think that was historically true for wolves in other areas of North America as well .
Unfortunately , I think the implications of this study could be potentially be used as fodder by people who are against wolf reintroduction in the western United States .
Disgruntled ranchers who have lost livestock to wolves might ask themselves : “ if wolves like fish , then why do they need my cattle ?
They do n’t . ”
Hopefully this thought exercise is just paranoia on my part .
I would n’t be surprised though if this line of thought eventually makes its way into the wolf reintroduction dialogue .
To end on a more positive thought , perhaps it underscores yet another reason why aiding efforts to bring back salmon runs in the U.S. would be a good thing .
Who knows , maybe it would alleviate some of the cattle losses incurred by ranchers by giving wolves another food source .

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are central to the US housing market US President George Bush says mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been taken over because they posed " an unacceptable risk " to the economy .
The two companies account for nearly half of the outstanding mortgages in the US , and have lost billions of dollars during the US housing crash .
The most recent figures show about 9 % of US mortgage holders were behind on their payments or faced repossession .
The federal takeover is one of the largest bail - outs in US history .
It was announced on Sunday by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
" Putting these companies on sound financial footing , and reforming their business practices , is critical to the health of our financial system , " President Bush said .
" The actions taken today are temporary , and will support housing finance in the near term . "
' Comprehensive action '
As part of the changes , the management of the two companies will be replaced while the firms will be given access to extra funding to support their business going forward .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the government was intervening in the wider interests of the financial system and of taxpayers since the financial position of the two firms was fast deteriorating .
A failure of either of them would create great turmoil in financial markets here and around the globe

He added that the two firms ' debt levels posed a " systemic risk " to financial stability and that , without action , the situation would get worse .
" We examined all options available and determined this comprehensive and complementary set of actions best met the objectives of market stability , mortgage availability and taxpayer protection , " he said .
" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would create great turmoil in financial markets here and around the globe . "

The move is intended to keep the two companies afloat , amid fears that either could go bankrupt as borrowers default on their home loans .
The two firms will be administered by the Federal Housing Finance Agency until their long - term future is decided .
The Congressional Budget Office has said such a move could cost up to $ 25 bn but Mr Paulson said there was no reason why taxpayers should have to directly foot the bill .
Funding guarantee Together , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae own or guarantee about $ 5.3 trillion ( £ 3 trillion ) of mortgages .
But they have made a combined loss of about $ 14bn in the past year and officials were worried that they would no longer be able to continue functioning if such losses continued .
PESTON'S PICKS
For the US Treasury , the bailout could turn out to be one of the most expensive financial rescues in history
Robert Peston 's thoughts in full
The Treasury 's funding guarantees to the two firms - which will include it buying up high - risk mortgage backed securities used to fund the mortgage market - will last until the end of 2009 .
During that period , neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac will be able to make any payments to their shareholders .
But Mr Paulson warned that the move was only a short - term " stabilisation " exercise .
He said it would be up to Congress to agree proposals to reform the two firms and address their " pervasive weaknesses " .
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said he " strongly endorsed " the proposals to ensure the two firms remained financially sound .
" These necessary steps will help to strengthen the US housing market and promote stability in our financial markets , " he said .
Banks around the world are highly exposed to the two companies and therefore , given the febrile state of markets across the world , it had become dangerous for doubts to persist about whether they were viable and would be able to keep up the payments on their massive liabilities , says the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston .
A rescue plan passed by Congress in July gave the US government the authority to offer unlimited liquidity to the two companies , and to buy their shares , in order to keep them afloat .
In an earlier version of this story we erroneously reported that more than 9 % of all US homeowners were behind on their payments or facing repossession .
This numbers applies to mortgage holders only .

Pipes that extract methane gas generated by waste decomposition are seen at the Simi Valley Landfill and Recycling Center in Simi Valley , California May 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Hector Mata
SAN ANTONIO ( Reuters ) - San Antonio unveiled a deal on Tuesday that will make it the first U.S. city to harvest methane gas from human waste on a commercial scale and turn it into clean - burning fuel .
San Antonio residents produce about 140,000 tons a year of a substance gently referred to as “ biosolids , ” which can be reprocessed into natural gas , said Steve Clouse , chief operating officer of the city ’s water system .
“ You may call it something else , ” Clouse said , but for area utilities , the main byproduct of human waste - methane gas - will soon be converted into natural gas to burn in their power plants .
The city approved a deal where Massachusetts - based Ameresco Inc will convert the city ’s biosolids into natural gas , which could generate about 1.5 million cubic feet per day , he said .
Methane gas , which is a byproduct of human and organic waste , is a principal component of the natural gas used to fuel furnaces , power plants , and other combustion - based generators .
“ The private vendor will come onto the facility , construct some gas cleaning systems , remove the moisture , remove the carbon dioxide content , and then sell that gas on the open market , ” Clouse said .
The gas will be sold to power generators , he said .
Some communities are using methane gas harvested from solid waste to power smaller facilities like sewage treatment plants , but San Antonio is the first to see large - scale conversion of methane gas from sewage into fuel for power generation , he said .
Following the agreement , more than 90 percent of materials flushed down the toilets and sinks of San Antonio will be recycled , he said .
Liquid is now used for irrigation , many of the solids are made into compost , and now the methane gas will be recycled for power generation .

Future 6D holograms interact with light
The basic technology used in cheap 3D postcards and novelty items has been adapted to create six - dimensional images that respond to changes in light and the viewer 's direction .
While the display is still pretty small , seven by seven pixels , the researchers hope that within the next two to three years they could scale it up to create some of the most realistic images available .
" We are the first ones to build a display that changes with lighting , " says Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar , a scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped to develop the technology .
" We 've finally found a way to build the most realistic display . "
The idea is similar to the technology used on stiff , cheap plastic postcards , the kind when rotated causes an image to move or make it 3D .
These postcards use a series of raised parallel lines to create tiny lenses that project different images at either vertical or horizontal angles .
The effect can make an image of a car appear like it 's moving down a road or a hand appear like it 's waving as you tilt the card one way and then another .
Instead of using parallel lines to create the image , the researchers used squares to create lenses that present different images at both vertical and horizontal angles simultaneously .
Responsive
It 's not all about the light coming out of the display though .
Unlike a television , where information only goes in one direction , the 6D display would respond to changes in the illumination around it , like passing shadows or bright highlights .
Imagine two flowers side by side , one real , one holographic , says Raskar .
" They would both look real , " he says .
" But if you shine a flashlight on the hologram , light would pass right through it while the real flower would change in response to the light . "
Using their new technology , the image the scientists create would actually respond to light like a real flower would .
To demonstrate their design , the scientists created a 6D image of a wine bottle in the display and showed the device at the recent SIGGRAPH ( Special Interest Group on GRAPHics and Interactive Techniques ) conference .
While the small prototype was a success , do n't expect to see the technology for a few years .
The scientists say the technology is still at least two to three years away from realistic use .
It 's also expensive .
Because they use custom made parts , the displays currently cost about $ US30 per pixel .
Novelty item
Mass production could lower that cost , but creating even a 100 by 100 pixel image viewable from 10 different angles would take 100 million different pixels , says Dr Alan Sullivan , a research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories who also built a sophisticated 3D DepthCube Display .
Sullivan sees 6D displays first being used by science museums as novelty items .
Once the technology matures it could be used for high - end applications , " where a lot of money would go into something and no one wants to make a bad decision during the design phase , " says Sullivan .
Some of the areas Sullivan envisions for 6D displays include new cuts for precious stones , vehicles with paints that change color depending on the angle , and buildings whose appearance would change depending on the position of the sun .
" I love this technology , " says Sullivan .
" I think it 's a cool idea , and even if its ultimate implementation is n't done , it 's inspirational .
If we do n't reach for the stars we can't get off the ground . "

Mikheil Saakashvili 's decision to use the opening of the Olympic Games to cover Georgia 's invasion of its breakaway province of South Ossetia must rank in stupidity with Gamal Abdel - Nasser 's decision to close the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships .
Nasser 's blunder cost him the Sinai in the Six - Day War .
Saakashvili's blunder probably means permanent loss of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
After shelling and attacking what he claims is his own country , killing scores of his own Ossetian citizens and sending tens of thousands fleeing into Russia , Saakashvili 's army was whipped back into Georgia in 48 hours .
Vladimir Putin took the opportunity to kick the Georgian army out of Abkhazia , as well , to bomb Tbilisi and to seize Gori , birthplace of Stalin .
Reveling in his status as an intimate of George Bush , Dick Cheney and John McCain , and America 's lone democratic ally in the Caucasus , Saakashvili thought he could get away with a lightning coup and present the world with a fait accompli .
Mikheil did not reckon on the rage or resolve of the Bear .
American charges of Russian aggression ring hollow .
Georgia started this fight -- Russia finished it .
People who start wars do n't get to decide how and when they end .
Russia 's response was " disproportionate " and " brutal , " wailed Bush .
True .
But did we not authorize Israel to bomb Lebanon for 35 days in response to a border skirmish where several Israel soldiers were killed and two captured ?
Was that not many times more " disproportionate " ?
Russia has invaded a sovereign country , railed Bush .
But did not the United States bomb Serbia for 78 days and invade to force it to surrender a province , Kosovo , to which Serbia had a far greater historic claim than Georgia had to Abkhazia or South Ossetia , both of which prefer Moscow to Tbilisi ?
Is not Western hypocrisy astonishing ?
When the Soviet Union broke into 15 nations , we celebrated .
When Slovenia , Croatia , Macedonia , Bosnia , Montenegro and Kosovo broke from Serbia , we rejoiced .
Why , then , the indignation when two provinces , whose peoples are ethnically separate from Georgians and who fought for their independence , should succeed in breaking away ?
Are secessions and the dissolution of nations laudable only when they advance the agenda of the neocons , many of who viscerally detest Russia ?
That Putin took the occasion of Saakashvili 's provocative and stupid stunt to administer an extra dose of punishment is undeniable .
But is not Russian anger understandable ?
For years the West has rubbed Russia 's nose in her Cold War defeat and treated her like Weimar Germany .
When Moscow pulled the Red Army out of Europe , closed its bases in Cuba , dissolved the evil empire , let the Soviet Union break up into 15 states , and sought friendship and alliance with the United States , what did we do ?
American carpetbaggers colluded with Muscovite Scalawags to loot the Russian nation .
Breaking a pledge to Mikhail Gorbachev , we moved our military alliance into Eastern Europe , then onto Russia 's doorstep .
Six Warsaw Pact nations and three former republics of the Soviet Union are now NATO members .
Bush , Cheney and McCain have pushed to bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO .
This would require the United States to go to war with Russia over Stalin 's birthplace and who has sovereignty over the Crimean Peninsula and Sebastopol , traditional home of Russia 's Black Sea fleet .
When did these become U.S. vital interests , justifying war with Russia ?
The United States unilaterally abrogated the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty because our technology was superior , then planned to site anti-missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic to defend against Iranian missiles , though Iran has no ICBMs and no atomic bombs .
A Russian counter - offer to have us together put an anti-missile system in Azerbaijan was rejected out of hand .
We built a Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey to cut Russia out .
Then we helped dump over regimes friendly to Moscow with democratic " revolutions " in Ukraine and Georgia , and tried to repeat it in Belarus .
Americans have many fine qualities .
A capacity to see ourselves as others see us is not high among them .
Imagine a world that never knew Ronald Reagan , where Europe had opted out of the Cold War after Moscow installed those SS - 20 missiles east of the Elbe .
And Europe had abandoned NATO , told us to go home and become subservient to Moscow .
How would we have reacted if Moscow had brought Western Europe into the Warsaw Pact , established bases in Mexico and Panama , put missile defense radars and rockets in Cuba , and joined with China to build pipelines to transfer Mexican and Venezuelan oil to Pacific ports for shipment to Asia ?
And cut us out ?
If there were Russian and Chinese advisers training Latin American armies , the way we are in the former Soviet republics , how would we react ?
Would we look with bemusement on such Russian behavior ?
For a decade , some of us have warned about the folly of getting into Russia 's space and getting into Russia 's face .
The chickens of democratic imperialism have now come home to roost -- in Tbilisi .
A new report from the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) predicts that alternative energy technologies will create millions of new jobs over the next twenty years , including 11 million in the biofuels industry alone .
The report , Green Jobs : Towards Decent Work in a Sustainable , Low - Carbon World , says that shifting employment and investment patterns adopted in response to the challenges of global warming are already creating new jobs in many sectors and economies , and could create millions more across both the developed and developing world .
In sum , UNEP predicts nothing short of a revoluton in the way the world economy will look over the next two decades .
In other highlights , the report has also found that :
The global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from US $ 1,370 billion ( 1.37 trillion ) per year at present to US $ 2,740 billion ( 2.74 trillion ) by 2020 ;
Half of this market is in energy efficiency and the balance in sustainable transport , water supply , sanitation and waste management ;
Sectors that will be particularly important in terms of their environmental , economic and employment impact are energy supply , in particular renewable energy , buildings and construction , transportation , basic industries , agriculture and forestry ;
Clean technologies are already the third largest sector for venture capital after information and biotechnology in the United States , while green venture capital in China more than doubled to 19 per cent of total investment in recent years ;
2.3 million people have in recent years found new jobs in the renewable energy sector alone , and the potential for job growth in the sector is huge .
Employment in alternative energies may rise to 2.1 million in wind and 6.3 million in solar power by 2030 ;
Renewable energy generates more jobs than employment in fossil fuels .
Projected investments of US $ 630 billion by 2030 would translate into at least 20 million additional jobs in the renewable energy sector .
Though the report is generally optimistic about job creation to tackle global warming , it also warns that many of these new jobs can be “ dirty , dangerous and difficult . ”
Sectors of concern , mostly ( though not exclusively ) in developing countries , include agriculture and recycling , where low pay , insecure employment contracts and exposure to hazardous materials need to be addressed as a matter of priority .
The report is bound to please advocates of renewable energy and will add to a growing evidence base that increased investment in green technologies can boost both the economy and the environment .
Earlier this month , a report from the Center for American Progress claimed that a $ 100 billion investment could see the creation of 2 million green jobs in the U.S. alone .

As oil prices recede from all - time dollar highs and some of the hot air gets let out of energy policy debates , it ’s a good time to remember that here ’s a key concept missing from almost every popular discussion of the subject : energy density .
Specialist economists get it , but almost nobody else does .
It is important to understanding why most forms of “ alternative energy ” are mirages , and what a sane energy policy would actually look like .
The background to this is that the few technologies we have for storing electricity ( batteries , pump - fed ponds above hydroelectric turbines ) are lossy and do n’t scale well .
Worse , power transmission is significantly lossy as well .
These mean several things , all of them bad .
Absence of a decent storage technology means we can’t really time - shift electricity demand .
When more electricity is needed ( for example , to run air conditioning during the day in the American Southwest ) more power plants have to be running and feeding power to the grid in real time .
There ’s no way to run plants at night and store the generated power for daytime use .
Transmission losses mean our ability to space - shift demand is limited , too , though not as severely .
Electricity - intensive industries ( the classic example is aluminum smelting ) need their own dedicated power plants nearby .
The combination of these problems means that household energy conservation is mainly a way for wealthy Westerners to feel virtuous rather than an actual attack on energy costs .
Household conservation slightly decreases the maximum capacity needed locally where the conservation is being practiced , but has little impact further away , where demand has to be supplied by different plants .
Industrial efficiency gains are far less visible ; but , because the scale of industrial energy use is so much larger , they matter a lot more .
The combination of these problems also means we cannot , practically speaking , aggregate lots of very small flows of electricity into one big one .
It ’s not just total volume of energy production that matters , but the energy density available to high - volume consumers at a given place at and at a given time .
This may sound like a dry technical point , but it has huge and nasty implications .
One is that the most touted forms of so - called “ alternative energy ” and are largely ( though not entirely ) useless .
Solar and wind power are both time - variable and low - density .
Lacking good ways to time - shift and aggregate electricity , this means you ca n’t count on them to run factories and hospitals and computer server farms .
The best you can hope for is that they can partially address low - density usage , running climate control and appliances for homes and some purpose - designed office buildings .
Biomass ( including processed forms like ethanol ) seems more promising because , like fossil fuels , you can burn it when and where you choose in order to to match your electricity production to demand .
The problem is that biomass has much lower practial energy density than coal or oil .
This means you have to transport and burn a lot more of it , with much larger pollution and life - cycle costs .
One of those is much higher CO2 emissions , which are a significant problem for other reasons even if ( like me ) you do n’t believe they ’re driving global warming .
Hydroelectric power is , in most respects , ideal — nonpolluting , renewable , all those good things .
The trouble is that , at least in the U.S. and elsewhere in the developed world , we ’re not going to get any more of it .
All the good sites for high - density hydropower are taken .
There ’s some potential for low - density hydropower , especially in rural areas to run farms .
Geothermal is like hydropower , economically speaking , but requires unusual geology .
Basically the only place it can work on a large scale is in Iceland , home of a full third of the world ’s active volcanoes .
Accordingly , hydropower and geothermal are not going to support any larger share of what energy economists call the industrial base load — the day - in , day - out demand for high - density power from all those factories and hospitals and server farms — and printing presses , and food - processing operations , and everything else .
The industrial base load is the life blood of technological civilization ; without it , we ’d have a hideous global population crash , and then revert to pre-1750 conditions in which the economy is almost entirely subsistence farming and life is nasty , brutish , and short .
The first question any energy - policy proposal has to address is how to sustain an industrial base load equivalent to today ’s — much higher than today ’s actually , if we do n’t want to condemn the Third World to perpetual poverty .
But most advocates of “ alternative energy ” evade this question , because they do n’t like the answers they get when they look at it squarely .
In the real world , there are only three base load sources that matter : coal , oil , and nuclear ( hydropower would be a fourth if it were n’t already maxed out ) .
What they have in common is that you can get lots of energy per gram out of the fuel , thus lots of both energy volume and energy density out of one power plant .
Of these three , nuclear has the highest density , then oil , then coal .
Both economic arguments and historical evidence tell us that you ca n’t have an industrial civilization without a fuel that has an energy density at least as high ( and thus a cost per unit of energy as low as ) coal .
Higher density is better , because it means lower cost .
Those costs are not denominated just in money ; low - density energy sources are more labor - intensive to operate and that causes more illness and death .
Compare annual deaths from coal mining to annual deaths in the petroleum industry to the annual deaths associated with nuclear power ; the trend is dramatic and favors higher - density sources , even if you ignore chemical air pollution entirely .
Nothing on offer from advocates of low - density “ alternative energy ” even comes close to coal as an industrial baseload source .
let alone oil or nuclear .
Ethanol and hydrogen look like it , until you consider life - cycle costs ; basically , making either costs a lot more than mining coal , both in money and in input energy .
Another key point is that , for transportation , oil is basically the only thing we have that will do .
For fixed - location power plants , the energy yield per gram of fuel matters a lot and the weight of the plant machinery only a very little .
On the other hand , for automobiles and ships and airplanes , power - to - weight ratio matters a lot .
Nuclear and coal basically cannot make that cut , cost - insensitive military applications of nuclear notwithstanding .
For fixed - location power plants , however , nuclear is the clear winner .
Coal and oil have lower density and serious pollution costs .
They are also much less safe .
Yes , I said less safe ; the historical evidence is extremely clear on this .
There are some kinds of non-polluting fixed - location plants that might become available in the future : notably tidal generators and atmosphere towers .
They will probably be good replacements for nuclear down the road , but they ’re not an answer to the transportation problem .
Oil is non-renewable ; the price is rising and eventually ( though not in the near term and not as rapidly as predicted by peak - oil - collapse hysterics ) it will run out .
And no , electric cars are n’t the answer either ; the power to run them has to come from somewhere .
The best case is that people will charge them off the grid at night .
This will require power plants to be burning just as much additional fuel as if the cars themselves were doing it , perhaps more given transmission losses .
What electric cars can do , at best , is give us fuel flexibility , replacing direct oil - burning with nuclear plants and coal .
But that ’s not going to net out to lower pollution and lower costs unless we build a lot of nuclear plants very quickly .
Thanks to decades of scare - mongering and NIMBYism , this probably is n’t possible in the U.S .
The pressing question , then , remains :
What ’s going to replace oil ?
Let ’s draw up a specification for the ideal replacement .
We ’d like a fuel with the energy density of oil , or better .
We ’d like the only per -unit cost to be sunlight , because that ’s the only thing that ’s 100 % renewable and ( unlike tidal , hydropower , and geothermal ) available everywhere .
Ideally , we ’d like the stuff to not require a huge , expensive conversion job on our energy infrastructure .
Happily , I think this spec can be filled .
There are demonstration plants making synthetic oil from algae at a per - unit cost not far above that of oil , and plenty of venture capital looking to fund more .
As this technology scales up , algal - synfuel costs will drop below that of oil .
At that point , the free market will have solved the problem .
It ’s largely forgotten now , but we ’ve actually been through a similar transition before .
In the mid-19th century whale oil was heavily used for lighting and as an industrial feedstock .
Prices rose as whales were hunted to near - extinction ; fortunately , the stuff proved to be replaceable by petroleum .
Yes , that ’s right ; big oil saved the whales .
A century and a half later , pond scum looks likely to save civilization .

The New Yorker magazine ’s controversial cover has renewed focus on public misperceptions of Sen. Barack Obama ’s faith .
Despite recurrent media attention to the issue — including extensive coverage of his association with the controversial Protestant cleric , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright — the incorrect perception that the Democratic presidential candidate adheres to the Muslim faith or to another non-Christian faith has remained remarkably constant over the course of the 2008 election campaign .
The belief that Obama is Muslim , however , appears to have virtually no effect on Republican voters — who overwhelmingly support McCain in any case .
But Democrats who share the misperception are significantly less likely to support Obama .
In the latest survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , 12 % say Obama is Muslim , virtually unchanged from 10 % in March .
This misperception is not limited to voters who oppose Obama .
Identical percentages of Republicans and Democrats ( 12 % each ) think he is Muslim , and the link between views of Obama ’s religion and their candidate choice vote is strongest among Democrats .
Believing Obama to be Muslim is not a strict litmus test to voters .
Among the 12 % who say he is Muslim , a slim majority ( 51 % ) backs McCain .
However , 37 % who hold this view say they intend to vote for Obama .
Among the majority who identify Obama as Christian these figures are reversed , with 52 % backing Obama for president and 39 % backing McCain .
Overall , 63 % of the voters who say they back Obama for president correctly identify him as Christian , but another 9 % say he adheres to the Islamic faith .
But questions about Obama ’s faith may have an effect beyond the 12 % who flatly say Obama is Muslim .
One - quarter of voters say they do n’t know what Obama ’s religious beliefs are , including 10 % who say the reason they do n’t know is not that they “ just do n’t know enough about him , ” but instead that they ’ve “ heard different things about his religion . ”
Significantly , those who have heard different things about Obama ’s religion favor McCain by a margin of 48 % to 33 % , while those who just do n’t know enough about it favor Obama 48 % to 33 % .
Republican voters in the survey overwhelmingly support McCain irrespective of their belief about Obama ’s religious faith .
But the new Pew Research poll finds that questions about Obama ’s faith appear to have a strong influence on candidate preference among the Democrats who either believe Obama is Muslim or who do n’t know because they ’ve heard different things .
These voters are 28 points less likely to say they back Obama for president than are those who believe he is Christian ( 62 % vs. 90 % ) .
The relationship between views of Obama ’s religion and the vote is far less substantial among independents — those who believe he is Christian are split evenly between the two candidates , while those who think or have heard Obama is Muslim favor McCain by a 50 % - to - 34 % margin .
FOX News ’
Alan Colmes reports on this same issue , and notes that Sarah Palin ’s son was born on April 20 .
Now a word from religious right leader James Dobson :
“ [ O ] ur conviction is that birth and adoption are the purview of married heterosexual couples .
Traditional marriage is God ’s design for the family and is rooted in biblical truth .
When that divine plan is implemented , children have the best opportunity to thrive .
That ’s why public policy as it relates to families must be based not solely on the desires of adults but rather on the needs of children and what is best for society at large . ” – James Dobson of Focus on the Family , TIME , December 2006
Joe and I discussed this post before writing it .
We were n’t even sure we were comfortable posting this because , as Democrats and progressives , we do n’t pass judgment on children born out of wedlock , or their parents .
Every child is a gift , and we do n’t believe it ’s the government ’s , or anyone else ’s , business what you do in your own bedroom .
But the conservative base of the Republican party , the very base that McCain ’s VP choice , Sarah Palin , was chosen to woo , does care about legislating your sex life .
Though it was 20 years ago , who can forget the infamous Murphy Brown controversy , when then Republican VP Dan Quayle criticized a fictional TV character , Murphy Brown , for having a child out of wedlock .
For conservative Christians , aka “ values voters , ” getting pregnant while not married is still severely frowned upon .
Remember , it was only 18 months ago that religious right leader James Dobson famously , and publicly , criticized vice presidential daughter Mary Cheney in a column in TIME magazine for having a child out of wedlock .
It is exactly Dobson who McCain is wooing with the choice of Palin .
As Joe notes in his post below , pregnancy and birth control – and overall sexual mores – are key issues for conservative voters , and for the Republican party leadership .
It is therefore newsworthy , and a legitimate issue , while admittedly somewhat uncomfortable , to inquire as to the practice of those very same issues in Sarah Palin ’s own life .
Let me walk you through the issue :
1. Sarah Palin ’s first son , Track Palin , was born in April 1989 ( we do n’t have the exact day ) .
Actually now we do , courtesy of FOX News ’ Alan Colmes .
He was born on April 20 .
For the purposes of this analysis , we will give Sarah Palin the benefit of the doubt and assume that her son was born on April 30 , 1989 , the longest possible April date from her marriage .
2 . Sarah Palin was married on August 29 , 1988 .
She eloped .
3 . 38 weeks is the typical human pregnancy .
4 . 38 weeks before her son ’s birthday , April 20 , 1989 , is July 28 , 1988 – i.e. , that would be the hypothetical day of conception .
5 . If this data is correct , that would mean that Sarah Palin eloped four weeks after her son ’s conception .
6 . Sarah Palin ’s son could still be legitimate if he was born four weeks premature , AND if he was conceived on the night his parents eloped .
Again , Joe and I are n’t very comfortable discussing these kind of issues because , honestly , we do n’t care when Sarah Palin ’s son was conceived .
But Sarah Palin and John McCain and James Dobson care very much about the conception of your children .
James Dobson , the very man McCain is wooing , himself decided that Mary Cheney ’s out of wedlock conception was worthy of an entire commentary in TIME magazine only 18 months ago .
It is at least fair to ask that Sarah Palin meet the James Dobson / Mary Cheney standard , and clarify for James Dobson and values voters everywhere whether her actions match her words .
The storm brought waves crashing over Havana 's Malecon promenade
Hurricane Gustav , a highly dangerous Category 4 storm , has lashed Cuba with torrential rain after leaving a trail of destruction across the Caribbean .
The storm ploughed through Cuba 's Isla de la Juventud before hitting the mainland in Pinar del Rio with maximum winds of nearly 240 km /h ( 150 m ph ) .
Almost a quarter of a million people have been evacuated in Cuba , where there has been extensive flooding .
Gustav has already claimed the lives of more than 80 people in the Caribbean .
It has swept through Haiti , the Dominican Republic and Jamaica over the past week , killing dozens of people and causing widespread damage .
HURRICANE CATEGORIES FIVE : Winds over 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) .
Storm surge more than 18ft ( 5.4 m ) above normal .
Only three such US landfall hurricanes - Labour Day 1935 , Camille 1969 and Andrew 1992 FOUR : Winds 131-155 mph .

In pictures : Hurricane Gustav Preparing for Gustav
As a Category 4 storm , Gustav is already stronger than Hurricane Katrina was when it hit New Orleans in 2005 , killing some 1,800 people and causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage .
But US forecasters warned that the latest storm could yet strengthen further after it passes Cuba , potentially growing to a Category 5 - the highest possible classification - as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico .
After Cuba , Gustav 's projected path takes it over the oil - producing Gulf , before making landfall in the US , possibly as early as Monday .
A hurricane watch has been put in place along America 's North Gulf coast , from Texas along to the Alabama - Florida border .
In the US , the city of New Orleans has begun enforcing a mandatory evacuation order for coastal districts , or parishes , Emergency officials have warned people in vulnerable areas not to try and ride out the storm .
US Republicans say their convention in Minnesota next week could be suspended as the storm roars ashore .
John McCain , due to be nominated as the party 's presidential election candidate , said the decision would depend on the storm 's impact .
" It would n't be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near - tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster , " he told Fox News .
Tobacco fears Gustav hit mainland Cuba between in the west of Pinar del Rio province , reports said , having passed across the low - lying Isla de la Juventud , or Isle of Youth .

The island 's civil defence chief , Ana Isla , said there were no reports of deaths but there were " many people injured " .
She told the Associated Press that nearly all the island 's roads were washed out and some regions were heavily flooded .
Cuban state media reported that many buildings were underwater and entire warehouses had been brought down .
The storm has already brought extensive flooding to the western , tobacco - growing province of Pinar del Rio and to Havana province .
Almost 250,000 people have been evacuated from low - lying coastal regions and half a million sacks of valuable dried cigar tobacco leaves were moved into safe storage .
The capital , Havana , is expected to escape the worst of the storm but its effects are being felt there - several parts of the city have lost power and large waves have poured over the Malecon , the capital 's famous seafront promenade .
People rushed for cover as the hurricane lashed Cuba The BBC's Michael Voss in Havana says Cuba , the only communist country in the Americas , has one of the best organised disaster - preparedness systems in the region .
Nevertheless , there have been reports of people fleeing from coastal areas carrying their belongings and valuable home appliances .
One woman said she was not afraid to leave home because " the police and authorities are always watching and taking care of things " .
Storm surge fears
In the US , the Associated Press estimates that about one million people took to highways in the Gulf Coast region on Saturday to flee the storm .
Coastal parishes in New Orleans have been placed under mandatory evacuation , and long queues could be seen at assembly points in the city .

States of emergency have been declared in Louisiana and Texas .
Emergency officials have warned that a tidal storm surge up to nine metres ( 30 ft ) is possible along the coast .
David Paulison , head of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) , said the government had learnt from Katrina and was taking a " pro-active " approach to the storm , getting evacuation transportation and extra personnel on the ground early .
Gustav is the second major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season .
On Friday night , Gustav struck the low - lying Cayman Islands , flooding streets in the tax haven and luxury tourist resort but reportedly causing no injuries .
Earlier , the storm claimed the lives of at least 66 people in Haiti , eight in the Dominican Republic and seven in Jamaica , where heavy rains caused flooding and strong winds tore roofs off houses .

Blue sky thinking :
The ' skyscraper ' farms that could be feeding millions by 2050
It may sound like a pie in the sky idea , but vertical farms containing enough food to feed four million people , could one day divert a potential world food shortage .
The huge ' living ' skyscrapers have captured the imagination of architects in the U.S and Europe as food prices soar .
They are the brainchild of Dickson Despommier , a professor of public health at Columbia University .
The skyscraper concept is gaining more attention as world food prices soar .
The designer claims one farm could produce 12 million lettuces a year
' We need to devote as much attention to vertical farming as we did to going to the moon , ' the 68 - year - old said .
' It will free the world from having to worry where our next meal will come from . '
The revolutionary scientist proposes gleaming 21 storey skyscrapers that could potentially be as productive as 588 acres of land and grow up to 12 million lettuces a year .
A computer generated image of whata vertical farm might look like
He said the farms , projected to cost £ 45 m to build and £ 2.7 m a year to run , would be both environmentally friendly and economically profitable .
Dr Despommier created his concept in 1999 with graduate students during a class on medical ecology .
With the world 's population expected to increase to 3 billion by 2050 and almost 80 per cent of farming land in use , the idea has never been more relevant .
Despommieren has used the internet and a series of lectures to spread his concept .
However , despite the neat simplicity of his idea , Dr Despommier is treated with suspicion in academic circles .
' I'm viewed as kind of an outsider because it 's kind of a crazy idea , ' Dr Despommier says .
Not put off , Despommier , has pushed for city planners in America to take his project seriously .
' Vertical farming practised on a large scale in urban centres has great potential to supply enough food in a sustainable fashion to comfortably feed all of humankind for the foreseeable future , ' he said .
' All of this may sound too good to be true but these are realistic and achievable goals , given the full development of a few new technologies .
' High - rise food - producing buildings will succeed only if they function by mimicking ecological process .
' Most important , there must be strong , government - supported economic incentives to the private sector , as well as to universities and local government to develop the concept , ' the professor said .
Vertical farms could also work in pyramid form
Building these modern Hanging Gardens of Babylon may seem like something from a science fiction novel , but Despommier believes they are necessary for mankind 's future .
' It 's very idealistic and ivory tower and all of that .
But there 's a real desire to make this happen , ' he said .
Reports of Barack Obama sightings in Burnout Paradise on the XBox 360 have been pouring in .
It seems the Presidential hopeful has purchased virtual billboard space from Electronic Arts , the makers of the game .
EA has confirmed the ad buy adding that it takes advertising from any credible source for placement in its video games .
The ad itself shows Obama next to a message directing voters to voteforchange.com , a site that gives voters information about how to register and where to vote .
Too bad Obama has cited video games as an obstacle to a good education as recently as yesterday , and there 's no confirmation yet to the rumor that McCain is looking to buy spots on the Monopoly board .

Capitalism is a panacea , after all .
It cures symptoms of affluence as well as poverty .
We file this report , coincidentally , from Manchester … where , according to legend , the industrial revolution began .
Modern tools , steady money , and fossil fuel were put together , creating so much gas , it lifted mankind out of the mud of the Middle Ages and carried him aloft .
Thrifty Scottish economists - notably Adam Smith and Adam Ferguson - saw what was happening and took note of the moral lesson : by foregoing the satisfaction of current consumption , savings could be invested in factories , machines , and new discoveries that increased the output from human labor .
In the same amount of time , thanks to his new tools , a workingman could produce more things .
And , soon , the things made him rich .
According to MeasuringWealth.com , during the second half of the 18th century , the typical British workingman earned about 60 pounds per year .
It took only 4.25 pounds sterling to buy an ounce of gold , so he earned the equivalent of 14 ounces of gold , which is worth about 6,622 pounds sterling at today ’s rates .
A century later , in 1971 , to be exact , his earnings had risen to the equivalent of 49 ounces of gold per year - or about 23,000 pounds sterling at today ’s rate .
( Readers who are good at math will already be asking questions .
The average wage in Britain today is only 23,177 .
In terms of gold , wages have gone nowhere for the last 37 years . )
But whatever wonder James Watt and the people of Britain ’s industrial heartland wrought , their descendants in America have worked another one ; in the midst of the greatest financial and technological boom ever , they have managed to actually reduce the value of their own labor .
Yes , dear reader , this week we turn our weary eyes away from the poor , the weak , and the huddled masses struggling to keep up with the price of rice … and focus on people who are struggling to keep up with their credit card payments .
Here is a group of people upon whom nature piled so many blessings , she crushed the wit out of them .
And , their wealth is being squeezed out too .
The United States of America has rich farmland , from sea to shining sea .
Still , it is a net importer of food .
In fact , it is a net importer of practically everything that can be moved .
Every day that goes by it receives about $ 2 billion more of these moveable objects than it sends out in exports .
Prior to the Nixon administration , such an imbalance could not persist for very long ; but however much God blessed America - with her purple mountains majesty and her fields of golden grain - was nothing compared to the way she was favored by the post - 1971 monetary system .
“ As ye plant , so shall ye reap , ” it saith in the Bible .
But in the period from 1997 - 2007 , Americans could reap without planting .
They could consume without earning .
They could invest without saving , and spend as much as they wanted without running out of money .
They were the world ’s luckiest people - they had the world ’s reserve currency … and access to the whole world ’s credit .
The miracle that fundamentally altered the world monetary system happened on August 15 , 1971 , when Richard Nixon “ closed the gold window , ” at the U.S. Treasury .
Before then , every nation ’s currency was anchored to gold .
Governments settled their imbalances in yellow metal ; since each unit of paper currency represented an option on the treasury ’s gold , it forced officials to be wary of issuing too many .
But after August , 1971 , the world ’s monetary system upped anchor and sailed with the tide .
Now , it all floats on a sea of paper money - and no one knows what ’s beneath the dark ocean surface .
The Chinese merchant who sold widgets and geegaws to spendthrift Americans could not use dollars to pay his wages .
He needed local currency .
So he traded his dollars for yuan .
And where did the Central Bank of China get enough yuan to buy up trillions of dollars ?
It had to create them .
All over the planet , as the world ’s stock of dollars rose … so did its inventories of local currencies .
And then , what could it do with its dollars ?
Before 1971 , it would have presented them to the U.S. Treasury and received one ounce of gold for every 41 paper dollars .
In order to protect the nation ’s gold , central bankers would have taken away the punch bowl and turned out the lights .
Rates would have gone up ; foreigners would have been encouraged to hold dollars ( rather than exchange them for gold ) ;
Americans would have been discouraged from spending dollars - effectively stifling U.S. consumer spending and bringing the current account back into balance .
Then , in 2001 , the U.S. financial authorities , led by Alan Greenspan , thought they faced a crisis .
They panicked - giving Americans even more credit rope .
With nothing to stop it , the supply of cash and credit rose at an even faster rate .
And thus it was that Americans wrapped their good fortune around their necks like a noose .
Instead of practicing the virtues that had made them rich - saving money , building new factories and learning new skills - they borrowed even more heavily than before .
And now their houses are being foreclosed and their bills are coming due .
Worse , the value of their most important asset - their time - is being marked down with the dollar .
According to our source , the typical American workingman in the late 19th century was already earning considerably more than an Englishman - 25 ounces of gold per year , rather than 14 .
He , too , became much richer as the industrial revolution progressed .
By 1971 , he was earning the equivalent of 82 ounces of gold , worth $ 76,000 today .
But then he forgot his lessons .
He stopped saving …his income fell … and his dollar dropped .
Adjusting the average hourly wage for consumer price inflation , he earns slightly less today than he did during the Carter administration .
Adjusting his wages to the fall of the euro , we find the average American earns less than the average Frenchman .
And adjusting his wages to gold and we see he has lost a half century of wage progress .
Today , he earns only the equivalent of 40 ounces of gold - or only about $ 38,000 .
Enjoy your weekend ,

Dounreay in Caithness is currently being decommissioned Scotland needs to consider creating a new generation of nuclear power plants to ensure energy security , according to a group of business leaders .
The Scottish Chambers of Commerce ( SCC ) has called for a plan to project energy demand over the next 20 years and match this with energy supply .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for more nuclear investment to help break the " dictatorship of oil " .
The SNP is opposed to new nuclear power stations , preferring renewable energy .
SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said : " No potential source of energy should be ruled out , including nuclear .
We believe that nuclear power must remain as a key option for a new generation of reactors in Scotland
Scottish Chambers of Commerce " Future renewable opportunities are extremely exciting for Scotland with new developments in wave and tidal power supplementing existing wind generation .
" The strategic plan must recognise that these will be vitally important to maintaining Scotland 's energy self - sufficiency , security of supply and conservation measures .
" However that security depends upon all options being on the table . "
Speaking to business leaders in Glasgow last week , the prime minister said the UK had to increase investment in both nuclear and renewable sources .
The Department for Business is currently undertaking a " strategic siting assessment process " to identify a list of possible sites for new nuclear projects .
The SCC has just submitted a paper to Holyrood 's Economy , Energy and Tourism Committee - which is carrying out an inquiry into energy .
The paper states : " Given the low greenhouse gas emissions of this [ nuclear ] generating technology and advances in decommissioning and nuclear waste disposal technologies , we believe that nuclear power must remain as a key option for a new generation of reactors in Scotland before the existing facilities reach the end of their lifespan .

What are these ?
Coastal dead zones , an increasing concern to ecologists , the fishing industry and the public , may not be as devoid of life after all .
A Brown scientist has found that dead zones do indeed support marine life , and that at least one commercially valuable clam actually benefits from oxygen - depleted waters .
Andrew Altieri , a post - doctoral researcher in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University , studied dead zones in Narragansett Bay , one of the largest estuaries on the U.S. East Coast .
In a paper published this month in the journal Ecology , he found that quahog clams ( Mercenaria mercenaria ) increased in number in hypoxic zones , defined as areas where dissolved oxygen in the water has been depleted .
The reasons appear to be twofold :
The quahogs ’ natural ability to withstand oxygen - starved waters , coupled with their predators ' inability to survive in dead zones .
The result :
The quahog can not only survive , but in the absence of predators , can actually thrive .
A recent study shows that dead zones have been expanding rapidly along the coastal United States and worldwide due to climate change and human - caused pollution .
Scientists have typically focused on documenting the death of species and loss of fisheries in these oxygen - poor areas , but they have n’t looked at how certain , hardy species such as quahogs can persist and thrive — until now .
There may be other commercially important species that persist — and perhaps benefit — from dead zones in other regions .
The research ( listen to the podcast on the Ecological Society of America Web site here ) also underscores that some key species can be more adaptive and resilient than expected when challenged environmentally , which could have important implications for conservation efforts .
“ You ’d be hard pressed to say dead zones are good , ” Altieri said , “ but with this study you just can't say that dead zones are simply doom and gloom .
Ultimately , it ’s a silver lining on a very dark cloud . ”
Altieri planted quahogs , soft - shell clams ( Mya arenaria ) and blue mussels ( Mytilus edulis ) at four locations in Narragansett Bay — three of which are known to become hypoxic seasonally .
He monitored how the species ’ populations fared during summer and early fall in 2003 and 2004 — periods when hypoxia is most likely to occur .
Altieri found that all three bivalve species can tolerate mild hypoxic conditions , and that each benefited from some degree of hypoxia , because their natural predators vacated those zones .
Scientists call hypoxia 's benefit to aquatic prey species “ predation refuge . ”
Altieri also determined that only the quahog can survive during severe hypoxia .
In fact , he found the clam ’s density was highest in the most oxygen - challenged areas , while the other species died off , as expected in a dead zone .
advertisement
“ The quahogs are benefiting from the dead zones , ” Altieri said .
“ That was not something that we would have predicted from the conventional wisdom on dead zones or laboratory experiments alone . ”
The quahog is an iconic symbol in Rhode Island and even nationally and is the dominant catch in the Ocean State ’s shellfish industry .
In 2007 , the quahog ’s landed value was $ 8.4 million , according to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management 's Division of Marine Fisheries .
In an odd twist , Altieri found that quahog populations declined in healthier waters .
He thinks it ’s because the predators return as oxygen levels in the water rise , and those hunters — primarily sea stars , fish and crabs — feast on the clams .
That means quahogs could fare worse if Narragansett Bay ’s waters got cleaner .
Yet Altieri is not advocating that hypoxic zones remain .
While the quahog is shown to benefit from dead zones in Narragansett Bay , it is the only marine organism he found to do so .
That means fishery managers , scientists or others could misjudge the health of a coastal ecosystem by the abundance of a particular species , while failing to see the losses of other species in that system .
“ You say we ’ve got this great fishery , what ’s the problem ?
But the ecosystem underpinning it may be hanging on the fact that one species is doing great , and the others may not be , ” Altieri said .
“ In the case of Narragansett Bay , if we lose the quahog because of further declines in water quality , disease , or some other factor , we wo n’t have another species to turn to . ”
The research was funded by the Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s National Estuarine Research Reserve System ( NERRS ) Graduate Research Fellowship , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the Lerner - Gray Grants for Marine Research through the American Museum of Natural History and the Sounds Conservancy Grants Program through the Quebec Labrador Foundation .

ELKHART , Ind . 
To understand just how grim things have gotten in this northern Indiana town , consider a new law passed last month by the City Council that limits residents to one garage sale a month .
It seems the perpetual garage sales  which for scores of people in this town are a sole source of income , and for others the only source of clothing  were annoying some residents .
The restrictions will make the financial pinch that much tighter .
“ I have no other option , ” said Todd Baker , 34 , who lost his factory job in July right before his wife gave birth to their third child .
Friday was his last permissible day to sell old children ’s clothing , muffin tins , a fake white Christmas tree , stereo speakers and dozens of household doodads out of his garage .
“ I ’ve never missed a day of work in my life , ” Mr. Baker said .
“ Man , I ’m shocked that I have to shut this down .
My neighbors are usually out here , too .
We ’ve got regulars who are in the same situation , or lost their house , and when the bank took it , they took everything that was in it .
I ’m just trying to do as much as I can because the heat bills are going to go up 25 percent this winter , too . ”

After bicycling for 152 miles in 6 hours and 23 minutes in Beijing ’s smoggy air , the gold medal was determined by a fraction of a second .
Spain ’s Samuel Sanchez willed a supreme effort to out - sprint the world ’s great riders like David Rebellin and Fabian Cancellara .
Although Sanchez could ignore pain and exhaustion during the 152 miles , he could not hold back his tears while listening to Spain ’s national anthem being played in recognition for his gold medal victory .
Fifty - seven million U.S. citizens ride a bicycle , at least , on occasion .
Over one billion globally use bicycles , famously including millions in our Olympic host nation .
For all of us “ Everyday Olympians , ” the pace is gentle as we enjoy exercise and fresh air .
For some of us , the bicycle is a practical part of our commuting and reaching other destinations .
Gary Bulmer often commutes 25 miles round trip to and from work with breathtaking rides through San Francisco and across the Golden Gate Bridge .
He is a master chef who enjoys great food , yet never gains a pound because of all his bike riding .
He and his wife Sue live in beautiful Sausalito , a community located where the Marin Headlands reach down to the Bay , and both work in San Francisco .
Nichole Cooke survived the intense Olympic bicycle race in rain that made downhill hairpin turns dangerously slippery and caused four great riders to crash .
She is proud of her first Olympic gold medal .
She is no stranger to great victories .
Paris has acclaimed her for twice winning women ’s most demanding bicycle race , La Grande Boucle Féminine ( the women ’s Tour de France ) .
Thanks to what started in Paris , 5 million Europeans in 16 cities are now members of Cyclocity ® with locations near major public transit stops , large buildings , and near major employers .
Paying an average of thirty euros per year , members do not need to own a bike .
They simply use a bike for less than 30 minutes without paying a premium .
Members use their smart cards to unlock a city bike at a transit center , ride one way to the Cyclocity ® bike rack nearest their destination and lock the bike .
The same bike is used by various members for up to 50 times per day .
Our nation ’s capital , the District of Columbia , is starting with 10 stations and 120 bikes .
But D.C. officials are eager to expand it quickly if the response is good .
Proponents say the program easily could be expanded to more than 1,000 bikes at more than 100 stations within a year .

This Week in HTML 5 – Episode 5
Welcome back to " This Week in HTML 5 , " where I 'll try to summarize the major activity in the ongoing standards process in the WHATWG and W3C HTML Working Group .
The big news this week is the merging of the Web Forms 2 specification into the HTML 5 specification , and updating it with the collected feedback of the last two years .
form [ r2142 ]
[ r2142 ] fieldset [ r2143 ]
[ r2143 ] input [ r2144 ]
[ r2144 ] button [ r2145 ]
[ r2145 ] label [ r2146 ]
[ r2146 ] select [ r2148 ]
[ r2148 ] datalist [ r2150 ]
[ r2150 ] optgroup [ r2151 ]
[ r2151 ] option [ r2152 ]
[ r2152 ] textarea [ r2153 ]
[ r2153 ] output [ r2154 ]
[ r2154 ]
The form attribute on various elements , which associates an element with its parent form , and the elements attribute of the form element , which associates the form with its elements .
( Form - associated elements no longer need to be children of the < form > element itself within the DOM , so explicit association is required .
Form - associated elements that are DOM children of the < form > element are implicitly associated , so your existing markup will continue to work the way you think it does . ) [ r 2157 ]
Meanwhile , revisions 2160 , 2161 , 2163 , 2164 , and 2165 begin the long , hard process of defining when and how a form is submitted .
This is one of those things that " everybody knows " but nobody has actually , you know , documented .
For example , do you submit a form when you toggle a checkbox ?
Of course not , " everybody knows " that .
Is an unchecked checkbox included in the form data when it is submitted ?
No , " everybody knows " that too .
How do you submit to an ftp:// URL ?
A mailto:// URL ?
A data:// URL ?
What are the three values of the enctype attribute , and how do they affect the form data when it is submitted to a data :// URL with the PUT method ? 1 Umm ...
How exactly do you construct the names of the X and Y coordinates to submit a server - side image map ?
( By the way , server - side image maps are inaccessible , so do n't use them unless you provide an accessible fallback form with equivalent functionality . )
Web Forms 2 ( and now HTML 5 ) will tell you .
Another interesting set of changes revolves around character encoding .
If you do n't know anything about character encoding , I would strongly recommend Joel Spolsky 's The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely , Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets ( No Excuses ! )
Tim Bray 's three - part series , On the Goodness of Unicode , On Character Strings , and Characters vs. Bytes , and anything written by Martin Dürst .
Now then : r2125 warns against using EBCDIC on public - facing web pages .
For those of you under 30 , EBCDIC is a character encoding invented by IBM in the 1960s for their System / 360 mainframe .
On non-IBM hardware , EBCDIC lost the encoding war to ASCII , and later Unicode , and it is rarely seen on the public web .
r2131 says that browsers should ignore an out - of - band encoding definition that they do not support .
For example , if a web page is served with an HTTP Content - Type header with a charset parameter that defines a character encoding the browser does not support , the browser should ignore it and continue the process of determining the character encoding by other means .
And finally , r2137 says that browsers should treat US - ASCII as Windows - 1252 when determining character encoding .
As the HTML 5 specification notes , " The requirement to treat certain encodings as other encodings according to the table above is a willful violation of the W3C Character Model specification . "
Other interesting changes this week :
r2122 makes it non-conforming to have empty unquoted attribute values like < input value= >
r2130 provides a special case for the definitionURL attribute for those embedding MathML in HTML .
attribute for those embedding MathML in .
r2140 and r2141 allow a legacy DOCTYPE if and only if the HTML page is the result of an XSLT transform .
The exact DOCTYPE string is <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ' XSLT - compat '>
Tune in next week for another exciting episode of " This Week in HTML 5 . "

Investigator : Palin probe to end before election RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 19 , 2008
Print This Email This McCain - Palin camp is seeking to delay investigation until after election
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( The Associated Press ) - The Alaska lawmaker directing an abuse - of - power investigation of Gov. Sarah Palin promised Friday the probe will be finished before the election , despite refusals by key witnesses to testify , including the governor 's husband .
After waiting 35 minutes for Todd Palin and two state administrative employees to appear under subpoena before the state Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen .
Hollis French condemned their refusal to testify and the attorney general 's broken promise that seven other witnesses would testify who were not subpoenaed .
French said the retired prosecutor hired by the Alaska Legislature to investigate Palin , Stephen Branchflower , will conclude his investigation by Oct. 10 .
Still , that report will not include testimony from the Republican vice presidential nominee , her husband or most of the top aides Branchflower hoped to interview .
Sarah Palin 's allies hoped the investigation would be delayed past the election to spare her any troublesome revelations  or at least the distraction  before voters have made their choice .
Palin 's reputation as clean - government advocate who takes on entrenched interests is central to her appeal as Republican John McCain 's running mate , and possibly at risk in the probe .

Perhaps this will shine an unflattering light on my psyche .
But , like many of you , I have a busy schedule , with lots of work obligations and meetings .
I also end up doing a decent number of panel discussions and speeches , though I try hard to keep those to a minimum .
And like everyone , sometimes I get tired or overwhelmed and I wish I could get out of this or that responsibility .
Occasionally in these moments , in a perverse kind of private entertainment , I ’ve found myself imagining what would happen if I pawned off on someone just the ballsiest , most inane excuse for flaking on some commitment .
And not something that people might buy — nothing entertaining about that — but just something completely off the wall and nonsensical .
What would people ’s reaction be ?
Speechless , laughter , tearing me limb from limb ?
Would they ever speak to me again ?
So , let ’s see , I ca n’t moderate the panel because I ’ve been called to Washington to give a special briefing on guerilla tactics to be used against the Taliban ?
Or maybe , I want to be at the meeting , but as weird as this sounds , all the bridges and tunnels out of Manhattan have been shut for the day .
Some counter - terrorism thing probably .
I tried renting a helicopter but they ’re all booked by people at the UN .
Is n’t this pretty much what John McCain tried to pull today ?
But actually really did it ?
And on a national stage ?
He wants to cancel the debate ?
And maybe also Palin ’s debate .
Are you kidding ?
Why not cancel the election too ?
And because he has to go back to DC to solve the financial crisis ?
Really ?
The topic he knows nothing about and after he ’s shown up less in the senate in the last two years than anyone but Tim Johnson , the guy who had the stroke ?
Which of my employees is going to call from home tomorrow and say they can’t come to work because of the financial crisis ?
One of the advantages of running a presidential campaign is that roughly half the country is deeply committed to believing or at least saying that virtually anything you do or say makes sense .
And so it is here .
But , look , if you were living in the real world , if you were some hotshot young executive at a Fortune 500 company trying to rise in the ranks , and you pulled some whacked crap like this , it would probably get you blackballed permanently .
People would think you were either deeply unreliable or maybe just had a screw loose .
And yet here he is — is he kidding ?
He ca n’t debate Barack Obama because he ’s got to go to Washington and save the economy ?
It ’s like the biggest ‘ dog ate my homework ’ in history .
Even though attendance was a bit sparse during this year 's LinuxWorld Conference & Expo when compared to previous years , the Canonical booth -- where the latest Ubuntu Linux software was being shown off -- still managed to draw a crowd .
Each Ubuntu presentation and training session throughout the three days of LinuxWorld was heavily attended , especially compared to similar sessions elsewhere where relatively few attended .
Ubuntu and Linux in general have , Canonical representatives claimed , have finally matured as a technology , rendering the need for an extravagant technology show no longer necessary .

Branching away from regular Ubuntu , there now is Ubuntu Server Edition Kubuntu , Xubuntu , Mythbuntu , Edubuntu , and Ubuntu Mobile Edition , with further permutations likely .
Ubuntu had a hectic week during LinuxWorld , with several different partnership announcements throughout the week .
The biggest Ubuntu announcement was its deal with IBM , announced during day one .
Ubuntu signed an agreement with IBM so the two companies can work together to try and move the consumer industry more towards a " Microsoft - free world . "
The Open Collaboration Client Solution -- consisting of Lotus Symphony , Lotus Notes , and Lotus Sametime -- can now be used with Ubuntu , Red Hat , and Novell SUSE Linux distributions .
Trying to get the IBM - supported software running in Ubuntu before the announcement oftentimes proved to be a headache , while OpenOffice and Abiword are both free and easy to install in Ubuntu .
Canonical will distribute Lotus Symphony through its
Web services before the end of August , the company said during LinuxWorld .
Later , Canonical announced a partnership with Alfresco Software , who makes the Alfresco Labs 3 content management platform .
Ubuntu will implement a pre-built version of Alfresco Labs 3 in its software repository .
Ubuntu also is working with Unison , which provides telephony , e-mail , and instant messaging in a single server platform .
The Unison client previously only operated on Windows - based machines , but the provider has ecently released a Linux client public beta version .
Finally , the Yahoo Zimbra Desktop will also be introduced into the Ubuntu Partner Repository , so Ubuntu users will have facst access to Yahoo Mail , Gmail , AOL mail and other e-mail accounts that are IMAP or POP enabled .
Ubuntu distributed its two latest editions , version 8.04.1 LTS ( Hardy Heron ) and Kubuntu 8.04 .
Hardy Heron has been the most popular Ubuntu release to date , with the Wubi Windows - based installer a welcome addition .
Wubi is able to install Ubuntu on the same partition used by Windows , without actually partitioning or formatting it .
Canonical is the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu , which owns the Ubuntu brand and offers paid commercial support to users .
Although fall means the end of summer ’s abundance of produce , the end - of - season crops are nothing to sneeze at .
Butternut squash , with its earthy sweetness and versatility , can be used in both sweet and savory dishes .
I whipped up this simple , hearty soup from local squash , then froze the extra for quick lunches throughout the season .
What makes this soup extra special is its creamy sweetness and vanilla flavor ; it ’s practically a dessert soup .
You can alter the sugar to taste , but I like the hint of sweetness that the small amount listed here provides .
Roasting the squash imparts a deeper , richer flavor as well .
The recipe , after the jump …
Butternut - Vanilla Bean Soup
2 2 - 3 lb butternut squash
2 T extra virgin olive oil
4 C vegetable stock
1 - 2 T sugar , to taste
1/2 C cream
1 vanilla bean
salt & pepper
1. Preheat oven to 400° F .
2 . Cut squash in half , lengthwise .
Drizzle halves with olive oil , then season with salt and pepper .
Bake on baking sheet for 35 - 45 minutes , until fork tender .
Remove from oven and let cool .
3 . Remove seeds ( set aside–then clean , dry , roast with olive oil and salt for a tasty snack ) .
Remove flesh from skins .
4 . In food processor or blender , blend squash flesh , stock , sugar , and scraped insides of vanilla bean .
5. Taste and adjust seasonings .
Blend in cream .
6 . Bring to desired temperature in saucepan over medium low heat .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California ’s sputtering economy is going to get worse , a report released on Wednesday said .
A home that has been foreclosed and repossessed by the bank is put up for sale in Burbank , California July 20 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
The state ’s jobless rate will hold above 7 percent through next year as the homes slump grinds on and finance payrolls shrink , according to the UCLA Anderson Forecast .
A “ strong undercurrent of housing and finance generated weakness ” is dragging down growth in the eighth - largest economy in the world , the report said .
“ Our near term quarterly forecast has things getting worse , ” it said .
“ Unemployment will continue to increase to the thin air of 7.4 percent by the end of the year and it will stay in that neighborhood for each quarter in 2009 , ” the report added .
The diversified economies of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas had been offsetting the drag of the housing downturn in many other parts of the state .
During the housing boom earlier this decade , the Golden State ’s housing prices skyrocketed , fueled in many areas by risky mortgages responsible for the current foreclosure surge .
Home prices in the California have been falling from their peaks , putting new home developments across the state on hold .
Home building ’s woes combined with worse - than - expected job losses in mortgage financing over the last three months “ have finally overwhelmed other sectors of the economy , ” the UCLA Anderson Forecast report said .
As a result , employers have pared hiring plans and the unemployment outlook for most populous U.S. state is “ ugly , ” the report said .
AFFORDABLE HOUSES ?
Home prices are falling to affordable levels in many areas , suggesting buyers will step into the housing market and help stabilize it , which should help lift home - building and finance , the report said .
New home buyers will enter the market by the middle of next year provided the existing inventory of unsold homes in California shrinks significantly and new mortgage money becomes available , the report said .
Until then it will be slow going .
“ Basically , the California economy will muddle along the balance of this year and next , ” the report added .
Growing a beard is as easy as 1 , 2 , 3 .
Our guide to growing a beard will help get you through the beard - growing process by teaching you how to grow your beard the right way .
Join the thousands of men around the world who have successfully grown their beards using this beard - growing guide .
While growing a beard really is easy , many would - be beard growers give up their efforts in frustration by falling into the trap of common mistakes and abandoning their newly - started beards too quickly .
The all about beards guide to growing a beard presents a tried and true method that will help you steer clear of beard - growing pitfalls and give you the confidence and determination to lead you to beard - growing success .
1. Commit to growing a beard
Growing a beard requires a commitment .
The experience can even be a test of character as well as a surprising process of self - discovery .
Do you have what it takes ?
Why grow a beard ?
Logically , the question ought to be : Why NOT grow a beard ?
But shaving is the norm and letting the beard grow is the exception .
So , it may require a bit of courage to take the decision to grow a beard .
Once that decision is taken , it is easily reversed upon second thought .
And another would - be beard disappears .
When you see a man with a full - grown beard , you know he made the decision to be bearded and he had the determination to stick with it .
Whether or not you should grow a beard depends in large part on genetics .
Beard growth is genetically determined and there is not much anyone can do other than to accept what they ’ve been given .
If you have developed enough facial hair to allow you to grow a beard , then you owe it to yourself to grow it out at least once during your lifetime — even if only as an experiment .
You may be so pleased with the results , even unexpectedly so , that you decide to keep the beard permanently .
Most importantly , the decision to grow , and subsequently keep , your beard is yours .
The only opinion that really matters is yours .
So , go for it !
If you like it , keep it .
If not , then shave it off .
At the very least you will have given it a try and you ’ll know what it was like to grow your beard .

It features several of the most frequent reasons cited by beard survey participants .
Make a commitment to grow your beard and stick with it .
This is most important !
2. Stop shaving and start growing
Consider starting your beard while on vacation .
You ’ll be more relaxed about it while away from your job .
Do n’t be overly concerned about other people ’s potential reactions to your new beard .
If you have a good beard , most people will probably react favorably , possibly much more favorably than you would have ever anticipated .
So relax and enjoy the experience .

If you have a good beard , people will probably react favorably , possibly much more favorably than you would have ever anticipated .
So relax and enjoy the experience .
When starting to let your beard grow , just stop shaving — completely .
Do not shave at all for at least the first four weeks of growth .
One of the most common errors is to attempt to start shaping or sculpting the beard too early in the process .
Even if you are just planning to grow a “ Van Dyke ” or goatee , you should let everything grow for the first four weeks .
WHY let your beard grow for four weeks before you start to shape it — even if you are just growing a goatee ?
If you do n’t wait , you might cut off more than you really wanted .
Also , you might not have thought about going for the striking effect of an oversized goatee .
You can always trim it down to a smaller size later .

After four weeks , you can start shaping the beard .
Usually , you ’ll want to define a “ neck line ” along the bottom of your beard around the neck .
This is probably best done by a professional barber or stylist .
The hard part may be finding one who has a lot of experience in beard styling .
To create proper neck and cheek lines for your beard , be sure to see : Designing a neck line for your full beard Choosing a cheek line for your full beard
Generally the “ cheek line ” , the upper limit of the beard on the cheeks , is best left natural .
Some men butcher otherwise excellent beards by shaving the cheeks into strange shapes .
Unless your beard appears to be starting just below your eyes , you probably are better off not shaving or sculpting the beard on your cheeks .
If you mess up your new beard ’s neck line or cheek line , do n’t give up !
Instead , see :
Repairing a neck line or cheek line for your full beard
Do n’t let itching deter you !
If you experience itching , keep your skin clean by daily shampooing ( with a gentle shampoo ) and optionally using a conditioner .
Your skin will eventually adjust to the new situation .
Itching should be only a temporary phase .
If you happen to need more relief , try applying some baby oil or moisturizing lotion to the areas that are itching .
That should help to soothe your skin while you go through the transition .

If you happen to need more relief , try applying some baby oil or moisturizing lotion to the areas that are itching .
That should help to soothe your skin while you go through the transition .
Do n’t give up !
Set a target date .
For example , give yourself a minimum of six weeks ’ growth before deciding to abandon your beard - growing effort .
Commit to not shaving before that six weeks is up .
When you ’ve reached the six weeks date , then you can decide whether you want to continue with the beard or get rid of it .
3. Maintain your beard
Invest in a beard trimmer and
learn how to use it .
learn how to use it .
Usually you should shampoo your beard with the same shampoo you already use for your head .
Some may prefer to wash their beards with soap instead .
You could try out soap and shampoo to see which you like best .
Pat your beard gently dry with a towel .
Blow drying is not usually necessary and is probably not recommended anyway .
If you choose to get rid of your new beard , the easiest way to dispose of it is to use a beard trimmer or other hair clippers .
Use the trimmer or clippers to trim away as much hair as possible .
Follow that with a regular shave .
Be extra careful .

Saturday morning my sister , Monica Bicking , and her boyfriend , Eryn Trimmer , were arrested in Minneapolis .
Monica was released on Sunday , but Eryn and others are still in custody , and the police will try to keep them detained as long as possible .
update : the two of them and six others from the Welcoming Committee are charged with felonies , including “ furtherance of terrorism ” .
A website has been set up in support of them , and to keep people informed about ongoing events in the case : rnc8.org
They were arrested for “ conspiracy to incite a riot ” .
This is the same charge used against the Chicago 8 ( or 7 ) at the 1968 Democratic Convention .
Perhaps the police have a sense of tradition ?
But more directly she and Eryn were arrested in an attempt to preemptively suppress the protests at the Republican National Convention .
They were both very active with the RNC Welcoming Committee , which is a group coordinating and supporting some of the people coming to the Twin Cities for the convention .
Obviously I ’m very concerned by the arrests and charges .
But there ’s been a huge outpouring of support from the community — both from activist in the Twin Cities , and from their neighbors .
In Chicago I ’m a little unsure about what to do .
Reading articles about the incidents ( Glenn Greenwald ’s post on Salon is a good one ) I find myself mostly avoiding the comment sections .
The comments fall into two categories : mean comments against the protesters , and reactionary comments with no real substance ( “ this is proof this country is a police state ! ” )
Activists generally understand what ’s going on , and people of a right - wing / authoritarian bend are hardly going to be convinced of anything , but there ’s a lot of progressive people out there who ’ve never really been involved in any activism like this .
There ’s very little explaining the protests , the role of activists like my sister , and the philosophies they hold .
Certainly the news makes no attempt , and unfortunately the activists themselves often speak from an unexplained perspective .
So I ’d like to use this as an opportunity to explain my understanding of the role of protest , what ’s going on at the RNC specifically , and what an “ anarchist ” really is .
At the moment I ca n’t do a lot to help Eryn and Monica directly , but at least I can talk about her personally instead of another story about a named but otherwise anonymous “ protester ” .
The Role Of Protest
It ’s challenging to explain and justify protest , at least in this country and at this moment .
Probably the biggest blow for protest as a useful form of political expression was the February 15 , 2003 protests against the Iraq War .
I say this because those were the largest protests the world has ever seen , estimated around 10 million people , and yet they did so little to stop the war .
That war is still with us , and is still the most significant motivation for the RNC protests .
The war has gone through many phases since then — purported success , then clear failure by just about anyone ’s definition , then ongoing failure labelled as success because of dramatically lowered expectations ( the surge ) .
Public opinion has moved several times , but is constrained by what is considered the reasonable options .
These “ reasonable ” options are defined by the Democratic and Republican elite .
Balance in news means inviting participation from partisans from those two parties .
In this context the Democratic party had a practical landslide in 2006 , driven primarily by anti-war sentiments , and then proceeded to do almost nothing to stop the war .
If protest has failed , then so has electoral politics .
I do n’t have any third path to offer , but I just want to make it clear : none of us know what is best to do , none of us have figured out the way to effect change .
People complain protest does n’t work .
Maybe it does , maybe it does n’t , but frankly most things do n’t work .
Doing nothing definitely does n’t work , and frankly that ’s what most of us are doing .
It ’s hard to take criticisms seriously when they are made from a stance of inaction .
What might the RNC protests accomplish ?
First , it is an attempt to break out of a politics restricted to two perspectives .
I believe , quite firmly , that “ radical left ” opinions are actually quite mainstream .
This was also the goal of the DNC protests .
This goal has become quite difficult to achieve .
News stations generally ignore protest , and when they do cover protest they seldom talk about the actual issues .
Second , protests can attempt to disrupt normal activity .
To be fair , this is probably better termed “ civil disobedience ” , and I ’m sure there will be civil disobedience in response to the RNC .
One possible goal of civil disobedience is to make news — to be so disruptive that you simply ca n’t be ignored .
And even if the news wo n’t say why you wo n’t be ignored , at least one message that can be made clear : everything is not okay .
Another goals is simply to disrupt the RNC .
This is a bringing together of many of the architects and profiteers of war .
This is a convention that includes many people advocating torture .
It ’s also a convention of people who buy the lines about the Republican party being “ conservative ” and supporting “ family values ” and whatever other bullshit .
One argument goes : oh , these poor dullards and simpletons !
Do not interrupt their harmless partying !
Do not interrupt their absurd views !
They deserve their delusions as much as anyone !
I say : this stuff is too important to defer to the bullshit of this political grandstanding .
Are We In A Time Of War ?
It is all too easy to fall into “ protesting for the right to protest ” .
Lest I fall into this , I want to make it clear : protest itself is not the goal .
600,000 Iraqis dead .
And to what ends ?
No ends at all ?
Unlikely !
There is a purpose .
It is a purpose architected by people who would throw away hundreds of thousands of lives .
People may argue about whether war is valid .
I do n’t believe it is , nor do Monica or Eryn , but whatever your feelings : this is not an abstract war .
This is a specific war .
And this specific war is a war made by liars , by people who treat human life lightly , by people whose primary ambition seems focused on power itself .
600,000 dead , and what ’s so different in America ?
Do you feel this war ?
If you did n’t turn on the TV or listen to the news , what would remind you that we are at war ?
What would remind you of all that ’s happened ?
We are a nation at war , and yet there is nothing to show us this , it has no presence .
Our nation is so large , our institutions so abstracted , our military so partitioned from most of society … we are numb to war .
Moving around while numbed is dangerous .
You ca n’t feel what you are doing .
A cut does n’t hurt , a bruise is just a faint sensation .
We are a numbed nation and this is dangerous .
If I was to give one reason for civil disobedience , it would be this : to acknowledge this war is real .
This is n’t just a difference of opinion , this is n’t just a debate .
This is about how we exercise our collective power , the power that is exercised in the form of the state .
This is our war , whether we feel it or not .
One of the criticisms of civil disobedience is to say it deprives the Republicans of their free speech .
First , this is absurd .
No form of civil disobedience deprives them of free speech .
No one is taping their mouths shut .
No journalists are being detained by activists .
No debate is stifled .
The RNC ’s request : we want to speak our lies without interruption , without distraction .
The Republicans have through decades of whining managed to frame the debate , to redefine “ common sense ” and “ conventional thinking ” , to move the Overton Window far to the right .
Free speech does not mean they should not be challenged .
Protest challenges the content of their speech , it does n’t deny them of the ability to speak .
This is an aside , but for all the effort put into limiting the bounds of debate I do n’t think the Republicans , or Bush , have really changed the country as much as they are given credit for .
I do n’t think people are as easily manipulated as that .
I think our core values are not so easily affected .
If we were not so numb I think it would all come rushing back .
On “ Anarchism ”
If you read the articles you will see Monica and Eryn called “ self - described anarchists ” .
This is true , they are anarchists .
I will attempt , briefly and probably inaccurately , to describe what anarchism is .
Anarchism is , at its core , a belief in the individual , and a belief that good flows uniquely from the individual .
Conversely , it believes that bad comes from institutions , from the abstractions we build between people .
Anarchism is a belief in the power of empathy instead of laws .
Instead of leading our lives according to principles that are passed down to us , anarchism says we should live our lives based on our personal reflections and decisions .
We should be deliberate , we should not be obedient .
The RNC Welcoming Committee ( the name is ironic ) is a “ anarchist / anti-authoritarian ” organization .
Ha ha you say , is n’t an anarchist organization an oxymoron ?
If you meet an anarchist this is the most tedious joke you could possibly make .
Anarchism is , of course , a somewhat chaotic philosophy .
And any anarchist should be a human first , and an anarchist second — anything else would be contrary to the very principles of anarchism !
More practically , they form groups based on shared understandings and motivations , and there is nothing at all inconsistent about individuals working together — indeed it is interpersonal cooperation that is at the heart of anarchist traditions .
Do anarchists want to tear down all institutions ?
I guess some flavors of anarchist rhetoric make this claim .
Looking in from the outside , it feels like some kind of phase adolescent male anarchists go through .
There is an underlying lack of respect for institutions and authority , and this is genuine .
But though they see nothing wrong with disrupting institutions , violence against people is not considered acceptable .
Some would like to categorize property damage as violence , but I find this rather disrespectful of genuine violence .
Things do n’t feel pain or fear .
Discussions of anarchism tend to degrade very quickly because people are overly obsessed with self - consistency .
For instance : how could an entire society run without laws , governments , police , taxes ?
There are answers and speculations , but we would all do better to make the world we want now and here .
This is what actual anarchists do — running whole societies might be fun to theorize about , but building a community is actually attainable , and among progressive groups anarchists are probably the most enthusiastic community builders .
Lastly : why the term “ anarchism ” ?
It ’s a scary term , though it ’s derivation is simply from the term “ without rulers ” .
It ’s been a term used to scare people for so long that it ’s hard to separate the idea from the myth .
People at time suggest alternative terms .
But anarchism is n’t just a philosophy , it ’s a tradition and culture and shared understanding , one that goes back over a hundred years .
And anarchists do n’t want to disassociate themselves from that tradition .
And usually , what does it matter what other people think of the name ?
It is however awkward when the police are trying to label you as a dangerous extremist .
Violence ?
Reports have come out about violent protest .
Update :
There were reports of “ violent protesters ” .
Now police report that “ one or two windows were broken ” during the entire RNC .
In other words , there was almost no violence at all by protesters , and almost no property damage .
Frankly I feel stupid for ever believing there were even small groups of “ violent protesters ” .
There was simply no violence ( under any definition of “ violence ” ) of any note by the protesters .
( I ’m actually surprised there were n’t more windows broken by stray police munitions . )
Again police lack basic credibility in their statements .
end update Actual incidents are often exaggerated or fabricated .
For instance , in the case of the home raids things like paint , bottles , and rags were labeled as “ the ingredients for making Molotov cocktails ” .
I ’m sure every reader of this post has sufficient ingredients to make a Molotov cocktail .
Also , many people have hatchets , bricks , and other materials .
Buckets of urine were particularly attention - grabbing , but the only reason for these was that one of the houses had a broken toilet .
The police interpretation of the confiscated material is not credible .
There have also been reports of violence at the protests themselves .
First it should be noted that there are no reports of police or bystanders being injured .
I personally find it is hard to classify property damage as “ violence ” .
If you do n’t include property damage then there does n’t seem to be much evidence of violence .
Protest is confrontational .
Some will suggest that protesters should obey police in all situations .
They suggest that protesters should obey all laws and only protest where permitted .
They suggest protesters should not be disruptive of anyone else .
The result would not be protest .
In cases like the RNC , where extensive planning was in place to counter protest , non-confrontational protest means protesting according to someone else ’s plans , someone who has no desire for the protest to succeed in any way .
Once you confront the police , there will be violence — usually by the police .
And sure , you can stand with a flower in your hand and get a face full of pepper spray , and of course many people choose that course .
It ’s a noble choice , but I ca n’t fault people for making other tactical decisions .
Another protesting tactic is the “ black bloq ” , typically a group of people who try to attract the attention of the police , often through property damage .
If the police have nothing better to do , then why not pin down the peaceful protesters and direct them where they can make the least impact ?
People in the black bloq will try to keep this from happening .
It ’s unlikely they were at all successful at the RNC as it was so thoroughly militarized .
You could debate whether this is a good strategy ( and there is lots of debate about this ) , but probably few people outside activists have any idea that there even is any underlying strategy .
Also , if you wonder why protesters , especially the anarchists , dress the way they do , it is primarily defensive .
If you are going to get teargassed and peppersprayed does wearing a handkerchief seem so odd ?
And if they are tracking people to preemptively arrest , all the more reason to be as anonymous as possible .

Neighborhood Effect
Decisions like those suggest that what some economists call a neighborhood effect  putting factories closer to components suppliers and to consumers , to reduce transportation costs  could grow in importance if oil remains expensive .
A barrel sold for $ 125 on Friday , compared with lows of $ 10 a decade ago .
“ If prices stay at these levels , that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production , among sectors and countries , ” said C. Fred Bergsten , author of “ The United States and the World Economy ” and director of the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics , in Washington .
“ You could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects . ”
The cost of shipping a 40 - foot container from Shanghai to the United States has risen to $ 8,000 , compared with $ 3,000 early in the decade , according to a recent study of transportation costs .
Big container ships , the pack mules of the 21st - century economy , have shaved their top speed by nearly 20 percent to save on fuel costs , substantially slowing shipping times .
The study , published in May by the Canadian investment bank CIBC World Markets , calculates that the recent surge in shipping costs is on average the equivalent of a 9 percent tariff on trade .
“ The cost of moving goods , not the cost of tariffs , is the largest barrier to global trade today , ” the report concluded , and as a result “ has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades . ”
The spike in shipping costs comes at a moment when concern about the environmental impact of globalization is also growing .
Many companies have in recent years shifted production from countries with greater energy efficiency and more rigorous standards on carbon emissions , especially in Europe , to those that are more lax , like China and India .
But if the international community fulfills its pledge to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change , even China and India would have to reduce the growth of their emissions , and the relative costs of production in countries that use energy inefficiently could grow .
In the Public Interest : Congressional Backbone Needed
In the Public Interest
Congressional Backbone Needed
by Ralph Nader
Congress needs to show some backbone before the federal government pours more money on the financial bonfire started by the arsonists on Wall Street .
Congress should hold a series of hearings and invite broad public comment on any proposed bailout .
Congress is supposed to be a co-equal branch of our federal government .
It needs to stop the stampede to give Bush a $ 700 billion check .
Public hearings should be held to determine what alternatives might exist to the four - page proposal advanced by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson .
Whatever is ultimately done , the bailout plan should not be insulated from judicial review .
Remember there is a third co-equal branch of government : the judiciary .
The judiciary does not need to review each buy - and - sell decision by the Treasury Department , but there should be some boundaries established to the Treasury Department ’s discretion .
Judicial review is needed to ensure that unbridled discretion is not abused .
Sunlight is a good disinfectant .
The bailout that is ultimately approved must provide for full and timely disclosure of all bailout details .
This will discourage conflicts of interest and limit the potential of sweetheart deals .
Firms that accept government bailout monies must agree to disclose their transactions and be more honest in their accounting .
They should agree to end off - the - books accounting maneuvers , for example .
Taxpayers must be protected by having a stake in any recovery .
The bailout plan should provide opportunities for taxpayers to recoup funds that are made available to problem financial institutions , or to benefit from the financial institutions ’ rising stock price and increased profitability after being bailed out .
The current so - called " regulators " cannot be trusted .
The U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , “ the investigative arm of Congress ” and “ the congressional watchdog , " must regularly review the bailout .
We cannot trust the financial " regulators , " who allowed the slide into financial disaster , to manage the bailout without outside monitoring .
It is time to put the federal cop back on the financial services beat .
Strong financial regulations and independent regulators are necessary to rebuild trust in our financial institutions and to prevent further squandering of our tax dollars .
The Justice Department and the SEC also need to scrutinize the expanding mess with an eye to uncovering corporate crime and misdeeds .
Major news outlets are reporting that the FBI is investigating American International Group , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Lehman Brothers .
Cap executive compensation and stop giving the Wall Street gamblers golden parachutes .
The CEOs who have created the financial disaster should not be allowed to leave with millions in hand when so many pensioners and small shareholders are seeing their investments evaporate .
The taxpayers are bailing out Wall Street so that the financial system continues to function , not to further enrich the CEOs and executives who created this mess .
Congress should pass the Financial Consumers ’ Information and Representation Act , to permit citizens to form a federally - chartered nonprofit membership organization to strengthen consumer representation in government proceedings that concern the financial services industry .
As the savings and loan disasters of the 1980s and the Wall Street debacles of the last few years have demonstrated , there is an overriding need for consumers and taxpayers to have the organized means to enhance their influence on financial issues .
The repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , separating traditional banks from investment banks , helped pave the way for the current disaster .
It is time to re-regulate the financial sector .
The current crisis is also leading to even further conglomeration and concentration in the financial sector .
We must revive and apply antitrust principles , so that banking consumers can benefit from competition and taxpayers are less vulnerable to too - big - to - fail institutions , which merge with each other to further concentration .
Congress should impose a securities and derivatives speculation tax .
A tax on financial trading would slow down the churning of stocks and financial instruments , and could raise substantial monies to pay for the bailout .
Regulators should impose greater margin requirements , making speculators use more of their own money and diminishing reckless casino capitalism .
Ask your representative a few questions : “ What should be done to limit banking institutions from investing in high - risk activities ? "
" What should be done to ensure banks are meeting proper capital standards given the financial quicksand that has spread as a result of the former Senator Phil Gramm ’s deregulation efforts ? "
And , " What is being done to protect small investors ? "
P.S. Shareholders also have some work to do .
They should have listened when Warren Buffett called securities derivatives a “ time bomb ” and “ financial weapons of mass destruction . "
The Wall Street crooks and unscrupulous speculators use and draining of " other people ’s money " out of pension funds and mutual funds should motivate painfully passive shareholders to organize to gain greater authority to control the companies they own .

Updated | 11:43 p.m.
And the Number Is …
How much does the United States owe China ?
Senator John McCain got it right , Senator Barack Obama was wrong .
“ We owe China $ 500 billion , ” Mr. McCain said early in the debate .
Near the end , Mr. Obama noted the challenges the United States faces with China and added , “ they now hold a trillion dollars ’ worth of our debt . ”
According to the most recent data from the Treasury Department , through July , China holds $ 518 billion in U.S. Treasury securities .
How High ?
Senator John McCain said tonight that U.S. businesses pay “ the second highest business taxes in the world , 35 percent .
Ireland pays 11 percent . ”
While 35 percent is the corporate income tax rate , few if any corporations pay that rate given tax breaks available to them .
The effective tax rate is closer to 20 percent .
Senator Barack Obama , in response , said Mr. McCain is “ absolutely right ” that business taxes are high “ on paper . ”
He added : “ Here ’s the problem ­there are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code , oftentimes with the support of Senator McCain , that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world . ”
Mr. Obama has proposed closing business tax loopholes , though he has n’t identified many specifically .
Earmarks :
Senator John McCain plunged into the debate with a strong attack based on one of his signature issues , the requests by members of Congress for funding for pet projects that would benefit their home districts or states , also known as earmarks .
Mr. McCain charged that Mr. Obama “ has asked for $ 932 million of earmark pork - barrel spending , nearly a million dollars for every day that he ’s been in the United States Senate . ”
Parts of that statement are true , but others are not , and other remarks Mr. McCain made about the subject Friday night were also incorrect .
According to the calculations of fiscal watchdog groups , Mr. Obama has indeed requested that amount of funding since entering the Senate in 2005 .
But some of the same groups make a distinction between “ pork - barrel ” projects that they deem inherently wasteful , such as the now - famous “ Bridge to Nowhere ” in Alaska , and those projects that may have a useful purpose but which are obtained through legislative guile .
In addition , Mr. McCain erred when he said that earmarks have “ tripled in the last five years . ”
Earmarks tripled in size over the decade between 1996 and 2005 .
But since then , they have actually declined , from nearly 14,000 projects worth $ 18.9 billion in fiscal 2005 to just over 11,500 projects valued at $ 16.5 billion for the fiscal year ending next week .
Finally , earmarks are , as Mr. Obama indicated , a tiny part of the federal government ’s overall budget and deficit .
For fiscal year 2008 , President Bush asked Congress to authorize $ 2.9 trillion in spending , which meant a total deficit of about $ 240 billion .
That means that even if all earmarks were eliminated , it would reduce the federal deficit for the year by less than seven percent .
What Would Henry Do ?
One of the most vigorous exchanges of the evening occurred over what exactly former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said recently about negotiating with Iran .
Mr. Obama cited Mr. Kissinger ’s comments to bolster his defense of his earlier statement at a Democratic debate that he would be willing to sit down with the leaders of nations like Iran , Venezuela and Syria without preconditions .
“ Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger , who is one of his advisers , who along with five recent secretaries just said that we should meet with Iran , guess what , without preconditions , ” said Mr. Obama .
“ This is one of your own advisers . ”
Mr. McCain pushed back forcefully , saying he knew Mr. Kissinger well and insisting that Mr. Kissinger would not approve of “ face to face meetings ” between the president and Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad but lower level negotiations .
Mr. Obama was referring to comments made by Mr. Kissinger at a forum last week at George Washington University with several other former secretaries of state– Warren Christopher , Madeleine Albright , James Baker and Colin Powell .
CNN broadcaster Christiane Amanpour asked them a hypothetical , whether a message came from Iran that they were ready to negotiate , “ all conditions on the table .
Is the advice to the next American president to once again put conditions to expect Iran to cry uncle or to engage ? ”
All of them said they would engage , with Mr. Kissinger arguing :
“ Well , I am in favor of negotiating with Iran .
And one utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East , of a stable Middle East , and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it . ”
But then Mr. Kissinger added , “ I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level , ” before he trailed off .
When another CNN broadcaster , Frank Sesno , followed up , whether it should be “ put at a very high level right out of the box , ” Mr. Kissinger said , “ Initially , yes . ”
He added : “ I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations . ”
In other words , it appears that both men were right to a certain extent .
Mr. Kissinger did not specify presidential - level talks , but the thrust of his comments appear consistent with what Mr. Obama has been arguing as well , insisting that his comments did not mean that he would sit down with the leader of one of these countries without any preparations , including lower level discussions .
After the debate , however , Mr. Kissinger issued a statement to the Weekly Standard backing Mr. McCain : “ Senator McCain is right .
I would not recommend the next president of the United States engage in talks with Iran at the Presidential level .
My views on this issue are entirely compatible with the views of my friend Senator John McCain .
We do not agree on everything , but we do agree that any negotiations with Iran must be geared to reality . ”
Most Liberal ?
According to Mr. McCain , “ Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate . ”
The reality , however , appears to be more complex than that categorical statement would suggest .
One publication that rates members of Congress gave him that description in 2007 , but others disagree , and Mr. McCain himself described Mr. Obama as “ a centrist ” when the Democratic nominee first entered the Senate .
In January , the specialized political publication National Journal , evaluating what it regarded as important votes in the Senate last year , concluded that Mr. Obama was indeed the Senate ’s most liberal member .
But Congressional Quarterly , using a different index to rank members of Congress , found that Mr. Obama voted with President Bush nearly half the time , which would put him closer to Mr. McCain ’s original “ centrist ” description .
Negotiating With Adversaries :
For over a year , the McCain campaign has sought to portray Mr. Obama as eager to meet with the heads of state of Iran , Cuba , Venezuela , North Korea and other countries that the United States sees as adversaries .
On Friday night , Mr. McCain repeated the accusation , which stems from a remark Mr. Obama made early in the campaign
In a debate among Democratic candidates in July 2007 , Mr. Obama was asked “ would you be willing to meet separately , without precondition , during the first year of your administration , in Washington or anywhere else , with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea , in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries ? ”
Mr Obama replied “ I would , ” adding that “ the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them — which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration – is ridiculous . ”
Since then , the McCain campaign has sought to blur the distinctions between “ would ” and “ will ” and to use “ without preconditions ” as a synonym for “ unconditionally . ”
But in diplomatic parlance , “ without preconditions ” has a specific meaning : that one party does not demand concessions from the other as a price for sitting down at the table to begin to negotiate .
On Friday , Mr. McCain accused Mr. Obama of merely “ parsing words ” when the Democratic candidate insisted on a distinction .
But Mr. Obama has been clear and consistent in saying that he would not automatically meet with the heads of state of nations that are adversaries of the United States and that preparatory spadework would be required before he as president would meet with such leaders .
“ The point is that I would not refuse to meet until they agree to every position that we want , ” he said in May when asked to explain his position .
“ But that does n’t mean that we would not have preparation , and the preparation would involve starting with lower level diplomatic contacts , having our diplomatic corps work through with Iranian counterparts , an agenda . ”
Oil and Energy :
Mr. McCain took Mr. Obama to task for voting for the 2005
energy bill , which Mr. McCain voted against .
“ This is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk , ” he said .
“ We had an energy bill before the United States Senate .
It was festooned with
Christmas - tree ornaments .
It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies — I mean billions of dollars ’ worth . ”
At the time , Mr. Obama said he voted for the bill because of the tax credits it included for ethanol and clean - coal facilities .
But the bill actually raised taxes on the oil industry by about $ 300
million , according to a report by the Congressional Research Service .
A report in March by the Center for American Progress , a liberal research group in Washington , said that Mr. McCain ’s tax plan would lower oil company taxes by nearly $ 4 billion .
No Hearings on Afghanistan ?
Mr. McCain attacked Mr. Obama tonight for never holding any hearings on Afghanistan while chairman of the a subcommittee on European Affairs on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
The crux of the argument is that Mr. Obama ’s subcommittee has jurisdiction of NATO issues .
The charge is literally true , but some have argued that such a major issue would probably be taken up by the full committee .
Indeed , the non-partisan , FactCheck.org , pointed out that the full Senate Foreign Relations Committee has held three hearings over the past two years on Afghanistan and Mr. Obama was at one of them .
Afghanistan :
Mr. Obama claimed that Mr. McCain has said that the United States “ can muddle through in Afghanistan . ”
That alters a critical word in a statement Mr. McCain made in Nov. 2003 to the Council on Foreign Relations , substituting “ can ” for “ may . ”
The full context of Mr. McCain ’s remarks suggests that he was merely describing a possible policy
outcome , rather than endorsing it :
“ There has been a rise in Al Qaeda activity along the border .
There has been some increase in U.S. casualties .
I am concerned about it , but I ’m not as concerned as I am about Iraq today , obviously , or I ’d be talking about Afghanistan .
But I believe that if Karzai can make the progress that he is making , that — in the long term , we may muddle through in Afghanistan . ”
Tax Hikes :
Senator John McCain charged that Senator Obama voted “ to increase taxes on people who make as low as $ 42,000 a year . ”
Mr. Obama interjected , “ That ’s not true , John .
That ’ s not true . ”
Mr. McCain ’s claim has been called “ simply false ” by the nonpartisan FactCheck.org .
It is based on Mr. Obama ’s vote for Senate Democrats ’ nonbinding budget resolution for fiscal 2009 that assumed all of President Bush ’s 2001 tax cuts would expire as scheduled in 2010 .
But Mr. Obama has promised that he would retain all Bush tax cuts for families making less than $ 250,000 a year .
Mr. Obama has proposed other tax breaks for the middle class as well .
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has concluded that 95 percent of families with children would get a tax break under Mr. Obama ’s plan , significantly more than under Mr. McCain .
Fannie and Freddie :
Senator John McCain said tonight that he “ warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , ” echoing some of his recent comments in which he portrayed himself as sounding the alarm about the impending financial crisis .
Mr. McCain was referring to his decision in 2006 to sign on as a co-sponsor of a Senate bill that would have overhauled regulations governing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
But the legislation was introduced more than 16 months earlier , and the debate over the issue had been going on for some time .
He also only added his name to the measure after an oversight agency issued a long report condemning practices at Fannie Mae .
Nuclear Reactors and Jobs :
In the debate , as in his campaign speeches , Mr. McCain said that the program to build 45 nuclear reactors that he favors would “ provide 700,000 jobs for American workers . ”
But scientists , industry analysts and other experts , including advocates of nuclear power , offer much more modest figures , noting that a good deal of the heavy foundry work , for instance , would have to be done overseas .
Patrick Moore , a founder of Greenpeace who is now co-chairman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition , a pro-nuclear group , estimated that each reactor project would generate between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 800 permanent jobs once in operation .
Asked to provide a ballpark figure on employment if all 45 reactors were to be built , he responded “ 225,000 good union jobs that you can support a family on . ”
Senator Obama also talked about reducing oil dependence with wind and solar power , but making that work would require a new battery technology that is not certain to develop .
For many Americans , it 's a struggle to make ends meet .
For Ed Rogers , a Republican lobbyist , it is n't .
How do we know ?
Because his wife , Edwina , wraps gifts in real dollar bills .
Rogers , formerly a deputy assistant to President Bush , is Vice Chairman of lobbying firm Barbour Griffith & Rogers .
Rogers lobbies on behalf of Iraqi Kurds , who want the U.S. government to guarantee their autonomy from Baghdad as well as oil wealth from the contested city of Kirkuk .
By now , most of you have heard that we have received $ 28.7 - million in funding ( Ya - HA - ay and thanks Richie ) , however , our work has only just begun .
As you also probably know , Richard de Silva has joined the Digg team and it is time we begin creating a stronger business model .
As Kevin twittered recently : “ our 12 month road map is the best it ’s ever been . ”
He ’s right , but we still need your help .
Here ’s what we aim to do , why we want to do it , and how you can help .
If you have any suggestions , let us know !
1. Push Digg into the $ 300 - million reality
We are looking for the crème de la crème of Business Development Managers .
We must drive our base negotiation point back to $ 300 - million ; Google walked away during the due diligence stage of our deal , and we believe this is directly related to our Quantcast score , which shows that Digg has hit a plateau and has fewer new registrations .
2. Remove the top 100 Digg users
Over the past week , we ’ve started killing off our top Diggers .
Let me explain :
If we want to place our negotiation baseline at $ 300 - million , we can not have the same 1 percent of users generating 32 percent of visits to our site .
To that end , we have started culling .
Zaibatsu has been hit first .
Sorry Reg–let me explain : we pulled straws – there was no other way .
I know , I know ; you do n’t use scripts , and I know that you ’ve never accepted money , but I also need you to understand that this is a business decision – pure and simple .
No hard feelings !
Speaking of our ban on Zaibatsu , we need to clear something up :
As a testament to our transparency , and our need to add to the conversation , from here on in , we will admit when we are wrong .
So , we apologize for not banning Jackie and her site at the same time that we banned Zaibatsu .
It must have made you wonder whether Digg is undemocratic when we continued giving her and her site exposure – after banning Zaibatsu for linking to the very same site .
Unfortunately it was an error on our part .
While we believe a simple program modification could automate the process of banning all members that link to a specific site , or banning one site permanently , it is difficult to do without a lead developer .
But rest assured , we are actively looking to recruit a new Business Intelligence Engineer .
Mr Babyman , MSaleem , MakiMaki , supernova17 , digitalgopher , mklopez , CLIFFosakaJAPAN , skored and AlbertPacino – what can I say , but so long and thanks for all the fish .
I am apologizing up front because you guys will be banned .
But again , please understand that it is purely a business decision and reflects in no way how I feel about you guys – I love you all .
If it were n’t for you , Digg may not have arrived at its $ 300 - million tipping point .
To show our appreciation for all that you have done for Digg , we will stay true to our 08/09 roadmap , and spread the bannings over a 12 month period .
By the same token , you have done all you can do at Digg , now we ask that you move on .
I ’d like us to part on amicable terms , so if you ’re ever in San Fran , let me know and we ’ll get together for a beer .
Again , we have nothing against our top Diggers , this is purely part of our new business model .
3. Eradicate script makers
While we encourage people to create add - ons applications for Digg , part of our new 08/09 roadmap is dedicated to creating stronger , leaner and more creative add - ons .
This means that you may create add - ons if they will benefit the core Digg business , but you may not create them for the Digg community ; that will be our job from here on in .
We understand that many developers have put time and effort into creating add - ons for the community , and again , we must apologize , but it is no longer your job .
It is ours , and if you choose to disrespect our new rules , we will ban you and anyone that uses your add - ons .
Thank you again for your previous hard work , and DiggBoss , thank you especially , I know you ’ve worked long and hard , and I ’m very sorry about our new changes .
The fate of Washington Mutual remained in question yesterday as federal regulators recently called a number of banks asking if they would consider buying the nation ’s largest savings and loan should it eventually falter , sources told The Post .
In recent days , federal banking regulators have reached out to Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase , HSBC and several other financial institutions to gauge their interest in a possible acquisition of WaMu , but no merger discussions are currently under way between the Seattle - based bank and anyone else , sources said .
The move comes as investors worry that WaMu ’s customers could begin pulling their money , which totals about $ 143 billion , out of the bank should its stock fall further .
That does n’t appear to be happening now , but several WaMu customers in the New York area told The Post yesterday that they were worried about their cash .
“ Should I be in panic mode ? ” asked one Brooklyn - based customer who recently bought a $ 250,000 13 - month CD from the bank .
At the end of June , WaMu customers had 42.4 million accounts , almost all with less than the federally insured maximum of $ 100,000 .
WaMu ’s shares traded down as much as 25 percent yesterday before rallying to end the day up 16 percent to $ 2.32 .
Standard & Poor ’s cut WaMu ’s credit rating to junk status late Monday citing “ increasing market turmoil , ” but at the same time acknowledged that WaMu ’s deposit base appears to be stable and the company has enough liquidity to meet all fixed obligations through 2010 .
Rumors about a pending takeover by JPMorgan also resurfaced yesterday , but sources close to both companies said no talks are happening .
WaMu ’s deposits could buy the company ’s new boss Alan Fishman time to seek a deal or more capital should it lose more on bad mortgages than expected .
In April , private equity giant TPG led a group of investors that pumped $ 7 billion into WaMu .
TPG invested a total of about $ 1.5 billion into the company at an average price of $ 8 a share , according to a letter to the firms ’ investors obtained by The Post .
Those investors are unlikely to take a loss and would want JPMorgan or any other buyer to pay at least $ 8 a share before they accept a deal , sources said .
“ If he takes the country to war in [ Iran ] without a vote of Congress , which will not exist , then he should be impeached . ” ( November , 15 2007 )
“ I stand with the many citizens - from the U.S. and around the world - who are concerned at the prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons .
Nuclear proliferation is a grave concern to international stability , and in the hands of the sponsors of terorism is entirely unacceptable . ”
( Statement to the Israel Project , July 19 , 2007 )
“ Iran with the bomb could spark an arms race in the Middle East , with Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Syria joining in .
Given the fault lines - between Sunni and Shia , Israelis and Palestinians , Persians and Arabs , Turks and Kurds , fundamentalists and moderates - that 's the last thing we need .
And it 's the last thing Israel needs .
No President should take any option off the table , including force .
But we have time : Iran is years away from having a bomb and a missile to deliver it .
We need to use the time wisely .
We have to keep our eyes on the prize : preventing Iran from getting the bomb .
This administration spent five years obsessed with the idea of getting rid of the Iranian regime .
None of us like the regime , but think about the logic :
We want you to renounce the bomb - and by the way , when you do we 're still going to try to take you down .
The result : Iran accelerated its efforts to get the bomb and it is much closer now than it was when President Bush took office .
We need a policy that isolates Iran , not America and tips the balance in Iran against pursuing nuclear weapons .
That means keeping our allies , Russia and China on the same page as we ratchet up economic and diplomatic pressure on the government to stop pursuing nuclear weapons .
At the same time , there are growing fissures within the ruling elite - we need to exploit them .
Above all , we have to recognize that our biggest allies in this effort are the Iranian people .
They 're open to America .
They do n't like a regime that denies them basic political and social rights and that can't deal with corruption , unemployment and inflation .
The Iranian people need to know it is their government , not the US that is choosing confrontation over cooperation .
So we should tone down the rhetoric and talk .
It 's amazing how little faith this administration has in America 's ideas and ideals .
Force must be the last option because it 's a bad option .
First , with our forces bogged down in Iraq , our threat to use force does n't look very credible .
Second , we can set back Iran 's program but not stop it .
Using force would lead to retaliation by Iran , including against our troops in Iraq .
It would cause the Iranian people to rally behind Ahmadinejad and the extremists .
Third , even a ' limited ' strike would be perceived as something much bigger by the Iranians and could spark a real war .
The only thing worse than a poorly planned intentional war is an unplanned unintentional war . ” ( Jerusalem Post , June 7 , 2007 )
“ The bottom line here is , if regime change is the operative element of this administration 's policy [ in Iran ] , you are never going to get to the point where you end up with a diplomatic solution .
There may be no diplomatic solution , in the end .
That 's possible .
We may have crossed the line , or they may have crossed the line ... while we fool around with this , you 're going to see Japan go nuclear , and you 're going to see China react to Japan going nuclear , and you 're going to see a chain of events set in motion that are going to be significantly damaging to the next generation of Americans .
And so , it seems to me we should get off this wicket of suggesting that we wo n't talk .
I mean , what are we afraid of in talking ? ” ( FOX News Sunday with Chris Wallace , October 22 , 2006 )
“ It seems to me what we have to do is continue to push to see if we can hold this coalition together to increase gradual sanctions [ on Iran ] .
Without that , we do n't have a whole lot of options here ... This is a test for the diplomacy .
This is a test for the United Nations .
If it fails , then what we 're going to have to do is begin to come up with a serious containment policy , here . ” ( August 27 , 2006 )
Reflexive Recoil
Update :
The Frank Luntz and Stanley Greenberg focus groups went overwhelmingly for Obama .
And a CBS poll of undecideds went for Obama 40 % - 22 % .
Update : The CNN polls goes to Barack , 51% - 38 % .
Job burnout :
The phrase might conjure up images of work - obsessed lawyers sneakily checking their BlackBerrys from the front row of their kids ' elementary school plays or from the sidelines of their soccer games .
But it should probably also bring to mind images of desk drones mindlessly filling out spreadsheets , preparing TPS reports , and shooting spitballs toward the ceiling .
Indeed , the state of being perpetually underworked may be about as exhaustion - inducing as that of always having more work than you can handle .
A book to be released in the United States this fall — it was published last year in Europe — pins this label on the epidemic of underchallenged workers : " boreout . "
Philippe Rothlin and Peter Werder , coauthors of Boreout !
Overcoming Workplace Demotivation , estimate that about 15 percent of workers are headed toward this state of chronic boredom and total resignation .
For those employees who would like to stay wholly underutilized , here are four quick ways to burn out ( or bore out ) without doing much at all :
Do n't ask for additional work .
You might be bored out of your mind , but at least you 've got time to pay your electric bill and surf Amazon for the best Father 's Day book .
If you started actively seeking additional projects , you might have to stop pretending to work and actually , gulp , do real labor .
For those who spend the 9 - to - 5 hours in a bleary haze of boredom , take comfort that you 're in good company .
" There is an epidemic in this country of disengaged , dissatisfied employees , " says Ford Myers , president of Career Potential , a career consultancy and outplacement firm .
" It costs companies billions and billions every year in lost productivity . "
A 2005 Salary.com survey found the average worker wasted a little more than two hours of every eight - hour day on personal activities .
And fully one third of employees surveyed said they wasted time because they did n't have enough work .
Work at home or communicate only through E-mail and IM .
The more time you can spend in mind - numbing isolation , poking at your keyboard and reading through your spam folder , the better to reach a state of burnout .
Indeed , isolating work can contribute to employee drinking , according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism .
A sense of being isolated comes when solitary workers are not getting necessary support from supervisors and peers , says Jay Mulki , an assistant professor at Northeastern University 's College of Business Administration who has studied workplace isolation among telecommuters and office workers .
" That leads to stress in the sense that a person feels that he's not visible , nobody cares about him , his achievements are not known , nobody cares about whether he has done his work or not , " Mulki says .
" And he also feels that , most of the time , somebody may feel that he is goofing off . "
Physical distance contributes to the sense of being isolated , but even employees who work elbow - to - elbow with others can experience the lonely sensation , Mulki says .
It can happen if coworkers communicate solely through E - mail or instant messaging , or if a job requires such constant tasking — as with call - center employees — that it allows no time for connecting .
To combat isolation , employees need to make a point of talking about their accomplishments regularly with their supervisor .
Telecommuters can seek out local mentors or find other nearby telecommuters to occasionally share their work space , Mulki says .
Sit back and wait for directions .
Job burnout can result from a lack of control over aspects of work like your hours or which projects you 're working on , according to the Mayo Clinic .
While some employees really do n't have a say in schedules or workloads , many have probably never asserted a preference .
Sitting around waiting for your boss to tell you exactly what to do and when to do it is a sure - fire way to feel like your job is totally out of your control .
Granted , workers often face tough , unyielding bureaucracies .
Much of corporate America is still not interested in granting employees ' desire for more control and influence , Myers says .
But , he adds , even in that context : " You do n't get what you deserve ; you get what you negotiate for . "
For people who would like more control over their working lives , the first step is to excel at what you 're doing and show off your capabilities .
Earn the right to some authority .
Then ask for it .
Do n't find out what the expectations for your job are .
Showing up to work every morning with only a vague sense of what you ought to be doing is like working in purgatory .
Are you fulfilling your goals ?
Are you satisfying your job description ?
Does your work impress management ?
Who knows ?
Many workers are n't clear on what their employer or boss expects of them .
Employees who would like some direction and clarity of purpose can make one simple request of their bosses :
Ask for one - on - one , regularly scheduled meetings where you can discuss your achievements , goals , and strategies for moving forward , Myers says .
During the meeting , employees should ask questions like : How am I doing ?
What are your expectations for me in this job ?
What can I do to help you reach your goals , boss ?

Obama has sought to play the steady , if cautious , statesman .
Market troubles benefit Obama
Wall Street ’s breakdown and bailout are likely to improve Barack Obama ’s odds of reaching the White House — a point not lost on John McCain , whose stumbles this week seemed to lend credence to the view that economics is not his strong suit .
He said the fundamentals of the economy were “ strong , ” then he said the economy was “ in crisis . ”
Advertisement
He called for a 9/11 Commission - style investigation into the financial crisis , then never brought it up again .
He said he opposed the $ 85 billion bailout of insurance giant AIG , then he said he supported it .
He said SEC Chairman Chris Cox had “ betrayed the public ’s trust ” and should be fired , then called him a “ good man ” who only had to resign to be held accountable as the head of the commission .
And McCain ’s campaign blasted Obama for not taking a firm stance on the AIG rescue , but McCain himself has declined to take a definitive position on the Bush administration ’s $ 500 billion to $ 1 trillion plan to buy up the bad debt of other financial institutions .
McCain aides , recognizing the political difficulties of the moment , are trying to turn the debate over an economic crisis into a fight over Obama ’s character and leadership .
In a blistering speech Friday in Green Bay , Wis. , McCain tried to put the blame for the financial meltdown on Obama and resurrect a larger debate over taxes and the candidates ’ competing economic plans .
Obama , by contrast , has sought to play the steady , if cautious , statesman — studiously avoiding a position on the AIG bailout , aligning himself with economic advisers such as former Clinton Treasury Secretary and economic soother Robert Rubin , and talking about the need to put politics aside and address the problem at hand in a fashion his advisers hoped seemed presidential .
“ Today , ” Obama said in Coral Gables , Fla. , “ I fully support the efforts of Secretary [ Henry ] Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman [ Ben ]
Bernanke to work in a bipartisan spirit with Congress to find a solution of this sort . ”
Obama remained above the political fray Friday — at least until McCain attacked , at which point Obama returned fire by mocking his rival as being “ panicked . ”
The candidates ’ differing reactions to the unfolding economic story illustrate the way the campaigns see their standing .
As Americans turn their focus to their wallets and retirement accounts , the Obama camp knows that lipstick , pigs and even Sarah Palin herself have disappeared from the spotlight .
The McCain camp , by contrast , feels an urgent need to broaden the contours of the battle beyond economics and a referendum on the status quo .
“ This is not about the economy , this is about a crisis , ” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , one of McCain ’s closest friends , said Friday .
“ And John McCain has shown a willingness to get his hands dirty to take on corruption .
Barack Obama has n't found any corruption to fight , even in Chicago . "
Observers say McCain has his work cut out for him — and that an already tough year for the GOP likely just got tougher .
“ The critical event was McCain ’s unfortunate comment that the economy is sound , ” says Charlie Cook of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
“ He ’s been really slow to pick up on what ’s been going on .
He stumbled knee - deep into a pile , and it ’s going to be hard for him to get out .
...
This has been the biggest faux pas committed by either of them all year . ”
“ The problem that Sen. McCain has got at this moment is that this is a big government intervention in the financial markets , and guess what ?
At the moment , it ’s working , ” says former Nebraska Sen.
Bob Kerrey , an Obama supporter .
“ His fundamental argument all along has been to keep the government out of it .
But if the government had n’t intervened , this thing could easily have spiraled out of control . ”
That ’s the bad news for McCain .
The bad news for Obama :
The economic crisis could help propel him to the presidency , but if the federal government spends $ 1 trillion or even $ 500 billion bailing out financial companies , it wo n’t have much left over for the plans he hopes to pursue come January .
Obama ’s ambitious domestic agenda , larded with $ 65 billion - a- year health care reform and $ 15 billion green jobs program , would almost certainly be cut back in the face of a deficit swollen by hundreds of billions in bailouts .
And he will face increased scrutiny over the next 47 days over whether he can accomplish his agenda — along with a major middle - class tax cut — in the current environment .
“ President Obama ’s going to have to stand before a Democratic Congress and say , ‘ Some of the things that you and I as Democrats want to get done , we ’re not going to be able to , ’ ” Kerrey said .
Michael Ettlinger , an economist with the left - leaning Center for American Progress , says the downturn is a double - edged sword .
It creates a “ greater demand for Obama ’s program , ” but it also means that Obama ’s proposals would “ have to be delayed or rolled out over a longer period of time . ”
According to a New York Times / CBS poll released this week , 62 percent of voters who think the economy is getting worse back Obama , while only 29 percent who believe that support McCain .
By contrast , 63 percent of voters who think the economy is staying the same back McCain , and 29 percent of them support Obama .
With the market on a roller coaster , major financial institutions failing and the federal government having to step in to prevent a fiscal disaster of Depression - era proportions , such inverted numbers as seen in the Times poll could prove fatal to McCain ’s hopes .
With his speech Friday morning in Green Bay , however , aides believe McCain has found the right posture and frame of attack .
First , they want voters to know McCain recognizes the problem and is committed to ensuring it does n’t happen again — thus , the proposal from McCain on Friday to create a Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust within the Treasury Department to intervene should future companies teeter and threaten shareholders and other investors .
Second , they want to shift the focus of the economic debate on to Obama and away from either McCain ’s stumbles or Bush ’s record .
“ We ’re identifying the housing system as the fundamental flaw that led to this , Fannie and Freddie as the bad actors , and pointing out that Obama has all these ties to these guys , ” said Matt McDonald , a senior McCain adviser .
Indeed , McCain all but laid the problem of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two mortgage giants , at the feet of Obama in his Green Bay speech , noting the Democrat ’s fundraising from the two companies and his ties to two former Fannie CEOs to accuse him of “ gaming the system . ”
“ We 've heard a lot of words from Sen . Obama over the course of this campaign , ” McCain said .
“ But maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems .
The crisis on Wall Street started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling , and he was square in the middle of it . ”
McCain has his own ties to Fannie and Freddie , namely a handful of top aides who once lobbied for or worked at firms that lobbied for the mortgage entities .
But the imperative to muddy Obama as part of the problem trumps any concerns about backlash .
Anything to make the crisis a Beltway problem instead of just a Bush problem .
And after pinning blame on Obama , McCain ’s camp wants to move the debate off the current crisis and force a conversation about larger issues relating to the economy — and also the two candidates .
“ We have to draw attention to the choice , ” said McDonald .
Ultimately , the McCain campaign would like to broaden the campaign even further : to get away from the pure issue dynamic — which overwhelmingly favors the Democrats — and make voters think instead about character and judgment .
“ McCain is somebody who you trust to take care of business , and Obama is not that guy , ” McDonald said , summarizing the case to be made .
Graham , similarly , predicted the crisis would accrue to the benefit of the more experienced candidate : " Americans are going to look for a steady hand now on the domestic side and in their commander - in - chief . ”
McCain put it even more bluntly at a rally Thursday night in Green Bay , directly raising the issue of trust .
“ A vote for Sen .
Obama will leave this country at risk during one of the most severe challenges to America ’s economy since the Great Depression , and that ’s straight talk , my friends . ”

The glass frog is one of many species found at the research centre
Trekking through the dense forestation of the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center is like stepping back in time .
More than 50 species of amphibians of just about every variety of shape , size and colour that you can imagine thrive within the 112 acres ( 45 hectares ) of pristine rainforest .
Brian Kubicki , who set up the centre in 2002 , says : " In a lot of other highland areas , species have really declined . "
The herpetologist has spent years turning his patch of land into an amphibian haven - and the site now has the highest concentration of amphibians anywhere in Costa Rica .
A team from Manchester University and Chester Zoo , who are being followed by the BBC , visited the rainforest during daylight and after nightfall .
Here are some of the incredible amphibians that live in this mist - shrouded forest .
THE POISONOUS FROGS Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Poison dart frogs are one of the few amphibian species that come out during the day .
As their name suggests , these little frogs are highly toxic - and any predators who are not put off by their bright warning colours will either become extremely sick or die .
The poison even has a strong effect on humans - if it gets into an eye , it can cause temporary blindness .
One species found in Colombia has enough poison in its skin to kill 10 people .

One of the Brian Kubicki's key species is the glass frog - a beautiful specimen that is found by streams in rainforests .
His research has focussed on the ecology , biology and taxonomy of these creatures .
He has been working on modifying and conserving the habitat around his research centre to make it an area where the frogs are able to thrive .

These frogs are extremely rare .
They live high up in tree tops , and only breed in pools that have formed in the logs of fallen trees .
At the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center , Brian has created special tubs that mimic water - holding logs where the frogs can lay their eggs .

They feed on a number of different animals , including small mammals and even other frogs .
If anything disturbs them , they let out a high - pitched scream to scare off potential predators .

The research centre is now the last stronghold for the critically endangered lemur leaf frog .
Several years ago , it was relocated here from its last known breeding site just before its habitat was destroyed .
Scientists on this conservation expedition are now investigating the genetics of this tiny frog to find out more about the species .

This Has Got To Stop
The late selection of vice presidential nominees has led to a gaffe - filled contest in which each campaign is pointing the finger at its rival ’s running mate .
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) has , in recent days , lived up to his reputation as a gaffe machine , breaking with his running mate on a few occasions and , in at least once instance , drawing a soft rebuke from Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Democrats would no doubt like to return fire , but are left to lament the bubble Republican candidate John McCain ’s campaign has erected around his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , and note her limited record is hard to contrast with McCain ’s 26 years in Washington .
On Tuesday , as Washington and much of the world were focused on the proposed financial bailout for Wall Street and the gathering of world leaders at United Nations headquarters in New York City , the influential website Drudge Report was dominated by the back - and - forth between Biden and Obama .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
In an unusually strong statement criticizing the United States for sending commandos into Pakistan to fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda , the chief of the Pakistani Army said Wednesday that his forces would not tolerate such incursions and would defend the country ’s sovereignty “ at all costs . ”
“ No external force is allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan , ” the military chief , Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , said in what amounted to a direct rebuff to the United States by the Pakistanis , who are regarded by the Bush administration as an ally in the campaign against terrorism .
When General Kayani took over as chief of the army in November , American officials spoke highly of him and were counting on him to be their ally in much the same way , perhaps even to a greater degree , as President Pervez Musharraf had been .
Mr. Musharraf was president and army chief for almost all of his nearly nine - year rule .
General Kayani ’s statement on Wednesday seemed to call into question the extent of his cooperation and that of Pakistan ’s army .
It may be one of the oldest beliefs , ascribed by both medical practitioners and lay press for hundreds of years : " The average person should drink at least 8 glasses of water a day for optimal wellness . "
But how many people know that the roots of this adage are n’t in science , but vitalism and nostrum remediums ?
How many know that after centuries , there ’s still no medical evidence for the belief that normal , healthy people all need to be concerned about drinking more water ?**
The lack of evidence should n’t really be a surprise if we stop to think about it .
As Dr. Heinz Valtin , M.D. , a kidney expert with the Department of Physiology at Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire , said , it ’s “ difficult to believe that evolution left us with a chronic water deficit that needs to be compensated by forcing a high fluid intake . ”
Yet , we only need to look around to see how slavishly this exhortation is being followed .
People carry bottles of water everywhere , sipping from them continually .
We ’ve become obsessed with our pee .
More incredibly , so have our employers .
Pee charts
Companies have made workers ’ bathroom business their business .
Drinking 8 ( 8 ounce ) glasses of water — known as 8x8 — has become a key part of preventive health and workplace wellness programs .
Like many other aspects of these wellness programs , their claims to prevent chronic diseases and promote optimum wellness have little credible scientific support .
It should n’t be at all surprising that our bosses do n’t know what ’s best for us , though .
How many human resource departments and company executives do you know who read the medical literature and understand science ?
So why are we readily accepting health advice at work ?
In fact , the off - the - wall claims being made by those that sold wellness programs to our bosses may be most surprising of all .
They ’re told that hydration is essential to a healthy workforce .
A recent Personnel Today magazine article , for instance , said that even the slightest dehydration affects job performance .
Dehydration drains energy and reduces productivity , affecting companies ’ bottom line , executives are told .
Vielife , which provides employer wellness programs , claims “ a 1 % decrease in hydration levels produces a 20 % decrease in production levels . ”
As part of Vielife ’s hydration program , for example , to ensure that employees are drinking enough water , companies offer water points , send emails to coax workers to drink water , distribute water bottles , and post pee charts in the bathrooms to check the color of workers ’ urine .
Yes , pee charts .
Bosses actually think it ’s their business what you do in the privacy of the bathroom .
Do n’t laugh , Vielife ’s Hydration Campaign and wellness programs have been adopted by companies around the world , such as Australia ’s largest health plan , Medibank Private , which covers 90,000 employees ; and Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council , which covers 4,600 employees in East Manchester .
Unsupportable claims about water abound in the tenuous health information being given people through wellness programs .
Mayo Clinic , which provides the online health information through many employer and healthplan wellness program , says water flushes toxins out of vital organs and that even mild dehydration can drain energy and make you feel fatigued .
To stay “ safely hydrated , ” Mayo Clinic advises : “ It 's generally not a good idea to use thirst alone as a guide for when to drink .
By the time you become thirsty , it 's possible to already be slightly dehydrated . ”
At the University of Maine , during campus Healthy Weight Week , employees were told by their wellness director :
DRINK WATER !
Most of us suffer from mild dehydration , and it ’s important to focus on drinking water all day , every day .
Try to consume about ten 8 - ounce glasses of water every day ( about 5 bottles of water ) , and remember that caffeine is dehydrating — if you drink a lot of coffee or caffeinated soda , you ’ll need to drink more than ten servings of water a day .
If you ’re tired , hungry , cranky , light - headed — you may just need a glass of water .
So run to the faucet or the nearest gas station and start hydrating !
These beliefs about water have certainly helped the bottled and purified water industries — among of the biggest promoters of the 8x8 adage and the water wellness factor for workplace wellness .
But , clearly , we need better sources of information , lest we be taken in , too .
For years , the recommendation to drink 8 glasses of water a day for good health had become one of those unquestioned rules that was so widespread , most people assumed there must be some scientific medical basis for it .
On the contrary .
In fact , most of us would probably be astounded to learn that it dates back to early philosophies — vitalism ideologies .
Living water
Water for health is an idea that goes back centuries , at least .
German physician , Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland ( 1764-1836 ) , who practiced natural medicine and vitalism , fashionable at the time , was one early proponent of 8 - 10 glasses of water a day .
He is most known for founding macrobiotics , and his book , Makrobiotik oder Die Kunst , des Menschliche Leben zu verlangern , attributed health and ill health to life force .
According to the Dictionary of Eighteenth Century German Philosophers , he sought “ not just a longer and healthier life , but also a more ethical life — moral and physical health were seen as intertwined and flowing from the same source , both marked by an abundance of life force .
Illness was not to be cured so much as prevented by pursuing a proper diet and lifestyle . ”
In Hufeland ’s Art of Prolonging Life , translated in 1867 , he wrote :
The first thing necessary in regard to the prolongation of life must undoubtedly be a more intimate acquaintance with ... the vital power , the grand cause of all life ...
The vital power is the most subtle , the most penetrating , and the most invisible agent of Nature ... it exceeds light , electricity , and magnetism .
The vital power may be weakened , and even totally destroyed , by certain causes ; and by other can be excited , strengthened and nourished ...
Water , if it be not nourishment of itself , it at any rate indispensably necessary for the business of restoration and nourishment ; first , because it must be the vehicle for the proper nutritive substances ... and secondly , because this vehicle is absolutely necessary to produce sufficient secretion and evacuation of what is corrupted , and consequently for the purification of the body .
In Makrobiotik , he said water , preferably alive , fresh spring or mineral water , was the best drink and “ an excellent means of prolonging life . ”
But , he added , “ the most essential thing is that it should be fresh ; for in its freshness there is a certain sprit , which in a peculiar manner renders it so digestive and fortifying . ”
Many special curative properties were attributed to fresh , cold water , which he said was a “ fortifier and vivifier of the stomach and nerves , and an excellent antibilious and antiputrid remedy . ”
In Makrobiotik , Dr. Hufeland described his water prescription to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day .
He advised drinking 2 or 3 tumblers of cold spring water upon rising , drinking more cold water to diminish the exciting effects of coffee or tea after breakfast , a tumbler of water an hour before dinner , 3 - 5 glasses during dinner , and a glass of water before going to bed .
Water was necessary , he wrote , “ above all in youth , when the blood begins to boil in the veins , that is particular necessary to have recourse to cold water to calm the natural effervescence of the blood .
In manhood , which naturally disposes us to febrile and inflammatory diseases and old age ... there is no better way of preventing and remedying these evils , than to drink cold water . ”
While his book was written in 1796 , this water adage appears to have been being promoted even prior to that date .
Dr. Hufeland described the Surgeon General to the King of Prussia , who , from the age of 30 , had suffered from “ hypochondria , melancholy , heart palpitations , and indigestion . ”
By following his water diet , “ all his complaints disappeared ” and he was said to have enjoyed better health the last half of his life than he had during his youth .
Throughout the 18th and 20th centuries , the hydropathy water cure was popular in Europe and America , as practitioners encouraged their followers to drink lots of water for healthful and curative properties and to flush out toxins and impurities .
Dr. Granichstadten , a follower of hydropathy , wrote in Hydriasiologie , in 1837 , that cold water followers will “ find his appetite , which he may indulge as much as he likes , and his gaiety increase daily , and his pains and aches diminish ; and when he becomes acquainted with the nature of the cure , he will feel a confident assurance of being speedily established in health . ”
By 1840 , there were just under 100 different hydropathy medical centers in Germany , alone , wrote Captain R.T. Claridge in Hydropathy : The Cold Water Cure , published in 1845 .
Throughout the early 1900s , the media continued to regularly espouse drinking 8 glasses of water a day .
The 8x8 recommendation continued , rarely questioned , until Dr. Valtin ’s seminal investigation in 2002 , trying to find any scientific justification for drinking so much water .
This was followed by other critical papers and the 2004 National Academy of Sciences recommendations .
Still , the scientific evidence has n’t caught up with some health writers , nutritionists and healthcare professionals .
Nor , obviously , with our employers .
The science of 8x8
Conventional wisdoms , despite their popularity , are n’t always true .
Dr. Valtin conducted a 10 - month review of the scientific literature and historic documents , and interviewed medical experts , to find any supportive evidence at all for this long - standing adage .
He also looked for any evidence behind the most cited claims about the our water needs and water ’s health benefits .
“ I ’m talking about randomized trials published in peer - reviewed journals , ” he said .
Not opinion pieces and anecdotes .
He also tried to uncover a definitive science - based origin for the recommendation .
His major undertaking found that “ the universal advice that has made guzzling water a national pastime is more urban myth than medical dogma and appears to lack scientific proof . ”
His search results , published in the American Journal of Physiology , said :
No scientific studies were found in support of 8 x 8 .
Rather , surveys of food and fluid intake on thousands of adults of both genders — analyses of which have been published in peer - reviewed journals — strongly suggest that such large amounts are not needed because the surveyed persons were presumably healthy and certainly not overtly ill .
This conclusion is supported by published studies showing that caffeinated drinks ( and , to a lesser extent , mild alcoholic beverages like beer ) may indeed be counted toward the daily total , as well as by the large body of published experiments that attest to the precision and effectiveness of the osmoregulatory system for maintaining water balance .
His review of lay press found that the rationale for 8x8 typically goes something like this : “ Our bodies consist mostly of water and our blood , muscles , brain , and bone are made up mainly of water .
Therefore , 1 ) we need water to function and survive and 2 ) we need at least eight 8 - ounce glasses of water each day . ”
The second conclusion , he said , besides being unproven is a nonsequitur .
“ It is akin to arguing that our homes run on electricity , and that , therefore , every house needs at least 1,000 - ampere service . ”
Dr. Valtin specifically investigated the research evidence behind the most popular myths about our fluid needs .
All fluids count .
The popular papers left “ little doubt ” that most advocates of the 8 glasses of water a day mean to convey that people should drink water per se , and specifically exclude caffeinated or sweetened drinks from the daily count .
But this is a misperception , he wrote .
He found strong scientific evidence that all fluids count , including water , coffee , tea , soft drinks , milk , juices and beer .
Dehydrating caffeine myth .
Similarly , he found that recent experiments have “ cast serious doubt on the often asserted diuretic role of caffeinated drinks , ” he said .
Caffeine had no significant effects on any of the variables that measure dehydration in one such study conducted at the Center for Human Nutrition in Omaha , for example , and the investigators concluded that “ advising people to disregard caffeinated beverages as part of the daily fluid intake is not substantiated . ”
The diuretic effect of caffeine in drinks and moderate alcohol is trivial compared to the amount of water they contain .
We need less than we think .
Among most adults , he found , caffeinated and alcoholic beverages constitute half or slightly more of their daily fluid intake , meaning the average adult drinks a respectable 1,700 ml and this does n’t include the water from foods and metabolism , which also count .
Yet , the medical research indicates that even 1,700 ml may be as much as a full liter more than what sedentary adults actually need to maintain physiological homeostasis , he said .
He could n’t find any article where 8x8 was recommended on the basis of scientific evidence .
The idea seemed to appear out of nowhere .
He did , however , find one possible source for a misinterpretation that may have been repeated , like urban legends often are .
The 1945 Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences had written in its Recommended Dietary Allowances :
A suitable allowance of water for adults is 2.5 liters daily in most instances .
An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food .
Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods .
Dr. Valtin believes this last sentence may have been ignored , leaving the incorrect interpretation of these early dietary guidelines that eight glasses of water to be drunk each day .
Thirst does n’t mean dehydration .
The scientific evidence also debunks the popular myth that by the time you feel thirsty , you ’re already dehydrated .
A number of scientific studies have confirmed there is no support for this fear .
Quite the opposite .
Thirst hits long before we 're near risk for dehydration .
Our thirst kicks in when the osmolality of our blood plasma is less than 2 % , whereas dehydration begins at osmolalities of 5 % and higher .
In fact , our bodies even adjust fluid balances moment - to - moment by changes in the plasma concentrations of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin , and subsequent changes in urine flow , far earlier than thirst plays a role .
“ Osmotic regulation of vasopressin secretion and thirst is so sensitive , quick , and accurate that it is hard to imagine that evolutionary development left us with a chronic water deficit that has to be compensated by forcing fluid intake , ” he wrote .
In the absence of diseases or other impairment of the osmoregulatory system , the body easily maintains water balance by this finely tuned system .
It also can slow down evaporation through the skin and signal the kidneys to release water back into the body when needed .
“ The body ’s own system is quick to restore water balance in healthy persons , ” he said .
Pee color .
While urine volume varies among healthy people , he said , there is a range of normal urine osmolalities among healthy people .
The mean osmolality has a concentration of solutes so that the urine appears moderately yellow in color , he said , “ which might be interpreted as ‘ dark ’ , especially when contrasted against ‘ pale yellow ’ or ‘ clear , ’ which is specified in most of the lay literature . ”
But osmolalities in normal range are nowhere near the values of 300 mosmol / kgH2O and higher , which are seen in meaningful dehydration .
“ Therefore , the warning that dark urine reflects dehydration is alarmist and false in most instances , ” he said .
Even water is n’t harmless .
“ Despite the dearth of compelling evidence for 8x8 , ” he wrote , “ many persons are likely to retort : ‘ But what harm would it do ? ’
The fact is that , potentially , there is harm even in water . ”
For example , he noted water intoxication and hyponatremia , covered here .
And then there ’s the hassle , he said .
Although some may dismiss this as minor , it can be a major inconvenience that can even cause embarrassment for some , he said .
And those who ’ve come to believe pure water is needed from bottled or purified sources , they can incur fairly large financial costs .
When the managing director of Vielife was asked about the downside of their employee hydration program and the inefficiency of having workers visiting the toilet all the time , he told Australian businessmen : “ Well , I do all my best thinking in the toilet . ”
Employers bought that one , too . :-)
We are not a dehydrated populace .
Examining multiple dietary surveys , he found that average daily water intakes during the 1990s were about 2,220 ml , far beyond that necessary for physiological homeostasis .
Yet “ proponents of 8x8 continue to tell us that ‘ Americans still do not drink enough water , ’ ” he wrote .
The published data to date strongly suggest that “ we probably are currently drinking enough and possibly more than enough . ”
[ Again , some disease states and special circumstances such as strenuous physical activity and hot environments can increase our water needs , said Dr. Valtin , but that ’s not who ’s targeted by 8x8 recommendations . ]
I would argue further that , for the time being , the burden of proof that everyone needs 8x8 should fall on those who persist in advocating the high fluid intake without , apparently , citing any scientific support .
2004 Food and Nutrition Board
Two years after Dr. Valtrin ’s famous paper , the latest 2004 Food and Nutrition Board recommendations for water were issued , reinforcing his findings and defusing the myths of 8x8 .
The Board clearly stated that total water intake includes fluids from drinking water , water in other beverages , and the water in food .
They found the evidence insufficient to establish intake recommendations to reduce the risk of chronic diseases but has set Adequate Intake for total water to prevent health problems from dehydration .
As they emphasized : “ A wide variety of intakes is compatible with normal hydration ... and Adequate Intake should not be interpreted as a specific requirement . ”
Daily consumption below the AI may not raise health risks for the typical person .
Higher total water is needed by people who are active or exposed to hot environments .
Over the course of a few hours , body water deficits can occur due to reduced intake or increased water losses from physical activity and environmental ( e.g. , heat ) exposure .
However , on a day - to - day basis , fluid intake , driven by the combination of thirst and the consumption of beverages at meals , allows maintenance of hydration status and total body water at normal levels .
The latest debunking
In the June issue of the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology , doctors Dan Negoianu and Stanley Goldfarb at the Renal , Electrolye and Hypertension Division at the University of Pennsylvania , further examined the science behind water myths .
“ There is what I call an urban myth that drinking a lot of water is a healthy thing to do and it leads to people toting around plastic water bottles all day drinking water , ” said Dr. Goldfarb .
“ The source of this is the complementary and alternative medicine worlds . ”
Not science .
Water does n’t reduce appetite .
Among the additional myths they reviewed was the belief that drinking water before and during a meal will help people eat less and help manage obesity .
They found surprisingly little evidence to support such rationale or even biological plausibility .
“ Because you absorb water so quickly and it moves through the GI tract so quickly , it probably does n't fill you up the way people have proposed , nor does it lead to the release of hormones which suppress appetite , ” he said .
Water does n’t detoxify .
Another myth is that filling up on water flushes toxins from the body .
“ In fact , that is not how the kidney works , ” said Dr. Goldfarb .
“ When you drink a lot of water you end up having a larger volume of urine but do n't necessarily increase the excretion of various constituents of the urine . ”
Urban myth .
While they did find solid evidence that some athletes or those living and working hot , dry climates have increased need for fluids ; and that people with certain diseases may benefit from increased water intake ; no such data exist for average , healthy individuals .
As they summarized :
There is no clear evidence of benefit from drinking increased amounts of water .
Although we wish we could demolish all of the [ other ] urban myths found on the Internet regarding the benefits of supplemental water ingestion , we concede there is also no clear evidence of lack of benefit .
In fact , there is simply a lack of evidence in general .
Our bodies are amazing creations .
There is no credible scientific reason that the average healthy person can’t trust his / her body to do what it was designed to do , and without continual diligence on his / her part .
Counting and tracking everything that goes in and out — including calories , grams of macro- and micro-nutrients , and water — does n’t make us any healthier .
But it sure adds to our stress and makes us feel guilty when we stray outside the lines .

Bill Clinton was a guest of the David Letterman show last night where he gave a tepid endorsement of Barack Obama .
The next guest was Chris Rock who is genetically incapable of being tepid .
He gave a near - belligerent excoriation of Clinton ’s performance :
“ Is it me , or he [ Clinton ] did n’t want to say the name Barack Obama ?
He did not …
He went through everything he could do … “ Well like Hillary would want to do with the economy … ” Hillary ai n’t running .
Hillary ’s not running .
What the hell ? ”
If everybody hates Chris , he apparently does n’t care .
He makes an interesting point .
Why is the Clintons ’ support of Obama so tepid and muted ?
Some openly speculate that they want Obama to lose so that Hillary will have a better shot in 2012 .
I have no idea if that is true , but the more they withhold their enthusiasm for Obama , the more they give their supporters license to do the same .
As the chart above shows , more than twice the amount of Clinton ’s primary supporters , as compared to Obama ’s primary supporters , now expect McCain to win the general election .
Also , three times as many Clinton primary supporters ( over Obama primary supporters ) say Obama does n’t understand their needs , but that McCain does .
If they really want Obama to win , now would be the time to say it – loudly , like Chris Rock .

Oil really is the root of all evil
Advertisement
Take oil and petroleum out of the energy equation and replace it with a locally produced , locally controlled , ecological , economical , renewable resource and what happens ?
95 % of the world 's structural problems melt away .
No more oil wars .
No more money leaving our country by the hundreds of billions .
No more ecological devastation related to fuel production .
Greatly reduced carcinogens .
But oil is necessary for our lifestyle , right ?
If it 's not , how did we get hooked on oil in the first place ?
History tells us the US went from whale oil to kerosene for lamps courtesy of the ingenuity of John Rockefeller and Standard Oil .
It also tells us that gasoline and diesel made from oil and was the only practical source of fuel for motor vehicles ( cars , trucks , buses and tractors . )
Still is , so they say .
But think about something for a moment .
Prohibition was the total ban on alcohol manufacturing in the US from 1919 to 1933 .
We accept it as a force of nature and never examine it .
The US is a hard drinking nation .
Always has been and back when this ban was put in place it was far more so .
The people who put Prohibition in place were men , most of whom were serious drinkers themselves .
Are we to believe that these 1919 - era men were led and controlled a group of 1919 - era church ladies ?
Does that make any sense ?
Is it a coincidence that the ban of alcohol production took place just as the fledgling auto industry was gaining traction and alcohol was the obvious and superior choice for fuel ?
And was only lifted after the local alcohol - for - fuel infrastructure was completely destroyed , forgotten and supplanted by oil industry giants ?
Am I saying that the last 90 years of the economic , political , and ecological rape of the world by oil companies has been a total con job , enforced with violence and supported by generations of corrupt politicians ( Cheney , Bush Sr. , Bush Jr. , Nixon , and on and on it goes . )
Yes , that 's exactly what I 'm saying .

In what has amounted to a huge embarrassment for the the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , it has been revealed that the card which holds a new “ duck stamp ” also has the telephone number for a $ 1.99 sex service on the back .
If you want to go duck hunting , you must buy and carry the duck stamp , otherwise known as the “ Migratory Bird Conservation and Hunting Stamp ” .
Sales of the stamp raise about $ 25 million each year to fund wetland habitat acquisition for the national Wildlife Refuge System .
The phone number that was supposed to go on the back is 1-800 - STAMP24 ( 1-800-782-6724 ) and is for people wanting to buy additional stamps .
But somehow two digits got changed ( presumably by accident ) and they ended up instead with a phone number with girls promising to get you hot within 60 seconds .
However , the Fish and Wildlife Service has ruled out recalling the cards and printing out new ones because it would cost far too much money .
So expect to see the cards on eBay as collectors items and duck hunters with cellphones wiling away the boring hours waiting for the ducks by making lots of phone calls .
Oh and if you want the “ other ” number , it ’s 1-800-872-6724 , ( 1-800 - TRAMP24 ) .
Do n’t say I do n’t think about you !
Post - 9/11 , torture has been official US policy under George Bush - authorized at the highest levels of government .
Evidence of its systematic practice continues to surface .
First some background .
On September 17 , 2001 , George Bush signed a secret finding empowering CIA to " Capture , Kill , or Interrogate Al - Queda Leaders . "
It also authorized establishing a secret global network of facilities to detain and interrogate them without guidelines on proper treatment .
Around the same time , Bush approved a secret " high - value target list " of about two dozen names .
He also gave CIA free reign to capture , kill and interrogate terrorists not on the list .
It was the beginning of events that followed .
On November 13 , 2001 , the White House issued a Military Order regarding the " Detention , Treatment , and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism . "
It " determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes , that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency . "
It defined targeted individuals as Al Queda and others for aiding or abetting acts of international terrorism or harboring them .
These individuals shall be denied access to US or other courts and instead tried by " military commission " with the power to convict by " concurrence of two - thirds of the members . "
On December 28 , 2001 , Deputy Assistant Attorney Generals , Patrick Philbin and John Yoo , sent a Memorandum to General Counsel , Department of Defense , William Haynes II titled : " Possible Habeas Jurisdiction over Aliens Held in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . "
It said federal courts have no jurisdiction and cannot review Guantanamo detainee mistreatment or mistaken arrest cases .
It further stated that international laws do n't apply in the " war on terror . "
This laid the groundwork for abuses in all US torture prisons .
On January 18 , 2002 , Bush issued a " finding " stating that prisoners suspected of being Al Queda or Taliban members are " enemy combatants " and unprotected by the Third Geneva Convention .
They were to be denied all rights and treated " to the extent .... consistent with military necessity . "
Torture was thus authorized .
The 2006 Military Commissions Act ( aka the " torture authorization act " ) later created the Geneva - superceded category of " unlawful enemy combatant " to deny them any chance for judicial fairness .
International law expert Francis
Boyle spoke out about this lawless designation : " this quasi - category ( created a ) universe of legal nihilism where human beings ( including US citizens ) can be disappeared , detained incommunicado , denied access to attorneys and regular courts , tried by kangaroo courts , executed , tortured , assassinated and subjected to numerous other manifestations of State Terrorism " on the pretext of as protecting national security .
The January 18 memo was preceded by a January 9 one to William Haynes II - co-authored by John Yoo , and Special Council Robert Delahunty .
It read in part : Regarding " international treaties and federal laws on the treatment of individuals detained by the US Armed Forces ( in ) Afghanistan .... the laws of armed conflict ( do n't ) apply to the conditions of detention and the procedures for trial of members of al Queda and the Taliban militia . "
These treaties " do not protect members of the al Queda organization ( or ) the Taliban militia . "
On January 19 , 2002 Donald Rumsfeld sent a memo to the Joint Chiefs titled : " Status of Taliban and al Queda . "
It stated that these detainees " are not entitled to prisoner of war status for purposes of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . "
It gave commanders enormous latitude to treat prisoners " to the extent appropriate with military necessity " or essentially as they saw fit .
On January 22 , 2002 , Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel , Jay Bybee ( now a federal judge ) , issued a Memorandum to Counsel to the President , Alberto Gonzales and William Haynes II .
It was titled : " Application of Treaties and Laws to al Queda and Taliban Detainees . "
It covered the same ground as the Yoo / Delahunty memo plus added misinterpretations of international law with regard to war .
On January 25 , 2002 , Alberto Gonzales , then issued a sweeping memo to George Bush .
In it he called the Geneva Conventions " quaint " and " obsolete " and said the administration could ignore Geneva law in interrogating prisoners henceforth .
He also outlined plans to try prisoners in " military commissions " and deny them all protections under international law , including due process , habeas rights , and the right to appeal .
In December 2002 , Donald Rumsfeld concurred by approving a menu of banned interrogation practices allowing anything short of what would cause organ failure .
On February 7 , 2002 , the White House issued an Order " outlining treatment of al - Qaida and Taliban detainees . "
It stated that " none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al - Qaida ( or Taliban detainees ) in Afghanistan 'or elsewhere throughout the world ... ' "
It meant they'd be afforded no protection under international law and could be treated any way authorities wished , including use of torture as was later learned .
A virtual blizzard of similar memos followed covering much the same ground to allow all measures banned under international and US law ( including the 1996 War Crimes Act , 1994 Torture Statute and the Torture Act of 2000 ) .
The War Crimes
Act is especially harsh .
It provides up to life in prison or the death penalty for persons convicted of committing war crimes within or outside the US .
Torture is a high war crime , the highest after genocide .
Two other memos particularly deserve mention - written by John Yoo , Alberto Gonzales , Jay Bybee and David Addington ( Cheney 's legal counsel ) .
One was for the CIA on August 2 , 2002 .
It argued for letting interrogators use harsh measures amounting to torture .
It said federal laws prohibiting these practices do n't apply when dealing with Al Queda because of presidential authorization during wartime .
It also denied US or international law applies in overseas interrogations .
It essentially " legalized " anything in the " war on terror " and authorized lawlessness and supreme presidential power .
On March 14 , 2003 , the same quartet issued another memo - this one for the military titled : " Military Interrogation of Alien Unlawful Combatants Held Outside the United States . "
It became known as " the Torture Memo " because it swept away all legal restraints and authorized military interrogators to use extreme measures amounting to torture .
It also gave the President as Commander - in - Chief " the fullest range of power .... to protect the nation . "
It stated he " enjoys complete discretion in the exercise of his authority in conducting operations against hostile forces . "
Military law expert and Yale University lecturer , Eugene Fidell , called it " a monument to executive supremacy and the imperial presidency ....( and ) a road map for the Pentagon ( to avoid ) any prosecutions . "
It denied due process is applicable and virtually all other constitutional protections .
It argued against any prohibition banning " cruel and unusual treatment . "
It was a document that would make any despot proud .
So much so that in late 2004 , Office of Legal Counsel head , Jack Goldsmith , rescinded the Memorandum saying it showed an " unusual lack of care and sobriety in ( its ) legal analysis ( and it ) seemed more an exercise of sheer power than reasoned analysis . "
Nonetheless , other administration documents authorized continued use of practices generally reflecting John Yoo 's views .
They may inflict " intense pain or suffering " short of what would cause " serious physical injury so severe that death , organ failure , ( loss of significant body functions ) , or permanent damage " may result .
The President 's July 20 , 2006 Executive Order ( EO ) was one such document , titled : " Interpretation of the Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to a Program of Detention and Interrogation Operated by the Central Intelligence Agency . "
It pertained to " a member or part of or supporting al Qaeda , the Taliban , or associated organizations ( who might have ) information that could assist in detecting , mitigating , or preventing terrorist attacks .... within the United States or against its Armed Forces or other personnel , citizens , or facilities , or against allies or other countries cooperating in the war on terror .... "
It authorized the Director of CIA to determine interrogation practices .
Based on what 's now known , they include sleep deprivation , waterboarding or simulated drowning , stress positions ( including painfully extreme ones ) , prolonged isolation , sensory deprivation and / or overload , beatings ( at times severe and life - threatening ) , electric shocks , induced hypothermia , and other measures that can cause irreversible physical and psychological harm , including psychoses .
International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) on Bush Administration Use of Torture
In a secret 2007 report , the ICRC concluded that CIA interrogators tortured high - level Al Queda prisoners .
Abu Zubaydah was one , a reputed close associate of Osama bin Laden and Guantanamo detainee .
He was confined in a box " so small ( that ) he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position " and stay that way .
He and others were also " slammed against the walls , " waterboarded to simulate drowning , and given other harsh and abusive treatment .
The report also said Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the supposed chief 9/11 planner , was kept naked for over a month - " alternately in suffocating heat and in a painfully cold room . "
Most excruciating was a practice of shackling prisoners to the ceiling and forcing them to stand for as long as eight hours .
Other techniques included prolonged sleep deprivation , " bright lights and eardrum - shattering sounds 24 hours a day . "
ICRC 's Bernard Barrett declined to comment but confirmed that Red Cross personnel regularly visit Guantanamo detainees , including high - level ones .
They also " have an ongoing confidential dialogue with members of the US intelligence community , and we would share any observations or recommendations with them . "
In her new book just out , " The Dark Side , " Jane Mayer went further using sources familiar with ICRC 's report .
She wrote it " warned that the abuse ( at torture prisons ) constituted war crimes , placing the highest officials in the US government in jeopardy of being prosecuted . "
She also explained that Red Cross investigators based their report largely on prisoner interviews .
However , CIA officers she spoke to confirmed what ICRC disclosed .
More on Mayer 's book below .
Presidential July 20 , 2007 Executive Order ( EO ) 13440 : Interpretation of the Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to a Program of Detention and Interrogation Operated by the Central Intelligence Agency
The EO is noteworthy for what it does n't say , not what it does .
Its language is reassuring but avoids stopping short of the administration 's official policy of torture .
Or real compliance with Geneva 's Common Article 3 that states in part : ( 1 ) Noncombatants , including " members of armed forces who laid down their arms .... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely .... " .... " the following acts are prohibited at any time and in any place .... : -- violence to life and person ( including ) murder , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture ; -- taking of hostages ; -- .... humiliating and degrading treatment ; " -- sentencing or executing detainees " without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees .... recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ; " and -- assuring wounded and sick are cared for .
Various human rights organizations weighed in on the EO .
Washington Director of Human Rights First , Elisa Massimino , said : The Order " fails to make clear whether ( CIA authorized ) interrogation techniques are still permitted . "
If CIA interprets the Order " as authorization to ( continue using ) techniques such as waterboarding , stress positions , hypothermia , sensory deprivation ( and overload ) , sleep deprivation and isolation , it sends a powerful - and dangerous - message " that these and other banned practices are permissible .
Bush 's EO avoided clarity and left considerable leeway for abuse .
New Yorker Writer Jane Mayer 's New Book : " The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals " Mayer 's book reflects what the ICRC reported and is now common knowledge except for more grim details and personal accounts .
Prior to its release , the publisher 's promotion commented : " The Dark Side is a dramatic , riveting , and definitive narrative account of how the United States made terrible decisions in the pursuit of terrorists around the world - decisions that not only violated the Constitution to which White House officials took an oath to uphold , but also hampered the pursuit of Al Queda .
In gripping detail ... Jane Mayer relates the impact of these decisions - US - held prisoners , some of them completely innocent , were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition than the twenty - first century . "
" The Dark Side " recounts the fallout from the above administration documents and more .
It reveals high - level contempt for the law to advance an imperial project .
The story is gripping and comprehensive .
It 's about an American gulag throughout the world where mostly innocent detainees are held secretly outside the law and subjected to ritual abuse , humiliation and excruciating torture - day after day repeatedly .
Some do n't survive .
All who do remain scarred for life .
Mayer states that decisions were taken at the highest levels - to make " torture the official law of the land in all but name , " and it 's no longer secret .
Her evidence is compelling and comes from military officers , intelligence professionals and other conservative Bush appointees - " hard - line law - and - order stalwarts in the criminal justice system " who came forward nonetheless , and apparently for good reason .
Unlike past lawless periods , this time is different given the menu of what occurred post - 9/11 : an array of -- illegal aggressive wars and the possibility of others ; -- police state laws enacted ; -- extremist Executive Orders ; -- similar National and Homeland Security Presidential Directives ; military orders and signing statements ; -- " unitary executive " authority assumption granting unlimited presidential powers ; -- lawless and pervasive spying on Americans ; -- turning elections into shams ; -- gutting the Constitution , article by article , including the Bill of Rights ; -- ending any sense of checks and balances ; -- ignoring international laws and norms ; -- establishing an official policy of secrecy ; -- silencing dissent and free speech ; -- conducting massive sweeps against Muslims , Latino immigrants and other designated targets ; -- convicting innocent people ( mostly Muslim men ) in US courts and holding them as political prisoners ; -- constructing US - based concentration camps for declared enemies of the state to be used if martial law is declared ; -- using NORTHCOM , DHS , CIA , FBI , NSA and private paramilitary security forces to militarize the continent ; and -- ending the rule of law , crushing any sense of democracy , and heading the country for tyranny .
Instituting the above fell to a small group of lawyers known as the " War Council . "
Also other select high - level officials reporting to Dick Cheney and George Bush as head co-conspirators .
They seized on 9/11 to establish what David Addington called a " new paradigm " authorizing vast new executive powers in the " war on terror . "
They believe the US legal system is " a burden " to be countered by " error - prone legal decisions whose preordained conclusions were dictated by Addington " as Dick Cheney 's legal counsel following Lewis Libby 's resignation .
Their view is hard - line and simple .
On matters of national security ( meaning anything ) , presidential authority is n't " limited by any laws . "
It 's empowered " to override existing laws that Congress had specifically designated to curb him " and thus render checks and balances and the Constitution null and void .
For these men , everything changed post - 9/11 .
The gloves came off .
Conventional law enforcement methods were inappropriate , and only global conflict without end can keep us safe .
It sounds bizarre and like the ravings of madmen , and maybe to a degree they are .
But very smart and cunning ones who 've led us to the current brink .
In 2001 , Max Waxman served as special assistant to then national security adviser Condoleezza Rice .
He told Mayer that the decision to go to war ( post - 9/11 ) was made with " little or no detailed deliberation about long - term consequences " because none were thought necessary .
But it set us on " a course not only for our international response , but also in our domestic constitutional relations . "
It also worked for the executive as a wartime commander - in - chief with considerable help from Congress , the courts , and the media .
It left him free from accountability after what Mayer calls " the worst intelligence failure in the nation 's history . "
Others see it differently - in " deep state " terms as Peter Dale Scott defines it .
He refers to facts in every society and culture " which tend to be suppressed because of the social and psychological costs of not doing so . "
In other words , covert criminal policies , unaccountable , lawless and self - serving that hide disturbing truths like both Kennedy and King assassinations , the Korean and Vietnam wars , and the more recent 9/11 event .
The War Council was n't concerned if extremist policies were banned .
Only security matters and supreme presidential power .
A discussion of policy was missing , according to Mayer , " not just ( about ) what was legal , but what was moral , ethical , right , and smart to do . "
These were peripheral matters because " fundamentally , the drive for expanded presidential authority was about ( unlimited ) power " outside of the law .
Prior to her book 's release , she wrote articles for The New Yorker on torture , and her book is largely based on them .
One on November 14 , 2005 was titled " A Deadly Interrogation - Can the CIA legally kill a prisoner ? "
It was about CIA officer Mark Swanner who " performed interrogations and polygraph tests for the Agency .... "
In 2003 , an Iraqi Abu Ghraib prisoner in his custody , Manadel al - Jamadi , died during an interrogation .
His head was covered with a plastic bag .
It inhibited his breathing , and according to forensic pathologists , he suffocated .
Subsequently US authorities " classified Jamadi 's death as a ' homocide . ' " Yet Swanner was n't charged and continued to work for the Agency .
Post - 9/11 , the DOJ " fashioned secret legal guidelines that appear to indemnify CIA officials who perform aggressive , even violent interrogations outside the United States " - to win the " war on terror . "
In 2001 , Dick Cheney condoned it in a Meet the Press interview saying :
We may have to go to " the dark side " in handling terrorist suspects .
" It 's going to be vital .... to use any means at our disposal . "
Subsequently , administration officials sought to turn the CIA loose and protect its " classified interrogation protocol . "
The idea was to give the Agency " flexibility " to make " cruel , inhuman and degrading " treatment permissible .
It means anything goes regardless of US and international laws and norms .
Another Mayer article appeared on August 13 , 2007 titled : " The Black Sites - A rare look inside the CIA 's secret interrogation program . "
In military terminology , such sites are locations where " black " projects are conducted .
Post - 9/11 , they refer to secret CIA or military prisons outside the country with no oversight , accountability , detainee rights , and where torture and abuse are freely practiced .
Mayer discussed the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , an Al Queda leader , supposed lead architect of the 9/11 attacks , and the CIA 's claim that he confessed to killing Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl .
No evidence supported it , and Mayer called his confession " perplexing . "
He had no lawyer , was detained at black sites for over two years , and in 2006 was sent to Guantanamo .
No one witnessed his confession , and it was certain he was tortured .
It was also at the time of the US Attorney scandal when critics called for Gonzales ' resignation .
Further , in 2002 , a Pakistani named Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh had already been convicted of Pearl 's abduction and murder , but that hardly mattered to US authorities .
They continued to interrogate Mohammed .
It was part of a secret CIA program in which detainees were held in " black sites " outside the country - out of sight , out of mind , and subject to " unusually harsh treatment . "
In 2006 , the program was supposedly suspended when George Bush said CIA detainees were being sent to Guantanamo .
It followed the June 2006 Hamdan v. Rumsfeld Supreme Court ruling granting habeas rights to Guantanamo prisoners .
It also acknowledged that Geneva 's Common Article 3 was violated .
The October 2006 Military Commissions
Act followed .
It overrode the High Court to allow " alternative interrogations methods " to continue .
Secrecy and unlimited presidential authority are the hallmarks of this administration so everything in the " war on terror " is classified and permissible .
Even few congressional members know much , and those who do wo n't say , let alone act to uphold the law .
Mayer notes how since the 1949 Geneva Conventions , the ICRC " played a special role in safeguarding " prisoner rights .
" For decades , governments allowed ( their ) officials ( access to ) detainees , to insure that ( proper treatment was ) being maintained . "
However , Red Cross personnel were denied permission to interview US prisoners for five years .
When they finally saw Mohammed , a spokesman declined to comment because ICRC 's work is confidential .
Nonetheless , information leaked out to confirm what 's now known .
CIA interrogation methods are " tantamount to torture , and ( responsible ) American officials .... could have committed serious crimes . "
Other Geneva breaches also along with violations of US law .
Mayer characterized ICRC 's revelations as having " potentially devastating legal ramifications . "
She also mentions an unnamed CIA officer , supportive of current policy , but worried that " if the full story of the CIA program ever surfaced , Agency personnel could face criminal prosecution . "
Within CIA , he said , there 's a " high level of anxiety about political retribution " regarding the interrogation program .
Some CIA operatives even took out liability insurance to help defray potential legal bills .
Others saw the operation as a " can of worms ( that might ) become an atrocious mess . "
Based on Mayer 's account , it 's far more than that - a systematic scheme to rewrite laws and norms ; to make any practice permissible ; to break and destroy human beings through intense coercion and psychological stress - without letup ; and to avoid all accountability .
Regarding torture : " It 's one of the most sophisticated , refined programs ever , " one expert explained .
" At every stage , there was a rigid attention to detail ....
It was almost automated .
People were utterly dehumanized .
( They ) fell apart .
It was the intentional and systematic infliction of great suffering masquerading as a legal process .
It is just chilling . "
Mohammed 's case is typical and shows what he was put through when accounts of his ordeal leaked out .
Initially he was told : " We 're not going to kill you .
But we 're going to take you to the brink of your death and back . "
He was first taken to a secret Afghanistan prison near Kabul International Airport - distinctive for its absolute lack of light and known by detainees as the " Dark Prison . "
Another one north of Kabul was called the " Salt Pit . "
An infamous 2002 death occurred there when a detainee was stripped naked and left chained to the floor in freezing temperatures until he died .
Mohammed endured some of these abusive practices .
He was taken to Afghanistan by a team of " black - masked commandos attached to the CIA 's paramilitary Special Activities Division . "
According to a report titled " Secret Detentions and Illegal Transfers of Detainees , " he and others were " taken to their cells by strong people ( in ) black outfits , masks that covered their whole faces and dark visors over their eyes . "
It was a carefully choreographed 20 minute routine during which detainees are " hog-tied , stripped naked , photographed , hooded , sedated with anal suppositories ( amounting to sodomy ) , placed in diapers , and transported by plane to a secret location . "
Stripping demonstrates the captors ' omnipotence and and debilitates detainees .
Interrogators were advised to " tear clothing from ( them ) by firmly pulling downward against buttons and seams .... pulling detainees off balance . "
Techniques also include the " Shoulder Slap , Stomach Slap , Hooding , Manhandling , Walling , " and a variety of " Stress Positions . "
Mohammed said he was placed in his own cell , kept naked for several days , and questioned by female interrogators for added humiliation .
He was also attached to a dog leash and yanked to propel him into walls in his cell .
In addition , he was suspended from the ceiling by his arms so that his toes barely touched the ground and he was unable to sleep .
It caused intense pain and swelling to his legs .
He may have also been beaten with electric cables , commonly used against other detainees .
Some also got repeated electric shocks .
Mohammed further described being chained naked to a metal ring in his cell in a painful crouch - for prolonged periods in alternating intense heat and extreme cold when he was doused with ice water , a banned practice that can cause hypothermia .
Other detainees were bombarded with deafening sounds round the clock for weeks or even months .
This and other practices went on endlessly , and its effect was shattering .
Detainees " lost their minds . "
You could " hear people knocking their heads against walls and doors , screaming their heads off . "
Attempted suicides were common , and some succeeded .
Mohammed was later secretly taken to a " specially designated ( Polish ) prison for high - value detainees . "
Up to a dozen others like him were there , but no first - hand accounts emerged of what happened .
However , " well - informed sources " said it was far more high - tech than in Afghanistan - including hydraulic doors , video surveillance and more .
From what 's known from others who were there , Mohammed was kept in a prolonged state of sensory deprivation , perhaps as long as four months .
He was also waterboarded multiple times .
There was no exposure to natural light , and the only human contact was with silent masked guards .
The ICRC report seemed to confirm that he was kept shackled and naked , except for a pair of goggles and earmuffs .
Meals came sporadically to keep prisoners disoriented .
It was largely tasteless and barely enough to sustain him .
Under this type treatment , virtually everyone breaks down , and Mohammed was no exception .
He ended up confessing to so many crimes , he was barely credible .
In addition to the Pearl murder , he said he planned to assassinate Presidents Clinton and Carter , Pope John Paul II and a great deal more , including plots to blow up New York suspension bridges and the Panama Canal - anything to end the pain .
Later on , like many other detainees , he said he lied " to please his captors . "
As for taking blame for Daniel Pearl 's killing , one of Pearl 's friends said : " I 'm not interested in unfair justice , even for bad people .
Danny was such a person of conscience .
I do n't think he would have wanted all of this dirty business .
I do n't think he would have wanted someone being tortured .
He would have been repulsed . "
So are all people of conscience at a grim time in our history .
Mayer recounts Mohammed 's ordeal as well as Abu Zubaydah 's and others in her book .
She also notes that Dick Cheney " saw to it that some of the sharpest and best - trained lawyers in the country , working in secret in the White House and US Department of Justice , came up with legal justifications for a vast expansion of the government 's power in waging war on terror .
As part of the process , for the first time in history , the United States sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment US - held captives , making torture the official law of the land in all but name . "
This " extralegal counterterrorism program presented the most dramatic , sustained , and radical challenge to the rule of law in American history . "
The Bush White House adopted a " doctrine of presidential prerogative . "
It functions in secret and allows no challenge to its authority .
In the " war on terror , " everything is permissible even against innocent victims .
And Mayer found there are many .
She revealed a classified 2002 CIA report stating that one - third of Guantanamo 's 600 prisoners ( at the time ) have no connection to terrorism .
In fact , the number was far higher as most sent there were snatched randomly for bounty and victimized by being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Major General Michael Dunlavey agreed and suggested up to half of Guantanamo detainees were innocent of any crime .
A Seton Hall University Law School study put the number even higher .
CIA , however , later lowered their estimate to 50 unjustifiably detained .
But either way it contradicted the administration 's claim that Guantanamo held " the worst of the worst " even though most never were charged with a crime and none so far have been tried .
They continue being held at black holes sites , totally outside the law , and for most without any hope again for a normal life .
After what they 've endured , that 's impossible .
It 's America 's darkest hour , and Mayer powerfully recounts it .
Late News on Torture Victims Salim Hamdan was captured during the Afghanistan invasion , held at Guantanamo , and accused of being Osama bin Laden 's personal driver .
After US District Court judge James Robertson 's July 17 ruling ( that may be appealed in light of the Boumediene decision ) , he 'll be the first detainee tried by a military commission ( possibly beginning July 21 ) in which he 'll receive no due process and no hope for judicial fairness .
On July 15 , he testified at a pretrial hearing and described everyday life at Guantanamo - a six year ordeal of interrogation , torture , isolation , sexual humiliation and more .
A snapshot follows : -- his " confessions " were made under extreme duress - torture ; his lawyer is trying to exclude them from trial ; there 's practically no chance he 'll succeed ; -- " Camp Echo , " where was held , " is like a graveyard where you place a dead person in a tomb ; " -- according to prosecutors , he was disciplined 84 times ; his counsel said 15 were for trying to speak to other detainees - " through walls , through vents and in the recreation yard ; " -- he described an interrogation by a woman who touched his thigh and groin area ; " She behaved in an improper way ;
She came very close with her whole body towards me .
I could n't do anything ; " -- he described months in isolation , multiple episodes of sleep deprivation , including Operation Sandman for 50 days in 2003 , and being force - fed - by military personnel in white coats ; they strapped him down and snaked a tube through his nose to his stomach ; " Doctors , butchers , I could n't tell the difference ; " it 's a very painful procedure ; -- during one month of FBI interrogation , guards rapped on his cell door every five to ten minutes all night to wake him ; -- a tape of his first interrogation was revealed ; he said he was a Muslim charity worker , not a bin Laden employee ; nonetheless he underwent harsh battlefield questioning with his arms and legs bound , a soldier 's boot on his shoulder to keep his head bowed , and a " bag over my head ; " -- he described persistent back pain and no medical treatment ; -- he 's charged with transporting weapons for Al Queda and helping bin Laden escape after 9/11 ; he calls himself a Muslim charity worker , not a terrorist ; a judge in Washington will shortly rule on whether he should be tried in federal court ; on July 14 , several hundred current and former European officials asked the judge to block the military tribunal saying it was " clearly at odds with the most basic norms of fair trial and due process . "
In another July 15 development , the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals made two rulings , both 5 - 4 .
One ( reversing a June 2007 three - judge panel decision ) allows the Bush administration to order indefinite military detentions of civilians captured in the US .
A second held that Ali al - Marri , a Qatar citizen held at the Charleston , SC naval brig , may challenge his detention in federal court but will remain imprisoned without charge .
The decision is disturbing because the court was vague about about what type new proceeding is allowed .
The Bush administration may also appeal to the Supreme Court so al - Marri and others like him remain in limbo .
He 's the only known person in mainland custody held as an " unlawful enemy combatant . "
Defense intelligence official , Jeffrey Rapp , calls him ( without evidence ) an Al Queda " sleeper agent " sent to America to commit mass murder and disrupt the banking system .
He was arrested in Peoria , IL where he lived with his family .
His lawyer , Jonathan Hafetz , called the court 's decision disturbing .
It means " the president can pick up any person in the country - citizen or legal resident - and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the Constitution , the right to a ( fair and speedy ) criminal trial . "
Final Comments
On February 17 , 2008 in a New York Times Op - Ed , Air Force Colonel Morris Davis , former chief Guantanamo military commissions prosecutor , went public .
He resigned last year because political operatives and military superiors pushed prosecutors to file charges before trial rules were written .
He also called the tribunals tainted by political influence and by evidence obtained through torture .
He further accused Pentagon general counsel , William Haynes II , of saying detainee acquittals would make the US look bad .
" We can't have acquittals , we 've got to have convictions . "
In 2004 , three other prosecutors also quit , calling the process rigged .
Davis explained his prosecutorial standard - " that evidence derived through waterboarding was off limits .
That should still be our policy .
To do otherwise is not only an affront to American justice , it will potentially put prosecutors at risk for using illegally obtained evidence . "
" Unfortunately , I was overruled .... and I resigned my position to call attention to the issue - efforts that were hampered by my being placed under a gag rule and ordered not to testify at a Senate hearing .
While some high - level military and civilian officials have rightly expressed indignation on the issue , the current state can be described generally as indifference and inaction ....
Military justice has a proud history ; this was not one of its finer moments . "
Guantanamo convictions are only justifiable " after trials we can truthfully call full , fair and open .
In that service , we must declare that evidence obtained by waterboarding be banned in every American system of justice . "
Hopefully he means all evidence gotten through torture and abuse .
On another matter following the Supreme Court 's important June 12 Boumediene v. Bush decision , the administration is reportedly preparing to transfer Guantanamo 's remaining 265 detainees to mainland locations .
Boumediene overrode the 2006 Military Commissions
Act by ruling Guantanamo prisoners have habeas rights and can challenge their detention in civil courts .
The administration has several choices .
It can stall , ignore the Court , act as reportedly rumored , or ask Congress to pass new supportive legislation .
Currently around 80 detainees are to be tried in military commissions .
Another 65 can be repatriated home , leaving 120 others .
According to Boumediene , they all have habeas rights unless Bush administration officials obstruct justice to prevent it .
Given what they 've done , a smooth road to justice is far from certain .
George Bush was noncommittal about Boumediene saying only that the ruling was being analyzed .
Both presidential candidates favor closing Guantanamo , then transferring prisoners to US military prisons .
Fort Leavenworth , Kansas is a likely possibility .
Another issues involves " prison ships , " and in 2005 , the UN's Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter - Terrorism took note .
He spoke of " very , very serious " allegations that the US was secretly detaining terrorist suspects aboard special ships at various locations around the world , notably in the Indian Ocean .
The UK legal action charity , Reprieve , believes up to 17 floating prisons are involved where detainees are held under torturous conditions and subjected to harsh and brutal treatment , in some cases worse than Guantanamo .
Details have emerged from US administration and military sources as well as the Council of Europe , various parliamentary bodies , journalists , and former prisoner testimonies .
The USS Bataan is one ship mentioned , and a former Guantanamo detainee described his treatment on board .
About 50 in total were there .
They were closed off in the ship 's bottom area and beaten more severely than at Camp X - Ray .
Reprieve 's Director , Clive Stafford Smith , said : " The US administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers .
We will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their human rights . "
" By its own admission , the US government is currently detaining at least 26,000 people without trial in secret prisons , and information suggests up to 80,000 have been ' through the system ' since 2001 .
The US government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are , where they are , and what has been done to them . "
The Bush administration 's response so far : silence .
Leaving aside other countries , America , to some degree , has practiced torture for many decades , and especially since the CIA 's establishment in 1947 .
During the Vietnam War , Paul Blackstock wrote an essay titled the " Moral Implications of Torture and Exemplary Assassination " for the Carnegie Council On Ethics and International Affairs .
He described widespread CIA and special forces torture saying this policy created a situation wherein " for the majority of private individuals ( the ) intolerable ( became ) tolerable . "
That 's the situation today in the Middle East , Central Asia , Guantanamo , on prison ships , and at all secret US black sites worldwide .
Unless exposed , denounced and stopped , it 's heading to mainland America and maybe a neighborhood near you .
It 's no idle threat given that , on July 14 , the ACLU revealed that the nation 's terrorist watch list hit one million names - based on the government 's own reported numbers .
It 's also symbolic of what 's wrong with " this administration 's approach to security - unfair , out - of - control , a waste of resources , ( treating ) the rights of the innocent as an afterthought , " and recklessly endangering what little freedom remains .
Even worse , by Bush administration standards , there is none .

As mentioned previously , some players maintain the distinction between player knowledge and character knowledge very faithfully .
But if you 're clever , there will arise certain situations in which you can do something completely in character , that makes perfect sense without the player knowledge , and which forces the issue into the open .
If you pull this off , though , there is the strong temptation to do some out - of - character crowing .

Goes along with what I was saying on CNN last night .
I think it ’s always about your gut , not your head , when voters judge presidential candidates .
It was okay for Obama to be wonky because voters want wonk after 8 years of dumb .
When your life savings is on the line , when you ’re calling the bank to see if your money is insured just in case there ’s another Great Depression , you want the biggest geek you can find to take over the presidency .
And while I would n’t call Obama THAT , he ’s clearly far more intelligent – and reassuring – than some guy who looks a little too old and a lot too angry .
More from Fallows :
Everything John McCain did on stage last night was consistent with trying to score tactical points in those 90 minutes .
He belittled Obama with the repeated “ he does n’t understand ”s ; he was explicitly insulting to him in saying at the end “ I honestly do n’t believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience ” for the job ( a line Joe Biden dare not use so bluntly on Sarah Palin ) ; and implicitly he was shockingly rude and dismissive in refusing ever to look Obama in the eye .
Points scored — in the short term , to the cheers of those already on his side .
Obama would have pleased his base better if he had fought back more harshly in those 90 minutes — cutting McCain off , delivering a similarly harsh closing judgment , using comparably hostile body language , and in general acting more like a combative House of Commons debater .
Those would have been effective tactics minute by minute .
But Obama either figured out , or instinctively understood , that the real battle was to make himself seem comfortable , reasonable , responsible , well - versed , and in all ways “ safe ” and non-outsiderish to the audience just making up its mind about him .
( And yes , of course , his being a young black man challenging an older white man complicated everything he did and said , which is why his most wittily aggressive debate performance was against another black man , Alan Keyes , in his 2004 Senate race . )
The evidence of the polls suggests that he achieved exactly this strategic goal .
He was the more “ likeable , ” the more knowledgeable , the more temperate , etc .
Update : though he does n’t have to say “ John is right … ” ever again during this campaign .
For years and years , Democrats have wondered how their candidates could “ win ” the debates on logical points — that is , tactics — but lose the larger struggle because these seemed too aggressive , supercilious , cold - blooded , or whatever .
To put it in tactical / strategic terms , Democrats have gotten used to winning battles and losing wars .
Last night , the Democratic candidate showed a far keener grasp of this distinction than did the Republican who accused him of not understanding it .
The Royal Society of London planned an event to celebrate the tercentenary of Isaac Newton 's birth in 1942 .
However World War II made it essentially impossible and the celebrations did not take place until July 1946 .
Lectures were given by E N da Costa Andrade , H W Turnbull , Niels Bohr and Jacques Hadamard .
John Maynard Keynes had also been invited to lecture but unfortunately he died in April 1946 , three months before the celebrations took place .
Keynes was fascinated by Newton 's manuscripts and had been the first person to see some of the manuscript material by Newton which had been kept secret until his papers were sold in 1936 .
Keynes ' lecture , Newton , the man was delivered at the celebrations by his brother Geoffrey Keynes .

It is with some diffidence that I try to speak to you in his own home of Newton as he was himself .
I have long been a student of the records and had the intention to put my impressions into writing to be ready for Christmas Day , the tercentenary of his birth .
The war has deprived me both of leisure to treat adequately so great a theme and of opportunity to consult my library and my papers and to verify my impressions .
So if the brief study which I shall lay before you today is more perfunctory than it should be , I hope you will excuse me .
One other preliminary matter .
I believe that Newton was different from the conventional picture of him .
But I do not believe he was less great .
He was less ordinary , more extraordinary , than the nineteenth century cared to make him out .
Geniuses are very peculiar .
Let no one here suppose that my object today is to lessen , by describing , Cambridge 's greatest son .
I am trying rather to see him as his own friends and contemporaries saw him .
And they without exception regarded him as one of the greatest of men .
In the eighteenth century and since , Newton came to be thought of as the first and greatest of the modern age of scientists , a rationalist , one who taught us to think on the lines of cold and untinctured reason .
I do not see him in this light .
I do not think that any one who has pored over the contents of that box which he packed up when he finally left Cambridge inand which , though partly dispersed , have come down to us , can see him like that .
Newton was not the first of the age of reason .
He was the last of the magicians , the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians , the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less thanyears ago .
Isaac Newton , a posthumous child bom with no father on Christmas Day , , was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage .
Had there been time , I should have liked to read to you the contemporary record of the child Newton .
For , though it is well known to his biographers , it has never been published in extenso , without comment , just as it stands .
Here , indeed , is the makings of a legend of the young magician , a most joyous picture of the opening mind of genius free from the uneasiness , the melancholy and nervous agitation of the young man and student .
For in vulgar modern terms Newton was profoundly neurotic of a not unfamiliar type , but - I should say from the records - a most extreme example .
His deepest instincts were occult , esoteric , semantic - with profound shrinking from the world , a paralyzing fear of exposing his thoughts , his beliefs , his discoveries in all nakedness to the inspection and criticism of the world .
' Of the most fearful , cautious and suspicious temper that I ever knew ' , said Whiston , his successor in the Lucasian Chair .
The too well - known conflicts and ignoble quarrels with Hooke , Flamsteed , Leibniz are only too clear an evidence of this .
Like all his type he was wholly aloof from women .
He parted with and published nothing except under the extreme pressure of friends .
Until the second phase of his life , he was a wrapt , consecrated solitary , pursuing his studies by intense introspection with a mental endurance perhaps never equalled .
I believe that the clue to his mind is to be found in his unusual powers of continuous concentrated introspection .
A case can be made out , as it also can with Descartes , for regarding him as an accomplished experimentalist .
Nothing can be more charming than the tales of his mechanical contrivances when he was a boy .
There are his telescopes and his optical experiments ,
These were essential accomplishments , part of his unequalled all - round technique , but not , I am sure , his peculiar gift , especially amongst his contemporaries .
His peculiar gift was the power of holding continuously in his mind a purely mental problem until he had seen straight through it .
I fancy his pre-eminence is due to his muscles of intuition being the strongest and most enduring with which a man has ever been gifted .
Anyone who has ever attempted pure scientific or philosophical thought knows how one can hold a problem momentarily in one 's mind and apply all one 's powers of concentration to piercing through it , and how it will dissolve and escape and you find that what you are surveying is a blank .
I believe that Newton could hold a problem in his mind for hours and days and weeks until it surrendered to him its secret .
Then being a supreme mathematical technician he could dress it up , how you will , for purposes of exposition , but it was his intuition which was pre-eminently extraordinary - ' so happy in his conjectures ' , said De Morgan , 'as to seem to know more than he could possibly have any means of proving ' .
The proofs , for what they are worth , were , as I have said , dressed up afterwards - they were not the instrument of discovery .
There is the story of how he informed Halley of one of his most fundamental discoveries of planetary motion .
' Yes , ' replied Halley , ' but how do you know that ?
Have you proved it ? '
Newton was taken aback - ' Why , I 've known it for years ' , he replied .
' If you 'll give me a few days , I 'll certainly find you a proof of it ' - as in due course he did .
Again , there is some evidence that Newton in preparing thewas held up almost to the last moment by lack of proof that you could treat a solid sphere as though all its mass was concentrated at the centre , and only hit on the proof a year before publication .
But this was a truth which he had known for certain and had always assumed for many years .
Certainly there can be no doubt that the peculiar geometrical form in which the exposition of theis dressed up bears no resemblance at all to the mental processes by which Newton actually arrived at his conclusions .
His experiments were always , I suspect , a means , not of discovery , but always of verifying what he knew already .
Why do I call him a magician ?
Because he looked on the whole universe and all that is in it as a riddle , as a secret which could be read by applying pure thought to certain evidence , certain mystic clues which God had laid about the world to allow a sort of philosopher 's treasure hunt to the esoteric brotherhood .
He believed that these clues were to be found partly in the evidence of the heavens and in the constitution of elementsand that is what gives the false suggestion of his being an experimental natural philosopher , but also partly in certain papers and traditions handed down by the brethren in an unbroken chain back to the original cryptic revelation in Babylonia .
He regarded the universe as a cryptogram set by the Almighty - just as he himself wrapt the discovery of the calculus in a cryptogram when he communicated with Leibniz .
By pure thought , by concentration of mind , the riddle , he believed , would be revealed to the initiate .
He did read the riddle of the heavens .
And he believed that by the same powers of his introspective imagination he would read the riddle of the Godhead , the riddle of past and future events divinely fore - ordained , the riddle of the elements and their constitution from an original undifferentiated first matter , the riddle of health and of immortality .
All would be revealed to him if only he could persevere to the end , uninterrupted , by himself , no one coming into the room , reading , copying , testing - all by himself , no interruption for God 's sake , no disclosure , no discordant breakings in or criticism , with fear and shrinking as he assailed these half - ordained , half - forbidden things , creeping back into the bosom of the Godhead as into his mother 's womb .
' Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone ' , not as Charles Lamb 'a fellow who believed nothing unless it was as clear as the three sides of a triangle ' .
And so he continued for some twenty - five years .
In , when he was forty - five years old , thewas published .
Here in Trinity it is right that I should give you an account of how he lived amongst you during these years of his greatest achievement .
The east end of the Chapel projects farther eastwards than the Great Gate .
In the second half of the seventeenth century there was a walled garden in the free space between Trinity Street and the building which joins the Great Gate to the Chapel .
The south wall ran out from the turret of the Gate to a distance overlapping the Chapel by at least the width of the present pavement .
Thus the garden was of modest but reasonable size .
This was Newton 's garden .
He had the Fellow 's set of rooms between the Porter 's Lodge and the Chapel - that , I suppose , now occupied by Professor Broad .
The garden was reached by a stairway which was attached to a veranda raised on wooden pillars projecting into the garden from the range of buildings .
At the top of this stairway stood his telescope - not to be confused with the observatory erected on the top of the Great Gate during Newton 's lifetimebut after he had left Cambridgefor the use of Roger Cotes and Newton 's successor , Whiston .
This wooden erection was , I think , demolished by Whewell inand replaced by the stone bay of Professor Broad 's bedroom .
At the Chapel end of the garden was a small two - storied building , also of wood , which was his elaboratory .
When he decided to prepare thefor publication he engaged a young kinsman , Humphrey Newton , to act as his amanuensisthe MS. of theas it went to the press , is clearly in the hand of Humphrey .
Humphrey remained with him for five years - fromto .
When Newton died Humphrey 's son- in - law Conduitt wrote to him for his reminiscences , and among the papers I have is Humphrey 's reply .
During these twenty - five years of intense study mathematics and astronomy were only a part , and perhaps not the most absorbing , of his occupations .
Our record of these is almost wholly confined to the papers which he kept and put in his box when he left Trinity for London .
Let me give some brief indications of their subject .
They are enormously voluminous - I should say that upwards ofwords in his handwriting still survive .
They have , beyond doubt , no substantial value whatever except as a fascinating sidelight on the mind of our greatest genius .
Let me not exaggerate through reaction against the other Newton myth which has been so sedulously created for the last two hundred years .
There was extreme method in his madness .
All his unpublished works on esoteric and theological matters are marked by careful learning , accurate method and extreme sobriety of statement .
They are just as sane as theif their whole matter and purpose were not magical .
They were nearly all composed during the same twenty - five years of his mathematical studies .
They fall into several groups .
Very early in life Newton abandoned orthodox belief in the Trinity .
At this time the Socinians were an important Arian sect amongst intellectual circles .
It may be that Newton fell under Socinian influences , but I think not .
He was rather a Judaic monotheist of the school of Maimonides .
He arrived at this conclusion , not on so - to - speak rational or sceptical grounds , but entirely on the interpretation of ancient authority .
He was persuaded that the revealed documents give no support to the Trinitarian doctrines which were due to late falsifications .
The revealed God was one God .
But this was a dreadful secret which Newton was at desperate pains to conceal all his life .
It was the reason why he refused Holy Orders , and therefore had to obtain a special dispensation to hold his Fellowship and Lucasian Chair and could not be Master of Trinity .
Even the Toleration Act ofexcepted anti-Trinitarians .
Some rumours there were , but not at the dangerous dates when he was a young Fellow of Trinity .
In the main the secret died with him .
But it was revealed in many writings in his , big box .
After his death Bishop Horsley was asked to inspect the box with a view to publication .
He saw the contents with horror and slammed the lid .
A hundred years later Sir David Brewster looked into the box .
He covered up the traces with carefully selected extracts and some straight fibbing .
His latest biographer , Mr More , has been more candid .
Newton 's extensive anti-Trinitarian pamphlets are , in my judgement , the most interesting of his unpublished papers .
Apart from his more serious affirmation of belief , I have a completed pamphlet showing up what Newton thought of the extreme dishonesty and falsification of records for which St Athanasius was responsible , in particular for his putting about the false calumny that Arius died in a privy .
The victory of the Trinitarians in England in the latter half of the seventeenth century was not only as complete , but also as extraordinary , as St Athanasius 's original triumph .
There is good reason for thinking that Locke was a Unitarian .
I have seen it argued that Milton was .
It is a blot on Newton 's record that he did not murmur a word when Whiston , his successor in the Lucasian Chair , was thrown out of his professorship and out of the University for publicly avowing opinions which Newton himself had secretly held for upwards of fifty years past .
That he held this heresy was a further aggravation of his silence and secrecy and inwardness of disposition .
Another large section is concerned with all branches of apocalyptic writings from which he sought to deduce the secret truths of the Universe - the measurements of Solomon 's Temple , the Book of David , the Book of Revelations , an enormous volume of work of which some part was published in his later days .
Along with this are hundreds of pages of Church History and the like , designed to discover the truth of tradition .
A large section , judging by the handwriting amongst the earliest , relates to alchemy - transmutation , the philosopher 's stone , the elixir of life .
The scope and character of these papers have been hushed up , or at least minimized , by nearly all those who have inspected them .
Aboutthere was a considerable group in London , round the publisher Cooper , who during the next twenty years revived interest not only in the English alchemists of the fifteenth century , but also in translations of the medieval and post - medieval alchemists .
There is an unusual number of manuscripts of the early English alchemists in the libraries of Cambridge .
It may be that there was some continuous esoteric tradition within the University which sprang into activity again in the twenty years fromto .
At any rate , Newton was clearly an unbridled addict .
It is this with which he was occupied ' aboutweeks at spring andat the fall when the fire in the elaboratory scarcely went out ' at the very years when he was composing the - and about this he told Humphrey Newton not a word .
Moreover , he was almost entirely concerned , not in serious experiment , but in trying to read the riddle of tradition , to find meaning in cryptic verses , to imitate the alleged but largely imaginary experiments of the initiates of past centuries .
Newton has left behind him a vast mass of records of these studies .
I believe that the greater part are translations and copies made by him of existing books and manuscripts .
But there are also extensive records of experiments .
I have glanced through a great quantity of this at leastwords , I should say .
It is utterly impossible to deny that it is wholly magical and wholly devoid of scientific value ; and also impossible not to admit that Newton devoted years of work to it .
Some time it might be interesting , but not useful , for some student better equipped and more idle than I to work out Newton 's exact relationship to the tradition and MSS .
of his time .
In these mixed and extraordinary studies , with one foot in the Middle Ages and one foot treading a path for modern science , Newton spent the first phase of his life , the period of life in Trinity when he did all his real work .
Now let me pass to the second phase .
After the publication of thethere is a complete change in his habit and way of life .
I believe that his friends , above all Halifax , came to the conclusion that he must be rooted out of the life he was leading at Trinity which must soon lead to decay of mind and health .
Broadly speaking , of his own motion or under persuasion , he abandons his studies .
He takes up University business , represents the University in Parliament ; his friends are busy trying to get a dignified and remunerative job for him - the Provostship of King's , the Mastership of Charterhouse , the Controllership of the Mint .
Newton could not be Master of Trinity because he was a Unitarian and so not in Holy Orders .
He was rejected as Provost of King 's for the more prosaic reason that he was not an Etonian .
Newton took this rejection very ill and prepared a long legalistic brief , which I possess , giving reasons why it was not unlawful for him to be accepted as Provost .
But , as ill - luck had it , Newton 's nomination for the Provostship came at the moment when King 's had decided to fight against the right of Crown nomination , a struggle in which the College was successful .
Newton was well qualified for any of these offices .
It must not be inferred from his introspection , his absent - mindedness , his secrecy and his solitude that he lacked aptitude for affairs when he chose to exercise it .
There are many records to prove his very great capacity .
Read , for example , his correspondence with Dr Covell , the Vice - Chancellor when , as the University 's representative in Parliament , he had to deal with the delicate question of the oaths after the revolution of .
With Pepys and Lowndes he became one of the greatest and most efficient of our civil servants .
He was a very successful investor of funds , surmounting the crisis of the South Sea Bubble , and died a rich man .
He possessed in exceptional degree almost every kind of intellectual aptitude - lawyer , historian , theologian , not less than mathematician , physicist , astronomer .
And when the turn of his life came and he put his books of magic back into the box , it was easy for him to drop the seventeenth century behind him and to evolve into the eighteenth - century figure which is the traditional Newton .
Nevertheless , the move on the part of his friends to change his life came almost too late .
Inhis mother , to whom he was deeply attached , died .
Somewhere about his fiftieth birthday on Christmas Day , he suffered what we should now term a severe nervous breakdown .
Melancholia , sleeplessness , fears of persecution - he writes to Pepys and to Locke and no doubt to others letters which lead them to think that his mind is deranged .
He lost , in his own words , the ' former consistency of his mind ' .
He never again concentrated after the old fashion or did any fresh work .
The breakdown probably lasted nearly two years , and from it emerged , slightly ' gaga ' , but still , no doubt , with one of the most powerful minds of England , the Sir Isaac Newton of tradition .
Inhis friends were finally successful in digging him out of Cambridge , and for more than another twenty years he reigned in London as the most famous man of his age , of Europe , and - as his powers gradually waned and his affability increased - perhaps of all time , so it seemed to his contemporaries .
He set up house with his niece Catharine Barton , who was beyond reasonable doubt the mistress of his old and loyal friend Charles Montague , Earl of Halifax and Chancellor of the Exchequer , who had been one of Newton 's intimate friends when he was an undergraduate at Trinity .
Catharine was reputed to be one of the most brilliant and charming women in the London of Congreve , Swift and Pope .
She is celebrated , not least for the broadness of her stories , in Swift's .
Newton puts on rather too much weight for his moderate height .
' When he rode in his coach one arm would be out of his coach on one side and the other on the other . '
His pink face , beneath a mass of snow - white hair , which ' when his peruke was off was a venerable sight ' , is increasingly both benevolent and majestic .
One night in Trinity after Hall he is knighted by Queen Anne .
For nearly twenty - four years he reigns as President of the Royal Society .
He becomes one of the principal sights of London for all visiting intellectual foreigners , whom he entertains handsomely .
He liked to have clever young men about him to edit new editions of the- and sometimes merely plausible ones as in the case of Facio de Duillier .
Magic was quite forgotten .
He has become the Sage and Monarch of the Age of Reason .
The Sir Isaac Newton of orthodox tradition - the eighteenth - century Sir Isaac , so remote from the child magician born in the first half of the seventeenth century - was being built up .
Voltaire returning from his trip to London was able to report of Sir Isaac - ' twas his peculiar felicity , not only to be born in a country of liberty , but in an Age when all scholastic impertinences were banished from the World .
Reason alone was cultivated and Mankind could only be his Pupil , not his Enemy . '
Newton , whose secret heresies and scholastic superstitions it had been the study of a lifetime to conceal !
But he never concentrated , never recovered ' the former consistency of his mind ' .
' He spoke very little in company . '
' He had something rather languid in his look and manner .
'And he looked very seldom , I expect , into the chest where , when he left Cambridge , he had packed all the evidences of what had occupied and so absorbed his intense and flaming spirit in his rooms and his garden and his elaboratory between the Great Gate and Chapel .
But he did not destroy them .
They remained in the box to shock profoundly any eighteenth - or nineteenth - century prying eyes .
They became the possession of Catharine Barton and then of her daughter , the Countess of Portsmouth .
So Newton 's chest , with many hundreds of thousands of words of his unpublished writings , came to contain the ' Portsmouth Papers ' .
Inthe mathematical portion was given to the University Library at Cambridge .
They have been indexed , but they have never been edited .
The rest , a very large collection , were dispersed in the auction room inby Catharine Barton 's descendant , the present Lord Lymington .
Disturbed by this impiety , I managed gradually to reassemble about half of them , including nearly the whole of the biographical portion , that is , the ' Conduitt Papers ' , in order to bring them to Cambridge which I hope they will never leave .
The greater part of the rest were snatched out of my reach by a syndicate which hoped to sell them at a high price , probably in America , on the occasion of the recent tercentenary .
As one broods over these queer collections , it seems easier to understand - with an understanding which is not , I hope , distorted in the other direction - this strange spirit , who was tempted by the Devil to believe at the time when within these walls he .
was solving so much , that he could reach all the secrets of God and Nature by the pure power of mind Copernicus and Faustus in one .
( CNN ) -- Presidential candidates Sen. John McCain -- who said Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign because of the nation 's economic crisis -- and Sen. Barack Obama will meet Thursday with President Bush to discuss a proposed Wall Street bailout .
McCain suspended his campaign , saying it was time for both parties to come together to solve economic crisis .
McCain and Obama accepted Bush 's invitation to discuss the proposed $ 700 billion bailout with him and congressional leaders at the White House , the candidates ' aides said Wednesday night .
Also Wednesday night , McCain and Obama said in a joint statement that the bailout plan was " flawed " but that " the effort to protect the American economy must not fail . "
" Now is a time to come together -- Democrats and Republicans -- in a spirit of cooperation for the sake of the American people , " read the statement , which was released about 15 minutes before Bush made a televised address on the economy .
Earlier Wednesday , McCain announced that he would suspend his campaign to go to Washington and participate in negotiations on the bailout plan , and he called for a postponement of Friday 's presidential debate .
Watch McCain 's announcement »
His campaign suggested that he would skip the debate if Congress had n't passed legislation addressing the crisis by then .
Obama , however , said the debate in Oxford , Mississippi , should go forward .
" It 's my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person will be the next president , " the Democrat said in Clearwater , Florida .
" It is going to be part of the president 's job to deal with more than one thing at once .
It 's more important than ever to present ourselves to the American people . "
The University of Mississippi , the host of Friday 's presidential debate , said it is going ahead with preparations for the event .
Watch Obama say debate should n't be postponed »
McCain 's suspension of his campaign hours before Bush 's address to the nation on the troubled state of the U.S. financial system , a problem for which Bush 's administration has proposed having the Treasury Department buy up to $ 700 billion in firms ' troubled assets -- mainly mortgage - backed securities -- whose values declined as the housing market imploded .
The plan 's goal is to stabilize the companies and prompt them to lend again .
Watch Bush 's address »
While McCain and Obama jointly called for bipartisan cooperation on the economic crisis , in a separate statement Obama outlined some principles he said should guide the legislation and called on McCain to support them .
Obama said the plan should help the " millions of families facing foreclosure " and not just Wall Street ; create " an independent , bipartisan board to ensure accountability and complete transparency " ; have Wall Street repay taxpayers for the bailout ; and have an independent , bipartisan board to oversee the bailout .
" This plan can not be a welfare program for CEOs whose greed and irresponsibility has contributed to this crisis , " Obama 's statement said .
Before Bush invited McCain and Obama to the White House , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issued a statement saying that the presidential debate should go on .
" If there were ever a time for both candidates to hold a debate before the American people about this serious challenge , it is now , " he added .
McCain senior adviser Mark Salter said that the campaign will suspend airing all ads and all campaign events pending Obama 's agreement .
Salter also said McCain called Bush and talked to colleagues in Washington and learned that passage of the bailout plan as it then stood was next to impossible .
Between McCain 's announcement and Bush 's speech , congressional leaders said progress has been made in negotiations .
" We agree that key changes should be made to the administration 's initial proposal , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican Leader John Boehner said in a joint statement .
" It must include basic good - government principles , including rigorous and independent oversight , strong executive compensation standards , and protection for taxpayers . "
Obama told reporters that before McCain suspended his campaign , he had called McCain on Wednesday to propose a joint statement of principles to govern the bailout .
McCain announced the campaign suspension shortly after their conversation , Obama said .
The joint statement came out hours later .
Sen . Chuck Schumer , D - New York , said McCain 's move was " just weird . "
" We have n't heard hide nor hair of Sen. McCain in these negotiations , " said Schumer , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
" He has not been involved except for an occasional , unhelpful statement , sort of thrown from far away , and the last thing we need in these delicate negotiations is an injection of presidential politics . "
Watch Schumer call McCain 's move " weird " »
But Sen. Lindsey Graham , a McCain ally , said that having the candidates join in negotiations over the bailout would be " enormously helpful . "
" We need a solution on this financial crisis more than we need a foreign policy debate , " said Graham , R - South Carolina .
" The next seven days could determine the financial well - being of this country .
We can postpone the debate for a week . "
And Rep. Roy Blunt , the Republicans '
House whip , said McCain 's decision " is a testament to the fact that [ he ] is a guy who would rather be part of the solution than run away from the fight . "
The bailout plan has met with a cool reception in two days of hearings on Capitol Hill , where both Democrats and Republicans have expressed skepticism about the proposal drafted by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
McCain said he believes that Congress could forge a consensus on legislation " before the markets open on Monday . "
Congress and the White House are trying to negotiate the details of what would be the most sweeping economic intervention by the government since the Great Depression .
Bush has asked Congress to act quickly on the bailout proposal after news of failing financial institutions and frozen credit markets .
" The clock is ticking on this crisis .
We have to act swiftly , but we also have to get it right , " Obama said Wednesday in Dunedin , Florida .
" And that means everyone -- Republicans and Democrats , and the White House and Congress -- must work together to come up with a solution that protects American taxpayers and our economy without rewarding those whose greed helped get us into this problem in the first place . "
iReport.com : Which candidate took the right approach ?
Obama said it 's unacceptable to expect the American people to " hand this administration or any administration a $ 700 billion check with no conditions and no oversight when a lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess . "
He said that struggling homeowners must be taken care of in any economic recovery plan -- and that taxpayers should " not be spending one dime to reward the same Wall Street CEOs whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess . "

Attacks , praise stretch truth at GOP convention Associated Press
Published : Thursday September 4 , 2008
Print This Email This ST .
PAUL , Minn . - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her Republican supporters held back little Wednesday as they issued dismissive attacks on Barack Obama and flattering praise on her credentials to be vice president .
In some cases , the reproach and the praise stretched the truth .
Some examples :
PALIN : " I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending ... and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
I told the Congress ' thanks but no thanks ' for that Bridge to Nowhere . "
THE FACTS : As mayor of Wasilla , Palin hired a lobbyist and traveled to Washington annually to support earmarks for the town totaling $ 27 million .
In her two years as governor , Alaska has requested nearly $ 750 million in special federal spending , by far the largest per-capita request in the nation .
While Palin notes she rejected plans to build a $ 398 million bridge from Ketchikan to an island with 50 residents and an airport , that opposition came only after the plan was ridiculed nationally as a " bridge to nowhere . "
PALIN : " There is much to like and admire about our opponent .
But listening to him speak , it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform  not even in the state senate . "
THE FACTS : Compared to McCain and his two decades in the Senate , Obama does have a more meager record .
But he has worked with Republicans to pass legislation that expanded efforts to intercept illegal shipments of weapons of mass destruction and to help destroy conventional weapons stockpiles .
The legislation became law last year .
To demean that accomplishment would be to also demean the work of Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , a respected foreign policy voice in the Senate .
In Illinois , he was the leader on two big , contentious measures in Illinois : studying racial profiling by police and requiring recordings of interrogations in potential death penalty cases .
He also successfully co-sponsored major ethics reform legislation .
PALIN : " The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes , raise payroll taxes , raise investment income taxes , raise the death tax , raise business taxes , and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars . "
THE FACTS : The Tax Policy Center , a think tank run jointly by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute , concluded that Obama 's plan would increase after - tax income for middle - income taxpayers by about 5 percent by 2012 , or nearly $ 2,200 annually .
McCain 's plan , which cuts taxes across all income levels , would raise after tax - income for middle - income taxpayers by 3 percent , the center concluded .
Obama would provide $ 80 billion in tax breaks , mainly for poor workers and the elderly , including tripling the Earned Income Tax Credit for minimum - wage workers and higher credits for larger families .
He also would raise income taxes , capital gains and dividend taxes on the wealthiest .
He would raise payroll taxes on taxpayers with incomes above $ 250,000 , and he would raise corporate taxes .
Small businesses that make more than $ 250,000 a year would see taxes rise .
MCCAIN : " She 's been governor of our largest state , in charge of 20 percent of America 's energy supply ...
She 's responsible for 20 percent of the nation 's energy supply .
I 'm entertained by the comparison and I hope we can keep making that comparison that running a political campaign is somehow comparable to being the executive of the largest state in America , " he said in an interview with ABC News ' Charles Gibson .
THE FACTS : McCain 's phrasing exaggerates both claims .
Palin is governor of a state that ranks second nationally in crude oil production , but she 's no more " responsible " for that resource than President Bush was when he was governor of Texas , another oil - producing state .
In fact , her primary power is the ability to tax oil , which she did in concert with the Alaska Legislature .
And where Alaska is the largest state in America , McCain could as easily have called it the 47th largest state  by population .
MCCAIN : " She 's the commander of the Alaska National Guard .
...
She has been in charge , and she has had national security as one of her primary responsibilities , " he said on ABC .
THE FACTS : While governors are in charge of their state guard units , that authority ends whenever those units are called to actual military service .
When guard units are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan , for example , they assume those duties under " federal status , " which means they report to the Defense Department , not their governors .
Alaska 's national guard units have a total of about 4,200 personnel , among the smallest of state guard organizations .
FORMER ARKANSAS GOV .
MIKE HUCKABEE : Palin " got more votes running for mayor of Wasilla , Alaska than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States . "
THE FACTS : A whopper .
Palin got 616 votes in the 1996 mayor 's election , and got 909 in her 1999 re-election race , for a total of 1,525 .
Biden dropped out of the race after the Iowa caucuses , but he still got 76,165 votes in 23 states and the District of Columbia where he was on the ballot during the 2008 presidential primaries .

GOV .
MITT ROMNEY : " We need change , all right  change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington !
We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington  throw out the big - government liberals , and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin . "
THE FACTS : A Back - to - the - Future moment .
George W. Bush , a conservative Republican , has been president for nearly eight years .
And until last year , Republicans controlled Congress .
Only since January 2007 have Democrats have been in charge of the House and Senate .
At the beginning of Games Convention wethat the 360 controller has received a subtle redesign .
The internal hardware of the d-pad has been reworked to provide for more accurate and responsive controls .
We spoke with Product Manager Michael Nagler here at the convention to find out a few more details .
He mentioned that the controller will be available in the middle of October in Germany in time for Pro Evolution 2009 .
GC attendees could get their hands on both unreleased products at the Konami booth on the show floor .
The redone design will only be available in the green color shown below ; the other colors are the old - school spongy models .
The improved d-pad will probably be rolled out to all future controller designs but we have yet to get any definite details on the either this or the US release .
Hear all about it in the latest Game Scoop !
News Break .
Having felt the eight - way input that takes the place of the old four way design we can safely say that the new hardware is an improvement .
Check out the image gallery for high resolution pictures but do n't be surprised if you can't find any visual differences between the two models .

Reading the news and scratching my head .
That 's what I have been doing as reports about Georgia , Russia , and South Ossetia populate the Internet .
As usual , there are a myriad of economic lessons underlying the event that can be found beneath the official interpretations offered by the principals and their functionaries in the media .
But first , let us be clear about what has happened .
In recent years , the United States has been providing military aid and advice to an increasingly militaristic Georgia , whose military budget has increased 30 fold since 2003 ( much to the chagrin , I am sure , of the Georgian taxpayer ) .
US intelligence services played a fundamental role in the 2004 election of its pro-Western president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who , in turn , has been aggressively courting Georgian membership in NATO .
None of these developments have been exactly welcomed by the Russians , who share a huge border with Georgia and run important natural - gas pipelines through the region .
To understand why , Americans should consider how the US government would react if ( say ) Texas declared its independence and received massive amounts of military aid and advice from the Russians , all while the Texas president feted his Russian counterpart at state dinners in Austin and promoted Texan membership in a post–Cold War Warsaw Pact that had already expanded greatly in the previous 15 years .
Throw into the volatile mix the region of South Ossetia , which I admit to never having heard of before Friday ( frankly , its name reminds me of a Miami avenue ) .
It is a region within Georgia that has long resisted consolidation by the Georgian state , preferring to secede from it as Georgia seceded from Russia .
Over the years , Georgia objected to South Ossetia 's right to self - government , and while much of the world 's attention was on Olympic opening ceremonies in Beijing , the Georgian government decided to take the region by force .
The Russian government , caught unawares , objected .
And so we have the tragic situation that is playing itself out today .
To me , the economic lessons dominate .
First , what of the incredible human and physical cost of such activities ?
Those tanks and men we see slogging between towns and villages carry huge opportunity costs .
War materiel and the troops who operate it have alternative uses in the market , and it represents a tremendous social failure when they are employed for destructive purposes .
This applies to all military activities and is uniquely engineered by governments .
( By all accounts , Georgian and South Ossetian people coexisted peacefully and are today angry at the Georgian and Russian states for allowing their belligerent stances to lead to war . )
But more than this , the loss of human life is the greatest cost .
What activities and contributions are foregone when a small child dies after a Russian or Georgian bomb slams into the side of an apartment building ?
Such costs are more obvious to the Austrian School theorists , who focus , after all , on the human person and on human action .
This is less of the case for more utilitarian - based schools of thought , in which atrocities can be justified based on marginal - benefit - and - cost metrics .
Second , are such activities indicative of a global economic slowdown ?
New York University economist Noriel Roubini has noted the likely harsh effects of recession on the emerging economies , especially on the BRIC nations — Brazil , Russia , India , and China .
It is a hard fact that economic recession and depression can serve as boons to national militaries and justify their use .
On the one hand , they provide government employment to people with fewer employment options .
This is as true for the distressed families in Michigan receiving visits from army recruiters as it is for families in Minsk .
Whenever market options become suppressed , options provided by governments become more acceptable .
And on the other hand , governments are usually the most obvious culprits when we 're searching for causes of economic slowdowns .
Indeed , standard market - failure arguments have less credibility in our hyper - regulated era .
When this happens , governments are more likely to engage in war , if only to increase their short - term popularity and to draw attention away from their role in the economy .
Since war is the health of the state , it is a more likely option when the state is not at least constrained and decentralized in structure and power .
Finally , much of what is happening in Georgia today reminds me of Hazlitt 's dictum that good economists consider the full effects of policies and actions .
Given the recent and not - so - recent history of US military interventions on foreign soil , there is little objection that our government can make when other governments invade countries , kill scores of innocent people , upend families , destroy homes and businesses , and contemplate regime change .
What game theorist in the Pentagon thought that the United States could intervene so heavily in the political and military affairs of Georgia without some eventual response from the Russians ?
At the very least , jobs should be lost , and theories should be questioned when such policies result in long - term , deadly blowback .
Furthermore , has anyone considered the extent to which post - 9/11 monetary inflation has made the Georgian tragedy more likely ?
To the extent that these policies have created a commodities price bubble , it has added tremendous wealth to the coffers of the Russian government , and it should surprise no one that that state is not out buying Faberge eggs with its newfound spoils .
The Austrians teach that the first effect of monetary inflation is a redistribution of wealth , and in this case , it may have emboldened the Russian and Georgian governments to pursue more violent means for achieving their objectives , simply because they could afford to .
In all of this analysis , it is important to separate the governments involved from the people who suffer from their actions .
The people do not have a dog in this fight — and they suffer the most from its being waged .
As the US government has " freed the hell out of Iraq " — to quote a popular bumper sticker — Russia is freeing the hell out of South Ossetians and Georgians .
In both cases , state violence hinders mutual cooperation and the development of peaceful institutions in society that characterize civilization itself .
Perhaps this is what Ludwig von Mises had in mind when he wrote , in the second chapter of Omnipotent Government ,
The characteristic feature of militarism is not the fact that a nation has a powerful army or navy .
It is the paramount role assigned to the army within the political structure .
Even in peacetime the army is supreme ; it is the predominant factor in political life .
The subjects must obey the government as soldiers must obey their superiors .
Within a militarist community there is no freedom ; there are only obedience and discipline .
Such is always the end result of militarism .
Sad to say , it is not confined to the Caucasus .
If you have been following the Hurricane Gustav news ( and it 's kind of impossible not to ) , then you might already know that Ray Nagin , the mayor of New Orleans , issued a statement saying that anyone caught looting will automatically be sent to Angola Prison " “ do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 .
This might not sound like a huge deal , but usually to be sent to Angola ( aka " The Farm "  ) you have to have a sentence of 50 years to life .
The word is that the prison is n't as horrible as it used to be , but when Nagin issued the statement , he added , " God bless you if you go there . " 
So I 'm assuming this is not a threat to be taken lightly .
Anyway , in case you do n't know what makes Angola so horrifying ( I did n't before I wrote this ) , I thought I 'd do the Q10 on it today " ¦ thanks to Jason English for the idea .
And thanks to the Angola Museum for the picture .
1 . It 's a working prison , meaning that inmates do n't just sit around and watch T.V. all day .
This stems from the 1800s , when inmates worked on constructing a levee .
Now , they do lots of agricultural work " “ the prison sits on 18,000 acres of farm land .
2. Conditions were so abusive and the brutality was so bad that in 1952 , 31 prisoners slashed their own Achilles ' tendons to protest .
Anyone who has ever cringed during that scene in Kill Bill when The Bride slashes Buck 's Achilles ' tendon with a scalpel knows how horrible that would be " “ especially doing it to yourself .
3 . Of the 5,000 - plus inmates , 86 percent are violent offenders and 52 percent are serving life sentences .
There are 84 male inmates on death row and one woman .
4 . It 's the home of Gruesome Gertie , the house electric chair .
It 's not currently used , but it was the main form of capital punishment for 50 years .
It was the chair that sent Elmo Patrick Sonnier , the subject of the movie Dead Man Walking , to his death in 1984 .
It was last used for execution in 1991 .
It made an appearance in the movie Monster 's Ball .
That 's Sister Helen Prejean in Angola to the left , the nun who counseled Sonnier and made their story famous .
5 . Horrifyingly , Gruesome Gertie did n't always work as she should have .
In 1946 , teenager Willie Francis was to be executed in the chair for killing his employer at a local drugstore .
But the prison guard who set the chair up was drunk at the time and did n't do it right .
Once the switch was thrown , Francis apparently screamed , " Take it off !
Let me breathe !
I 'm not dying ! " 
They did , and Francis appealed to the Supreme Court , citing cruel and unusual punishment ( among other things ) .
The appeal was rejected , however , and Willie Francis was executed ( again ) on May 9 , 1947 .
I can't imagine the horror of going back to the electric chair after the first botched attempt .
6 . It 's where two of the Angola 3 were in solitary confinement since from 1972 until March 2008 .
Robert King Wilkerson , Albert Woodfox and Herman Wallace were convicted of stabbing a prison guard to death .
" Witnesses "  included other inmates who were promised cigarettes and pardon recommendations for testifying .
One prisoner repeatedly confessed to the murder over the years , but it 's alleged that prison officials chose to ignore him in favor of putting the Angola 3 in solitary because they were leaders of the prison 's Black Panther movement .
Wilkerson was paroled in 2001 , but Woodfox and Wallace remained in solitary until recently .
Wallace said that for years , he would attend biweekly " hearings "  to determine whether his behavior was good enough to spring him from solitary , but when he got to the room , he was simply handed a piece of paper saying that he was denied .
He never got a chance to speak .
7. Musicians have been telling the tale of Angola 's horrors for years .
Lead Belly , Freddy Fender , Robert Pete Williams , Aaron and Charles Neville , James Booker and rapper Juvenile are just a handful of people who have mentioned Angola in their works .
Lead Belly actually served time in Angola from 1930 to 1934 for attempted homicide , Freddy Fender served about three years for marijuana possession , and James Booker spent six months at The Farm for heroin possession .
8 . It sounds very Austin Powers " “ sharks with frickin ' laser beams " “ but Warden Burl Cain uses wolves and bears to help guard the grounds .
Although the bears are more of a bonus than a planned thing : when it was discovered that a 400 + pound black bear was living on prison grounds , Cain viewed it as a plus .
" I love that bear being right where it is , "  he said .
" I tell you what , none of our inmates are going to try to get out after dark and wander around when they might run into a big old bear .
It 's like having another guard at no cost to the taxpayer . "
It 's probably not the only bear , though " “ prison officials think they might have up to ten living at The Farm .
As for the wolves , Paste magazine reported in 2003 that the prison had recently acquired wolves to act as guard dogs .
" You 're more afraid of a wolf than you are of dogs , "  Cain said , " so if I have a wolf that 'll bite , then the wolf will never have to bite anybody , because nobody will want to be challenged by the wolf . " 
9. Prisoners make their own coffins .
At least , they could be .
A coffin-making factory on the grounds keeps inmates busy , but it serves a purpose as well : prisoners who die and are not claimed by anyone are buried in them .
This is a step up from the cardboard boxes they used to use for burials .
That practice had to be stopped when a corpse fell through the bottom of the box .
10 .
There 's not much mercy for those who act out .
When one inmate got unruly at his trial in 2002 , officers dealt with the problem by taping his mouth shut .
Well , his whole head , almost .
Paste quotes the the Baton Rouge newspaper The Advocate : " State Penitentiary security officerswrapped the bottom half of his face and all of his neck with duct tape , then wrapped a circle of tape under his jaw and over the top of his forehead . " 
However , Angola also has some things other prisons do n't : its own radio station ( " The Incarceration Station "  ) and magazine produced by inmates , the annual Angola Prison Rodeo and a four - year bible college .
' Some nations have a gift for ceremonial , " wrote the future third Marquess of Salisbury , Lord Robert Cecil , after watching Queen Victoria open parliament .
" No poverty of means or absence of splendour inhibits them from making any pageant in which they take part both real and impressive .
Everybody falls naturally into his proper place , throws himself without effort into the spirit of the little drama he is enacting and instinctively represses all appearance of constraint or distracted attention . "
What was arguably true for 19th century Britain ( Cecil , as it happens , believed that Britain did not possess that gift ) is no less so for 21st century America .
As one party convention ends and another begins ( hurricane permitting ) , we are halfway through a fortnight of ticker tape , talking points , balloons and bluster .
There was a time when these conventions meant something more than mere pageantry .
They were the place where arguments were made , platforms thrashed out and delegates wooed with policy .
But like British party conferences , conventions are now essentially media events at which the media enjoys neither particular access , information nor , for the most part , insight .
The result is two weeks of propaganda rolled out like a well - choreographed marketing campaign and faithfully transmitted by supine outlets .
Like most acts of ceremony , form has long surpassed content .
The further they have strayed from the substance the more the symbols matter .
Strip away the high - minded commentary and you are left with two patriotic parades steeped in electoral rivalry and masquerading as a celebration of democratic culture .
As far as pageantry goes , they could certainly be worse .
At least in these there are no gilded coaches , crowns , ermine or wigs .
And yet despite the slew of historic candidacies - first Barack Obama and now Sarah Palin - it seems as though this year America 's political class has less to celebrate than ever .
For the conventions do not just mark the beginning of a new presidential cycle but the passing of an old one .
The fact that this administration has been criminally incompetent is now the stuff of water - cooler orthodoxy .
The fact that it has been plain criminal is not .
But it should be .
Under George Bush the US has tortured , disenfranchised , lied , spied and , on more than one occasion , flouted its own constitution .
Those who would not go along were fired or demoted .
Those rulings it could not garner support for it simply classified or hid .
Those inquiries it could not prevent it thwarted .
When Major General Antonio Taguba tried to pursue his investigation of Abu Ghraib up the chain of command he was stopped .
" I was legally prevented from further investigation into higher authority , " he told the New Yorker .
Its violation of international law is ultimately a matter for the international community .
But its violation of American laws is a matter for the American public .
However , it is now clear that the political consequences of these transgressions will range from negligible to non-existent .
The Bush administration should be led away in handcuffs - either indicted or impeached .
Instead it is about to leave the scene of the crime in broad daylight while those tasked to police this democracy - notably politicians and the press - blind themselves with confetti .
Those who regard impeachment as merely a vindictive attempt to adjudicate the past display a chronic lack of imagination .
True , it is not going to happen .
But that makes it no less morally compelling or politically relevant to argue that it should .
Trying to look ahead without acknowledging how you got to where you are is a surefire way to end up wandering around in circles .
And the last place the Democrats want to be is where they were .
Take voter registration .
Around this time last year the attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , was forced to resign amid allegations of perjury before Congress over his role in the politically motivated firing of seven attorneys .
They were replaced by what his then chief of staff referred to as " loyal Bushies " on the advice of the White House .
Five of the fired attorneys were in battleground states .
They had irritated local Republicans by refusing to bring voter fraud cases targeted at loyal Democratic groups because of lack of evidence .
The congressional hearings were a farce .
Gonzales said he " could not recall " more than 71 times in one day .
Clearly he hoped we would forget too .
But in a year when voter rolls are swelling with the expectation of an unprecedented turnout it is crucial that we remember .
A few weeks ago John McCain 's campaign attorneys attended a national training session for Republican lawyers on election law , which included a session on identifying and responding to instances of voter fraud .
Despite the justice department 's own studies showing that voter fraud is extremely rare , Republicans are gearing up for mass intimidation in minority areas on election day .
If the election is close expect to see Florida 2000 replayed from Virginia to Nevada .
And if the challenges go to court , Gonzales 's " loyal Bushies " will be there to hear the cases .
Such are the lasting consequences of Bush 's crooked tenure .
Casting him as inept and unethical is not difficult .
He is the most unpopular president for six decades .
Some have been loathed more - but none by so many for so long .
But understanding how he managed to do it demands a wider lens .
For he could not do it alone .
The US is not an elected dictatorship .
The president is supposed to stand at the helm of a system of checks and balances .
The reason there was no balance was because there were no checks .
The real problem with the Bush years is not so much that he did what he did , but that he managed to gain the consent of America 's political class in enabling him to do it .
His political estrangement is not because he tried , only because he failed .
This has more or less been conceded by none other than the leader of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , who voted against the war in Iraq .
When asked recently by the Nation why she took impeachment off the table before the 2006 elections , Pelosi answered : " What about these other people who voted for that war with no evidence ...
Are they going to be voting with us to impeach the president ?
Where are these Democrats going to be ?
Are they going to be voting for us to impeach a president who took us to war on information that they had also ? "
In other words , for the Democrats to impeach the president they would first have to implicate themselves .
This is not to say the Democrats were equally culpable .
But they were differently responsible , and cowed by accusations of lack of patriotism most of them abdicated that responsibility .
Asked to explain the administration 's use of torture , the director of the 9/11 commission , Philip Zelikow , said : " Fear and anxiety exploited by zealots and fools . "
But there is , it seems , no price to pay for being a zealot or a fool in power .
America will no doubt be anxious and fearful again some day .
And for all the ceremonial hyperbole of this convention season , there is little to suggest that when that day comes the fools and zealots wo n't once again come out on top .

The Alliance Defense Fund has called on 35 pastors across the country to break IRS tax laws and endorse presidential candidates during sermons .
The pastors will draw on Bible passages tomorrow in a protest organized by the group of conservative Christian lawyers .
The ADF launched the effort to protest a 50 - year - old law which bans churches , religious groups , and non-profit groups that accept tax deductions from endorsing candidates .
Erik Stanley , a legal adviser with the ADF , said the group would be sending copies of the sermons to the IRS and would be seeking a Supreme Court case .
The law , he said , was unconstitutional because " being tax - exempt is part of freedom of religion ; otherwise the government could tax churches out of existence . "
Minnesota reverend Gus Booth , who is participating in the protest , says he will be endorsing Senator McCain and has forbidden his congregation from voting for Senator Obama due to his position on abortion .
He defended his actions , saying " I have a First Amendment right to say whatever I want to say . "
" Pulpit Freedom Sunday , " as the event is being called , has drawn criticism from both religious and secular groups .
A group of former IRS officials and pastors held a conference on September 8 , submitting a complaint to the IRS and urging other ministers to preach against the endorsements .
One of the participants , former director of the IRS Marcus Owens , says the group may be facing a loss of its own tax exempt status and compared it to teaching people how to cheat on taxes .
Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the IRS are monitoring the situation .

This mass could be the smallest known " building block " of the mysterious , invisible substance called dark matter .
Stars that form within these building blocks clump together and turn into galaxies .
Scientists know very little about the microscopic properties of dark matter , even though it accounts for approximately five - sixths of all matter in the universe .
" By knowing this minimum galaxy mass , we can better understand how dark matter behaves , which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be , " said Louis Strigari , lead author of this study and a McCue Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCI .
Study results are published Aug. 28 in the journal Nature .
Dark matter governs the growth of structure in the universe .
Without it , galaxies like our own Milky Way would not exist .
Scientists know how dark matter 's gravity attracts normal matter and causes galaxies to form .
They also suspect that small galaxies merge over time to create larger galaxies such as our Milky Way .

The smallest known galaxies , called dwarf galaxies , vary greatly in brightness , from 1,000 times the luminosity of the sun to 10 million times the luminosity of the sun .
At least 22 of these dwarf galaxies are known to orbit the Milky Way .
UCI scientists studied 18 of them using data obtained with the Keck telescope in Hawaii and the Magellan telescope in Chile , with the goal of calculating their masses .
By analyzing stars ' light in each galaxy , they determined how fast the stars were moving .
Using those speeds , they calculated the mass of each galaxy .
The researchers expected the masses to vary , with the brightest galaxy weighing the most and the faintest galaxy weighing the least .
But surprisingly all dwarf galaxies had the same mass – 10 million times the mass of the sun .
Manoj Kaplinghat , a study co-author and physics and astronomy assistant professor at UCI , explains this finding using an analogy in which humans play the role of dark matter .
" Suppose you are an alien flying over Earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night .
From the brightness of the lights , you may surmise , for example , that more humans live in Los Angeles than in Mumbai , but this is not the case , " Kaplinghat said .
" What we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas , even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens , have a population of about 10 million . "
Since dwarf galaxies are mostly dark matter – the ratio of dark matter to normal matter is as large as 10,000 to one – the minimum - mass discovery reveals a fundamental property of dark matter .

" We are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible , yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter , " said James Bullock , a study co-author and director of UCI 's Center for Cosmology .
" This helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter , and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe . "
The scientists say clumps of dark matter may exist that contain no stars .
The only dark matter clumps they can detect right now are those that are lit by stars .
Scientists hope to learn about dark matter 's microscopic properties when the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland becomes operational later this year .
The device will accelerate two beams of nuclei in a ring in opposite directions and then slam them together to recreate conditions just after the Big Bang .
By doing this , scientists hope to create the dark matter particle in the lab for the first time .
Several UCI physicists are working on this international project .
Joining UCI scientists on the galaxy study were Joshua Simon of the California Institute of Technology , Marla Geha of Yale University , Beth Willman of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , and Matthew Walker of the University of Cambridge .
The research was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation and a donation from Gary McCue to the UCI Center for Cosmology .

Argos 0.7 for Qemu 1.1.0 released ( runs Windows 7 )
Apologies for the long delay .
We never got 'round to putting Argos version 0.7 online ( the one that supports Windows 7 ) .
We now did it , but it has not been tested very rigorously , so use at your own risk .
The current status can be described as : it works for us !
The tarball is available from the downloads page .
Argos for new version of Qemu ( supports Windows 7 )
Most taint analysis systems to date work with older versions of Qemu ( 0.9.x ) .
This works fine for older versions of Windows like XP , but it prevents you from running , say , Windows 7 or later .
The problem is that newer versions of Qemu , which do support Windows 7 , are radically different ' under the hood ' .
We finally ported Argos to the latest version of Qemu and are now able to run W7 .
The only thing we are still working on is a network driver for W7 ( NE2000 is no longer supported by W7 ) .
As soon as we have this done , we will release this new version of Argos .
Argos 0.5.0 released : shellcode extraction and client - side honeypot
And finally , we released the new 0.5.0 version with shellcode extraction and support for running as a client - side honeypot ( using the same infrastructure as the Shelia client - side honeypot ) .
The shellcode extractor keeps an attack running after an attack is detected , and extracts the NOP sled , unpacker (s ) , and real shellcode .
Argos shellcode extractor released
While there have not been many releases recently , we have been working quite hard on cool new features for Argos .
We have just been incredibly slow in making them public .
In the near future we will start adding them here .
For now I have made the shellcode extractor available .
I hope you find it useful .
The Argos shellcode extractor is a new version of Argos that does not stop the attack immediately .
Rather it keeps it running in order to detect the shellcode --- and separate it from nop sleds and unpacker (s ) .
To confine the shellcode , you can specify exactly what API calls it is allowed to make by means of a white list .
Everything else is still prohibited and will stop the execution .
As an aside , the new version is also usable as a very accurate , but fairly slow client - side honeypot .
Client argos library v0.1.4 released
Client argos library v0.1.4 contains an updates to the carlog utility that enables the user to print the contents of an arbitrary memory block from an Argos csi log .
Argos critical fix
Argos v0.4.2 - 1 fixes a critical error that caused a crash if the control socket was not used .
New packages released
Argos v0.4.2 released
This release of Argos is fixing problems with the control socket .
Threading is not used any more .
Instead Qemu 's async .
IO mechanisms are used .
Another modification allows one to let tainted data execute , by supplying the ' - no - fsc ' option at run time .
This of course disables the injection of forensics shellcode .
Also , this version makes whitelists optional .
The user needs to enable whitelist support when configuring Argos , as well as at runtime .
Argos-replay
This is an early release of versions of Qemu and Argos that allow you to record the execution of a VM running within our modified Qemu emulator , and replay the exact same execution using Argos .
This code has not been extensively tested , and currently does not support graphical output , and IO - APIC .
Prospector
Prospector is a flavour of Argos that performs more aggressive data tracking for more comprehensive signature generation .
Please consult the research paper , and included documentation files for more information .
New Argos web site
Our website got a new look .
You will also notice that we added a " Use Cases " page , which lists the security frameworks that are currently using Argos .
Argos 0.4.1 released
The new version of Argos ( 0.4.1 ) contains bug fixes related with taint tracking .
It is recommended to update to the latest version of Argos , since it solves issues with reported false positives .
Checking the CALL instruction for tainted operands , has also been re-enabled , since it seems it does not cause problems with windows systems anymore .
The use of a whitelist is not necessary as well , since the false positives reported by 2.6 . * linux kernels are also solved .
Finally , crashes reported with windows 2000 guest systems , seem to be also solved .
If any of the users discovers false positives , after these changes please notify the developers immediately .
Argos version 0.4.0 released
Finally , the long awaited port to QEMU 0.9 . * series is here .
Argos v0.4.0 is based upon QEMU v0.9.1.
Additional changes , besides the port , include a double taintness check before executing a part of code to ensure attackers ' injected code is always detected at the moment it is first executed .
The check is performed whenever a TB is scheduled to be executed , as well as within the translated code whenever EIP is modified .
This is to cover TB chaining performed by QEMU to speed up emulation .
In the future we might consider disabling chaining , if a single check offers a significant performance gain .
Improved argos network logs conversion utility
A new argos - utils package has been released , containing the utility netlog2 pcap , which converts an argos network log to a pcap log without using Ethereal 's text2 pcap .
The older raw2 pcap is also included , with a small bug fix .
Thanks are going to Tillmann Werner .
New logs processing library
Version 0.1.3 of the logs processing library has been released .
Contains large file support for Linux , as well as a bug fix for cargos_lib_csi_mbnext ( ) .

Ten Things I Hate About Science Fiction
First off , I love science fiction , but when it ’s bad , oh boy , there ’s little worse .
As a writer and scientist , I ’m probably more sensitive to some of the bad things than the average person , but there are plenty of things that happen too often that we can probably agree to share for a good two - minute hate .
With me so far ?
1. Bad science .
AKA technobabble or just plain getting things wrong .
You know , reverse the polarization and charge this doohickey and wham bam thank you ma’am the aliens are toast !
There are a million examples out there .
Star Trek , though I love it , is a prime offender .
There are a lot of sub - categories , but I ’ll try to keep them lumped together except for a few cases that need their own number .
2. Bad writing .
This happens less , I think , than in decades past , but it still happens .
The President of Earth can still be heard slamming his fist on his desk and ordering that Space Commander Sparky Jones and his sidekick Space Babe Sally do something about the alien menace .
OK , there ’s probably very little this bad out there any more ( Galaxy 666 , how I miss you ) , but some of the sci - fi channel movies have echoes .
I recall the first - season intro to Babylon 5 being pretty badly written , for instance , and happily noticing it was later revised .
3. Bad aliens .
Aliens who are exactly like humans except for their skin color or nose shape .
Aliens with biologies that make no sense with ridiculously simple ecosystems .
4. Inconsistent or illogical time travel .
It seems like writers just make up rules for time travel that make no sense a lot more often than other types of stories .
I mean , WTF was with that fading photograph in Back to the Future ?
Do n’t try to make too much sense of it , please , or your brain will hurt .
And while I ’m talking about this , bad history or irrational projection of today ’s morals / beliefs on other peoples .
5. Blatant politics or moralizing .
Science fiction is n’t a good medium for overt polemics .
Covert ones , sure , when you ca n’t come right out and say what you mean because your government will disappear you , or a topic that is too hot socially , ok .
But if you can be blatant , sf is not needed .
Be clever , be subtle , otherwise use a posterboard and stand by the roadside .
6 . The singularity .
Every sf story that takes place in the future does n’t have to be about the singularity , or even address it .
If it ever happens , I doubt people will be looking around and saying , “ Hey , did you see that singularity happen ? ”
It wo n’t be like that .
7. Small universes .
The universe is big .
Really big .
Just acknowledging hyperspace or FTL to avoid this issue is usually not enough .
The dang Vipers on Battlestar Galactica , with rocket power alone and not too much fuel , still manage to let pilots zip around entire solar systems without having bathrooms .
8. Monocultures and monoworlds .
While arguably plausible in some cases , those cases are rarely made .
Instead , worldbuilding is given short - shrift and entire planets are reduced to single simple settings .
And Waterworld really was n’t that good .
9 . Dark futures .
I like the occasional cautionary tale , but at some point dark became cool and all too prevalent .
Despite our problems and challenges , technology and the quality of life has been improving dramatically for the majority of people on Earth .
Do n’t think about this year compared to last or even this decade compared to the last .
Think about your grandparents ’ experience at the doctor or the dentist , or shopping by catalog vs. internet , or the outhouse .
And who remembers dial - up ?
10 . Heart / faith / determination triumphing over intellect .
This happens all the damn time and it drives me nuts .
I like my heroes as smart as my villains , and in a technological world being smart is important .
Too often , however , writers seem to like to put all sorts of qualities ahead of intelligence and education .
It ’s probably thought to be reassuring to mass audiences to put down elites and play up traditional values , but I ’m tired of that message , especially during election season .
A recent example is the movie Armageddon , where the roughnecks are so much better than the idiots NASA ’s been training for months .
Ugh !
What am I wrong to hate , and what is even more hateable that I did n’t list ?

SPORTS , WE KNOW , are big business .
The Red Sox are worth more than $ 800 million , the Patriots at least a billion .
China spent more than $ 40 billion to host the just - completed Olympics , an event dedicated , at least in theory , to showcasing the spirit of amateur athletic achievement .
Even for the individual fan , the price can be high , whether it 's measured in money , time , or lost sleep .
A good seat at Gillette Stadium can run you $ 169 ; an NBA season is hundreds of hours of basketball .
And then there are the hours spent Monday - morning quarterbacking , the sums lost in office betting pools , the money spent on replica jerseys and commemorative beach towels , the time spent crafting taunting e-mails and the time spent responding to them .
With costs like these , it 's inevitable that people will , from time to time , ask what sort of return they get on their investment .
Sure , there are the occasional moments of euphoria , the feeling of boozy comradeship we feel toward strangers at sports bars , but is there , perhaps , anything more concrete ?
In Boston and other American cities , the question tends to come up whenever one of the city 's pro teams asks the legislature for money for a new stadium .
Or it emerges when a New York or London or Paris is vying to host a mega - event like the Olympics .
The usual answer from local boosters is that a pro team or an Olympics - by employing local workers , by drawing big - spending fans , by giving a city media exposure - helps out the local economy .
Even if you do n't care about the Celtics , or the triple jump , you 're still profiting by their presence .
Economists are generally skeptical of these claims .
But a few scholars have started to suggest that there may indeed be another kind of benefit from big - time sports .
There 's a catch , though : the team has to be good .
In a forthcoming paper , economist Michael Davis and the psychologist Christian End say that having a winning NFL football team increases the incomes of the people who live and work in its hometown by as much as $ 120 a year .
And while the study does n't identify exactly what causes the boost , the authors point to psychological literature suggesting that winning fans are at once harder workers and bigger spenders .
In short , buoyed by the team 's success , we work longer hours , take bigger risks , and shop more avidly , all of which helps the local economy .
" This collective mass of people in a good mood , that is something that could really bolster the economy , " says End , an assistant professor of psychology at Xavier University .
Here in Boston , of course , there has been a lot of winning recently .
Between the Patriots , the Red Sox , and the Celtics , the city is enjoying an era of almost unprecedented sports dominance .
The only one of the three that is not currently the reigning champion , the Patriots , starts its season today with the goal of redeeming a season that came within a couple minutes of being the greatest in pro football history .
If ever there was a city that knows what it means to go from futility to victory , it is ours .
The new work suggests that this kind of success on the field can shape a positive mind - set that affects the rest of our lives .
Studies have shown , for example , that fans are not only happier when their team wins , they feel smarter , more athletic , luckier , and even more attractive .
Other research shows that happy , self - confident people tend to be more successful - at work , in school , in any realm they 're competing in - suggesting how the successes and failures of our sports heroes become our own .
. . .
Here in Boston , fandom has for years been imbued with a certain nobility .
Boston fans and their bards like to expound on the great and soul - crippling hardships they have suffered at the hands of their teams .
For their first 40 years , the Patriots were usually a laughingstock .
The Red Sox , of course , were a paragon of sports futility for the better part of a century .
Even the Celtics have been mostly mediocre for the past two decades .
New England is a part of the world known for cold weather and Puritan ancestry , so it would be simplistic to blame sports teams for our distinctive regional dourness .
But surely all the losing did n't help .
Sports psychologists have found that losing does indeed make fans unhappy , just as winning brings joy .
While little work has been done to assess the durability of these emotions , they can be quite powerful - one survey , for example , found that West Germans professed themselves more pleased with the national economy and their own jobs after their national soccer team won a game at the 1982 World Cup .
But what is particularly striking is the almost comical extent to which fans appropriate the successes and failures of their team .
Like a stadium full of stage moms , they see the accomplishments of their team as reflections of themselves .
Edward Hirt , a professor of psychology at Indiana University , has found that the school 's famously ardent basketball fans saw their opinion of themselves rise and fall with the fortunes of the team .
Over the years , he has conducted various versions of a study in which fans , after watching a game , are asked how well they thought they would do at a variety of tasks - throwing darts , shooting free throws , solving various word games , even rolling dice .
Consistently , both male and female fans showed a sharp rise in confidence in their abilities on all the tasks after a win , and a corresponding drop after a loss .
Winning even made fans feel sexier :
When shown a picture of an attractive member of the opposite gender after a win , they were far more likely to say they would be able to get that person to go on a date with them .
Findings like these suggest that there might be a broadly shared psychological boost from our stubborn inability to separate our own accomplishments from those of a group of multimillionaire professional athletes who have never heard of us .
Multiple studies , for example , have shown that testosterone levels in male fans rise in the wake of a victory , and drop in the wake of a defeat .
A study published earlier this year of traders on the London Stock Exchange found that the ones with higher levels of testosterone made more money than their colleagues - the researchers suggested that it might be because the hormone emboldened the traders to take bigger risks .
A large body of psychological research suggests that the kind of psychological changes seen in fans after a victory could translate into positive behavior .
More self - confident people tend generally to do better at life : they get better grades , make more money , have more friends , even live longer .
And the self - confidence does n't have to be earned to make a difference .
Shelley Taylor , a UCLA psychologist , has found that having outright illusions about one 's abilities , and about the amount of control one has over the events in one 's life , makes people happier , harder working , and more successful at whatever they put their minds to .
When Taylor looked at AIDS patients in the late 1980s ( a time when the disease was far less treatable than it is today ) , she found that those with an unrealistically optimistic sense of their prognosis lived an average of 9 months longer than those with a more accurate understanding of the disease .
The illusion of control , of course , is a pretty fair description of sports fandom .
It explains better than anything else why people spend so much of their lives sitting in a special spot on the couch , wearing their lucky jersey , and upbraiding the television .
Drawing on work like this , the Davis and End paper set out to see what large - scale economic impact a winning team might generate for its fans .
In doing so , they were expanding on a 2002 paper by the economists Dennis Coates and Brad Humphreys .
Coates and Humphreys had found that when an NFL team won the Super Bowl , its home city saw a boost of about $ 140 in per capita income .
Perhaps , they suggested , winning might be making people more productive .
Davis and End decided to define winning more broadly .
Looking at data from 1969 to 1998 , they charted win-loss record against per capita income .
Even after controlling for factors like the size of the city , how much money it spent on its team , and a host of local factors that might affect some sports markets and not others ( natural disasters , oil booms and busts in Texas and Louisiana , the tech boom and bust in Northern California ) , they found that , for every win in a city 's NFL team 's record , per capita income in the city rose around $ 10 - not enough to change anyone 's tax bracket , but , multiplied over the course of all of a city 's inhabitants , enough to add up .
Americans are confronted with what appears to be the worse economic situation since the Great Depression .
What will history say about the U.S. credit crisis turned global financial crisis ?
At every turn investors are faced with new problems , new crises , and less than desirable solutions which include debt , deflation and a transfer of wealth .
With regard to debt , the American taxpayer has been made the lender of last resort for international bank Bear Stearns and now the two Government - sponsored Enterprises - GSEs , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
On top of the $ 29B for Bear Stearns , Fannie and Freddie 's debt of $ 5.4T has been effectively transferred to the balance sheet of the USA .
This is equal to the entire publicly traded debt of the U.S. which is also the same as the total of America 's mortgage - related assets .
In addition to personal debt , every American now has a financial responsibility for Bear Stearns and Fannie and Freddie .
We , the people , have saved the foreign investors such as China which owns $ 376B , Japan which owns $ 228B , South Korea which owns $ 65B , Taiwan which owns $ 55B , and Australia which owns $ 33B , from losing faith in America .
It is the stockholders , both common and preferred , that have been given the raw end of the deal .
While large financial institutions such as JP Morgan , which owns $ 1.2B of Freddie and Fannie stock , said a complete loss would only erase one or two months of profits , contrast this to smaller banks such as the Central Virginia Bank in Richmond which has $ 20 M in shares of Freddie and Fannie .
That type of loss will put them in the same kind of trouble as Lehman Brothers , not enough capitalization .
There are 15 other banks that hold 10 % or more of their capital in shares of Freddie and Fannie .
The Federal Accounting Standards Board is requiring more stringent standards for banks and savings and loans to maintain a certain amount of capital to protect against insolvency .
Those rules are in the process of being changed to conform to international rules issued by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland which Congress has voted on .
These rules which were only to pertain to international banks are now being applied to national banks .
Furthermore those in retirement who thought their money was safe - invested in the highest ranked bonds in the country are going to lose their dividends .
Depending on the price they invested , they could have principal losses of up to 80 or 90 % of their investment .
Ouch .
The credit crunch began a year ago when the various investment banks both here and abroad stopped buying each others paper , a very uncommon practice between them .
As a result of no liquidity for mortgage paper caused by their decision , we have the most serious slowdown in real estate in decades .
The decision to not buy mortgage paper includes the sub - prime loans made to home buyers that had no down payment .
To relate , I recently met a young Latino who is worried about her home .
Five years ago she bought a $ 370,000 townhouse with $ 14,000 down .
Her interest rate varies causing her monthly payment to jump from $ 2700 per month to $ 3500 .
She cleans houses for a living .
Freddie and Fannie decided they could make more money by buying subprime mortgage paper .
Today there is an eleven month inventory of unsold homes .
Higher interest rates as a result of the hidden clauses on floating interest rates have put many people in jeopardy of foreclosure .
All of these problems have given the Federal Reserve the opportunity to seize total control of powers they did not oversee in order to protect our economy .
Perhaps we should ask where the desire to put poor people into homes came from ?
It was part of the Bush Administration 's policy to conform to the United Nations ' Millennium Development Goals unveiled in the year 2000 .
Exacerbating the credit crunch have been the historically high oil prices which have caused pain at the gas pumps and a weak dollar which has made imports more expensive .
To counter high oil prices , Americans have drastically reduced how many miles they drive and a number of buying habits .
In light of a tight job market and job losses in housing and the automotive industries , we are confronted with higher energy costs to heat and cool our homes , increased costs for food , and the inability to refinance mortgages .
Basically the economy is now in deflation .
When people stop spending , it moves from deflation to stagflation - no matter how cheap an item becomes , people can't afford to buy .
All this without knowing what the real fall out will be from the bailout of Freddie and Fannie .
The situation we are confronted with did not happen in the last few years , but began in 1913 when a group of cunningly deceitful legislators passed the Federal Reserve Act on December 24 at 11:45 p.m. , after those who were opposed went home for Christmas .
The entire financial system of the U.S. was transferred from Congress to a private corporation that is NOT accountable to Congress .
They create and destroy the business cycle by various means : raising and lowering interest rates .
The government of the United States is in bondage to a group of individuals who own the Federal Reserve .
The reason why the American people cannot forgive themselves the interest on our debt is because we do not owe it to ourselves we owe it to the Federal Reserve !
Every single time since then that the Federal Reserve Act was amended , over 195 times , the Federal Reserve gathered more power over various aspects of our economy .
However , they are in the final throes of stripping America of any remaining vestiges of sovereignty as has been laid out in the Treasury " Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory System . "
The Blueprint was written under the watchful eye of one of America 's most successful international bankers , former Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson , who is now our illustrious Treasury Secretary .
Is this not a case of the fox in the chicken coup ?
Long time investment sage Marty Whitman commented on his actions , " Paulson thinks he is in Russia and is not giving any value to stockholders .
It is outrageous that the Treasury Secretary is not giving any consideration to the shareholders . "
The Blueprint calls for key components of our financial system , not currently under Federal Reserve control , to be transferred to them .
In order to do this , a number of changes will be necessary which Congress will have to approve .
First , it recommends changing the banking charter to include all financial institutions , thus effectively transferring control over " national banks , federal savings associations , and federal [ and state ] credit union charters . "
For your information , Washington Mutual is a savings and loan while Lehman Brothers is and Bear Stearns was an international bank .
The Fed is to be given authority over the U.S. Payment and Settlement System thereby controlling the settlement process for securities .
It will be given the role of Market Stability Regulator and it will have total control over the market .
The Blueprint provides for the entire mortgage system of the U.S. to be federalized and to be under the control of the Mortgage Origination Commission .
The Federal Reserve will be part of the Commission .
Additionally the Federal Reserve will be given a say in the insurance industry which will be federalized and a new Office of Insurance Oversight will oversee its activities .
The Federal Reserve will have a place on the Insurance Oversight commission .
By the time Congress votes on the Blueprint , there will be so many reasons for them to transfer the last vestiges of our financial sovereignty to the Federal Reserve that they will not even have to read the prepared legislation .
So far , we have the bailout of Freddie and Fannie by giving Treasury a blank check to act ; the Federal Reserve worked all weekend to find a buyer to Lehman , another international bank , their next project might be to rescue Washington Mutual , a savings and loan , and the Fed has been given initial powers to act as the Market Stability Regulator .
The only component that is missing is the demise of an insurance company , AIG anyone ?
For the record , at the heart of the Blueprint is changing our financial / banking and securities regulatory system from a national system to an international system to bring America into the world governmental system that functions above the nation - states .
I have maintained that in order to get Congress to go along , we would have to have a huge problem which would allow Congress to be convinced that they need to act , however , the truth of the matter is they no longer have the power they once had because the majority has been transferred to the Federal Reserve .
History will determine how the final stage was set but I believe it started in 2000 with the Crash of the Nasdaq .
Who would have ever thought that a stock would drop 90 % in value ?
About $ 7T vanished from the balance sheets of investors .
But we did not have to worry , as a result of 9/11 , the Federal Reserve started to reduce interest rates to 45 year lows to get Americans to support the economy by buying the dream home .
We bit the bait .
It was the Roaring 20s all over again .
At one point in the housing boom , one out of four jobs was created by the housing industry .
No one asked if they could afford the debt , they only asked if they could afford the payment : a big difference .
They did not ask the right questions about their mortgage because the mortgage industry was not required to disclose to them , when it should have .
At one time the mortgage industry was run on honesty and integrity , but that changed too and people have been caught in a terrible snare .
The Bailout of Freddie and Fannie provide us with the latest excitement in the diabolical saga of the raping , robbing , and pillaging of America .
Interestingly enough it took place 13 months after the beginning of the credit crunch .
Lastly , I have maintained since the beginning of the credit crunch last August that it was planned and managed destruction in order to accomplish the final transfer of America 's financial sovereignty .
All of the above only confirms my original suspicion .
Sadly , only the strong will survive , only those who did not use their house as a checking account will survive , only those who turn to the Creator of the Universe , the Lord God who created heaven and earth , and His Son , Jesus , will survive in the midst of the Great 2008 Transfer of Wealth .

CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - The Web site of the Ohio state agency that handles voter registration and other election information was shut down briefly after it was hacked , an official said on Tuesday , vowing to guard against fraud in the key battleground state in the November 4 presidential contest .
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said the agency temporarily took the Secretary of State Web site at www.sos.state.oh.us down on Monday after “ one or more ” security breaches were detected .
The site was restored to partial service on Tuesday after technicians worked overnight to ensure that no information could be compromised .
“ Our focus is and has always been to protect the vote of every eligible Ohio voter from any kind of fraud , be it voter registration fraud , illegal voting or vote suppression .
This action has been taken to detect and prosecute any illegal breach of our voting infrastructure to maintain voter confidence , ” Brunner said .
Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , a Democrat , said in a separate statement that Brunner and her family had been subjected to “ repeated serious threats . ”
With 20 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidential election , Ohio is a central front in this year ’s White House campaign between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama .
Ohio was the state that secured Republican President George W. Bush his 2004 re-election victory .
The Ohio State Highway Patrol is assisting with an investigation into the security breach , Brunner said .
There were widespread complaints of voting problems in Ohio in the 2004 presidential election , and Republicans and Democrats in the state have been battling in recent weeks over voting registration rules and early voting procedures .
Brunner , a Democrat , said her office has also been assaulted in recent weeks by a barrage of phone calls and e-mails containing “ menacing messages and even threats of harm or death . ”
Last week , a suspicious package covered with threatening messages and containing an unidentified powder was mailed to the office , Brunner said .

Sphinx : Open Source Speech Recognition
by Ostatic Staff - Sep. 18 , 2008
Related Blog Posts
Have you been frustrated with speech recognition software in the past ?
I 've used the top proprietary products , such as IBM's ViaVoice and Nuance 's Dragon Naturally Speaking in the past .
I 've found limited good uses for them , but they 're not entirely accurate , and they 're reasonably expensive .
Carnegie - Mellon University developed a free offering called Sphinx , which may be a good alternative for many people , and it's now offered under a BSD license .
You can either use Sphinx for straight speech recognition tasks , or integrate it with , say , an online application .
Sphinx - 3 is one freely downloadable version , Sphinx - 4 is a versioin written entirely in Java , and PocketSphinx - - though smaller and less accurate than other versions -- is designed to run in real time on handhelds and be integrated with live applications .
If you want to try Sphinx for your own use , it looks like the package to try is Sphinx - 4-- the Java version .
Because it 's Java , it 's platform independent , I 'm still in the process of testing it for accuracy , and will do a subsequent post on my results , but this post from Artificial Intelligence and Robotics reports that the Java version works as well as proprietary solutions .
It 's interesting to see an open source effort in this space , where the proprietary players have always ruled .
Britain 's freedoms under threat from ' Big Brother security state ' , warns Director of Public Prosecutions
The chief prosecutor has warned the surveillance society is threatening to ' break the back of freedom ' .
Sir Ken Macdonald , Director of Public Prosecutions , said the state was poised to take powers to keep information on everyone and 'we might end up living with something we can't bear . '
His message - delivered ten days before he steps down as head of the Crown Prosecution Service - was a parting shot at ministers who aim to make every phone call , email , test message and internet visit available to police and security services .
Sir Ken said : ' We need to take very great care not to fall into a way of life in which freedom 's back is broken by the relentless pressure of a security state . '

The warning comes amid growing public concern over state snooping .
Some 4.4 million people - many of them non-criminals - are on a DNA database , CCTV cameras routinely film pedestrians and motorists and the Government continues to plan an ID card system .
Last week Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was accused of planning surveillance on a Big Brother scale when she announced moves to give police and security services access to all private electronic communications .
Sir Ken attacked the spread of surveillance in a CPS lecture .
He said : ' Let me in my final public speech as DPP repeat my call for levelheadedness and for legislative restraint in an age of dangerous movements . '
While technology had brought immeasurable benefits , Sir Ken added , it ' also gives the state enormous powers of access to knowledge and information about each one of us and the ability to collect and store it at will .
Every second of every day in everything we do . '
The DPP said : ' Of course modern technology is of critical importance to the struggle against serious crime .
Used wisely , it can protect us .
' But we need to understand that decisions taken in the next few months and years about how the state may use these powers , and to what extent , are likely to be irreversible .
' We should take very great care to imagine the world we are creating before we build it .
We might end up living with something we can't bear . '
Sir Ken said the best way to face down terrorist threats was to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law .
His period as DPP had seen a relentless struggle against terrorism and a conviction rate ' unmatched in the fair trial world . '
It had been done ' with full respect for our historical norms and our liberal constitution ' .
He added : ' It is difficult to see who will maintain a cool head if governments do not .
Or who will protect our constitution if governments unwittingly disarm it . '
Tories praised the speech .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' Sir Ken has been at the forefront of our counterterrorism effort for several years , so he knows the security challenges we face .
' This Government 's approach has all too often proved cavalier - unjustified powers , sprawling databases and excessive use of surveillance powers risk undermining both our security and our way of life . '
The Home Office said last night : ' The Government agrees with the DPP that technology and communications data is critically important in tackling all forms of serious crime as well as in the fight against terrorism .
' The Government also agrees that care is needed to agree what safeguards are needed , in addition to the many we have in place already , to provide a solid legal framework which protects civil liberties .
' The Home Secretary made it very clear last week that the Government will consult widely with the public and all interested parties to set out emerging problems with technology , the important capability gaps that we need to address in collecting data and to look at the possible solutions . '
Sir Ken will be succeeded next month by human rights lawyer Keir Starmer .

What 's good for the heart may hurt the brain , according to a new study of the effects of alcohol .
According to the study findings , the more alcohol consumed , the smaller the brain volume .
People who drink alcohol -- even the moderate amounts that help prevent heart disease -- have a smaller brain volume than those who do not , according to a study in the Archives of Neurology .
While a certain amount of brain shrinkage is normal with age , greater amounts in some parts of the brain have been linked to dementia .
" Decline in brain volume -- estimated at 2 percent per decade -- is a natural part of aging , " says Carol Ann Paul , who conducted the study when she was at the Boston University School of Public Health .
She had hoped to find that alcohol might protect against such brain shrinkage .
" However , we did not find the protective effect , " says Paul , who is now an instructor in the neuroscience program at Wellesley College .
" In fact , any level of alcohol consumption resulted in a decline in brain volume . "
In the study , Paul and colleagues looked at 1,839 healthy people with an average age of about 61 .
The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the brain and reported how much they tippled .

Overall , the more alcohol consumed , the smaller the brain volume , with abstainers having a higher brain volume than former drinkers , light drinkers ( one to seven drinks per week ) , moderate drinkers ( eight to 14 drinks per week ) , and heavy drinkers ( 14 or more drinks per week ) .
Men were more likely to be heavy drinkers than women .
But the link between brain volume and alcohol was n't as strong in men .
For men , only those who were heavy drinkers had a smaller brain volume than those who consumed little or no alcohol .
In women , even moderate drinkers had a smaller brain volume than abstainers or former drinkers .

Six reasons why a little glass of wine each day may do you good
It 's not clear why even modest amounts of alcohol may shrink the brain , although alcohol is " known to dehydrate tissues , and constant dehydration can have negative effects on any sensitive tissue , " says Paul .
" We always knew that alcohol at higher dosages results in shrinking of the brain and cognitive deficit , " says Dr. Petros Levounis , M.D. , director of the Addiction Institute of New York at St. Luke 's -- Roosevelt Hospital Center , who was not involved in the study .
" What is new with this article is that it shows brain shrinking at lower doses of alcohol . "
Health.com : Type 2 diabetes and alcohol : Proceed with caution
However , the study did not demonstrate that the smaller brain volume actually impaired memory or mental function , notes James Garbutt , M.D. , professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
And the differences between brain volumes in drinkers and nondrinkers were quite small -- less than 1.5 percent between abstainers and heavy drinkers .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Alcoholism
" We 're talking very small differences here , " says Dr. Garbutt , who was not involved in the study .
" We 're not seeing 10 to 20 percent shrinkage . "
However , he says , reduction in brain mass is an interesting finding .
" But we have a long way to go to figure out the implications of it . "

Why do RPG 's have to be so long ?
The scam had the potential to net more than £ 1 m profit A fraudster has been jailed for five years after a photo of his baby surrounded by piles of money was used by police as evidence against him .
Adu Bunu , 34 , was convicted at Hull Crown Court over a £ 40,000 scheme which saw more than 2,000 bank cards cloned .
The scam targeted cash machines outside supermarkets including ones in Beverley and Willerby in East Yorkshire .
Romanian national Bunu , of St Oswald Road , Wakefield , had the picture of his son with the cash on his mobile phone .
The court was told Bunu cloned the cards and then used them to withdraw money from other cash machines across the country .
Bunu , who police believed worked with an accomplice who is still being hunted , fitted false fronts to the machines , which were able to record both the magnetic strip identifying cards and Pin numbers typed in by their owners .
Police believe Bunu worked with an accomplice Police said he netted £ 43,000 but had the potential to steal more than £ 1 m .
He claimed the picture of his baby son surrounded by money was part of a Romanian tradition celebrating the christening of his child .
But the jury dismissed his claims and he was found guilty of conspiracy to clone bank cards .
Det Sgt Neil Clarkson from the Humberside Police Economic Crime Section said : " This was obviously a well - organised card cloning operation where more than 2,000 card details were recovered .
" Although not all card details had been used , if they had all been used , then according to banking guidelines , he had the potential to recover more than £ 1m . "

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Moody's Investor Service downgraded Washington Mutual Inc.'s WM , - 0.55 % credit rating to below investment grade late Thursday , citing WaMu 's reduced financial flexibility , deteriorating asset quality and expected franchise erosion .
The rating agency cut the group 's senior unsecured rating to below investment grade at Ba2 from Baa3 .
It also reduced the long - term deposit and issuer ratings of the banking unit to Baa3 from Baa2 , though this rating remains investment grade .
Moody 's added the outlook for the ratings is negative .
In a response , Washington Mutual said it believes the decision to cut its ratings to below investment grade " is inconsistent with the company 's current financial position . "
The firm added Moody 's action appears to reflect the uncertainty in the market , rather than a thorough evaluation of its business .

A theoretical model of a quantum dot made out of the semiconductor material gallium arsenide .
The dot contains just 465 atoms .
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
The strange behavior of quantum physics might seem too unpredictable to rely on for our energy needs , but new technologies hope to capitalize on its very strangeness .
The most familiar of these quantum tricks is the fact that light acts both like a wave and a particle .
This dual nature is utilized in solar power technology .
Incoming sunlight is concentrated by mirrors and lenses that rely on the wave - like properties of light .
Once inside a solar cell , however , this focused light collides with electrons in a particle - like way , thus freeing the electrons to create an electric current .
Quantum dots
The next generation of solar cells may employ tiny bits of semiconductor material called quantum dots .
These nanometer - sized devices are so small that only a handful ( anywhere from 1 to 1,000 ) of free electrons can reside inside .
Because of these cramped quarters , a quantum dot behaves like an artificial atom in that its electrons can reside only at specific ( so - called quantized ) energy levels .
These levels define exactly what wavelengths of light the dot will absorb .
" Quantum dots have a host of unusual properties compared to bulk semiconductors , " said Arthur Nozik of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , part of the U.S. Department of Energy .
He and his colleagues are looking at how a single light particle ( or photon ) can enter a dot and excite several electrons , rather than the usual one .
Other researchers are looking to tune the wavelengths at which a dot absorbs light by making it bigger or smaller .
Solar cell manufacturers may one day be able to mix together dots of different sizes to absorb sunlight along a wide range of wavelengths .
Quantum wires
A quantum wire is like a quantum dot stretched out along one direction .
In certain cases , this narrow conduit — 10,000 times thinner than a human hair — can be very good at conducting electricity , as the electrons tend to move in a more orderly fashion down the wire .
One way to make quantum wires is with carbon nanotubes , which are small rolled - up sheets of hexagonally - bound carbon .
Discovered in 1991 , these nanotubes are beginning to show up in all types of applications , including better energy storage .
As one MIT group has shown , it is possible to make a souped - up capacitor from carbon nanotubes .
The researchers grow the nanotubes close together — in what is likely the world 's tiniest shag carpet — to increase surface area inside the capacitor .
The resulting " ultracapacitor " could store as much as 50 percent of the electricity that a similarly - sized battery can , the scientists claim .
This might be ideal inside an electric car , as capacitors are more durable and can charge and discharge much faster than batteries .
Superconductors
Although quantum wires can be good conductors , another quantum substance is the best .
Superconductors are materials in which the electrons pair up to carry the current .
This pairing is unusual because electrons typically repel each other , but quantum physics overcomes this and , in so doing , reduces the electrical resistance in the superconductor to zero , or very close to zero .
Resistance is what makes a wire get hot when it carries electricity .
Power companies typically lose about 7 percent of their energy to heat caused by resistance in transmission wires .
Superconducting wires could help reduce this waste .
The trouble is that superconductors only work at extremely cold temperatures .
For example , the longest superconducting cable system for transmitting power — installed earlier this year along a half - mile stretch of the Long Island power grid by American Superconductor Corporation and its partners — must be surrounded by liquid nitrogen to keep it at minus 330 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 200 degrees Celsius ) .
American Superconductor is also working on applying its superconducting wires to offshore wind turbines , in order to make them smaller and more efficient .
Light - emitting diodes
One good way to use all this quantum - derived electricity is to turn on a light - emitting diode , or LED , which works like a solar cell but in reverse .
Electric current going through the diode causes electrons to jump across a barrier between two types of semiconductor material .
The jumping electrons then fall into lower energy states , emitting a photon .
Because the wavelength of this emitted light is in a very narrow band , there is not a lot of wasted energy emitted in the infrared , as is the case for normal incandescent light bulbs .
An LED 's efficiency is even better than that of compact fluorescents .
LEDs are now being made into full light fixtures that can replace normal bulbs .
Their extra cost can be offset by lower electricity bills .
In the energy saving business , every quantum bit can help .
Forget Crystal Balls : Let the Power of Math Inform Your Future
HBOS and Lloyds TSB last night created a monstrous new banking entity safe in the knowledge that nothing can possibly go wrong .
Politicians and businessmen breathed a collective sigh of relief as two of the biggest names on the high street formed one very long name that will never do anything other than be brilliant all the time .
Martin Bishop , a senior trader at Madeley Finnegan , said : " History tells us that massive financial institutions do not fail .
Ever .
Okay , there is maybe a tiny handful of exceptions .
" Okay , maybe 40 or 50 exceptions .
Actually , you 're right , this is starting to look really dodgy .
If you 'll excuse me , I have to start selling the shit out of Lloyds TSB . "
As shares in the new banking giant plummeted , the government came under renewed pressure to stop people wanting lots of money .
A Treasury spokesman said : " We 've devised a regulatory framework that will effectively ban greed and no - one will ever be able to find a way round it .
At least for the first six months .
Probably . "
Meanwhile Downing Street sources let it be known the prime minister played a key part in securing the deal which will put 40,000 people out of work .
Economic theory predicts that rent control laws will result in these effects ( from the Gwartney textbook ) :
1. Shortages and black markets will develop for housing .
2 . The future supply of affordable housing will decline .
3 . The quality of housing will deteriorate .
4 .
Non-price methods of rationing housing will increase in importance ( discrimination ) .
5 .
Inefficient use of housing will result .
6. Long - term renters will benefit at the expense of newcomers .
Today , there are 43,317 New York City apartments where tenants ( or their heirs ) pay rents first frozen in 1947 .
There are another 1,043,677 units covered by rent stabilization .
All told , about 70 % of the city 's rental apartments are either rent controlled or rent stabilized .
And because the system has been in place for more than six decades , many residents see their below - market rents as an entitlement .
This system is destructive to the city 's housing stock , because landlords who own rent - controlled apartments have less incentive to pay for repairs and upkeep ( see # 3 above ) .
It also warps the housing market , and forces many new arrivals to occupy the least desirable apartments ( see # 6 above ) .
Many renters who pay below - market rents are reluctant to move -- because it's too difficult to get as good a deal elsewhere in the city ( see # 5 above ) .
Thus , economists Ed Glaeser and Erzo Luttmer estimate that 21 % of the city 's renters live in apartments that are bigger or smaller than they would otherwise occupy .
The controlled rents certainly do n't increase the number of affordable apartments ( see # 1 and # 2 above ) .
As we have seen , burning someone to a crisp with a laser takes a tremendous amount of energy .
Blinding them is much easier .
U.S. Special Operations Command 's new Advanced Tactical Laser is approximately one hundred thousand times more powerful than a so - called " Class IV " laser , which can cause permanent eye damage .
Since 1995 , there has been a prohibition on the military use of blinding lasers .
However , this only applies to lasers which are " specifically designed , as their sole combat function or as one of their combat functions , to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision " .
The ATL , which was designed for a variety of targets , is not a blinding laser by this definition .
So it likely lies outside the letter , if not the spirit of the law .
The easiest way of stopping a moving vehicle with the Advanced Tactical Laser would be to blind the driver ; this could be accomplished in an instant , far quicker than melting the tires , or any other method .
Whether such a use would be sanctioned is another matter , but engaging someone with such a laser would in any case carry a high risk of blinding them .
Any high - energy laser carries a significant risk of eye damage to other people in the area .
Any stray reflection off metal or glass could blind someone at a considerable distance .
Even the reflection of the laser off steam or smoke may be dangerous .
This item appears in the latest budget for the Air Force 's " Bioeffects And Protection " research :
Integrate dynamic bi-directional reflectivity distribution mathematical models into diagnostic tools of laser eye damage for collateral hazard assessments of typical laser systems .
Expand laser damage threshold database for multiple wavelengths to validate DoD , national , and international safety standards .
Evaluate impact of visible lasers upon critical aircrew and ground force missions .
[ My emphasis ]
The Airborne Laser is tasked with shooting down ballistic missiles which will be safely away from anyone .
The Advanced Tactical Laser –
and other new lasers under development – are likely to be used in close proximity to civilians and friendly troops .
Minimizing the hazard to eyeballs may prove to be a serious challenge to deploying such lasers .
There is also the question of what happens when such lasers become more widely available .
Since 1995 , there has been no sign of blinding lasers proliferating ( the Chinese ZM - 87 does not seem to have spread ) .
But tactical lasers which " incidentally " blind might be another matter .

In Athens during the 2004 Olympic Games , human trafficking cases nearly doubled , according to the Greek Ministry of Public Safety .
Government officials and human rights activists in Canada are worried that Vancouver 's 2010 Olympics could become a similar magnet for traffickers and their victims .
But Canada has yet to successfully prosecute a single person for human trafficking , although the country has been singled out as a major link in the grim global industry in a U.S. State Department report .
Human trafficking , says the report , is the world 's third most lucrative international crime business after drugs and arms smuggling , and Vancouver is a hub .
The coming Olympics will only fuel the trade , predict authorities .
Not only in Athens but at the soccer World Cup in Germany , " there was definitely a demonstrated increase in the exploitation of women in relation to those events , " says Robin Pike , head of B.C. 's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons ( OCTIP ) , an arm of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General .
Taking the UK's efforts as a role model , OCTIP started to work with the Salvation Army , which will launch their " The truth is n't sexy " anti-trafficking campaign this October in Vancouver
Canada lags in convictions
In 2004 , the RCMP estimated that about 600 people are trafficked to Canada for sexual exploitation each year and another 1,500 to 2,200 are brought through the country on their way to the United States .
Police and border officials need to be sensitized towards trafficking victims , says Norm Massie , former RCMP human trafficking coordinator .
" We get the victim out of the situation and reassure them so that over time and with the right people in place ... we can gain their support in order to gather the evidence necessary to advance criminal charges . "
While several criminal charges have been laid over the last years against alleged traffickers , not a single person has been convicted of human trafficking so far .
Others countries are more successful in prosecuting offenders : Sweden had 15 convictions for human trafficking in 2005 and 21 in 2006 .
In the United States , 75 defendants have been convicted of human trafficking since 2001 .
' Under the radar ... very challenging '
The testimony of a trafficked victim is often the only clue to find the offender , and victims are hard to track down , says Pike .
" Human trafficking is very clandestine and under the radar and it is the detection and identification of trafficked victims that has proved to be very challenging in about every country in the world . "
" It 's a very new offence ...
It 's only been on the books for a few years , " says University of B.C. law professor Benjamin Perrin .
" Some prosecutors and police are reluctant to [ allege ] this offence because they are not sure how the court will interprete it . "
Nakpamgi : A first conviction ?
In May of 2002 , Canada ratified the United Nations Palermo Protocol , which commits all undersigned countries to protecting trafficked victims and punishing those who carry out the trafficking .
Three years later , Canada 's Criminal Code was amended to include laws against human trafficking .
The new laws are getting a first test in Toronto , where Imani Nakpamgi pled guilty to forcing two 14 - and 15 - year - old Canadian girls , who were reported missing , into prostitution after advertising them on Craigslist in sexual poses .
For Perrin , the Nakpamgi case is also significant for eventually calling attention to domestic women and children being trafficked as well .
" For many years most people in Canada simply thought of human trafficking as involving foreign nationals , " says Perrin .
" Canadians realize more and more that Canadian women and girls are being used as commodities in the sex trade and Canada needs to do more to punish those who are causing this suffering . "
No long - term solutions for victims
Convictions are further hampered in Canada because there is too little incentive for victims to work with government officals , says Daisy Kler from Vancouver Rape Relief and Women 's Shelter .
" [ Trafficked women ] are here completely illegal ... and because they are illegal , they are afraid to use the system .
Rightly so , because most of the women are sent back once they are identified as being trafficked . "
Most victims of trafficking are eligible to apply for a Temporary Resident Permit ( TRP ) .
From May 2006 up to today , 43 victims of trafficking have been referred to Citizenship and Immigration Canada , of which 17 have been granted a TRP .
" That does n't mean the others have been deported , " says CIC spokesperson Karen Shedd .
" They might have applied for other kinds of permits , and not all victims want to stay . "
While TRPs have been recently extended to six months , Kler fears that victims still have few chances to build up a new life in Canada .
" We know of six trafficked people who asked for TRPs and they got that but none have been granted citizenship , " says Kler .
" So part of the solution is to offer women who are trafficked a genuine route to citizenship whether or not they testify against their trafficker . "
The CIC holds no records on how many trafficked persons applied for permanent residence or citizenship .
Trafficked women , especially when they come from poor and unstable countries , need to be protected from being sent back , says Kler .
Too often , once returned to their homeland , the women find themselves vulnerable to further exploitation .
' The truth is n't sexy '
Backers of Vancouver 's upcoming " The Truth Is n't Sexy " campaign against human trafficking point to a similar effort carried out during the 2006 World Cup soccer competition held in Germany .
The nation - wide effort used posters , shirts , whistles and beer coasters to get its message out .
The German government says its studies found there was less human trafficking than anticipated during the contest .
Pike hopes that a public campaign will make Canadians more aware of trafficked victims in their vicinity and contact public services if they believe they 've spotted a victim .

Experts warn of Nov. 4 voting meltdowns
While the two campaigns Tuesday accused one another of trying to steal or suppress votes , experts in election administration are focusing on the old standbys : Faulty machines , questionable voter lists , last - minute litigation .
The likely trouble spots , the experts say , include two familiar election reprobates : Ohio and Florida .

But there are also some new entrants , as the broad new playing field of the 2008 presidential election means more states are competitive , more citizens are participating , and the potential for Election - Day meltdowns like the notorious administrative collapse in Florida in 2000 has increased .
Many pointed , in particular , to Colorado as the possible source of a late night November 4 , while others suggested that record turnout in states like Virginia and Georgia could challenge local election officials .
" There 's still reason to be concerned in terms of what 's going to take place in November , " said Kimball Brace , whose firm , Election Data Services , advises local governments on election administration .
Brace cited everything from new machines in Cleveland and South Florida to the rise in absentee voting , many of which are counted by error - prone " optical scan " machines .
" The states that we 're keeping an eye on [ are ] still Florida , but also Ohio , and also Colorado .
Those three states are the problem ones from an election administration standpoint , " he said .
The location of a Florida - 2000 - style Election - Day meltdown - with the attendant legal clashes , and lingering doubt - is impossible to predict .
Such crises only come about in extremely tight elections , and require the confluence of that close vote with an administrative failure .
But despite eight years of federal and state efforts to create a more standardized , higher - tech national framework for election administration , most state votes will still be administered by county election boards whose competence and equipment vary wildly .
The campaigns , meanwhile , have already begun intense legal skirmishing in states like Ohio and Indiana over a new wave of early voting that began in September .
" In South Florida you 've got areas that are going to be on their third separate voting technology in their third consecutive presidential election , " said Doug Chapin , the editor of the non-partisan Electionline.org .
" Ohio once again is in ground zero for policy changes and litigation . "
Colorado , meanwhile , is still reeling from a true Election Day meltdown in 2006 , a technical failure in Denver that may have swung at least one close race .
" It 's squarely in both campaigns ' sights , " Chapin said .
" They were one of the last states to finish their voter registration list .
They had a very bad experience with Election Day voter centers in 2006 .
Lots of changes , lots . "
Many states are taking pressure off their November 4 poll sites with a push for early voting , which has been embraced by both presidential campaigns .
" Mail - in voting helps to relieve a lot of the pressure , " said Rich Coolidge , a spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state .
But Brace said early voting comes with its own concerns :
The error rate for optical - scan ballots transported to a central location for counting is sharply higher than those tallied on site , he said .
Florida , the state that has been synonymous with Election Day chaos since the 2000 recount , remains especially troubled despite intense local efforts to remedy its problems .
A 2006 congressional election was marred by a dispute concerning more than 18,000 " undervotes " on ballots that registered votes for some offices but not for the congressional race itself .
The losing campaign claimed that unusually high number of undervotes was due to a software glitch on " touch - screen " voting machines .
In preparation for the presidential election , 15 Florida counties complied with a new edict to abandon their touch - screen voting machines , and switched to optical scan machines , which leave a physical record of each voter 's ballot in case of a recount .
But this August in Palm Beach County , a close local primary where 3,400 ballots went uncounted - followed by a series of recounts - led officials to worry and re-test the optical scan voting machines .
" We feel pretty good about the machines , " said Jennifer Krell Davis , the communications director for the Florida secretary of state , who said most had had a test - run in this year 's presidential primaries .
But just in case , " All of the supervisors have been encouraged to plan as if there is definitely going to be a county - wide recount , " she said .
Some observers say that the main problem may simply be delays , and depressed turnout , as voters navigate the new machines .
" To me it 's the possibility of the long lines that 's the issue , " said Susan McManus a political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa .
In Ohio , where Democrats continue to complain that a Republican secretary of state tilted the rules toward George W. Bush in 2004 , the shoe is now on the other foot .
Ohio Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 's directives on early voting , voter identification , and interpreting voter registration forms have taken fire from Republicans .
" What we 're worried about is the registration lists , " said Terri Enns , a law professor at Ohio State University .
Ohio courts are currently considering whether Brunner is required to supply lists of questionable registrations to county election boards .
Democrats say the county boards could unfairly remove voters due to technical glitches and similar names ;
Republicans have charged that people who should n't be allowed to vote will .
The result of the wrangling may be more voters casting provisional ballots , which require laborious checking and and time - consuming counting .
" It could mean that we do n't know the outcome of Election Day as soon , " said Enns .
There have also been machine problems .
A glitch in the touch - screen machines used during the primary has meant that Cuyahoga County spent September scrambling to test and ensure that new optical scan ballots work .
A spokesperson for Brunner did n't respond to a call seeking comment on the litigation or the preparations .
The newest state on the list of potential troublespots is shadowed by a disastrous election in Denver two years ago .
Denver County responded by scrapping its machines and reverting to old - fashioned paper ballots and printed lists of voters this year , but critics are still worried about the state 's capacity to manage the surge of registrations in a closely fought race .
" I 'm afraid that there will be problems - so many counties are doing so many different things , " said state Senator Ken Gordon , a Democrat whose narrow defeat in the 2006 race for Secretary of State is attributed by some to the chaos in Denver that year .
" We 're expecting huge turnout , we have a long ballot - and this is where I think the problem will occur , " he said , noting that 18 ballot measures may lead to long voting times and long lines at the polls .
While many counties will allow voters to use paper ballots if lines get long , two key counties in the Denver suburbs do n't have that option , Gordon said .
" There will be glitches , but the Secretary has confidence in the state of Colorado and the county clerks who have been working diligently , " said Coolidge , the spokesman for the secretary of state , who said that the fact that 40 percent of voters had requested mail - in ballots would keep lines short on November 4 .
Observers of election administration , however , say it 's hard to predict where the next perfect electoral storm will land .
New Mexico , for instance , was the site of a long vote count in 2004 , and is against hotly contested .
Tova
Wang , the vice president for research at Common Cause , cited Georgia as a state that might have trouble coping with the 2008 contest , criticizing their voter registration requirements .
A spokesman for the Georgia secretary of state , Matt Carrothers , said his department had encouraged a massive surge in early voting , which will take pressure off the Election Day poll sites .
And he said the state and counties had put in " an enormous amount of preparation " for the November 4 vote .
Wang also cited Virginia , which may be a crucial battleground this year , as a potential hot spot .
Chris Ashby , a lawyer and longtime observer of Virginia elections , who supports McCain , said the " increased use of touch - screen voting machines " could lead to technical problems .
But he said the state had passed a test in the high - turnout Democratic primary .
" It 's impossible to make predictions , " said Wang .
" Probably what 's going to happen is what nobody anticipates . "
Another risk , said Susan McManus , the Florida professor : Even discussing potential problems could have an impact at the polls .
" What I 've heard some people worry about is that too much discussion of a meltdown in Florida before it happens may keep at home the very people we 're trying to bring into the system , " she said .

Finding the Perfect Diamond
Selecting Diamond Engagement Rings Within Your Budget
There are four factors diamond experts consider when valuing a diamond .
They are Cut , Color , Carat Weight and Clarity .
These four factors add up to the final cost of your diamond .
Which is the most important factor for you to consider ?
Most experts believe the cut and proportion are the most important factors in determining a diamond 's value .
They are what give the diamond its sparkle and brilliance .
That is why we only sell good or better cut diamonds for all of our diamond engagement rings and wedding rings .
We never sell cheap diamonds that have no luster .
The brilliant shine from our expertly cut diamonds will add sparkle to your diamond engagement and wedding rings for eternity .
Now that you understand what ’s most important , you will need to consider the other factors that play a role in the diamond you choose .
Remember , the most important factor in purchasing the perfect engagement ring is your own personal preference and taste .
Read on and decide what matters most to you and your bride - to - be in diamond engagement and wedding rings .
Cut
The cut of the diamond can affect its price by as much as 50 % .
Please take note ... cut does not equal shape when speaking about diamonds .
A well cut diamond is necessary if you want your diamond engagement rings to have brilliance and sparkle .
When we talk about cut , we are talking about the stone 's symmetry , proportions and finish .
These factors are instrumental to the stone 's " brilliance " and " fire . "
The term " cut " may be exchanged with the term " make " when speaking about a diamond .

Color
Remember , the color of a diamond is not important as long as the person wearing it is happy !
Diamond color is graded on a lettered scale from D to Z , D being the least presence of color or the whitest .
It is also the most expensive letter grade , because very few diamonds will receive this high grade .
Diamonds in the D to J range are all considered colorless or near colorless without any noticeable traces of yellow .
Diamonds that are graded K color and darker are less expensive and will begin to show some yellow tinge of color .
It is very hard even for a professional to detect the differences in color in the D -F range .
This is especially true when the diamond is placed in a setting .
If you are looking for more affordable diamond wedding rings consider the fact that diamonds in the D - J range will look even whiter in a white gold or platinum setting , because the whiteness of the diamond is reflected in the white metal and any yellow tint is diminished .
Yellower diamonds darker than k will appear whiter in a yellow mounting .
The yellow gold color of the engagement ring setting masks the yellow tint of the diamond and makes it look whiter .
To ensure that our diamonds are among the best colors , Danforth Diamond does not offer any loose certified diamond below the color grade of J .

Carat Weight
Generally speaking , the higher the carat weight , the greater the per-carat price of the diamond .
Carat is a unit of weight not of size .
One carat is equal to 100 points or 1/5 of a gram .
So if a stone weighs 25 points it is equal to 25/100 of a carat which means ¼ carat .

Rewriting Copyright History , The Elitist Way : Compare File Sharers To 9/11 Terrorists
from the stunning dept
" Arrington 's stance , of course , epitomizes the permissive attitude about intellectual property that has already destroyed the music business and is now threatening to kill the holy trinity that includes Hollywood , the television industry , and the book trade . "
In 1999 , when Napster first assaulted the recorded music industry with its peer - to - peer technology , we heard similarly open - minded nonsense from Web 1.0 moguls like MP3.com founder Michael Robertson and Public Enemy 's Chuck D. Almost 10 years later , the catastrophic consequences of Napster 's mass piracy are all too tragically evident .
In 1997 , global recorded music sales were $ 45 billion .
By next year , it is estimated that they will have fallen to around $ 23 billion -- an almost 50 percent drop in sales in a little more than a single decade .
" The truth , of course , is that the theft of digital content is no more " natural " than holding up little old ladies on street - corners or crashing civilian airliners into tall buildings .
And it 's the responsibility of thought - leaders like Arrington to use their privileged positions to educate the innocent about the evils of digital thievery . "
Error 1 : Calling infringement " theft . "
Error 2 : Saying that it 's irresponsible for someone who notices that the majority of the population is breaking a law to suggest that perhaps it 's time to rethink that law .
Error 3 : Suggesting actions done by the majority of the population is the equivalent of the 9/11 hijackers .
Error 4 : Saying that any " thought - leader " has a " responsibility " to take a particular stand
Error 5 : Saying that infringement is a problem of " innocents " run wild .
Error 6 : Putting a moral angle ( " evil " ) on an issue that is merely one of business models
By stating his opposition to criminalizing " natural behavior , " Arrington is not only legitimizing online theft , but he is also undermining the credibility of entertainment companies , such as Hulu or Blinkbox that have invested major resources into building entirely legal Web businesses .
Defending YouTube 's flagrant disregard for intellectual property laws is tantamount to justifying criminal behavior ....

When we first debunked Hank Williams ' problematic attack on Mike Arrington for suggesting , reasonably , that copyright law had reached the point that it needed a serious rethink , someone told me that Hank Williams is trying to become " the next Andrew Keen . "
Keen , of course , wrote a book last year about how the internet is somehow destroying culture , with the basic thesis being that " culture " is defined only as professionally produced content .
Effectively , his argument was that non-professionally produced content simply can't be good , so by competing with professionally produced content , all that amateur content was somehow damaging professional content .
The logical errors in this thesis are pretty easy to spot , but we 'll just mention the obvious one : if professional content is so much better than amateur content , what does it have to fear from amateur content ?
In fact , Keen 's whole thesis is so ridiculous , and the book praising the reliability and accuracy of " professional " media is so riddled with errors , distorted truths and outright falsehoods , that some have suggested ( credibly ) that Keen is merely satire .
Everything that Keen claims is bad about amateur media , he does -- repeatedly .
Either way , it appears that he 's a bit jealous of Hank Williams taking up his role in these debates , as he 's finally chimed in on Arrington 's original piece , just a few weeks late .
Keen 's take is so filled with errors that it definitely seems to support the " satire " theory -- and for now we 're going to go with that theory , and assume it 's the case .
But , for a few howlers in the piece , try these on for size :
This would be the music industry that is seeing every single aspect of its business on the upswing ( other than the sale of plastic discs ) ?
This would be Hollywood that had its best year ever in 2007 ?
Ah , right .
Destroyed , huh ?
This is " professional " content at work .
This is classic Keen .
Total misdirection in how you define the market and selective quoting of facts .
You see , markets for obsolete products shrink , but the overall market is not shrinking .
It 's like the analyst reports that whined about the market for " PDAs " shrinking just as smartphones were taking over .
Did we say that smartphones destroyed the market for PDAs or did we just recognize that the market evolved ?
Keen leaves out the fact that concert revenue is at record highs .
He leaves out the fact that more people today are making music than ever before in history , and more people are able to listen to more music than ever before in history .
By any real measure , it would appear theindustry is thriving , even if the obsolete part ( selling recordings ) is fading .
And , then , there 's Keen 's coup de grace , comparing those who want to listen to music to the 9/11 terrorists in a sentence riddled with errors :
So many errors in just such a short quote .
You 'd never see that from a professional writer ... oh wait .
We 'll finish it off one more howler :
Ah , you see , in Keen 's satirical world , companies like Hulu and Blinkbox that offer up professionally produced content deserve to have their business models protected by the government and criminal laws .
But those that support amateur content are criminal enterprises .
The fact that Keen seems unable to grasp the difference between a service provider and a user in terms of criminal liability is the least of the problems here .
The fact that Keen seems unable to grasp the fact that these are merely different business models for distributing content -- and the one he dislikes is winning in the market -- suggests an unwillingness to actually understand what 's happening here .
What it comes down to is that folks like Keen and Williams have decided that there 's a certain class of content that " counts , " and that 's " professional " content .
All other content is a problem -- especially if it interferes with an obsolete business model .
Basically , they 've decided that they like one particular ( poor and increasingly obsolete ) business model for a particular group of companies , and decided that interference with that business model must be a crime -- even if the end result is exactly the opposite of what they predict ( i.e. , there 's more content being produced today than ever before -- it 's just that it 's happening using a very different model than the one they like ) .
Luckily , we live in a world where business models adapt and change , and the companies and pundits unwilling to do so will simply fade away .

The Best Toaster Ovens
What are the best toaster ovens ?
Toaster ovens are efficient devices for cooking small meals .
They typically use two 750 watts heating elements and draw a total 1500 watts , whereas electric ranges draw about 3000 watts ( and thus require a 240 volt electric socket ) .
Toaster ovens also heat up more quickly , due to their smaller size .
But the most efficient toaster ovens are those that incorporate a convection fan and good insulation into their design .
The fan blows heated air continuously around the food being cooked , thus reducing required temperature and cooking times .
On average , they cut energy use by about 20 % , and cooking time is reduced by about 30 % .
Food also tends to cook better because of the more even temperatures in the oven .
Some owners complain that convection fans are noisy , but others say the noise is exaggerated .
One reviewer on Amazon says :
There is a hum from the convection fan but it is no louder than the sound of my refrigerator compressor or my microwave when in use .
Here is our round - up of the best toaster ovens :
The Krups FBC2 Convection Toaster Oven
The best sources for ratings of toaster ovens are Consumer Reports , Cook ’s Illustrated , Real Simple , and Good Housekeeping .
According to the reviews , the convection toaster oven with the best rating overall was the Krups FBC2 toaster oven .
Not only does this oven include a convection fan , it also sports more heating elements other toaster ovens .
The toaster has a special function where it will alternate between powering each of its quartz heating elements .
Each element is brought to its full 1600 watts power , so that radiant heat is maximized .
Reviewers also say this oven is easy to use and cleans up easily .
You can get it from Amazon for around $ 160 .
Amazon reviewers give it 4 out of 5 stars ( 168 reviewers . )
T- Fal Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven
Avanté Elite by T - Fal is another toaster oven that was highly rated in reviews .
Many reviewers commented that this compact toaster cooks very evenly due to its convection fan .
It also has a roomy interior : you can fit a 12 ″ pizza inside or 6 pieces of toast inside .
Avanté Elite alsopreheats quickly — it takes about 3 minutes for the oven to preheat to 350 degrees .
You can get it from Amazon for around $ 100 .
During his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention , Barack Obama spoke movingly of restoring the American Dream , the dream that allowed him to rise from poverty to Columbia University , Harvard Law School , and now , the Democratic nominee for President .
In the meantime , the Republican party continue to try to turn their opponents ’ strengths into weaknesses as they tap into voters ’ resentments by suggesting that Obama might be too exceptional , too well - qualified , too “ elitist ” to be president .
Aziz Rana recounts the history of Obama ’s American Dream , and argues that many working class voters remember they once had a different dream , one that makes them skeptical of meritocratic success .
How can Barack Obama , a man who only recently paid off his student loans and who lives a relatively modest life in Chicago ’s Hyde Park , a few blocks from one of America ’s poorest neighborhoods , be more “ elitist ” than John McCain , the son of an admiral ( not to mention the husband of a beer heiress ) , or more “ elitist ” than Hillary and Bill Clinton , a couple whose joint earnings since 2000 top 100 million dollars ?
Yet the E- word , and the charge that Obama is out of touch with the experiences of white , blue - collar workers , first leveled against Obama by the Clintons during the primary race , still hang heavy over his otherwise charmed campaign .
These charges stick around not because of the working - class credentials or commitments of Obama ’s opponents , but because of a problem inherent in contemporary politics that neither party ever addresses , that highly educated professionals are the driving force , financially and politically , behind both major parties .
The Democratic leadership particularly continues to present itself as the best hope for the working class , while sharing few economic interests and fewer cultural experiences ( now rebranded as “ values ” ) with the people it claims to represent .
Thus far , Obama has constructed his campaign around a reformist message backed by personal example .
His life story suggests the possibility of success through meritocratic opportunities , individual educational achievement , and high - status employment .
In his now famous speech on race following the Reverend Jeremiah Wright controversy , Obama described himself as proof of America ’s greatness — the potential for any individual , no matter his racial or class background , to achieve the rewards of professional status .
He emphasized that it is precisely his diverse connections and social experiences ( from life in Indonesia to Harvard Law School ) that situate him to protect the promise of equal opportunity :
I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas .
I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton ’s army during World War II and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas .
I ’ve gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world ’s poorest nations .
I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners — an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters .
I have brothers , sisters , nieces , nephews , uncles and cousins , of every race and every hue , scattered across three continents , and for as long as I live , I will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible .
By tying the professional ethos to the old aspirations of the civil rights movement , Obama unifies seemingly unconnected constituencies .
It ’s a story compelling to upper - status voters , students , and African Americans , and it has allowed him to create a powerful political coalition .
Each group sees Obama ’s message as proof of the continued vitality of equal opportunity .
It would be simplistic to view his support within the black community as merely a matter of ethnic solidarity ; in fact , there has always been an element within the civil rights movement that devoted itself expressly to the opening of the professional world to blacks and other minorities .
The best - known civil rights litigation of the 1950s involved segregated primary schools , but the earliest NAACP test cases focused on postgraduate professional study — especially law school .
One of the first serious victories in the NAACP legal strategy was 1938 ’s Missouri ex rel Gaines v. Canada , which held that Missouri violated equal protection guarantees by failing to provide in - state law school education for black students .
A decade later , Sweatt v. Painter ( 1950 ) went further , holding that individuals could in no way be denied access to law school on the basis of race .
For NAACP lawyers , equality was crucially about including blacks in the American project of social mobility — about winning for blacks the opportunity to achieve professional status through meaningful education and hard work .
Obama ’s personal story and political vision combine the hopes of both the professional elite and many in the black community , carrying on the aspirations of those early civil rights lawyers : that to aspire to become a lawyer would become a civil right .
Throughout our history there have always been multiple versions of the American dream .
These accounts held in common the hope that hard work , discipline , and self - reliance would allow those recognized as citizens not only to improve their economic lot and achieve personal happiness , but to participate fully in political life .
Today , however , only one version of the dream continues to make sense as a sustainable personal project .
This is the dream exemplified by Barack and Michelle Obama — as well as by their former rivals Hillary and Bill Clinton — a dream of success through higher education and a life in professional work .
It is a vision of social advancement that leaves little room for historically important narratives of blue - collar respectability .
This now dominant version of the American dream first emerged around the turn of the twentieth century in the wake of massive structural transformations .
Industrialization , heightened bureaucracy , and corporate consolidation helped generate an economic and social need for professional groups such as business managers , lawyers , doctors , social workers , and teachers .
Louis Brandeis , in his 1905 Harvard lecture “ The Opportunity in the Law , ” crystallized the account of freedom and independence that motivated these groups .
Brandeis argued that lawyers and other professionals were specially situated to think in terms of right policy rather than divisive politics .
The essence of legal training was “ the development of judgment , ” in which lawyers learned the value of “ patient research and develop [ed ] both the memory and the reasoning faculties . ”
Moreover , legal practice , like all professional work , was marked by a high degree of autonomy and creativity .
The lawyer defined his own tasks , ideally served a diverse and broad community , and became skilled at testing moral and political logic against empirical reality .
Given these attributes , Brandeis hoped that the professional stratum would struggle to reconcile competing interests in defense of a nonpartisan public good .
The professional class would protect the weak against the powerful , but only in ways that reduced conflict and allowed for the smooth functioning of collective institutions .
At the time when Brandeis was describing the promise of professionalism , three earlier accounts of the American dream not only survived but were real competitors for social preeminence .
In Thomas Jefferson ’s founding republican vision , yeoman farmers were “ the most valuable citizens . . . the most vigorous , the most independent , the most virtuous , . . . tied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interest by the most lasting bonds . ”
To this Jeffersonian vision of “ the cultivators of the earth , ” a rapidly urbanizing nineteenth century added the small - business owner and the unionized industrial worker .
The former aspired to the same freedom as the farmer by cultivating a shop instead of acreage ; the latter strove ( with mixed results ) to achieve economic independence through collective political activity .
In Brandeis ’s time , these three versions of the American dream each still constituted a viable route to meaningful political and social life .
Today , by contrast , all such dreams are essentially foreclosed .
The independent farmer lives on in the national imagination , but industrial farming has rendered him marginal both politically and socially .
The quantity of small businesses begun each year suggests that the aspiration of having one ’s own shop persists .
Yet for the past half - century bankruptcy has been more likely than success .
Statistics cited by Bush ’s own Small Business Administration ( SBA ) show that more than half of small businesses close within four years and more than 60 percent within six .
The title of the SBA article , “ Redefining Business Success : Distinguishing Between Failure and Closure , ” perfectly captures the difficulty of sustaining optimism , even for propaganda purposes , about the vitality of small - scale entrepreneurship .
As for blue - collar workers , deindustrialization and the weakening of the labor movement have made the wage earner ’s dream of middle - class respectability less and less tenable .
Real incomes for working - class families have been declining for three decades , and highly skilled jobs once available to high school graduates are now memories from a previous era .
Abraham Lincoln , in his 1859 speech at the Wisconsin State Fair , concluded that the ideal of the small businessman or farmer was meant to be accessible to everyone :
The prudent , penniless beginner in the world , labors for awhile , saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land , for himself ; then labors on his own account another while , and at length hires another new beginner to help him .
This , says its advocates , is free labor — the just and generous , and prosperous system , which opens the way for all — gives hope to all , and energy , and progress , and improvement of condition to all .
This classless universality — the hope that every American citizen , through free labor , could enjoy middle - class respectability , economic freedom , and the intellectual benefits of education — lay at the core of the dreams championed by farmers , small - business owners , and factory workers .
In the nineteenth century , such universal rhetoric coexisted with the practical exclusion of blacks and women , who were considered to be beneath citizenship .
Crucially , however , there was nothing intrinsic to farming , wage earning , or entrepreneurship that required the permanent separation of these groups from the promise of social respectability .
Today , one can and should hope for an American dream that truly includes all Americans , and which recognizes and respects all the different types of labor the country needs .
This would fulfill the promise of nineteenth - century aspirations .
Instead we have been left with the professional ideal , which values only certain types of work and thus implicitly disdains the rest .
It is an inherently exclusive ideal , structured around a divide between those engaged in high - status work and those confined to task execution .
The political theorist Iris Marion Young writes , “ Today equal opportunity has come to mean only that no one is barred from entering competition for a relatively few privileged positions . ”
The idea of exclusivity is a necessary structural feature of professionalization .
As a model for society , however , it validates an economic and cultural divide between those with meaningful access to social respectability and the vast majority of Americans , who remain consigned to low status and low - income employment .
This divide is antithetical to democracy .
The professional and educational meritocracy justifies a basic hierarchy in which only those with professional status wield political and economic power .
The democratic ideal of ordinary citizens collectively deciding the fate of key institutions has little in common with this logic — a logic that is aristocracy by another name .
Precisely because all three alternative versions of the American dream were universal , all imagined work — whether industrial , agricultural , or entrepreneurial — as a training ground for democratic citizenship .
Farmers and entrepreneurs developed the personal virtues necessary for political decision making .
As for the industrial worker , the union was considered a continuous education in democratic control , and one ’s role in its management and success were a miniature form of collective self - rule .
Barack Obama ’s political ascent reiterates the current dominance of the professional ethic and one side of the civil rights movement .
But there was always another side , which presented the movement as our most recent attempt to create a political community in which all citizens , including those truly marginalized , could assert power and achieve social respectability .
Malcolm X , and Martin Luther King Jr. argued that our social problems were structural , the result of fundamental disagreements between the haves and the have - nots .
These disagreements could not be papered over by talk of consensus , because the interests of the culturally privileged rested on continuing a politics of exclusion .
As King often maintained , freedom requires making democracy a general way of life .
This means more than integrating liberal society ; it entails eliminating the basic economic and political hierarchies on which postwar liberalism rests .
Today ’s professional creed — while undoubtedly better than the Bush administration ’s culture of cronyism , corporate profiteering , and rejection of expertise — remains a long way from these aspirations .
To the extent that Obama ( and the Democratic Party leadership ) refuse to offer more than the professional ideal , any reform agenda will fail to address the basic situation of most Americans .
His comments about small - town voters at a fund - raising event in San Francisco were indicative : “ You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania , and . . . the jobs have been gone now for twenty - five years and nothing ’s replaced them .
. . .
So it ’s not surprising then that they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . ”
Obama ’s tone - deafness , as well as Clinton ’s opportunistic denunciations — her aides quickly began handing out “ I ’m not bitter ” stickers — spoke to a larger failing in the party as a whole .
Political pundits like Tom Frank and Paul Krugman commonly ask why low - income constituents seem to vote less and less with their pocketbooks .
This question suggests that the New Deal coalition was built primarily on a social welfare agenda .
While such programs have been essential to providing millions of American with economic security , the heart of the New Deal lay elsewhere .
From 1932 until 1968 , the Democratic Party rested on two descriptions of American life — the American dream as embodied by the rural farmer and the industrial worker .
It gained sustenance from a respect for these accounts of middle - class achievement , economic independence , and democratic inclusion .
Today ’s party , however , has given up on establishing new forms of solidarity for nonprofessional citizens .
All it has to offer is a lose - lose proposition : join the competition for professional status and cultural privilege at a severe disadvantage , or do n’t join it at all .
The party holds on to the social programs of the past , but in ever more truncated form .
It presents a politics of consensus while ignoring the fact of basic division .
If Obama hopes to save his party and to address the interests and experiences of working - class citizens , he will have to challenge the hegemony of the professional and with it the closing of the American dream .
The question is whether he and those around him are interested in this task , or whether they are determined to recycle the failed homilies of postwar liberalism and meritocratic success .

The discovery of the earliest known cases of human tuberculosis ( TB ) in bones found submerged off the coast of Israel shows that the disease is 3000 years older than previously thought .
Direct examination of this ancient DNA confirms the latest theory that bovine TB evolved later than human TB .
The new research sheds light on how the TB bacterium has evolved over the millennia and increases our understanding of how it may change in the future .
The bones , thought to be of a mother and baby , were excavated from Alit - Yam , a 9000 year - old Pre-Pottery Neolithic village , which has been submerged off the coast of Haifa , Israel for thousands of years .
Professor Israel Hershkovitz , from Tel - Aviv University 's Department of Anatomy , noticed the characteristic bone lesions that are signs of TB in skeletons from the settlement , one of the earliest with evidence of domesticated cattle .
Map of Atlit - Yam site in the North Bay of Atlit , 10 km south of Haifa ( 34°56 ′ E , 32°42.5 ′ N ) .
Inset shows general geographical location .
An international collaborative team , led by Dr Helen Donoghue and Dr Mark Spigelman of the University College London Centre for Infectious Diseases & International Health , conducted detailed analyses of the bones using scientific techniques that revealed DNA and cell wall lipids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the principal agent of human TB .
The DNA was sufficiently well - preserved for molecular typing to be carried out and the analysis of the bacterial cell wall lipids by high performance liquid chromatography provided direct , confirmatory evidence of tuberculosis .
Dr Donoghue said : " What is fascinating is that the infecting organism is definitely the human strain of tuberculosis , in contrast to the original theory that human TB evolved from bovine TB after animal domestication .
This gives us the best evidence yet that in a community with domesticated animals but before dairying , the infecting strain was actually the human pathogen .
The presence of large numbers of animal bones shows that animals were an important food source , and this probably led to an increase in the human population that helped the TB to be maintained and spread .
" We were also able to show that the DNA of the strain of TB in these skeletons had lost a particular piece of DNA which is characteristic of a common family of strains present in the world today .
The fact that this deletion had occurred 9000 years ago gives us a much better idea of the rate of change of the bacterium over time , and indicates an extremely long association with humans . "
Dr Spigelman added : " Examining ancient human remains for the markers of TB is very important because it helps to aid our understanding of prehistoric tuberculosis and how it evolved .
This then helps us improve our understanding of modern TB and how we might develop more effective treatments . "

Sex sold from congressman 's apartment ; School used as base for sex ring George Archibald and Paul M. Rodriguez The Washington Times ; Part A ; Pg. A1 August 25 , 1989 , Friday , Final Edition
A male prostitute convicted of drug trafficking and sex offenses against a minor used the Chevy Chase Elementary School in late 1987 to run his prostitution operation after the school 's principal began buying sex from him , an investigation by The Washington Times has revealed .
The call boy was allowed to sleep and use phones in the school even after the principal left at 5 p.m. , while teachers and the children were still involved in after - school activities such as chorus , Mr. Massaro said .
The principal , Gabriel A. Massaro , conceded in a two - hour interview with The Times Wednesday that he had a four - year relationship with the prostitute and provided him with a guidance counselor 's office and telephone at the model " magnet school " even while children were in classes elsewhere in the building .
The 48 - year - old principal also confirmed that he told the school 's custodian to give the prostitute - who told The Times that he has also worked for a homosexual prostitution service now under investigation by federal authorities and the subject of earlier articles - unlimited access to the building .
Their relationship ultimately soured , Mr. Massaro said , in part because the prostitute used his credit card number without his permission to pay for a personal ad in The Washington Blade , a weekly newspaper of the homosexual community .
" I knew he was an escort , but I did n't know he was running an escort service , " Mr. Massaro said .
" I could n't condone it from going out of here . . .
He may have done that , but I did not know that . "
The escort , who asked to be identified as Greg Davis , the alias he uses in personal ads , told The Times he was at the school at Mr. Massaro 's invitation " on a fairly regular basis " during October and November 1987 and that he regularly used drugs in the building during that time .
Davis said Mr. Massaro " was very aware of what I was doing and what was going on " when he was at the upscale Montgomery County school , which enrols about 350 children , aged 9 through 12 , in the third through sixth grades .
" I would be allowed to use the telephones to check my [ computerized answering ] service and to set up appointments [ with homosexual and heterosexual clients ] , as long as they were n't set up at the school - that was the arrangement , " the prostitute said in one of several interviews .
Davis said Mr. Massaro also explained to him how to turn off the school 's audio security system so his calls would not be overheard .
Mr. Massaro confirmed that such listening devices were installed in the school ceilings but denied telling Davis how to have the security system turned off .
" How would I know that these devices were in operation at the school unless he had warned me about them ? "
Davis asked .
" I normally used the time between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. to set up the appointments for that evening with any of the ladies or myself .
And then after 10 o'clock I would have a person who was used as the driver for the [ escort ] services pick me up at the school .
He would pick me up about 10 p.m. , " Davis said .
On at least one occasion , Davis claimed to have performed homosexual sex with a client in the guidance counselor 's office .
The 45 - year - old man who came to the school to have sex with Davis " was a regular client that I knew , " the prostitute said .
" When I told him that he was going to come to a school , at first he sounded concerned on the telephone .
In a joking sort of manner , he asked me if he was being set up . " .
. .
The client , after thinking about it for a couple of minutes , said , ' Well , it might be a kick . '
That was his response .
In other words , it was a turn - on for him , " Davis said .
The Times has been unable to locate the customer to confirm Davis ' story .
The prostitute said that Mr. Massaro did not know " that I had met a client at the school . "
" He knew me well enough to know that that was possible and told me that that was not supposed to be done , " Davis said .
" For the most part , I agreed .
I went along with it because it was a threat to the security of the [ prostitution ] service to have anybody come to the school . "
Davis also said Mr. Massaro never knew that his driver went into the school or about the drug use in the building .
" I would be there maybe three out of the five nights a week , " the prostitute said .
Mr. Massaro said Davis came to the school several times a week during the two - month period in question .
The principal 's secretary , Peggy Monday , confirmed Davis 's access to the school , but said she saw him no more than once a week .
Mrs. Monday said that Mr. Massaro explained Davis ' presence at the school by saying the man was a friend of his .
" I would either use his [ principal 's ] office or I would use a guidance counselor 's office upstairs " on the school 's second floor where 6th grade classrooms and a science lab are located , Davis said .
Told that Davis had given
The Times a detailed accounting of his call boy activities and criminal convictions , the principal conceded that he was aware of Davis ' work as a prostitute .
Mr. Massaro said he knew the prostitute was still on probation for felony drug and sex offenses and undergoing court - ordered psycho- sexual therapy when he allowed him to use the school 's facilities .
A former school counselor , Mr. Massaro said he talked to Davis 's sex therapist about his court - ordered treatment after the call boy 's felony conviction in 1982 on four charges : possession of obscene material , production of obscene items involving a juvenile , oral sodomy and possession of cocaine .
Davis was convicted in 1975 of cocaine distribution .
" There were some afternoons when he just had nowhere to go , so I would just let him come here to the school and just use the bathroom and stuff like that , " Mr. Massaro said .
" [ The prostitute ] used that [ counselor 's ] office , " the principal said .
Asked if he authorized the escort free use of school phones , Mr. Massaro responded , " Oh , yes . "
Pressed whether Davis might have molested or tried to molest any children at the Chevy Chase school , the principal said , " Oh God , no .
He could n't have .
I do n't think so .
No . "
Davis said he had no dealings with any of the children who attended the elementary school .
The call boy was allowed to sleep and use phones in the school even after the principal left at 5 p.m. , while teachers and the children were still involved in after - school activities such as chorus , Mr. Massaro said .
" I introduced him to one of the custodians and the custodian just let him use the facility , " he said .
" I told him [ the custodian ] that he was my friend . "
" I would leave at five and I thought he [ the prostitute ] would leave shortly thereafter , but before the custodian would close the building , " Mr. Massaro said .
Davis said he advertised his services as an " escort / model " in the classified section of The Washington Blade .
He also advertised homosexual escort services under the name " Male Ad " and services for bisexual threesomes under the name " Bi-Couples . "
Davis said he and a woman partner in the " Bi-Couples " business also ran a female prostitution operation called " Touch of Class , " which advertised in City Paper , a District weekly newspaper .
In his interview with The Times , Mr. Massaro , who is married , at first denied procuring sex from the male prostitute .
But as the interview continued , and a photograph of himself with Davis in the audience of a 1986 telecast of the Phil Donahue show , the principal said he had had a longtime , secret sexual liaison with Davis .
" That 's not true [ previous denials of having homosexual sex with Davis ] , " Mr. Massaro said about 30 minutes into the interview .
" I did .
Yes , I did .
But it was nothing , though .
I mean it was .
. . . "
His voice trailed off as he fought back tears .
" My son died very suddenly [ in 1984 ] and I met [ Greg ] through a friend " - another education professional , he said .
The friend , whom he declined to identify , gave Mr. Massaro the prostitute 's telephone number listed in his escort advertisement in The Washington Blade .
" I began to know [ Greg ] and I got to know him very well , " Mr. Massaro said .
" He became also a surrogate son to me . . .
I do n't want you to think I behaved this way with my son .
I had a normal father - son relationship with my own son , John . "
Mr. Massaro 's son died at age 19 in August 1984 of a viral infection resulting from drug abuse , the principal said .
Mr. Massaro acknowledged frequent payments in cash and by check to Davis ranging from $ 20 to $ 100 .
He also gave the call boy gifts of clothing and restaurant outings , and the loan of his car when the principal went to the beach with his wife and daughter .
After Davis lost his bank account , Mr. Massaro paid for his trysts with checks made out to Davis 's roommate , also the call boy 's homosexual client and a social friend of the elementary principal , he said .
The roommate has confirmed the arrangements .
Both Davis and Mr. Massaro said the call boy was not only a sex partner to the principal but also a family friend .
However , Mr. Massaro said neither his wife nor daughter knew about his secret homosexual sex life .
Mr. Massaro acknowledged that he attended a meeting between Davis and his Alexandria probation officer at the Capitol Hill home of Rep. Barney Frank , Massachusetts Democrat , another client whose home the call boy used to perform sexual services .
" We [ Mr. Massaro and Mr. Frank ] tried to help him through it [ the probation ] , " the principal said .
" [ Davis ] invited me over [ to Mr. Frank 's house ] one day and said , ' Hey , I 'd like you to meet with this person , ' and he was trying to get off [ probation ] .
I do n't even remember all the details . . .
I went as a friend of [ Davis 's ] who could vouch for him as being the person who was trying to pull his life together . "
On some days , Davis said he would arrive at the Chevy Chase school as early as noon , when classes were still in session .
" There were times when the guidance counselor 's office was not available to me , " the prostitute said .
" I would actually use the principal 's office itself , and he would move to another location and I would sit at his desk using his telephones on his desk . "
The phone numbers listed in his escort advertisements were call - forwarded to a Maryland - based answering service called Compu - Voice , he said .
" It 's all done by computer .
When a client calls the answering service , they hear my voice , recorded by remote from a telephone using a series of code numbers .
I would call my own phone number and , through punching in a series of code buttons [ on the telephone dial ]
I was able to obtain access to my own system , and I was able to obtain the messages from the system , and then erase them after I had recorded them into the appointment book , " Davis said .
" I let them know on the tape that I usually returned calls within one hour .
And at the time that I was at the school , I would check in every 15 minutes , " he said .
" And I would go ahead and set up the appointments for the evening until Bobby [ the man who would drive him to his sexual liasons and supply him with illegal drugs ] would arrive . "
Davis said he used cocaine in the school with Bobby and that the two men often raided the school 's cafeteria for their dinner .
" Bobby and I would make something to eat , we 'd play a little basketball [ in the school gym ] , we'd do some coke , and then we'd go out to meet the appointments and to meet the ladies and obtain the commissions from their appointments . "
On several occasions Davis said he and Bobby " did use cocaine in the guidance counselor 's office , " Davis said .
Davis said Mr. Massaro " instructed me on how to have the [ school 's audio ] security system turned off so that the conversations would not be overheard [ when he was conducting his prostitution business ] .
They [ security listening devices ] were in operation after 5 p.m. when all the administration leaves , " he said .
" I would call the security of the school system , report in . . .
I would call in and tell them that I would be there until 10 p.m. doing work for Dr. Massaro , " Davis said .
The prostitute said he " never stayed overnight [ at the school ] or anything like that .
I would take a nap there maybe - there was a couch there - because I was running around a lot from place to place at the time . "
Mr. Massaro said he helped Mr. Davis move from one apartment to another on several occasions during their relationship , and allowed the male escort to store his personal effects and furniture in the school 's basement machine room in 1987 while he was looking for a new place to live .
His landlord found out that he was running a prostitution operation and kicked him out of the apartment , Davis said .
Mr. Massaro said the relationship ultimately soured just over a year ago when Davis started stealing from him .
" I loaned [ Greg ] my car , and he literally stole it .
He never returned it .
He finally did return it .
I sent him money and he did return it , " the principal said .
Also , Davis used the principal 's credit card number without permission to pay for his escort ads in The Washington Blade , Mr. Massaro said .
A spokesman for the newspaper 's publisher confirmed " a problem " that caused The Blade to cancel Davis 's ads but would not elaborate .
" I just used very poor judgment , what can I tell you ? "
Mr. Massaro said .
" It was just stupid .
I just never thought it through .
I just thought I was helping somebody . "
After the car and credit card incidents , Mr. Massaro said he told Davis , " ' Hey , you 've got real problems and I can't help you . '
So that was it and he just left .
And I guess it was then that I really realized that he was a drug abuser . "
Asked if Davis had ever used drugs in his presence , Mr. Massaro said he " may have " smoked marijuana .
" I do n't remember that .
He may have .
He never used anything else , though , other than pot .
I do n't think I ever knew that , until very recently .
. . .
" I 've never used the stuff .
I do n't know what it 's like .
And we talked about that in trying to get off it and trying to help him get off it . . .
Our lives just became very intertwined and I guess I felt as though I could save him . "
Davis , for his part , said that the relationship with Mr. Massaro soured because of a lack of " sensitivity " and " a lack of interest " on his part sexually towards the principal .
Mr. Massaro characterized Davis 's action in going public as " an effort to get back at me . "
He said Davis " was always going to sell his story and I was going to write a book for him and make him famous . . .
He said he had a very interesting life , and one day we were going to sit down and write a book , and I guess that 's what he 's doing . "

Sea unearths secret Nazi bunkers that lay hidden for more than 50 years
Three Nazi bunkers on a beach have been uncovered by violent storms off the Danish coast , providing a store of material for history buffs and military archaeologists .
The bunkers were found in practically the same condition as they were on the day the last Nazi soldiers left them , down to the tobacco in one trooper ‘s pipe and a half - finished bottle of schnapps .
This bunker was entombed under the sand dunes until a violent storm swept away the sands three months ago
The bunkers had not been touched since the war
The bunkers were three of 7,000 built by the Germans as part of Hitler 's ‘ Atlantic Wall ‘ from Norway to the south of France .
But while the vast majority were almost immediately looted or destroyed , these three were entombed under the sand dunes of a remote beach near the town of Houvig since 1945 .
They were uncovered only because recent storms sent giant waves cascading over them , sweeping away the sand and exposing glimpses of the cement and iron structures .
Kim Clausen , curator of the Ringkoebing - Skjern museum views a heater retrieved from the bunker
Stamps of the German Eagle of Adolf Hitler and the Swastika were also retrieved
They were located by two nine - year - old boys on holiday with their parents , who then informed the authorities .
Archaeologists were able to carefully force a way , and were astounded at what they found .
' What 's so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds , ' chairs , tables , communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside , ' says Jens Andersen , the curator of the Hanstholm museum .
The discovery of the fully - furnished bunkers was " unique in Europe , " said Bent Anthonisen , a Danish expert on European bunkers .
Expert Tommy Cassoe : ' It was as if the Nazis had just left yesterday '
And a third expert , Tommy Cassoe , enthused : " It was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around .
Wat I saw blew me away : it was as if the German soldiers had left only yesterday . "
The team working with Cassoe emptied the structures within a few days of boots , undergarments , socks , military stripes , mustard and aquavit bottles , books , inkpots , stamps featuring Hitler , medicines , soda bottles , keys , hammers and other objects .
All of the objects from the shelters have been taken to the conservation centre at Oelgod museum , some 20 miles from the beach to be examined .
The centre 's German curator , Gert Nebrich , judged the find 'very interesting because it is so rare . '
'" We do n't expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved .
Maybe it 's because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum , " he says , carefully showing four
stamps featuring Hitler 's image and the German eagle , found in one bunker .
The Germans left the bunkers in May 1945 after the Nazi surrender .
Historical records show that Gerhard Saalfed was a 17 - year - old soldier with the German army when he arrived at the bunker in January 1945 .
Germany surrendered on May 8 1945 , but it was n‘t until two days later that he and his fellow soldiers left their remote station .
They shut the steel doors of the bunker behind them on their remote beach and went to the nearest town ten miles away to surrender .
' The remote location of the bunkers and the drifting sands that covered them saved them from being ransacked , “ said Cassoe .

Late Update :
The faster they spin , the harder they fall :
Secondary brain cancer or cerebral metastasis is the most common malignancy affecting the brain , and is present in a fifth of all people who die of cancer .
It is formed when cells from a primary cancer , usually in the lungs , are pumped around the body in the blood and clump together in the brain .
Saudi Arabia 's top judiciary official has issued a fatwa authorising the murder of owners of satellite TV networks that broadcast " bad programmes " .
Sheik Saleh al - Lihedan , 79 , chief of the kingdom's highest tribunal , the supreme judiciary council , said satellite channels caused the " deviance of thousands of people " .
He was answering listeners ' questions during the daily radio programme Light in the Path , in which he and other clerics make rulings on what is permissible under Islamic law .
One caller asked yesterday about Islam 's view on satellite TV channels that broadcast " bad programmes " during Ramadan .
" What does the owner of these networks think , when he provides seduction , obscenity and vulgarity ? " said Al - Lihedan .
" Those calling for corrupt beliefs , certainly it 's permissible to kill them .
Those calling for sedition , those who are able to prevent it but do n't , it is permissible to kill them . "
One of the most viewed Arab satellite networks is Rotana , which broadcasts films and music videos .
It is owned by Prince Al - Waleed bin Talal , a billionaire businessman and member of the Saudi royal family whom Forbes ranks as the world 's 13th richest person .
Several other networks are owned by Saudi princes .
Al - Lihedan did not specify particular channels in his judgment .
Fatwas are regularly issued on everyday issues , although they do not have the weight of law .
Al - Lihedan sparked controversy previously when he issued a religious decree permitting Saudis to join jihadists to fight US troops in Iraq .
In his first interview with a foreign newspaper since becoming head of state , Abdullah Gül tells Stephen Kinzer of his vision for his country as a bridge between nations
Days after Russia scored a stunning geopolitical victory in the Caucasus , President Abdullah Gül of Turkey said he saw a new multipolar world emerging from the wreckage of war .
The conflict in Georgia , Gül asserted , showed that the United States could no longer shape global politics on its own , and should begin sharing power with other countries .
" I do n't think you can control all the world from one centre , " Gül told the Guardian .
" There are big nations .
There are huge populations .
There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world .
So what we have to do is , instead of unilateral actions , act all together , make common decisions and have consultations with the world .
A new world order , if I can say it , should emerge . "
Gül , relaxing in a hotel suite with a spectacular view of the glistening Bosphorus , spoke just hours before meeting with the visiting president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He rejected the idea , promoted by the United States and Israel , that the best way to deal with Iran was to isolate , sanction and punish it .
" There are so many important issues , like the nuclear issue , Iraq , the Caucasus , Afghanistan , " he said .
" Iran is definitely having some influence of these issues , so we are talking . "
Gül said Iran had a right to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons .
" We do n't want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region , " he said .
" If it 's in our neighbourhood , we definitely do n't want to see it . "
Asked about the possibility of an American attack on Iran , Gül replied : " I do n't want to think about that .
Everybody should take a lesson from what happened in Iraq , " he said .
" Diplomatic solutions are always better than hard solutions . "
Few countries in the world have changed as dramatically as Turkey over the last decade , and Gül is among the most intriguing new political leaders to emerge here during that period .
When first elected , he seemed to be part of a new Islamic wave that was challenging the entrenched secular elite .
He is a practicing Muslim who married his wife when she was 15 ; she wears the headscarf that some secular Turks consider a badge of reactionary Islam .
Yet he and his closest political ally , the prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , have led a political revolution that has brought Turkey closer to democracy than any regime in the modern state 's 85 - year history .
Gül said Turkey could play a decisive role in bridging the chasm that separates the west from more turbulent regions .
His country 's effort to join the European Union , he said , was its " main agenda " .
" I wish to see Turkey as an island where the European standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well , " he said .
" This will be a real gift to the region , to the world , for peace .
And this Turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many .
" As we are transforming ourselves in that direction , we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries - Muslim countries , central Asian countries , Caucasus countries , Middle Eastern and other countries , " he added , speaking in fluent English .
" Turkey is having a positive impact on them , spreading the values of democracy , freedom , rule of law .
Also , the economic changes here ... are admired .
Maybe that is the indirect influence of this country . "
For much of this year , political life in Turkey was frozen as the constitutional court considered a prosecutor 's charge that the ruling Justice and Development party should be banned because it was a " focus of anti-secular activity " .
Last month the court rejected that argument .
Now , Gül said , Turkey 's priority must be to resume its stalled progress towards political reform .
" In the last two years , we spent our energy on domestic issues , and the reforms slowed down , " he said .
" Now , after the court case , there is a new era .
This is a big opportunity for Turkey .
Everybody realises that reforms are necessary . "
Some European leaders , Gül said , fail ed to recognise the contribution that Turkey was making to stability in the world 's most volatile region .
" This is a big asset for Europe , " he said .
" Turkey has great capacity to influence the region , indirectly , very peacefully , being an inspiration for changes .
Turkey has been playing this role already .
This has not been appreciated enough . "
Opposition to Turkish membership in the EU was for years based on the country 's failure to meet democratic standards .
More recently , politicians in some European countries have sought votes by bashing Turkey and pledging to keep it out of the EU regardless of its progress toward democracy .
These campaigns , Gül said , harmed Europe 's long - term interests .
" Europe should realise that Turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region , " he said .
" Start with the Caucasus ; last month , the problem was not serious , but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation .
" Europe should encourage Turkey , and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us .
Some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues .
Domestic issues are conjunctural ; today it 's there and tomorrow it 's not .
But the strategic issues are always there , and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues .
Unfortunately , nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries . "
Gül repeatedly returned to the importance of Turkey 's democratisation process .
He said it would ultimately resolve all of the country 's domestic problems , including the long - festering conflict with Kurdish nationalists in south - eastern provinces .
" Some call it terror , some call it the south - east problem , some call it the Kurdish problem - whatever you call it , we will find a solution , " he said .
" There are other problems - secularism and anti-secularism - those things will also find solutions in this climate .
That is why I focus on the reform process .
The problem was this : the lack of democracy , the standard of democracy .
That was creating problems , not only in the south - east but in other issues .
That is when we upgrade the standards , these problems will find solutions . "
With that , Gül was off to meet Ahmadinejad .
" Our values are different , " he said with a smile , " but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region . "
Here 's an update on the strange story of the Gulfstream II jet filled with 3.7 tons of cocaine that crashed in the Yucatan last year .
The Mexico City newspaper El Universal reports that European Parliament was investigating the circumstances surrounding the plane , which had previously been used by the CIA for " extraordinary rendition " flights .
The daily said it had obtained documents from the United States and the European Parliament which " show that that plane flew several times to Guantanamo , Cuba , presumably to transfer terrorism suspects . "
It said the European Parliament was investigating the private Grumman Gulfstream II , registered by the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation , for suspected use in CIA " rendition " flights in which prisoners are covertly transferred to a third country or US - run detention centers .
Last October , the Austin American Statesman reported the plane had previously flown to Guantanamo Bay .
Here 's a Chicago Public Radio story from October 31 , 2007 about the crashed CIA drug plane .
The crashed drug plane also has been linked to a Bush fundraiser .
Mad Cow Morning news has been covering stories about the CIA and drug smuggling .
The plane was owned by Donna Blue Aircraft , Inc .
Mad Cow visited Donna Blue 's offices and took photos of what appears to be a sham company .
Here 's a photo of some unmarked police cars parked in front Donna Blue Aircraft 's empty suite :

Tecate , Mexico
Adrug - sniffing dog pulled the U.S. Border Patrol agent to a rusty cargo container in the storage yard just north of the Mexican border .
Peeking inside , he saw stacks of bundled marijuana and a man with a gun tucked in his waistband .
The officer and the man locked eyes for a moment before the smuggler scrambled down a hole and disappeared .
By the time backup agents cast their flashlights into the opening , he was long gone , through a winding tunnel to Mexico .
U.S. authorities called a trusted friend on the other side , Juan Jose Soriano .
The deputy commander of the Tecate Police Department gathered the entire shift of 30 officers at the decrepit police headquarters on Avenida Benito Juarez .
Soriano knew any of them might leak information to the tunnel ’s gangster operators .
So he took their cellphones and sent them away on a ruse about a car chase near the border .
The veteran officer told only a few trusted aides about the tunnel .
Later that day , the officers went into the U.S. and traversed the length of the passageway to an empty building , where they found computers , ledgers and other key evidence .
For U.S. authorities , it was an encouraging example of cross - border cooperation in the drug war .
For Mexico ’s crime bosses , it was a police victory that could not go unpunished .
That night last December , while Soriano slept with his wife and baby daughter , two heavily armed men broke into his house and shot him 45 times .
The 35 - year - old father of three young daughters died in his bedroom .
He had lasted two days as the second - in - command of the department .
The death of a police officer is generally greeted in Mexico with a knowing smirk .
All too often , it is assumed the cop in question was playing for both sides in the raging drug war that has claimed at least 2,000 lives in Mexico this year .
But all indications , from U.S. and Mexican sources , suggestthat Soriano was among the good ones , poorly paid but somehow immune to the lure of big money and the threat of deadly firepower from Mexico ’s violent drug gangs .
Cooperation with U.S. law enforcement ranges from secretive intelligence sharing to high - profile raids and arrests .
It is aggressive police work that runs the risk of death for honest cops .
An intense , soft - spoken man , Soriano struggled for years to clean up the troubled department .
But his corruption - busting ways earned him only contempt from many cops .
At the small shrine to fallen officers in the courtyard at police headquarters , Soriano ’s image is conspicuously absent .
“ It ’s a shame , ” said Donald McDermott , a former Border Patrol assistant chief who worked with Soriano .
“ He was one of the good guys .
. . .
His untimely demise was a blow to border enforcement on both sides of the border . ”
A city of 120,000 tucked in the rugged mountains 40 miles east of Tijuana , Tecate is best known for its tree - lined plaza and beer brewery .
But its tranquil veneer masks its reputation as a hub of organized crime groups that use the surrounding area of boulder - strewn peaks and remote valleys as a launching pad for smuggling drugs and humans .
The 200 - member police department has long been suspected of functioning as an arm of the drug cartels , providing protection and ensuring that smuggling routes remain open along the 75 miles of border for which the department is responsible .
Soriano stood apart : an aggressive , disciplined lawman who aspired to become police chief , according to law enforcement sources on both sides of the border .
Unlike most Mexican cops , he had a degree in police science .
And he spent three years working for Grupo Beta , a federal immigrant - safety force with whom he once saved 65 immigrants in a snowstorm .
In 2003 , Soriano took charge of Tecate ’s SWAT - like special response team .
In a break from past practices , he reached out to U.S. agencies for training opportunities and cross - border crime fighting .
Soriano ’s officers arrested border bandits , disrupted smuggling operations and went where cops had n’t gone in years , say U.S. and Mexican sources who spoke on condition of anonymity , fearing retaliation .
Soriano was a go - to source for the U.S. Border Patrol and other agencies and was a regular at binational meetings , where he shared information with his U.S. counterparts .
“ He wanted to do things the right way , ” said one Mexican law enforcement source .
“ But that was a problem for many people . ”
Police brass reassigned Soriano to a desk job in 2005 .
“ They took away his wings .
They were n’t ready for where he was going , ” said one U.S. law enforcement source .
Late last year , Tecate ’s new mayor salvaged Soriano ’s career , asking him to take the No. 2 job at the department .
Law enforcement contacts across the border applauded the move and did n’t wait long to restore ties .
This time , though , the stakes were higher .
A well - concealed tunnel can generate tens of millions of dollars in drug profits for traffickers , who pay huge amounts of protection money to keep them open and threaten anyone who talks about their location .
It was crucial to quickly find the opening of the tunnel discovered that December morning .
U.S. authorities did n’t want the operators to have time to clear out the drugs and other evidence .
In other tunnel cases , Mexican authorities had been slow to respond , allowing crime bosses to abscond with drugs .
Soriano took immediate action .
After confiscating the cops ’ cellphones , he dispatched them to the four - lane border crossing and told them to look out for a fugitive trying to flee from California authorities .
Then he and several trusted officers started searching for the tunnel in homes and businesses near the border .
He kept a close watch on crooked cops , who he feared would slip away to warn the tunnel operators .
The search failed .
Someone would have to traverse the length of the passageway to find the opening .
Soriano volunteered seven officers .
They crossed into the U.S. and descended into the tunnel while U.S. and Mexican authorities waited for them to surface in Mexico .
About 45 minutes later , the Mexican team climbed up the 80 - foot - deep shaft into a vacant two - story building a block south of the border .
A Virgin of Guadalupe picture hung near the opening .
Nearby were computer monitors and scribbled ledgers .
Soriano , alerted by a radio call from his team , arrived at the building just ahead of the crush of reporters and other police .
Mexican federal agents took over the crime scene .
At about 2 a .m. the next morning , a convoy of vehicles drove down the deeply rutted dirt road leading to Soriano ’s modest house , which was decorated with a string of Christmas lights .
Two men armed with AK - 47s broke in .
Soriano jumped out of bed , but the men stopped him before he could grab his weapons in the hallway .
Soriano seemed to recognize his attackers and begged them not to shoot , a source said .
But the men opened fire , the spray of bullets coming within inches of Soriano ’s year - old daughter sleeping in the crib by his bed .
Since Soriano ’s death , relations between the Tecate Police Department and U.S. agencies have been almost nonexistent .
The force does n’t have a liaison officer , and the border lands are more lawless than ever , Mexican sources say .
Soriano ’s slaying sent a message to other cops who would dare cooperate with U.S. authorities .
That was clear at Soriano ’s funeral , where many cops seemed to be celebrating his death , said one person who attended .
Some laughed , while others chatted loudly in gestures of disrespect .
Mexican authorities suspect police were involved in the slaying , either as the triggermen or the lookouts for hit men .
Nobody has been arrested in the case .
Meanwhile , the tunnel investigation has stalled .
There have been no arrests , and it is unknown who was behind the construction and financing of the passageway .
On the day of the tunnel discovery , Soriano turned over a largely intact crime scene .
But soon , dozens of soldiers , police , federal agents and reporters gathered to marvel at the sophisticated lighting and water pumping system .
Other unidentified people seemed to linger for no apparent reason , said U.S. and Mexican sources .
The computers and other evidence had vanished .
Soriano once wrote on an employment evaluation that he wanted to be a police commander and lead a team of loyal , aggressive cops whom he would treat as friends .
“ I want to be surrounded by honest police who would never betray anyone . ”

Outcome of Election Unchanged , According to Officials , Despite Thousands of ' Phantom ' Write - in Votes ...

Guest Blogged by John Gideon of VotersUnite.org
From Washington Post ...
D.C. election officials blamed a defective computer memory cartridge yesterday for producing what appeared to be thousands of write - in votes that officials say did not exist .
The glitch caused initially inaccurate results in several contests , including two high - profile council races , and created a chaotic scene at Board of Elections and Ethics headquarters Tuesday night .
Even with an extremely low turnout , there was no clarity well after midnight , when 50 people , among them candidates and their attorneys , crowded into the election board lobby and demanded answers from officials .
These are voting machines made by Sequoia Voting Systems , whose systems have failed in many recent elections .
Their Edge touch - screen system , with its Verivote paper - trail printer , was featured in a video released this week by the UC Santa Barbra Computer Security Group .
The video from the scientists at UCSB offers step - by - step instructions on how a single person can hack such a voting system , in about two - seconds , resulting in a county - wide flipped election that even a full post-election hand count of the systems paper trails would not reveal .
It has been pointed out on one of my mailing lists that this same issue may have taken place in Alameda Co , CA , in Feb. 2008 .
UPDATE : As expected Sequoia Voting Systems has now made a statement that their investigation shows that the problem was user error or --- in a fresh new excuse for the company --- possibly even " static discharge " .
The Washington Post reports :
" There 's absolutely nothing wrong with the database , " said Michelle Shafer , spokeswoman for California - based Sequoia Voting Systems .
" There 's absolutely no problem with the machines in the polling places .
No. No . "
Instead , the company pointed to possible static discharge or other scenarios , including the possibility of human error .
The conclusion was based on Sequoia 's examination of the District 's election database , according to a company statement yesterday , and the company essentially rejected D.C. election officials ' assertion that " one defective cartridge " was at fault .
The glitch led to a chaotic scene Tuesday night as 50 people , including several candidates and their lawyers , showed up demanding answers about the voting tallies .
One thing that Sequoia can be counted on doing is always putting the blame on the voters or the poll workers / election officials .
" Static discharge " is something new that we can probably expect to hear more of in the future .
There are many reasons to give up cocaine : the price , the health risks , the illegality .
But for Dame Helen Mirren the decision to turn her back on the drug was more specific : Klaus Barbie .
Mirren , who won an Oscar last year for her portrayal of the Queen , says she took the decision after discovering the Nazi war criminal had been making money from selling cocaine while he was in hiding in South America in the early 1980s .
" I loved coke .
I never did a lot , just a little bit at parties , " said Mirren .
" But what ended it for me was when they caught Klaus Barbie , the Butcher of Lyon , in the early 80s .
He was hiding in South America and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron .
And I read that in the paper , and all the cards fell into place and I saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this fucking horrible man in South America . "
Mirren says that from then on she never took cocaine again .
" Until that moment I had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in Britain . "
In the interview with GQ magazine , Mirren , who starred in Prime Suspect as DCI Jane Tennison , says she has been held back by her looks .
" I 've always had big tits and blonde hair .
That 's an ... can be a terrible disadvantage , " she said .
" Because you 're not allowed to be intelligent if you 're a woman with big tits and blonde hair .
And if you are , it offends people .
Intelligence does not fit into that package , and you are patronised , condescended and insulted .
Professionally . "
Obama : McCain based entire foreign policy on Iraq surge
NBC's Tom Brokaw talked to Barack Obama about the surge of troops in Iraq .
Obama agreed that the increased troop levels had made a difference in violence in Iraq .
Obama stressed that it was important to look at a bigger picture when considering foreign policy .
Obama said , " If we want to look at the question of judgment , which is the one that John McCain makes , John McCain essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops .
He 's made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of Bush 's decision to send more troops in .
But we can have a whole range of arguments about bad decisions -- the decision to go into Iraq in the first place and whether that was a good strategic decision . "

One of the secrets of Arsenal 's impressive start to the season can be revealed today with the confidential details of a motivational briefing delivered to the players by a sports psychologist drafted in by the manager Arsène Wenger .
The astonishing fact about the briefing – contained on an A4 sheet of paper and given to the squad at a team meeting on the eve of their Premier League match away to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday – is its simplicity .
The document runs to just 224 words and nine times in the opening two paragraphs the word " team " is used while there is also an emphasis on being " strong " , having " belief " and " keep going until the end " .
It is clear that Wenger was concerned that his young team , who played away from home three times last week , having also faced Blackburn Rovers and Dynamo Kiev , needed some outside help to bond and stick together during that testing schedule .
It may also be that because of the taxing travelling arrangements , including the tiring flights to and from Ukraine , Wenger felt it necessary for the players to be encouraged by someone else rather than just him .

History also points to Arsenal 's recurring unease on their trips to the North - west .
The four points they dropped at Blackburn and Wigan Athletic last season would have raised them into second place above Chelsea .
Indeed , Arsenal lost just three league games last season , all away from home .
" Sometimes when we go away we just do n't start well , " said the defender Kolo Touré after the victory at Bolton .
" We have been working on it . "
Clearly , part of that work is using a psychologist .
The messages he delivered were clear and simple and are , according to Arsenal players , in keeping with Wenger 's own team talks , which are usually not particularly detailed and cover areas such as playing positively , rather than specific tasks given to each player .
Similarly , the psychologist 's briefing calls for the team to work together and uses such words as " driving force " and " dynamic " .
It also makes observations on how the players should behave off as well as on the pitch calling for a " positive attitude " and a demand to " stay humble and grounded as a player and a person " which , again , reflects their youth .
Nothing , it adds , should be taken " for granted " .
The message reinforces the principles Wenger has drilled into his team .
The passage that will mean most to him and to Arsenal supporters is when there is a call for the players to " play the football we love to play at home " even when they are visiting grounds such as the Reebok stadium , which has not be an easy fixture for Arsenal in recent years – they have lost four times before winning there last season .
For Wenger that is central to his football philosophy .
Arsenal won 3 - 1 on Saturday , of course , and the result propelled them to the top of the Premier League , a point ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool , having scored seven goals in the last two away league fixtures and resisting Bolton 's physical approach .
Little wonder another message in the briefing is the need to " stick together " .
That the briefing is so simple may surprise some but , given the various nationalities in the Arsenal squad and given the youth of the team , then it is no real surprise .
Nevertheless , Wenger has been sceptical about using psychologists in the past , with the club 's former vice - chairman David Dein once remarking that Arsenal did not need such advice because they had a manager who could fulfil the function himself .
However , prior to the second leg of the Champions League last - 16 tie against Real Madrid in 2006 , Wenger used a psychologist and , although the club have not employed one on a full - time basis , it is understood to use various consultants on a freelance basis which the manager clearly feels is necessary at this time when a strong start to the season will breed confidence and banish the doubts over the strength of his squad .
Using a psychologist may also reveal Wenger 's concerns that , although he may have the most technically gifted squad in the league , he is relying heavily on young players who fell away last season when it appeared that , improbably , the club could win a first league title in five years .
Yesterday Wenger said he felt that each of the so - called " big four " – Arsenal , Manchester United , Chelsea and Liverpool – had now " found their rhythm " .
" It 'll be an interesting battle , " he said of the league title race , while confirming that the injury to Gaël Clichy suffered against Bolton amounted to nothing more than a bruised shin .
The left - back should be fit for Saturday 's fixture against Hull .
In any case , Clichy would not have featured in tonight 's Carling Cup tie at home to Sheffield United with Wenger – who said that at Arsenal " you can say that 20 - to 21 - year - olds are the experienced players " – set to field one of the youngest sides in the club 's history .
Aaron Ramsey , Jack Wilshere , the reserve team captain Gavin Hoyte , Kieran Gibbs and first - year scholar Emmanuel Frimpong are in the squad .
CONFIDENTIAL
Team meeting 19th September 2008-09 - 22 :
The team :
* A team is as strong as the relationships within it .
The driving force of a team is its member 's ability to create and maintain excellent relationships within the team that can add an extra dimension and robustness to the team dynamic .
* This attitude can be used by our team to focus on the gratitude and the vitally important benefits that the team brings to our own lives .
It can be used to strengthen and deepen the relationships with it and maximise the opportunities that await a strong and united team .
Our team becomes stronger by :
* Displaying a positive attitude on and off the pitch
* Everyone making the right decisions for the team
* Have an unshakeable belief that we can achieve our target
* Believe in the strength of the team
* Always want more - always give more
* Focus on our communication
* Be demanding with yourself
* Be fresh and well prepared to win
* Focus on being mentally stronger and always keep going until the end
* When we play away from home , believe in our identity and play the football we love to play at home
* Stick together
* Stay grounded and humble as a player and a person
* Show the desire to win in all that you do
* Enjoy and contribute to all that is special about being in a team - do n't take it for granted
Mind over matter :
Who 's who among sports psychologists
Bill Beswick
The first sports psychologist to work fully in professional football .
He has worked with Steve McClaren at Middlesbrough and Manchester United and had a spell at Derby County .
Beswick has also spent time with the England Under - 18 and Under - 21 sides .
Former England cricketer Marcus Trescothick is currently working with Beswick to help maintain his career following his struggles with depression .
Eileen Drewery
Faith Healer employed by Glenn Hoddle during his time as England manager in the 1990s .
Techniques ridiculed by some players but not all were against her .
" I felt for her during all the fuss with the England players , " midfielder Dennis Wise said in his autobiography .
" The way she was made to look like some crank is n't fair .
I thought she was really nice , she reminded me of my mum . "
Work came under scrutiny following Hoddle 's comments about reincarnation , which led to his dismissal as national coach in 1999 .
Steve Bull
Employed by the English Cricket Board in 2002 , has worked to create an environment to improve mental toughness .
Ashley Giles claimed Bull helped him overcome a lack of self - belief .
Bull was flown to Cape Town in 2003 for England 's opening World Cup match with Zimbabwe to spend almost three hours with the team and help them with their mental preparations .
Was also present for England 's Ashes victory in 2005 .
Ross Hall
University of Glamorgan tutor helped with the British Paralympic rugby team .
" It 's my job to ensure they are able to cope with any distractions that might occur in training or games , " he said .
Britain won silver .
Steve Peters
Worked with Olympic gold medal cyclist Victoria Pendleton .
" I can honestly say I do n't think I 'd be here if it was n't for Steve , " she said .
And also ...
Clive Woodward 's man-management famously led England 's rugby union team to World Cup glory in 2003 .
He received a knighthood and is now director of elite performance at the British Olympic Association .
The best league in the world is back .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif .  Sergey Brin , a Google co-founder , said Thursday that he has a gene mutation that increases his likelihood of contracting Parkinson ’s disease , a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that can impair speech , movement and other functions .
Mr. Brin , who made the announcement on a blog , says he does not have the disease and that the exact implications of the discovery are not clear .
Studies show that his likelihood of contracting Parkinson ’s disease in his lifetime may be 20 percent to 80 percent , Mr. Brin said .
Mr. Brin , whose personal fortune was recently pegged at $ 15.9 billion by Forbes , ranking him as the 13th richest American , said that he may help provide more money for research into the disease .
Through a Google spokesman , Mr. Brin declined to be interviewed for this article .
Mr. Brin said he learned that he carries a mutation of the LRRK2 gene , known as G2019S .
His mother , Eugenia Brin , also carries the gene mutation and has Parkinson’s .
Some of the worst JavaScript code I have seen has to do with sorting data .
JavaScript has a flexible array sort method , but it takes a while to get the hang of using it .
Programmers seem to do fine sorting a simple array , but if the data format is something just a bit less trivial , many JavaScript programmers throw their hands up in the air .
You can almost see the frustration in the code ( sometimes in the comments ) .
One common situation that many people seem stumped by is sorting an array of objects based on a given key .
Suppose we have this array of objects :
arr [ 0 ] ={r:100,g:100, b:250} ; arr [ 1 ] ={r:50,g:127,b:255} ; arr [ 2 ] ={r:255,g:255,b:100} ;
Now suppose you want to sort the array by any of r , g , or b , and that you want to support both ascending and descending sorts .
How would you approach the problem ?
Back To Basics
Remember that to sort an array , you just invoke the “ sort ” method that belongs to JavaScript ’s array type .
arr.sort ( ) ;
That works for sorting an array of strings , but it does n’t work for sorting an array of numbers .
That ’s why even the novice JavaScript programmer recognizes the code for sorting numeric values .
function sortNumber ( a , b ) { return a - b ; } arr.sort ( sortNumber ) ;
JavaScript lets us pass in a function that is used to judge whether a value is less than , equal , or greater than another value .
Having that hook into the guts of the sort method lets us solve just about any sorting problem .
But how ?
Here ’s a solution for the {r , g , b} problem above , where I want to be able to sort on r , g , or b in either ascending or descending mode .
function sortByKey ( arr , key , direction ) { function sortNumeric ( a , b ) { if ( direction= = " ASC " ) { return a [ key ] - b[ key ] ; } else { return b[key ] - a[ key ] ; } } return arr.sort ( sortNumeric ) ; }
The outer function is a handy way to keep the key ( what we ’re sorting on ) and direction ( which way we ’re sorting ) around , since there is no simple way to pass that information into the sort method .
Remember that the inner function has access to the outer function ’s variables , and that includes the parameters that come in .
Oh , by the way , the code is easier to understand if you recall that obj.r is the same as obj [ “ r ” ] .
We can pass in a string to a function and use that string as a key to get a value .
That way we get around the need to write a separate evaluation function for each key .
Call the function like this :
sortByKey( arr , " r " , " DESC " ) ;
to sort the objects in descending r order , or
sortByKey( arr , " g " , " ASC " ) ;
to sort the objects in ascending g order .
Real Life Intrudes
Sometimes the data is not nice .
You may have blank ( empty or missing ) spots in your data .
In Excel , whether you sort ascending or descending , cells that are empty always show up at the end of the list .
I recently needed to match that functionality in an Adobe AIR utility program I was writing .
Here ’s the code ( blank cells from Excel ended up as empty strings in my data ) .
function sortByKey ( arr , key , direction ) { function sortNumeric ( a , b ) { var c=a[key ] , d=b[key ] ; if ( direction= = " ASC " ) { return ( c=== " " ) - ( d=== " " ) || c-d ; } else { return ( c=== " " ) - ( d=== " " ) || d- c ; } } return arr.sort ( sortNumeric ) ; }
A bit longer , codewise .
But exactly what I needed for my data .
Once you get the hang of using inner functions , JavaScript ’s sort method makes much more sense .
It ’s easy to extend this idea to accomodate other kinds of data ( like strings ) , or to support secondary sorts , where a second key can be used to break ties .

Russia Refuses To Meet With U.S. on Iranian Nuclear Program .
Not a good sign considering their erecent military deployments .
From The New York Times
Russia said on Tuesday that it would not participate in a meeting with the United States this week to discuss Iran ’s nuclear program , the most significant indication yet of how Russia ’s war with Georgia has spoiled relations regarding other security issues .
Russia ’s move apparently effectively scuttled the meeting .
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a biting statement that criticized remarks last week by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who declared that Russia had taken “ a dark turn ” away from democracy and respect for international norms .
“ We would very much like Washington , in the end , to make up its mind what kind of relations they want with Moscow , ” a ministry spokesman , Andrei Nesterenko , said in the statement .
“ If they want to punish Russia , that is one thing , ” he said .
“ If they agree that we have common interests that need to be jointly advanced , then that ’s another . ”
Sean McCormack , the State Department spokesman , said in a press briefing on Tuesday that the decision to cancel the meeting was mutual and not a game of tit for tat with the Russians .
“ We agree with them the time is not right to have a meeting at the ministerial level , ” he said .

The former operator of a popular online poker site faces a $ 75 m claim after internet sleuths presented evidence that for more than three years it offered rigged games that allowed cheaters to win hands at astronomically unlikely odds .
According to a special report published last week on msnbc.com , scammers were able to manipulate the software running UltimateBet.com , one of the top 10 online poker sites .
The unauthorized software code allowed certain players to see the hole cards of their opponents , according to the report , which cited a report from Tokwiro Enterprises , a company that claims ownership of UltimateBet .
The scam was unearthed by some of the players who got burned .
They noticed that certain players in the highest - stakes games were winning at a rate that seemed to defy statistical odds .
Two of the players , who went by the handles " trambopoline " and " dlpnyc21 , " eventually closed in on a particular account as a prime suspect .
Using the screen name " NioNio , " the player netted $ 300,000 in profit in just 3,000 hands .
They later discovered that NioNio had won 13 of the 14 sessions recorded on MyPokerIntel.com , a website that tracks high - stakes online tournaments .
Australian poker player Michael Josem compared the results to 870 other accounts with 2,500 or more hands recorded and calculated that NioNio 's win rate was less likely than winning a one - in - a - million lottery four days in a row .
The tale is reminiscent of allegations leveled last year against AbsolutePoker.com , UltimateBet 's sister site .
In both cases , the suspicions of fraud only came to light after players smelled a rat .
Forums like this one from the Two Plus Two poker website show the players unraveling the scheme .
Tokwiro Enterprises blamed the alleged cheating on individuals who worked for the previous owners of UltimateBet , who sold the business in 2006 .
If true , that would mean the unauthorized code was running Tokwiro 's system for two years before it was finally dismantled in January of this year .
The site has been known for its glitzy television commercials and advertisements that trumpet the security of its software .
The $ 75 m claim was filed by Blast - Off Ltd. of Malta , a private company that currently has an ownership interest in Ultimate Bet .
A representative with the liquidator for UltimateBet says the claim is being taken seriously .
Many more details from msnbc.com are available here . ®

KBC : Recently , my sister had a child .
A few months before hand , she had a baby shower .
I was invited , because my sister likes getting presents .
I got them Hungry Hungry Hippos .
The reason for this ?
My brother - in - law , when young , was a terror , and his mother was an actual single mother .
The father left the day of conception .
KBC : One day , his mother got fed up with my brother - in - laws antics , she said ' That 's it , grab one toy , you 're going to the orphanage ! '
So he grabs HHH , they walk around a mall a bit , he 's clutching that thing to him saying ' I * sob * Do n't * Sob * wanna * sob * go to the orphan * sob * age ! '
KBC : And then they go home .
But this story is n't about my brother - in - law , or his mother , or even my nephew , really .
It 's about the baby shower , when I went out to buy their gift - Hungry Hungry Hippos .
KBC : I go to Walmart , because it 's the only thing open at the time I went out .
I go to the toy section , look at the Lego , crappy excuse for action figures , then grab the game .
After that , I start heading for the cash registers .
KBC :
On the way towards the cashes , I pass the pharmacy and realize , ' Hey , I need condoms . '
Because , well , condoms expire after four years .
So , I grab a box of condoms , Tiny Trojans ( they invaded in a pony , not a horse ) and head to the cashes with my HHH in tow .
KBC : While waiting at the cash , I see their impulse buys .
Impulse buy at this cash was gummy bears .
This reminded me about a story I heard that eating too many gummy bears can turn your pee black .
So I picked up some .
For science .
( Post - script : It did n't )
KBC : I 'm waiting for the cashier , and there 's two people in front of me .
The cashier is this old , 80 or older blue haired bat who likes talking .
She rung the items up for the people in front of me and talked to them for a few minutes , despite their wanting to pay and leave .
And then I get served .
KBC : She looks at me and smiles , then looks at my items .
Then looks at me .
And looks at my items .
And then just glares at me .
I 'm standing right in front of her , after a long 12 hour shift , in a trenchcoat , not having shaved for a week .
That 's when it hits me , I just won the condom game , where you grab three items , one being condoms , and see if you can get a reaction .
You know , coathanger , garbage bags , condoms .
Something like that .
KBC :
By the way she 's looking at me , she must think I 'm a child molester .
So I say to her .
' Oh , uh , I 'm new in town ... do you know where I can get a white , panelled van ? '
And her jaw drops .
She scans the items , as she had n't yet , as fast as fast can be , I give her the money and she pretty much throws it back at me .
KBC : I thank her for her service , and start to leave the store .
Before I leave , I look back , and I see her , on the phone , looks like she 's yelling , using her hand beside her to try and judge height next to her , probably giving my description to someone .
And that 's why I 'm not allowed at the east end Wal - mart again .
END .

prozac : khmer , there was a huge cutural misunderstanding
prozac : japanese arent puritianical like western society .
khmer : like , we were afraid we 'd end up in the bedroom , we 're like , yes , score , inside - the - park , and she would , i dunno , pull out hungry hungry hippos as we were getting our pants offf
Coldcell : hahaa
khmer : so , yes , considering among other things the cultural gaps you two are pointing out , we made sure not to flirt with anyone heavily
Coldcell : 'oh , I totally play HH in the nude , do n't you know Americans ? '
khmer : but we definitely get real full of ourselves
khmer : we end up sitting inside in front of like 12 japanese kids , doing stupid elementary school tricks
khmer : like , jeff played the william tell overture with his mouth , i opened a beer can with a lighter
khmer : THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE EVERY TIME
khmer : we recited the who's on first routine

khmer : beer bottle , that is
khmer : excuse me
khmer : you know , absence of verbal humor , we 're like ...
khmer : getting peals of laughter from making shapes with our tongues

khmer : so i get a quarter out of my pocket and i grab miyuki , who is heartbreakingly gorgeous
prozac : I 'm wondering about how you did n't get laid after all this ....
khmer : i press the quarter to my forehead , it sticks there , i hit myself in the back of the head twice , it falls off
khmer : she understands
khmer : so , i press it to her forehead , and , you guys know the trick , right ?
i remove it as i pull my hand away
khmer : enthusiastically , she begins hitting herself in the back of the head
khmer : one time ... two times ... three ... harder ... harder ... HARDER
khmer : TWELVE TIMES
khmer : she 's getting FURIOUS
khmer : another party guest comes into the room
khmer : she yells something at him in japanese , glares
khmer : he 's like ...uh ... are you ... are you sure ?
khmer : it 's gonna hurt real bad
khmer : she nods frantically
Ephphatha : you 're mean
khmer : Ephphatha i was BEGGING her to feel her forehead with her hand
khmer : after like the sixth smack
khmer : she would n't LISTEN
khmer : i was FLIPPING THE QUARTER IN MY HAND
khmer : LOOK MIYUKI IT'S THE QUARTER
khmer : MIYUKI STOP THIS
khmer : so she demands that this dude hit her
khmer : and he does
khmer : so hard she FALLS OVER
Ephphatha : hahaha
khmer : gets up , and looks mortified
khmer : she heard no quarter drop
khmer : so i grab her and put her hand on her forehead
khmer : realization breaks out over her face
khmer : her eyes widen , and then
khmer : she JAMS ME INTO A CORNER AND BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF ME
khmer : i'm cowering for my LIFE
khmer : she 's screaming and hitting me with closed fists , REALLY HARD
Ephphatha : I 'm nearly pissing myself laughing at this
khmer : so , i notice after a few seconds of this
khmer : the blows are falling softer and less often
khmer : she 's ... she 's laughing !
ha !
all is forgiven !
khmer : the room begins to chuckle , the trance recedes
khmer : then she stops DEAD SILENT
khmer : spins around and GLARES at the guy who hit her really hard
khmer : and BEATS THE FUCK OUT OF HIM
khmer : KICKS , PUNCHES
khmer : he 's MOANING FOR MERCY
khmer : her friends have to restrain her
khmer : and then suddenly she BURSTS OUT LAUGHING and laughs for like THREE MINUTES
shoofle : that 's a great story
khmer : and then she turns to me and says ' you like jazz ? '
creature : Congratulations !
You pulled a crazy girl .
khmer : ... the end
prozac : khmer , she 'd do wild things to you in the bedroom .
Ephphatha : ok , if I EVER go to a party with you , you 're not allowed to have any coins
prozac : Ephphatha , you should give him several
khmer : prozac : i thought about trying to bag her , but ... i had a magic : the gathering tournament in the morning

So today in the school 's parking lot , this big truck was triple parked .
So , not being mean enough to actually scratch his truck , I wrote a note that said " Sorry about the scratch " and left it under his wiper .
As I was pulling out , he got to his car , looked at the note , and spent like 10 minutes looking for a scratch .
