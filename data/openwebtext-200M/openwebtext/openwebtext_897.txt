Russia 's economy is expected to shrink by six per cent this year .
It is a dramatic turnaround from just a few months ago when it was predicted to grow by five per cent .
Unemployment is rising by more than half a million a month .
The result can already be seen on the streets of Moscow 's soup kitchens .
Rupert Wingfield reports .
When Barack Obama made headlines by eating a hamburger this week , we were disappointed that he ruined his by ordering it medium - well .
Sean Hannity , though , found something far worse .
Click to view
Obama did n't want good - old - fashioned American ketchup .
No , Mr. " Common Man " over here wanted his hamburger with " spicy mustard " — or , horror of horrors , " dijon . "
Dijon !
Real Americans do n't like things that actually make things taste like things , Princess OBambi !
Then Sean Hannity plays the old " Grey Poupon " commercial , as if having seen that commercial 20 years ago is the only reason an adult man who lives in Chicago ( where ketchup is not considered an acceptable condiment for a hot dog , btw , Mr. Hannity ) would want " spicy mustard . "
Then he literally says this : " I hope you enjoyed that fancy burger , Mr. President . "
If Barack Obama had actually said " Grey Poupon " instead of just asking for any mustard with a bit of kick to it we would admit that that would be kind of tone - deaf and funny , but no .
The man just wanted some spicy mustard for his goddamn burnt hamburger , Sean .
AT LONG LAST , SIR , HAVE YOU NO DECENCY ?
Actually , at this point , does n't Hannity 's grasping populism just seem kinda quaint ?
He 's doing his best to fear - monger and rabble - rouse , but this is just pathetic .
Hell , on the same network you 've got Glenn Beck weeping about how the Illuminati controls the Federal Reserve or whatever the fuck he 's on about these days .
Anyway after this commercial happened , in like 1993 or something , it is no longer appropriate to consider " dijon " a high - faluntin ' condiment .

In stitches inflatable rental software ?
During my most recent voyage toward Denver I stumbled over Leroy while on this lane .
He told me , he was free to buy an original Software program here this Notebook Store close to the area .
Ok , what a coincidence , I was just now in this area to proceed in the direction of this identical shop , but intended for a diverse cause .
We decided that we depart together , therefore we both may present suggestion to one another .
Nowadays I once in a blue moon buy Software in a shop .
I have a preference getting in our Internet since more or less at all times there appears to be the benefit to look into a presentation or even take a crack at it over a limited while or and limited features .
I cannot perform that inside the superstore !
My acquaintance opposed this , telling me he knows precisely what he desires .
He experienced previously on his associates device as a consequence it is the greatest he really ever encountered up till now !
Here in USA nevertheless it is safe to buy [ url=http://www.accuevent.com]inflatable rental software [ /url ] in the Web .
It comes with the complete assistance you require .
For sure it appears to be awsome , when you offer individuals enjoyment and this so much wanted relaxation , when you run a firm that certainly is interconnected to Parties , Events and Celebration , but even this sort of earning funds nevertheless needs to get money ( smirk at this time ) .
So keep it together and remain positive you have a decent program to deal with every one of your ventures and keeps you updated !
In my opinion , Millard Campos it is the most vital piece of gear you does have !
Until the end of time experience , what has been unsurpassed !!

By all authoritative accounts , Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) did not interfere in the investigation of two former pro-Israel lobbyists who were suspected of unlawfully receiving and transmitting classified information .
She did not seek to win favorable treatment for them from the Justice Department .
They did not receive any such treatment .
And she did not become chair of the House Intelligence Committee .
Nevertheless , she stands accused of saying that she would get involved in the case of the pro-Israel lobbyists in exchange for outside efforts to promote her candidacy to be chair of the House Intelligence Committee .
In a widely cited story in CQ Homeland Security , Jeff Stein reported that several former government officials had told him that Rep. Harman had been captured on a National Security Agency wiretap speaking with an unidentified “ suspected Israeli agent ” agreeing to “ waddle into ” the controversial case of the two former AIPAC officials , who were charged under the Espionage Act with mishandling classified information , and to try to get the charges against them reduced .
“ In exchange for Harman ’s help , ” Stein wrote , the suspected Israeli agent pledged to help lobby for Harman ’s appointment as intelligence committee chair .
Rep. Harman denied any misconduct .
“ These claims are an outrageous and recycled canard , and have no basis in fact , ” Harman said in a statement to CQ .
“ I never engaged in any such activity .
Those who are peddling these false accusations should be ashamed of themselves . ”
In a follow - up story by Neil A. Lewis and Mark Mazzetti , the New York Times confirmed the existence of an NSA recording , but also added several important points .
David Szady , the former FBI counterintelligence official who zealously led the investigation of the two AIPAC suspects told the Times that Rep. Harman never interfered in his pursuit .
“ In all my dealings with her , she was always professional and never tried to intervene or get in the way of any investigation , ” Mr. Szady said .
( The trial of the AIPAC defendants , Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman , who are charged with multiple counts of violating the Espionage Act , is scheduled to begin on June 2 . )
The Times did not independently confirm the CQ claim that former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had quashed an investigation into Rep.
Harman ’s statements purportedly because he wanted her support of the Bush Administration ’s warrantless surveillance program .
[ Update , 4/24/09 :
In a follow - up story published April 23 , the Times did independently confirm that Gonzales intervened in the case . ]
The Times reported that an official familiar with the NSA transcript said that Rep. Harman “ appeared to agree ” to intervene in the AIPAC case in exchange for support of her chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee .
But by introducing some equivocation about her “ apparent ” agreement , the Times implied that the transcript is susceptible to other interpretations .
It also highlighted the least credible aspect of the story — the alleged quid pro quo between Harman and the “ suspected Israeli agent . ”
What makes the quid pro quo allegation questionable is that neither side of the reported conversation seemed to need an inducement to act as described .
Of all potential candidates for chair of the House Intelligence Committee ( Harman , Hastings , Reyes ) , Harman ’s views have probably been closest to those of pro-Israel lobbyists .
Their support of her was not in doubt .
Nor did Rep. Harman require extraordinary incentives to be concerned about the prosecution of the former AIPAC officials .
That case has drawn widespread criticism ( including from Secrecy News ) for its over - broad reading of the Espionage Act that would make even the receipt of classified information a crime .
Ironically , the single identifiable crime in this whole story is the unauthorized disclosure of the classified contents of an intelligence intercept to CQ , and then to the New York Times .
While there is no categorical legal prohibition against all classified leaks , several specific categories of classified information are protected by statute and their release is a felony offense .
Under 18 U.S.C. 798 , one of those is the unauthorized disclosure of communications intelligence , like that gathered by NSA .
Jeff Stein provides a second - day review and update of the story here .
Update : In an April 21 letter to the Attorney General ( pdf ) , Rep . Harman demanded the release of “ all transcripts and other investigative material involving me in an unredacted form .
It is my intention to make this material available to the public . ”
“ Let me be absolutely clear : I never contacted the Department of Justice , the White House or anyone else to seek favorable treatment regarding national security cases on which I was briefed , or any other cases , ” she wrote .
Ron Paul , the Texas congressman and darling of Libertarians everywhere , has an idea on how the United States can deal with the Somali pirates plaguing international shipping in the Indian Ocean : hire and train some bounty hunters .
The idea , unlike some of Paul 's proposals , is actually gaining traction in Congress .
The U.S. Navy is too big for the mission , designed to do battle against the navies of other nations ,
So hiring and training bounty hunters to go after the pirates is , as Political Machine put it , " a classic case of fighting fire with fire . "
The mechanism would be a little - known power written into the Constitution called marque and reprisal .
Leave it to a strict constitutionalist like Paul to have read that far into the document .
Anyway , the provision was used often during the Revolution and the War of 1812 , and has n't been used since .
Basically , the law allows the United States to hire private citizens to keep international waters safe .
“ If we have 100 American wannabe Rambos patrolling the seas , it ’s probably a good way of getting the job done , ” said Competitive Enterprise Institute 's Eli Lehrer .
If Congress does start using the procedure , it might want to consider a few amendments .
Under current law , bounty hunters are allowed to keep the ship and any treasure they capture .
Here 's the congressman .

I want software development to be so predictable that it 's boring .
I want people to take release dates for granted .
I want them to yawn at completed deprecations .
I want all of the surprises in new versions of Perl and Parrot to be delight at improvements : code runs faster , new features make your projects simpler and more elegant , rough edges keep disappearing .
I want the development process to become repeated cycles of ideas , design , implementation , testing , refinement , and release .
I want this cycle to happen annually , if not quarterly .
I want steady , sustainable progress in small , achievable , repeatable , and verifiable steps .
I believe that 's the only way to save Perl and its ecosystem from slow decline and irrelevance .
That 's why I write here .
This is a manifesto .
My transparent intent is to identify obstacles and convince the rest of the Perl community to work around them ( or better yet , to remove them ) .
Some of those obstacles are the way we teach Perl .
Some of those obstacles are the way we write and distribute Perl .
Some of the most persistent and pernicious obstacles are the way we develop Perl itself :
No one can predict when ( or if ) Perl 5.12 will come out .
No one can predict which features it will have .
( You can predict that it will have at least some of the new code currently in bleadperl which will not go into Perl 5.10 , but can anyone tell me what those are ? )
No one can predict how many point releases there will be in the Perl 5.12 series ( nor the Perl 5.10 series , for that matter ) .
No one can predict how long people will support Perl 5.12 , or Perl 5.10 for that matter .
I 've written about the DarkPAN dependency management and support problem before .
It 's unrealistic to expect volunteers to maintain code they can't see , if that code even exists .
That 's unrealistic .
p5 p 's attempts to do so are unsustainable ; there 's no feedback .
There are only two motivations : the desire to write high quality software , and the desire to avoid guilt and shame .
( That 's false guilt , by the way . )
While thinking about a documented support policy for Perl 5 , I came across a comment from Adam Kennedy :
There are many possible descriptions of this expectation .
The most polite I can imagine is " unsustainable " .
The easiest argument against it is one of the most persuasive .
Ten years ago , the newest Perl release was 5.005_03 .
Lexical filehandles , three - arg open , and the warnings pragma did not exist .
Unicode was unreliable .
There have been fifteen stable releases of Perl in the intervening decade , even with the unpredictable release schedule .
Biannual releases would have produced twenty stable releases of Perl .
Quarterly releases -- my preference -- would have produced forty stable releases of Perl .
I wo n't speak for anyone else , but you could n't pay me enough to support forty versions of a piece of software released over a decade .
Good luck convincing a sizable fraction of the other 930 or so people listed in the Perl AUTHORS file to do the same .
The proper approach is to :
Document a sustainable support and development policy , then follow it .
Establish a regular release schedule .
Extract all essential DarkPAN features worth supporting into tests for the core test suite .
Replace the feature pragma with a pragma which explicitly limits the running instance to those features present in a specific release .
( After fixing feature ...)
Change the default behavior of Perl 5 to enable modern features .
...)
Change the default behavior of Perl 5 to enable modern features .
Encourages businesses which believe they really must use ancient versions of Perl long past their shelf lives to purchase support contracts from businesses willing to take on that burden .
Continuing to pile this support burden on volunteers who do not know if the DarkPAN exists , let alone suffers from changes in modern Perls , is a great way to ensure that Perl 5.12 will never come out .
Put more positively , my suggestions are ways to reduce the barriers to participation for people who have an investment in the present and future of Perl 5 .
That 's the only way to make Perl and its ecosystem sustainable : to divide the work among everyone who wants or needs it to succeed .
PRINCETON , NJ -- President Obama begins the second 100 days of his presidency with 56 % of Americans believing he has done an excellent or good job thus far , and only 20 % saying he has done a poor or terrible job .
According to the new USA Today / Gallup poll , conducted April 20 - 21 , about a quarter of Americans are on the fence , saying his performance has been " just okay . "
Those who rate Obama positively have slightly tempered views of him , with more saying his performance has been " good " rather than " excellent , " 33 % vs. 23 % , respectively .
However , those who are critical of Obama are as likely to use the harshest term -- " terrible " -- as they are to say his performance has been merely " poor , " 11 % vs. 9 % .
Democrats are highly laudatory of Obama , with 88 % rating him excellent or good .
Republicans offer more measured criticism -- only 40 % say he has done a poor or terrible job , while 35 % say he has done " just okay . "
These summary evaluations of Obama 's presidency provide a more detailed picture of public reaction to the new president than Gallup 's standard job approval rating .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking from April 20 - 22 finds 65 % of Americans saying they " approve " of the job Obama is doing as president ; 29 % disapprove .
Thus , on both measures , Americans ' general assessment is quite positive , by a better than 2 - to - 1 margin .
The new poll also finds that Americans generally got what they expected in the Obama presidency .
More than 6 in 10 -- 62 % -- say Obama has thus far done about as they expected as president , overall .
Among the rest , more indicate he has exceeded their expectations than fallen short , 24 % vs. 13 % .
This evaluation of Obama is more favorable than a similar reading on former President Bill Clinton after his first 100 days in office , in April 1993 .
While a larger majority in that poll said Clinton had done about as they expected as president than say this for Obama , only 12 % said he had done a better job ( compared with Obama 's 24 % ) .
The majority of all three major partisan groups say Obama has done about as they expected as president .
A third of Democrats , however , say he has done a better job , with very few ( only 7 % ) saying he has done worse .
Republicans are almost evenly divided as to whether he has done a better job ( 19 % ) or a worse job ( 17 % ) .
Economy and U.S. World Image Repair Lead Obama's Achievement List
Americans in the new poll were also asked to say , in open - ended format , what they think is the best thing Obama has done as president .
A summary of these responses is provided in the accompanying table , and detailed responses are shown at the end of this report .
About one in three Americans ( including roughly half of Republicans ) cannot name anything they think Obama has done well ; but among those who can , aspects of Obama 's economic policies lead the list , mentioned by 27 % .
About half of these respondents identify Obama 's work on the economic stimulus package or bailout plans as the best thing he has done .
The other half mention a different economic issue , such as " improving the economy , " " creating jobs , " or making changes to tax policy .
Foreign policy and relations with leaders of other countries ranks a close second , mentioned by 21 % .
This includes 14 % of Americans who specifically say Obama has improved the United States ' image abroad or its relations with other countries .
It also includes smaller individual percentages citing the president 's efforts to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq , his success in dealing with the Somali pirates , his closing of Guantanamo Bay prison , and his steps to improve relations with Cuba .
Smaller percentages cite aspects of Obama 's leadership style or his efforts to reform the way government works as his top achievement to date .
An additional 8 % name something else .
Critics Cite Spending First , Foreign Affairs Second
The worst thing Obama has done as president , according to the American public , is spend too much taxpayer money on bailouts , the budget , and the economic stimulus package .
A combined 28 % of Americans name one of these issues , including 14 % specifically mentioning bailouts , the largest single response for this question .
( Thirty - nine percent of Americans cannot name anything in response to the question asking about the worst thing Obama has done . )
The second - most - often - mentioned family of responses involves Obama 's approach to dealing with America 's national security .
A combined 11 % of Americans name either his relations with U.S. enemies , his closing of the Guantanamo Bay prison , or the release of classified information .
( See table at end for detailed responses . )
Bottom Line
Two new USA Today / Gallup measures of how Americans perceive President Obama confirm what his job approval ratings have been showing -- that he is well regarded and somewhat better reviewed at this early stage than the last Democrat to hold the office of president , Bill Clinton .
Given five options for rating the kind of job Obama has done thus far , 56 % say he has done an excellent or good job , and 79 % say his performance has been at least " okay . "
Just 20 % call it poor or terrible .
The issues Obama gets the most credit and criticism on are the same : federal spending on the economic stimulus and bailout package , and his approach to dealing with national security threats , including leaders of unfriendly countries and the Guantanamo Bay prison .
In the eyes of Americans , Obama 's top achievement to date involves the U.S. economy -- whether the economic stimulus plan and industry bailouts , specifically , or improvement to the economy , generally .
Restoring the United States ' image abroad ranks a close second .
Although relatively few Americans give Obama a negative job evaluation , the issue he gets the most criticism on is government spending , with the economic stimulus plan , auto and financial industry bailouts , and the federal budget all contributing to the view that he is being too profligate .
The perception that Obama is too loose in his handling of national security issues ( including foreign enemies and Guantanamo Bay ) ranks second .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,051 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted April 20 - 21 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
By Don Fitz and Tim Kaminski
In the days when there was an Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers union ( OCAW ) , its St Louis business agent , Bob Tibbs senior , enjoyed coming to Green Party events .
He would tell us that his union knew how bad nuclear powerplants were and that it would be happy to get rid of them if workers would be guaranteed jobs of equal pay in other industries .
That ’s “ social unionism ” .
The union looked beyond wages and working conditions – it asked if what it was producing truly benefited humanity . [ 1 ]
Social unionism is most needed in times of crisis .
The automobile industry is truly in crisis .
According to the February 14 , 2009 , Wall Street Journal , car sales have dropped to a 30 - year low .
In November and December , 2008 , Ford , General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler went to , whining that without tens of billions of dollars in government handouts they would go belly up .
Washington
As if the big three automakers had told them what to say , Congress responded that a condition for granting bailout loans must be autoworkers ’ surrendering the gains won during the last half century .
After a few months of browbeating its membership , United Auto Workers union ( UAW ) executives indicated their willingness to go along with giving up the right to strike and the slashing of wages , health benefits , job security , Supplemental Employment Benefits and rights of new hires .
Confident that it was successfully using the crisis to bludgeon the union , on February 17 , 2009 , GM asked for US $ 16.6 billion , in addition to the $ 13.4 billion it has already received , and Chrysler sought $ 5 billion to be put on top of its $ 4 billion in - pocket .
With no thought of protecting jobs via a shorter work week , GM pledged to chop 37,000 production line and 10,000 salaried positions . [ 2 ]
The unanswered question was :
If the private corporations had so unequivocally demonstrated their inability to manage the auto industry , and if they were putting the entire US economy at risk , why should they not be “ de - privatised ” — taken over by the government — instead of being rewarded for incompetence ?
The auto barons have no interest in such a question .
Neither Republican nor Democratic party politicians imagined asking it .
And UAW honchos did their best to pretend that nationalisation had never entered the mind of the union .
A split personality with two left hands
The response of the labour and social justice left has been to demand protection of the jobs and benefits of those whose work has not already been off - shored .
Auto industry militants seek support from other unions to fight any give - backs that union bosses seek to shove down their throats .
As news stories blast the opulent squandering of millions by bankers , unionists increasingly ask why should they bear the brunt of the attack on living standards ?
Meanwhile , anyone whose head has not been buried in the sand for the last decade knows that the private automobile is at the root of countless environmental evils .
Few devices are responsible for more destruction .
It ’s not just the tens of thousands of fatalities and injuries on the road .
Or health disasters in auto factories and their feeder industries , such as oil and steel .
It ’s more than the enormous contribution of cars to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change .
Not even adding in the massive toxins that cars pour into the air , resulting in asthma , lung and other diseases tallies the full destructiveness of the private automobile .
Transcending all of these is the automobile being the cornerstone of a culture that sacrifices relationships between people to increasingly frantic “ mobility ” .
Cities are split apart by highways as people live kilometres from their families in sprawling suburbs .
The rush - hour drive transforms the eight - hour work day into 10 or even 12 hours away from home .
Of all idols that the corporate mind - set worships , none is more blasphemous that the Tower of Auto .
The automobile epitomises a society that makes workers beg for a job that forces them to labour at an increasingly exhausting pace so that they can be dumped when the factory closes , robbed of their healthcare and pensions , and compelled to watch their communities polluted , their children poisoned from toxins and their grandchildren fried from global warming .
Yet , it is not unusual for people to rally to save jobs while having amnesia concerning the environmental catastrophe those jobs embody .
And there is certainly nothing unique about an environmental forum that says nothing about work life .
Pity the poor leftist who schedules both in the same day , having to remember when to wear the personality of a labour activist who ignores the environment and when to be an environmentalist ignoring labour .
Forward to the past
There was a time , not so many generations ago , when the Knights of Labor and the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) proclaimed that labour organisations should never limit themselves to bread and butter issues .
Defending basic rights should be a part of imagining what society would be like if it was not ground down by capital .
The original labour organisations asked how workers could reorganise industry to benefit society rather than make profit .
Propping up an obsolete technology may seem like it is defending jobs .
In the long run , it does nothing of the sort .
Tall buildings used to have multiple elevator operators .
As push button elevators came in , those jobs were doomed .
Demanding that elevator operator positions be maintained could only feed an illusion .
It would have been far better to demand , like the OCAW , that elevator operators be guaranteed the transition to a different job .
Automobile production is doomed .
The last half of the world ’s oil will disappear far more rapidly than did the first half .
No fantasy of shale oil , tar sands , hydrogen or the like will save the private automobile .
The only salvation for the remaining auto jobs is a complete rethinking of what can replace the production of cars .
If auto workers are to be retrained , what would their new jobs be ?
If not the private automobile , then …
To say that the “ private ” car should be abolished does not mean that all automobile manufacturing should cease .
There will be plenty of need for vehicles for the disabled , for use in the construction industry , for emergency the services and car sharing .
That is totally different to people owning a car for single - occupant personal use .
But production for these purposes would be vastly less than the constantly expanding production of private cars and could not absorb all auto jobs .
Automobile plants should be immediately retooled to increase the production of buses and trains as the manufacture of cars declines .
This would also result in a lowering of production .
The only way that masspublic transport can be efficient is for the total mass of production to be less than that required to move the same number of people in individual cars .
The number of jobs created by bus and train manufacture will be less than the number lost by manufacturing fewer cars .
Automobile plants need to be redesigned for environmentally positive production .
Production of windmills and solar panels are good options .
Increased production of bicycles is important if we are to design cities so people can make 80 % of their trips without motor vehicles .
Yet , adding non-private vehicles , buses , trains and environmental production will tally a smaller number of jobs than required by existing auto plants .
The obvious solution to preserving jobs is a reduction in the number of hours everybody must work .
If we can produce what we need with fewer hours of labour , why do n’t all of us work less rather than having some work more than 30 hours a week while others have no job ?
Who could make this happen ?
It ’s not likely to be the corporations .
Those sitting around waiting for the big three automakers to make a socially responsible decision will get bed sores on their butts .
Maybe the Democratic Party politicians will decide to do the right thing .
Or maybe not .
After all , it was the Clinton gang that rammed the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) through and did everything in its power to outsource US jobs .
What about the UAW officialdom ?
A big problem is that none of the fundamental changes needed in the US economy are going to happen without nationalising the banks and the automobile companies .
Demanding nationalisation would require union bosses to think beyond Roosevelt ’s New Deal and they wo n’t even ask to revive it .
New alliance , old alliance
Was n’t it 10 short years ago that labour , environmental and human rights activists , along with those supporting rights of indigenous people and many others , came together in Seattle to block the World Trade Organisation ?
Whatever the limitations of that coalition , it showed that corporate power can be successfully challenged by pulling many struggles together .
The potential for a new alliance is that we all have the same need : a better life with less work and the manufacture of less damaging stuff .
Unfortunately , decades of defeat have left very few progressives willing to announce : “ The emperor has no clothes ! ”
With a numbing unanimity of corporations , government and media demanding a “ stimulus ” package , who will say , “ Attempting to jump start the economy by producing more of what we do n’t need is the opposite of what should be done ” ?
Rather than increasing production , we could live vastly better lives by reducing production in a sane , planned way and sharing the necessary work . [ 3 ]
Is it too much for auto workers to question their own jobs ?
Actually , a better way to pose the question is :
Why should any group of working people fail to challenge what they do and how they do it ?
If it is not outrageous for those who work in weapons plants to ask themselves if they should be guaranteed work that does not involve tearing the flesh off of other people ’s bodies , then why should n’t auto workers ask if they need to be manufacturing something as deadly as the privately owned car ?
The same applies to steelworkers , lead miners , doctors , nurses , teachers and social workers .
It is not just in the auto industry — working people throughout the country are hurting .
Correcting for statistical manipulation by the government , the true unemployment rate in the United States rose from 17.5 % in December 2008 to 18 % in January 2009 .
The US unemployment rate has already reached depression levels . [ 4 ]
Again correcting for governmental statistical manipulation , the true number of jobless in January 2009 was 716,000 .
Even if US Presideny Obama ’s promised 3 million jobs materialise , the gain will be wiped out in a few months .
We need more cars like we need a new generation of nuclear power plants
We hear unending propaganda equating more cars with more jobs .
To build a human economy we do not need a “ stimulus ” to increase the production of objects that harm us .
Sensible economics requires : ( a ) universal healthcare , ( b ) universal retirement / unemployment coverage , and ( c ) guaranteed employment with a [ much ] shorter work week .
During the CIO organising days , auto workers paved the way in unionising plant after plant .
For decades , the UAW was a trendsetter for the rest of labour , demanding pay that would allow workers to own their own homes and send their children to college .
Now , a beaten and cowed UAW blazes the trail of union self - destruction .
In the 1930s , labour needed to protect job security , pay and standards of living .
Those continue to be essential , but the great task of today is redefining work .
The last half of the 20th century saw a continuous reconceptualisation of how to organise everything from transportation to computers to office work .
Today , labour will either be in the forefront or the victim of job redesign .
Union leaders who insist that labour must have no part in rethinking production trade labour ’s birthright for a pottage of lentils .
Auto workers have the ability to again set the bar by proclaiming that labour must be at the centre of redefining jobs , the economy and , most important , working people ’s role in establishing a just society .
Should n’t those who do the work be the first ones to ask how it can be done in a different way or even abolished if it is useless or destructive ?
It was no accident that Bob Tibbs senior was a OCAW business agent during the work day and signed people up to the IWW during the weekend .
Though Bob died several years ago , his spirit continues to inspire activists who keep one foot in a languishing union , environmental or civil rights movement while hoping to kindle a dream for a different world .
St Louis
Now is the time to pull disparate forces together for a program of ( a ) full employment with ( b ) fewer hours of work and ( c ) working people deciding what to produce and how to produce it .
The economy , the environment and our society are in too much peril to allow the same corporations who created the mess to continue to make decisions for us .

Since I recently ordered a HTC G1 smartphone that runs Android , I wanted to be able to code for it as well .
But since I ’m a bit allergic to Java , I decided to figure out how to use the nice language Scala on it .
This turned out not to be very hard , but it was frustrating enough that I shall explain how I think to best do it .
( Please notice that I do n’t really know Java , barely know Scala , had no clue about Android , and generally avoid “ the Java way ” , so please bear with me , and report any mistakes I did . )
In theory , we can just use scalac to compile our . scala files to ordinary JVM .class - files and they would interoperate without problems .
In practice , this approach should be avoided , since Android does things a little bit differently : it does not run Java byte code , but Dalvik byte code , and you need to convert the .class files to .dex files to make them run on the phone , a task I call dexing .
So you can try to dex your .class files together with scala - library .
jar , and after figuring how to give dx ( the dexing tool ) more heap space ( dx - JXmx512 m ) , it will happily munch that , think a rather long time , and spit out a not -very - compact ~ 800 kb Android .apk application that does nothing yet .
After doing that a dozen times , you run out of coffee .
And swap , maybe .
Now , do n’t try to “ pre-dex ” the scala libraries , because in a .dex , everything is mangled into one file , and there are no tools to combine these files .
Instead , you should “ treeshake ” the application such that only the required Scala classes end up in the Android binary .
I ’ll use ProGuard for this .
To make things short , here is a step - by - step guide :
Create the application skeleton ( I use the Android SDK 1.1r1 for OS X ) : % activitycreator -- out helloscala com.example.helloscala.HelloScala % cd helloscala Download Scala ( I used version 2.7.3 ) and ProGuard ( I used version 4.3 ) , and extract them somewhere ( $ SCALA , $ PROGUARD ) .
Import the tools : % mkdir tools % cp $ SCALA/lib/scala-{compiler,library}.jar tools % cp $ PROGUARD /lib/ proguard .jar tools Modify the Ant file .
For your reference , this is the modified build.xml .
Add inside the compile task : < taskdef resource = " scala/tools/ant/antlib.xml " classpath=" tools/scala-compiler.jar:tools/scala-library.jar " /> < scalac force=" changed " deprecation = " on " srcdir= " $ {srcdir} " includes = "**/*. scala " destdir= " ${outdir-classes} " > < classpath > < pathelement location= " ${android - jar} " /> < fileset dir=" tools " includes= " *.jar " /> </ classpath > </ scalac >
Modify the dex task to look like this ( “ proguard ” as dependency , changed fileset ) < target name = " dex " depends = " proguard " > < apply executable = " $ {dx} " failonerror = " true " parallel = " true " > < arg value= " -- dex " /> < arg value= " --output=${intermediate-dex-ospath} " /> < fileset dir= " $ {outdir} " includes= " *.min.jar " /> </ apply > </ target >
Add the proguard task : < target name= " proguard " depends = " compile " > < taskdef resource = " proguard/ant/task.properties " classpath=" tools/proguard.jar " /> < proguard > - injars $ {outdir}/classes:tools/scala-library.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF,!library.properties ) - outjars $ {outdir}/classes.min.jar - libraryjars $ {android - jar} - dontwarn - dontoptimize - dontobfuscate - keep public class * extends android.app.Activity </ proguard > </ target >
Now , rewrite the . java file in Scala ( do n’t forget to remove the HelloScala. java file ) : package com.example.helloscala // we need these _root_ because com.android exists , // and we are in com.example.helloscala .
import _root_.android.app.Activity import _root_.android.os .
Bundle class HelloScala extends Activity { override def on Create( savedInstanceState : Bundle ) { super.on Create( savedInstanceState ) // use a bit of Scala 's stdlib , just to show off setContentView ( List ( R.layout.main ) first ) } }
Done !
Now you can build it by running ant .
If the build succeeded , check bin/HelloScala - debug.apk :
% du bin/HelloScala - debug.apk 20 bin/HelloScala-debug.apk
Nice and small ( well , a pure - Java app only has 4 k , but its a lot better than 800 kb unstripped Scala standard library ) !
You can check which Scala libraries this uses with :
% jar tvf bin/classes.min.jar
Now start up the emulator , and when it has booted , install your application :
% adb install -r bin/HelloScala - debug.apk
Then , you can select it in the emulator , and you should see the default “ hello world ” screen .
Congratulations , you are running Scala on Android !
Homeworld .
Dawn of War. Company of Heroes .
In the world of PC gaming , these are big names .
While Relic might not be widely known as a console developer , it 's not entirely unfamiliar with the territory .
The Outfit , an over - the - top World War II action game focused on multiplayer mayhem , was put out for Microsoft 's Xbox 360 very early on in that console 's life cycle , and was met with a .
Now the company is again dipping into Games Workshop 's gleefully violent and chaotic Warhammer 40 ,000 universe and preparing something new , this time only for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 .
Utilizing a proprietary engine and being built by a new console - focused team , Relic is busy putting together Space Marine , a third - person action - RPG .
After seeing some early footage , it looks as though it 's going to be as bloody as Warhammer 40 K fans might expect , filled with large - scale battles , brutal weaponry , and frantic fighting .
In Space Marine you play as ( surprise ! ) a Space Marine , a genetically enhanced super soldier engineered specifically to smash the faces of anything that gets in the way .
We witnessed in the video a group of four Space Marines landing on an Imperial planet to fend off a massive incursion of Orks .
If you have no idea what Warhammer 40,000 is , then you should just know that it's a universe within which numerous alien races are constantly killing each other in a spectacularly gory manner , and generally enjoying the process .
Debut Trailer - Watch or download the video here ( HD available ) .
Of the races included in the footage , the primary conflict involved a handful of Space Marines against seemingly overwhelming swarms of Orks .
Near the end we also spotted a Carnifex , a towering agent of devastation and member of the Tyranid race .
Relic would not say anything further about to what degree Tyranids will be in the game , so no word yet on exactly what 's going on or what other races , if any , might be included .
If you do n't know what Tyranids are , they 're a somewhat insect - like alien race that overwhelm and decimate whatever they happen upon .
To get a better idea of what they 're like , check out this , Relic 's recently released PC - only real - time strategy game .
Back to the gameplay , the action appears to be fast , brutal , and bloody .
It 's still pretty early on , so specifics were n't plentiful , but it seems as though as a single Space Marine you 'll move through the story and engage in some large - scale conflicts against mobs of enemies .
Using power swords , chain swords , hammers , bolters , heavy bolters , and more it appears your Space Marine will have quite a few deadly tools to wipe out the Ork hordes from range or up close in melee .
In addition to acquiring a number of types of weaponry , you 'll also get some useful items that can help with taking out even bigger groups of baddies .
We saw a jump pack that a Space Marine can equip and use to pop up into the air and slam down on the ground , sending Orks tumbling in all directions around the point of impact .
There 's also the potential to acquire and put to use more devastating items , which might include something like an orbital strike that sears a large swath of a planet 's surface with a blast originating at an orbiting Space Marine ship .
To do this effectively , the President needs to be above the fray .
He can not be seen as fanning the flames of outrage against the abuses of the previous government .
In fact , he needs to be the one shielding them from the lynch mob , while his own base demands just punishment .
Then he needs to let the law take its course .
The shameful secrets of the past must get out drip by drip .
Each day a new morsel must be released to be chewed up by the wolf pack .
And each day the opposition must find itself defending something even more indefensible than the day before .
This is just what is happening to the GOP .
You can see the desperation in their faces .
Not all Republicans are cowardly sociopaths like Hannity or Cheney .
They are honorable men and women who happen to believe in a different political philosophy .
They do not want to defend criminal behavior any more than us .
The drip drip drip of daily scandalous revelations is the political equivalent of Chinese water torture .
We can see their responses become more irrational , more desperate .
The softest target of all is Cheney .
In this , as in everything else , he is acting as a coward .
For a man with so many shameful secrets to hide , he has made a major blunder by asking for more memos to be released .
Cheney has a history of cowardice and cracking under pressure .
He got five deferments from getting drafted into the army during Vietnam .
Cheney could not rebuff criticism from the right wing for not invading Baghdad during the first Gulf war .
While he was out of power , he seethed , scheming for a way to start another war against Iraq , to finish the job .
His overreaction to 9/11 is the root of the whole torture policy .
Now , he is cracking again .
Cheney 's best strategy right now is to hire a good lawyer and keep his mouth shut .
But he is too scared to do that .
His overreaction is sucking all other Republicans into his own personal nightmare .
He has enemies among the Bush administration alumni .
Condoleeza Rice , no less culpable than Cheney , is sending her flacks out to defend her own record .
Powell 's former Chief of Staff is already on record pointing the finger at Cheney as the source of the torture program .
Military men have a special contempt for Cheney , for getting them to do things that he would not himself .
This is the way the mafia was broken up .
All organized criminal enterprises rely on the ability of its members to keep their mouths shut and their leadership to remain cool under pressure .
When the leaders overreact and start to shoot at each other , the rank and file will start to blab .
Their fear of the law exceeds their fear of bosses .
As each one tries to save his skin , more and more crimes get revealed .
The honorable members of the community to which the criminals belong will organize to expel the evil .
That is what Rudy Giuliani did to the NY mafia .
It was Republican Senator Howard Baker who asked " What did the President know , and when did he know it ? " during the Watergate hearings .
He was among those who advised Nixon to resign .
Keep them busy .
Let every GOP member of Congress explain why water - boarding is not torture .
Why we are any better than China in the treatment of prisoners .
Destroy their spirit , their belief in themselves .
The issues that animate them ( abortion , border security , taxes ) will get pushed out of the news .
Even their own talking heads will be stuck talking of the past , mired in the minutiae of what happened back in May 2 2004 .
It is the Republicans who can put an end to this .
Who will be the Howard Baker of the Waterboarding scandal ?
Who will step up first to condemn torture and admit that the whole program was a grievous mistake ?
Sen. McCain , we are looking at you .
The danger here is that the issues that matter to us will get pushed out too .
This is our last chance to get Universal Health Care while the baby boomers can still pay into the system .
There are two wars going on , one of which can evolve into an existential threat to American civilization .
The economy has collapsed and needs immediate attention .
As this storm is rages , Obama needs to be focused on his reform agenda .
Carter had a similar chance after Watergate .
But he was not able to make radical enough changes in Government .
Reagan deftly used the small window of opportunity available to him .
There were no major scandals from the previous administration to help him along though .
Clinton got mired in minor controversies early on that slowed his momentum and never achieved the full potential of his considerable political skills .
Let that not happen .
The trick is to use the torture scandal to pound the Republicans while at the same time getting our own agenda through .
Do not let one distract us from the other .
Obama must succeed or we are all in deep trouble .
Added Note
Thanks for the Rec List !
Changed the title to reflect more accurately what I think will wreck the GOP .
For Those Clamoring For Prosecutions
Now :
Once prosecutions start ( grand juries convene ) , the release of memos will have to stop .
Much better to keep the revelations coming .
Let the shameful secrets hidden away in Cheney 's files become common knowledge .
There are enough violations of law here that some people will go to jail .
I do n't believe Cheney , Rumsfeld or Rice will , but some of their aides will .
In time .
They are already starting to point fingers at each other .
If you are still impatient for prosecutions to start :
Remember what happened with Sen. Stevens .
A prosecution that does n't go exactly by the book will backfire .
These guys will have the absolute best defense attorneys : Col. Oliver North and Sen. Stevens had the same guy .
This is also why Congressional investigations are not the way to go .
They generate a lot of publicity , but Congress cannot force testimony without offering immunity .
That is how Oliver North got away .
What Obama is doing is just the right thing .
Drip Drip the memos out .
Let the DOJ make its own independent decision on what is a crime worth prosecution .
Let the rest of us spread the outrage .
And keep up the pressure .
Jamal Anderson , ESPN Analyst Arrested On Drug Charges
, former Atlanta Falcons running back and current season NFL analyst on ESPN 's First Take , was arrested and booked on a felony charge for possession of cocaine and a misdemeanor charge for marijuana .
The arresting officer witnessed him using cocaine and found a one inch square bag of cocaine and a marijuana cigarette in Anderson 's pocket .
Anderson , 36 , was taken to the Fulton County sheriff 's office in Atlanta late Saturday night and is being held without bail until his first court appearance , which is scheduled for Monday , February 9 .
A nightclub customer at the Peachtree Tavern hear sniffing in a bathroom stall and mentioned it to an off - duty cop who was working security at the bar .
According to police spokesman Otis Redmond , " The officer went into the restroom , heard the same sniffing and peered over the stall door .
He saw Jamal Anderson sniffing a line of powdered cocaine off the back of the toilet . "
George McNeilly , senior director of communications at ESPN said in a Sunday morning statement , " We just learned of this situation , and it is not appropriate for us to comment until we have more information . "
Anderson played for the Falcons for eight seasons , amassing 5,336 rushing yards , 156 receptions for 1,645 yards , and 41 touchdowns before he suffered a career - ending tear of his ACL in 2001 .

PRECISELY what happened behind the barrack gates of a Georgian tank battalion near Tbilisi on May 5th is unclear .
The Georgians say they quelled a mutiny and foiled a conspiracy to overthrow President Mikheil Saakashvili , probably inspired by Russian intelligence .
Russia , predictably , denied involvement .
Then on May 7th protesters from Georgia 's opposition , who have been demanding Mr Saakashvili 's resignation , clashed with police in Tbilisi in the first outbreak of violence since their demonstrations began in early April .
It is clear that Georgia remains extremely tense .
Any provocation could easily become a pretext for renewed conflict .
Both Russia and Georgia were quick to link the mutiny to NATO exercises that started in Georgia on May 6th .
Georgia said it was a bid to derail the exercises , Russia that it was proof of NATO 's folly .
Holding the exercises in a psychiatric hospital would be more appropriate than holding them on the territory of the Georgian state , thundered Dmitry Rogozin , Russia 's irascible NATO ambassador .
In fact NATO 's small exercises were held under its Partnership for Peace programme and planned before last August 's war in Georgia .
Russia was even invited to participate .
Dmitry Medvedev , the Russian president , still called the exercises a provocation .
The Russians were also miffed by the expulsion of two Russian diplomats from NATO on suspicion of spying , especially since one of them , Vasily Chizhov , is the son of Russia 's ambassador to the EU .
In a tit - for - tat , Moscow kicked out two NATO envoys from Canada and pulled out of a NATO - Russia council meeting in Brussels .
( Georgia also arrested its former envoy to NATO on spying charges . )
After Mr Medvedev 's relatively amicable meeting with Barack Obama a month ago , NATO 's actions have caused confusion in Moscow , says Dmitri Trenin , director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre .
Is America serious about improving relations with Russia ?
Yet this confusion betrays a conviction that any improvement must come from America , leaving Russia free to interfere in its neighbourhood .
Even as it complained about NATO 's exercises , Russia was deploying border guards in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
In early April Georgia detected a build - up of Russian troops and equipment in the two breakaway regions .
The Russians , however , said this was merely a military exercise .
Pavel Felgenhauer , an independent military analyst who accurately predicted Russia 's war with Georgia in August , says that Russia 's troops are still poised for action .
The proponents of war , he argues , feel that the West 's reaction to the 2008 war was meek .
They also note that , despite being called a political corpse by Mr Medvedev , Mr Saakashvili has survived .
Fears of Russia weighed heavily on the minds of those who went to Prague this week to launch the “ eastern partnership ” , a project meant to improve economic and political relations between the European Union and six former Soviet republics : Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , Armenia , Azerbaijan and Belarus .
This low - budget project has no military component and may not make much of a difference , says Fyodor Lukyanov , a Russian foreign - policy pundit .
Still , Russia sees the EU as a competitor in its sphere of influence and reacts fiercely to any interference , such as Belarus being told that recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia would hurt its prospects with the EU .
That the summit was followed by a conference on Nabucco , a gas pipeline meant to bypass Russia in the south , was just another irritation .
Some would like the countries in the eastern partnership to choose between Russia and the EU , said Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , on the eve of the Prague meeting .
“ We hope … there are no attempts at creating new dividing lines , ” he added .
Yet drawing new lines is exactly what Russia has done in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
It is no surprise that Russia 's idea of a second Europe centred on Moscow has little appeal to former Soviet republics .
Unless the EU can offer tangible benefits to its new partners , however , its own appeal could also quickly wear out .
This is a long video , so here are the highlights :

( 7:45 - 8:00 ) The agent tells me in less than perfect English , “ In the Border Patrol Checkpoint , the person ’s rights does n’t matter here . ”

( 19:00 - 19:40 ) I ’m accused of being a terrorist
( 26:20 ) I ’m told that I ’m free to go without being searched
Thank God we live in a free country !
But how long will our freedom last if we ignore our Bill of Rights ?

Images of 25 cities are viewable via Google Street View
Google 's Street View technology carries a small risk of privacy invasion but should not be stopped , the UK's Information Commissioner has ruled .
The technology , which adds photos of locations to maps , sparked complaints it breaches the Data Protection Act .
A spokesman for the privacy watchdog said removing the entire service would be " disproportionate to the relatively small risk of privacy detriment " .
One village in the UK prevented Google from taking photos of the streets .
Residents of Broughton , near Milton Keynes , blocked the driver of a Google Street View car , which captures the photos , when it tried to enter the village .
Police were called after residents staged the protest , accusing Google of invading their privacy and " facilitating crime " .
The Street View car takes photos for the service
The villagers said the car was intrusive and that residents should have been consulted .
Google has always said its service observed UK law and that photos were only taken from public areas .
The technology was first launched , amidst some complaints , in the US in May 2007 .
Privacy International had complained to the Information Commissioner along with 74 others , requesting the service be suspended , because some individual 's faces were identifiable on Street View .
Face blurring
The technology does have automatic face blurring but some individuals were not obscured .
Google said it would remove any image on Street View if a request came from a member of the public .
Dozens of images were removed from the UK roll out of Street View within days of the service going live .
The Information Commissioner 's office said Google was acting quickly to remove images .
It would not be in the public interest to ' turn the digital clock back '
David Evans , Information Commissioner 's Office A spokesman for Google said it was pleased with the Information Commissioner 's decision .
" We recognise that a small minority of people may not wish their house to be included in the service which is why we have created easy to use removals tools , " he added .
David Evans , the Information Commission 's senior data protection practice manager , compared being captured by the service to passers - by filmed on TV news camera .
" It would not be in the public interest to ' turn the digital clock back ' , " he said .
" In the same way , there is no law against anyone taking pictures of people in the street as long as the person using the camera is not harassing people , " he said .
Relatively limited
He added : " In a world where many people Tweet , Facebook and blog , it is important to take a commonsense approach towards Street View and the relatively limited privacy intrusion it may cause . "
Google should continue to routinely blur images of people 's faces and car number plates , he said .
The Information Commissioner 's Office said it would continue to monitor the service .
I 'm not saying Street View is evil and should be taken down , but it should n't be up to individuals to spot breaches of privacy and get them taken down
Dr Ian Brown , Oxford Internet Institute Dr Ian Brown , a privacy expert at the Oxford Internet Institute , said : " The phrase ' small risk of privacy detriment ' betrays the slightly wrong mindset at the Information Commissioner 's office as they are having to adopt a reactive approach when it's far too late to really do anything about it .
" They should have been involved much earlier , because Google could - and should - have done a much better job and the Information Commissioner needs to be involved at a much earlier stage ; in other words , when it is being designed and not finished . "
He added : " I 'm not saying Street View is evil and should be taken down , but it should n't be up to individuals to spot breaches of privacy and get them taken down .
" So far , the breaches have just been embarrassing - someone being sick , someone else leaving a sex shop - but it 's possible someone could find themselves being unfairly divorced because an innocent image could be interpreted wrongly . "
Google claim that they have " engaged " with the Information Commissioner 's office throughout the development process and say that they have created " easy to use removal tools " .

SAN BERNARDINO , California ( CNN ) --
Three - year - old Briant Rodriguez remained in a hospital bed fatigued and malnourished Monday , 15 days after being kidnapped at gunpoint and then dumped on the streets of Mexico .
Liberato Vega , 30 , left , and Israel Moreno , 28 , are suspects in the kidnapping of 3 - year - old Briant Rodriguez .
Police do n't know much about what happened to the boy , who was taken after gunmen tied his family and ransacked his California home on May 3 .
They do n't know why the gunmen broke into the home , why they kidnapped the bubbly 3 - year - old or how he ended up wandering the streets of Mexicali with a shaved head , rather than the long hair he had sported before the kidnapping .
But police believe they do know who is responsible .
In a news conference on Monday , the San Bernardino Sheriff 's Department and FBI identified the two suspect gunmen as Liberato Vega , 30 , and Israel Moreno , 28 .
The two men , who authorities said were illegal immigrants with criminal records , are believed to have burst into the San Bernardino home , ransacked the house , tied up 3 - year - old Briant Rodriguez 's family and snatched the child two weeks ago .
The boy was returned to his family Saturday in the border town of Calexico .
" It was a very emotional and unforgettable experience , " said San Bernardino County Sheriff 's Sgt. Doug Hubbard , who was with the boy 's mother when he was returned .
" Enough said there -- before I get emotional . "
Officials said the boy was still in the hospital Monday and was being treated for malnourishment and fatigue .
" We 're very happy that he 's alive , " San Bernardino County Sheriff Rod Hoops said this weekend .
" A 3 - year - old goes missing in this country for two weeks -- sometimes it has an unhappy ending .
" This one did not . "
Now , police are trying to piece together exactly what may have happened during the 13 days the boy was missing .
Detectives from the San Bernardino Sheriff 's Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations agents were able to identify the alleged kidnappers based on unspecified physical evidence at the San Bernardino home and interviews with the boy 's family and neighbors .
Hubbard said the family has adamantly denied knowing who may be responsible for the kidnapping or having any association with those responsible .
FBI Supervisory Special Agent Don Roberts said it was , however , " likely that this family was the target " of the kidnappers .
" But why , we do n't know , " Roberts said , adding that the kidnappers had clearly planned the crime .
Officials said they believe Vega and Moreno are the two men they captured on video at a home - improvement store near the Rodriguez home before the crime buying tape like the kind that was used to bind the family .
Hubbard said there are no -bail warrants issued for both men for home invasion robbery and kidnapping and Roberts said the FBI also obtained federal warrants for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for both men .
" We will leave no stone unturned until these two are returned to San Bernardino to face justice , " Roberts said .
" We will not take a break until that day happens . "
Authorities are hunting for both men , who have criminal records , in Mexico where they were both born .
Roberts said both men have previously been deported from the United States , where they were living illegally .
Their previous residences are empty , police said .
Vega , who police said they considered to be the primary suspect , has had seven encounters with authorities in San Bernardino , according to court records , including four convictions in 2005 for a variety of charges , including driving under the influence .
He also has a dismissed burglary case and two open cases against him for driving under the influence , providing false information to police and driving without a license .
Police described Vega as a Hispanic male , 5 feet 9 inches weighing 130 pounds .
Moreno was convicted in 2008 for driving under the influence and has another similar case open against him .
Police described Moreno as a Hispanic male , 5 feet 6 inches weighing 150 pounds .
Police have said they are also looking for 21 - year - old Claudia Acosta , Vega 's girlfriend , who may be traveling with him .
They are n't sure how she 's related to the kidnapping .

Facebook 's Terms of Service vote wrapped up yesterday , and although participation fell far short of what the social networking company had hoped , by a vote of three - to - one users supported its new TOS .
Earlier in the week , Facebook attempted to right earlier wrongs over its Terms of Service by throwing the issue open to a massive vote .
Controversy erupted earlier this year when the site tried to introduce a new policy that could have left accounts in Facebook 's possession , even if a user terminated his or her association with the database .
Some even feared Facebook would take users ' personal details and sell them off to the highest bidders , including advertisers , or worse .
Turnout Far Short of " Binding " Requirement
A huge outcry by privacy advocates put an end to that , and in trying to establish a better relationship with users Facebook opened its Terms of Service policy to a vote , beginning Monday and ending Thursday at 11:59 am PT .
The site 's management had hoped that at least 30 per cent of the total user base would vote , making the decision " binding " in their opinion .
Unfortunately , the turnout was just about 650,000 -- still a significant number , but not anywhere near the 60 million represented by 30 % .
( Source : latimes.com )
The new policy voted in , which insiders speculate will be held up by Facebook , ensures that the site must continue a democratic approach to future revisions of any policies affecting its users .
Protest About Privacy -- or Design ?
It 's a step in the right direction for privacy advocates , but the low turnout is certainly surprising .
After the the February debacle involving the new TOS , a group was created to fight the changes .
" Millions Against Facebook 's New Layout & Terms of Service " eventually soaked up about 2.7 million members , making it one of the largest groups ever created .
However , given the vote 's turnout ( less than a quarter of that group alone ) , it seems most people in " Millions Against ... " were probably more opposed to the site 's redesign than its complicated privacy policy .
Officially , Facebook 's commitment to adopt and keep its democratic , communal governance will only be considered " advisory , " since so few ( about 0.32 % of all Facebook users ) turned out to vote .
" It just goes to show that while a few users clearly got upset over TOS issues , most just do n't care enough , " quipped one expert .

( NewsTarget ) A study to be published in thehas revealed that vitamin D could help ward off the decline in mental function which usually accompanies old age .
Its findings add on to other recent studies which had also suggested vitamin D has protective effects in this area .
Study after study has revealed to us the amazing protective and beneficial effects of vitamin D on various aspects of health .
In some ways , it almost sounds too good to be true .
But once we understand that vitamin D functions not so much as a vitamin , per se , but more as a hormone which regulates a multitude of processes in the human body , this then becomes far less surprising .
Researchers from the Peninsula Medical School ( Exeter ) and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom as well as the University of Michigan in the United States had looked at 2,000 persons who were 65 years old or more , and who had participated in the Health Survey for England carried out in 2000 .
The study team assessed the subjects ' cognition or comprehension skills , which included factors such as attention , memory , as well as time and space orientation ; impaired cognitive function has been linked to a higher chance of getting dementia .
Among the study subjects , about 200 were found to have significant cognitive impairment .
And the researchers uncovered the finding that the degree of cognitive impairment was inversely correlated with vitamin D levels in the subjects .
In fact , those with the highest levels of vitamin D in their bodies had less than half the risk of cognitive impairment , as compared to those with the lowest levels of the nutrient .
Besides exposing one 's bare skin to sunlight , what other ways can we get our necessary fix of vitamin D ?
The truth is people who live in higher latitude zones as well as older folks , whose bodies are less able to synthesize vitamin D upon exposure to sunlight , may well have to look at getting enough vitamin D through dietary sources , such as oily fish and supplements .
" For those of us who live in countries where there are dark winters without much sunlight , like the UK , getting enough vitamin D can be a real problem - particularly for older people , who absorb less vitamin D from sunlight .
One way to address this might be to provide older adults with vitamin D supplements , " said Dr Iain Lang from the Peninsula Medical School , who was part of the study team .
As always , the researchers as well as leaders from Alzheimer 's organizations have called for further research .
But for believers , there is already more than sufficient evidence of the healing powers of the sun , both in traditional wisdom as well as modern scientific proof , in protecting both the body and the mind .
A University of Southern California study , for example , had found that more time spent under the sun during childhood translated to reduced risk of getting multiple sclerosis ( MS ) later in life .
Published in 2007 in the journal , the study had looked at 79 pairs of identical twins , each of which comprised one person who developed MS .
MS itself has a heightened incidence rate at higher latitudes , which already suggests a link with limited sun exposure .
That study added to findings from previous research , which had discovered that women who consumed vitamin D supplements had a 40 % lower MS risk .
Another study published in 2007 , this time in the , also suggested that vitamin D could play a part in slowing the aging process of bodily cells and tissues .
Carried out at King 's College in London , the study had looked at over 2,000 women and found that higher levels of vitamin D were linked to less signs of aging - related DNA changes .
More recently , a study published in 2008 in thefound that low levels of vitamin D could also have a part to play in the development of Parkinson 's disease .

As the evidence mounts , why not begin getting some daily sunshine during the cooler hours of the day ?

( This essay was originally published in issue # 1 of the AHS newsletter , Secular Future . )
As the New Atheist movement grows in size and influence , we ’ve been assailed by pundits and theologians who say we ought to be more respectful – that we need to choose our words carefully and afford religious believers the courtesy they are due .
And I could n’t agree more .
Respect is a moral imperative for all people , and I think it ’s especially vital that we , as the vanguard of a reform movement seeking to make our mark on society , are respectful at all times toward the powers that be .
That ’s why I think it ’s especially important for atheists to buy ads on trains and buses , to speak out on TV and the radio , to publish editorials in newspapers and journals , and especially , continue to publish blockbuster books like The God Delusion that make the case against theism with force and candor .
I also encourage atheists to speak out in their personal lives wherever possible , to make their views known to family and friends and to push back against aggressive and intrusive religious proselytizing whenever and wherever we encounter it .
I believe that respect for the religious demands no less .
As you might have guessed , although I agree with clergy and apologists that atheists should be respectful , I define respect somewhat differently than they do .
I believe that when you disagree with someone , especially in a matter of importance , the most respectful course of action is to speak your mind clearly and firmly , making certain that the other party knows exactly where you differ with them and why .
To my mind , this seems like the only honest definition .
When religious apologists call for “ respect , ” what they generally seem to mean is that atheists should be silent and not speak our minds if doing so might offend someone .
For instance , when Richard Dawkins was interviewed for the Canadian TV show The Agenda last May , the host , Steve Paikin , read him the following passage , which originally appeared on an atheist website and which Dr. Dawkins quoted in The God Delusion :
“ You have included in your book the ‘ new ten commandments ’ for atheists , and I want to read out the third commandment , which is : ‘ Treat your fellow human beings , your fellow living things , and the world in general with love , honesty , faithfulness , and respect . ’
Do you think you have shown those qualities to those who oppose your side of the argument ? ” ( see video )
Since I was the original author of that passage , I feel compelled to set the record straight .
In context , my original essay most emphatically did not advocate refraining from criticism of others ’ beliefs , and I strongly object to that misrepresentation of my views .
( In fact , my “ new ten commandments ” also include these : “ Never seek to censor or cut yourself off from dissent ; always respect the right of others to disagree with you ” , and “ Question everything ” ) .
How would that be showing respect ?
In what sense is it respectful to paper over your differences in the name of false amity , to stifle your opinions just because others might disagree ?
That ’s not respect , but rather condescension .
This advice treats the religious , as columnist Johann Hari says , as if they were immature and excitable children who need to be protected from anything that might upset them .
Acting this way toward theists would be to treat them as less than fully mature adults – it would be a failure to respect their status as rational agents who can evaluate an argument on the merits and respond to persuasion .
Personally , if someone I knew thought I was making a disastrously ill - advised choice , but held back from saying so because they thought I could n’t handle hearing it , I would find that far more offensive and disrespectful – verging on a lie by omission .
No one should fear honest criticism .
Granted , there actually are some believers who ca n’t handle criticism without becoming angry or violent .
( I ’m thinking of groups like the Muslims who protested cartoons of Mohammed by marching through the streets of the UK waving banners that said things such as “ Massacre those who insult Islam “ ) .
But even this is no reason to refrain from criticizing them .
To do otherwise would be to send them the message that they can have their way any time they want it , just by threatening the rest of us if their desires are n’t met .
It rewards people for being irrationally and violently protective of their own cherished ideas .
The message we should be sending – the one that shows the most respect for all groups in a free society – is that the price of being able to air your views is that other people have the right to speak out as well , even if you do n’t like what they have to say .
There ’s another sense in which a strong and impassioned defense of atheism is a respectful act .
Regardless of how certain specific religious groups feel about it , our society is founded , among other things , on the ideal of free speech as a human right .
We are all heirs to the legacy of the Enlightenment , a grand historical tradition of rational debate and democratic inquiry .
Countless brave people from history – activists , patriots , rabble - rousers , and freethinkers and believers both – waged great battles to wrest this basic human right from the grasp of tyrants .
Our freedom is a precious gift which they have bequeathed to us , and we can best honor them by making full use of it .
To silence ourselves , to refuse that gift out of some spurious and ill - advised notion of politeness , would be an act of extreme disrespect toward those who suffered and even died to bring it to us .
The best way to honor their memories is by making full use of their gift and voicing our opinions boldly , trusting that the tumult of debate will ensure that bad ideas are defeated and good ones ultimately win out .
I , for one , intend to show that respect to my forebears ; and I encourage atheists everywhere in the world to do likewise .

Is Arizona turning into a climate - change dropout ?
Under former Gov. Janet Napolitano , the state took a leading role in a series of regional plans to reduce carbon dioxide and other pollutants believed to be responsible for global warming .
But in the three months since Napolitano left for a Cabinet position in the Obama administration , Republican leaders have branded the initiative anti-business and have introduced bills to block Arizona from adopting the plans .
The discord here and in neighboring states threatens to unravel an agreement that had been held up as a global model barely a year ago .
It also exposes the tenuous relationship between environment and politics .
" It 's old - school thinking , this idea that if you protect the environment , somehow that 's bad for the economy and bad for business , " said Sandy Bahr , chapter director of the Sierra Club in Phoenix .
" I think that most people who have been paying attention understand if you do n't protect the environment , that 's really bad for business .
Bad air is bad for everyone . "
Arizona was one of the founding members of the Western Climate Initiative , a coalition that now includes 11 U.S. states and Canadian provinces .
The members agreed to set a regional cap on greenhouse gases , mostly pollution from fossil - fuel sources like power stations , and oversee an emissions - trading system to help polluters comply with the cap .
Most of the U.S. members of the coalition , including Arizona , have also adopted vehicle - efficiency rules that exceed federal standards .
The states are awaiting permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enforce those rules , which would further limit emissions from automobile tailpipes .
The EPA may have strengthened the states ' arguments for new standards on Friday when it concluded that greenhouse gases endanger public health and should be regulated under the Clean Air Act .
But the decision wo n't guarantee that a regional plan would succeed and could instead lead to stronger support in Congress for nationwide standards .
Many Republicans opposed Napolitano 's aggressive role in the initiative but were unable to block her from acting .
When she resigned to take over the Homeland Security Department , critics of the climate plan quickly introduced bills chipping away at Arizona 's role .
One measure was aimed at the vehicle - emission standards , which the state Department of Environmental Quality adopted last year .
A second , introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs , R - Gilbert , was more direct :
It prohibited ADEQ from participating in the climate coalition .
At a hearing earlier this year , Biggs made it clear he thought the Legislature should go further .
" I 'd rather Arizona not participate , " he said .
" I would rather they stand up to this steamrolling tank which is running over Arizona .
There comes a time when you have to stand up and say , ' No . '
At some point you have to have the courage to stand up and protest this thing like the guy did at Tiananmen Square . "
Business groups say the emissions - trading program would increase energy costs at a time when most people can't afford higher bills .
Carmakers say the proposed emission standards would drive them closer to ruin , especially if only parts of the country adopt the rules .
Despite pressure from legislative leaders , Gov. Jan Brewer has said she wants Arizona to remain active in the climate coalition , if only to maintain a voice in what happens .
Her newly appointed ADEQ director took a similarly reserved stand .
Other states in the group are also struggling .
Utah 's legislature passed a non-binding resolution urging Gov. Jon Huntsman to withdraw from the coalition .
Lawmakers in Montana , Oregon and Washington have balked at adopting all of the emissions - trading framework needed for the regional system to work .
So far , only California has adopted the bills as pledged in the agreement .
Analysts that have followed the process say the coalition probably could n't survive if several states broke away , and the emissions program would stumble , largely ineffective without wide participation .
Some state officials already say they want to see what actions Congress and the president take on climate change .
President Barack Obama has proposed an ambitious plan that includes many of the elements of the Western initiative , though it faces an uphill battle in the House and Senate .
Environmental groups say Arizona and the other states should push ahead with a regional plan that can address local needs .
" These programs can protect consumers , reduce air pollution and promote public health , " said Diane Brown , executive director of Arizona PIRG , an advocacy group .
" We need to do something to reduce emissions now or we 'll be paying more in the future . "
MONTGOMERY , AL --
Many state offices are closed on Monday because it's an official state holiday for Confederate Memorial Day .
Confederate Memorial Day was actually on Sunday , but Alabama observes it on Monday .
The Sons of Confederate Veterans are planning a memorial program at the State Capitol .
Not all state offices are closed because of the holiday .
Alabama 's two unemployment compensation call centers are staying open .
State Industrial Relations Director Tom Surtees says that 's because Monday is a peak day for filing unemployment claims .
" However , when we launched at 9.10 am on that morning the critical point for the experiment was to see if the balloon would make it past 10,000 m , or 30,000 ft , which is the altitude that commercial airliners fly at . "
The game of Chess , said to have been invented as early as 600 A.D. in India , is said to have been characterized by attacks against the enemy King .
Nevertheless , since the popularization of the game since the past 3 centuries , a number of principles have been evolved by the erstwhile masters of the game , which have been tried and tested over a prolonged period .
One of such principles related to the opening moves of a chess game , initiated and advocated by Francois - Andre Philidor in the year 1749 .
Unfortunately , the importance of the principles of Philidor was realized much later than he expired , in the nineteenth century , and is commonly referred to as Classical Opening Principles of Chess .
Philidor moved away from the general notion of attacking the enemy king at every possible opportunity in the game of chess .
Philidor insisted that the attacks should be more properly planned and executed to win over the enemy .
He also laid emphasis on minor objectives in the game .
You may have known by now that the major objective of chess game is to attack the enemy king .
Philidor emphasized that apart from the major objective , minor objectives such as conquering the centre from the enemy and controlling the conquered centre , should be pursued as part of the development of the game .
With this concept getting popular among the chess players , the art of defending against attacks gained more prominence and the games challenge and fascination was taken to a new level .
Without dwelling more on Philidor , let me explain the classical opening principles .
Well , the centre of the chessboard refers to the four vital squares in the central part – the four squares commonly referred to as e4 , e5 , d4 and d5 .
The four major aspects of Classical Opening Principles are —
Centralization
Quick Development
Early castling
Knights before Bishops
Centralization :
The most important part in the chessboard is the centre .
It is but obvious that pieces placed in the centre attack more squares than those positioned on either sides of the board .
For example , a knight placed in “ d4 ” can effectively attack eight squares .
Do you know what they are ?
They are c2 , b3 , b5 , c6 , e6 , f5 , f3 , and e2 .
Assuming that the same knight is not in d4 , but in h1 – then the knight can attack only two squares – f2 and g3 .
If you do not control or possess a fair share of the centre , then it might be difficult to maneuver pieces from one side of the board to the other side of the board .
Quick Development : The second important part of Classical Opening Principles is Quick Development .
You might know that pawns are of the lowest cadre .
The minor pieces such as bishops and knights are the next cadre .
The Queen and the rooks are the major pieces in the chessboard while the ultimate superior is the King .
According to classical principles , developing minor pieces is considered important before developing major pieces such as rooks and the queen .
It should be ensured that pawn movements are restricted to the minimum .
The knights can jump over other pieces in the board and as such , pawn movement is not necessary for developing the knights .
If you open up the pawns in front of the King and the Queen , then the two bishops are opened up , and so are the Queen and the King .
Early castling : Castling , as you all know , is one of the special moves in chess , where the king is allowed to move two squares in a single move .
In addition , two pieces are moved in a single move , the King and the Rook .
The two rooks are in the two corners .
In line with the concept of quick development , both the minor pieces such as bishops and knights can be moved out after the pawns in front of the queen and the king are opened .
Now there will be no pieces in between the King and the Rook at the kingside , while queen will be there in the queenside .
You can take up castling on the kingside , thereby opening up the rook to combine with the Queen and the other rook .
In addition , the King in the first row will be guarded by the Queen and two rooks .
Knights before Bishop : Another part of the classical opening principles is to move the knights before the bishop .
As already stated , the knights can be moved without waiting for the pawns to leave way , as they are capable of jumping over pieces lying in between the original square and the destination square of the knight .
As such , it is suggested that knights are moved into the front before opening up the bishops .
These classical opening principles , if employed effectively , can open up to fascinating contests in the middle game , as the art of defense and attack needs to be mastered to enhance the level of knowledge in the game of chess .

Introduction
Traditional cryptosystems fall into three categories : public - key systems , private - key systems where the key is shorter than the message , and one - time pad systems .
If our friends Alice and Bob wish to send encrypted messages to each other , they face a dilemma .
They like the convenience of public - key cryptosystems , but they are n't happy that these systems are breakable given enough computing time .
They might not mind meeting to exchange a short secret key , but they are afraid that someone might be able to break their system using differential cryptanalysis .
And if they use a one - time pad , they will have to meet , perhaps over and over , to exchange very long keys .
Even then they still can't be sure that on the way to the meeting , a third party has n't somehow managed to sneak a look at the key .
Unlike traditional cryptosystems , quantum cryptography offers the promise of unconditional security without face - to - face exchanges .
Rather than relying on problems believed to be computationally " difficult , " quantum cryptography uses basic physical laws to provide provable unconditional security .
And unlike the key to a one - time pad , it is impossible for anyone to eavesdrop on a quantum key exchange and copy the key without being detected .
The foundation of quantum cryptography lies in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , which states that certain pairs of physical properties are related in such a way that measuring one property prevents the observer from simultaneously knowing the value of the other .
In particular , when measuring the polarization of a photon , the choice of what direction to measure affects all subsequent measurements .
For instance , suppose you measure the polarization of a photon using a vertical filter .
Classically , you would assume that if the photon passes through , it is vertically polarized , and therefore if you placed in front of the photon another filter with some angle t to the vertical , the photon would not pass through .
However , quantum mechanics states that in fact , there is a certain probability that the photon will pass through the second filter as well , and this probability depends on the angle t.
As t increases , the probability of the photon passing through the second filter decreases until it reaches 0 at t = 90o ( i.e. the second filter is horizontal ) .
When t = 45o , the chance of the photon passing through the second filter is precisely 1/2 .
In measuring polarization of photons , we refer to a pair of orthogonal polarization states , such as horizontal / vertical , as a basis .
A pair of bases is said to be conjugate if the measurement of the polarization in the first basis completely randomizes the measurement in the second basis [ 1 ] , as in the example above with t = 45o .
Note that if someone else gives the photon an initial polarization ( either horizontal or vertical , but you do n't know which ) and you use a filter in the 45o / 135o basis to measure the photon , you cannot determine any information about the initial polarization of the photon .

Quantum Key Distribution
The first published paper to describe a cryptographic protocol using these ideas was written in 1984 by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard .
In it , Bennett and Brassard described an unconditionally secure quantum key distribution system .
Following is a description of the BB84 system [ 4 ] .
First , we equip Alice and Bob with two polarizers each , one in the 0o / 90o (+ ) basis and one in the 45o / 135o ( X ) basis 1 .
We assume a quantum channel between Alice and Bob over which Alice can send photons , and a public channel over which Alice and Bob can discuss results .
We allow the eavesdropper Eve to have unlimited computing power and access to both these channels , though she cannot alter messages on the public channel ( see below for discussion of this ) .
Now , Alice begins to send photons to Bob , each one polarized at random in one of the four directions -- 0o , 45o , 90o , or 135o .
As Bob receives each photon , he chooses one of his polarizers at random to measure it with .
Since he does not know which direction
Alice chose for her polarizer , his choice may or may not match hers .
If it does match , Bob will measure the same polarization as Alice .
But if it does n't match , Bob 's measurement will be completely random .
For instance , if Alice sends a photon | and Bob measures with + , he will correctly receive |.
But if he measures with X , he will see ( with equal probability ) either \ or / , neither of which is what Alice actually sent .
To eliminate the false measurements from the sequence , Alice and Bob begin a public discussion after the entire sequence of photons has been sent .
Bob tells
Alice which basis he used to measure each photon , and Alice tells him whether or not it was the correct one .
Neither Alice nor Bob ever announces the actual measurements , only the bases in which they were made .
They discard all data for which their polarizers did n't match , leaving ( in theory ) two perfectly matching strings .
They can then convert these into bit strings by agreeing which photon directions should be 0 and which should be 1 .
Here is an example of the protocol in use , using | = \ = 1 and - = / = 0 :
Alice sends with : + X + + X X + + X X + + X Alice sends to Bob : | / | - / \ | - \ \ - | /
Bob measures with : + X X + + X + X X + X + X Bob 's results : | / / - | \ | \ \ - \ | / Valid data : | / - \ | \ | / Translated to key : 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
So far , all we have shown is that Alice and Bob can arrive at a shared key without publicly announcing any of the bits .
But suppose
Eve tries to gain information about the key by intercepting the photons as they are transmitted from Alice to Bob , measuring their polarization , and then resending them .
What happens now ?
Since Eve , like Bob , has no idea which basis
Alice uses to transmit each photon , she too must choose bases at random for her measurements .
If she chooses the correct basis , and then sends Bob a photon matching the one she measures , all is well .
But suppose she chooses the wrong basis .
She will then see a photon in one of the two directions she is measuring , and send it to Bob .
If Bob 's basis matches Alice's , ( and thus is different from Eve's ) , he is equally likely to measure either direction for the photon .
But if Eve had not interfered , he would have been guaranteed the same measurement as Alice !
In fact , in this intercept / resend scenario , Eve will corrupt at least 25 % of the bits for which Bob 's and Alice 's bases coincide [ 1 ] .
So if Alice and Bob publicly compare and discard some of the bits in their key and find no discrepancies , they can conclude that Eve has learned little or nothing about the key .
Alternatively , Alice and Bob can agree publicly on a random subset of their bits , and compare the parities .
The parities will differ in 50 % of the cases when the bits differ , so by doing 20 parity checks , Alice and Bob can reduce the probability of an eavesdropper to less than 1 in a million .
The above discussion assumes that Eve cannot corrupt the messages on the public channel , or else she could simply impersonate each party to the other .
However , if Eve is in fact capable of more than just passive observance of the public channel , the above protocol will still work as a method of " key expansion " rather than key generation [ 1 ] .
Alice and Bob must share a small secret key to begin with which they use to implement a secure authentication scheme .
Thus they can ensure to arbitrarily high probability the validity of the public messages .
Then , using the quantum key distribution protocol , Alice and Bob can generate a much larger number of key bits for future use .

Reconciliation
In practice , there are several problems with this protocol .
The first is that real photon detectors always have some noise , so even without eavesdropping , Alice and Bob 's bits will differ .
Secondly , current technology is not good enough to reliably generate single photons .
Actual photon emitters can generate pulses of light with a given average number , m , of photons per pulse , but not necessarily exactly that number each time .
Clearly , if m is greater than 1 , then Eve will have a good chance of being able to split the pulses , observing one photon while letting the remainder continue undisturbed to Bob .
If m is significantly less than 1 , then the probability of an eavesdropper being able to split the pulse is approximately m 2/2 [ 1 ] .
Even in this case the eavesdropper will be able to learn a constant fraction of the key bits without being detected .
In 1992 , Bennett , Bessette , Brassard , Salvail , and Smolin published a paper [ 1 ] describing how to deal with these difficulties .
With this protocol , Alice and Bob first reconcile their data through public discussion , revealing to Eve no more information than she may have already discovered during the quantum transmission phase .
Then , using so - called " privacy amplification , " Alice and Bob distill from their partly private key a smaller but far more secure key .
The procedure described in [ 1 ] for Alice and Bob to reconcile their bits takes place over a public channel .
Since
Eve presumably listens to all public transmissions , Alice and Bob must reveal as little information as possible while still ensuring that they end up with identical keys .
They can do this by agreeing upon a random permutation of the bits in their strings ( to randomize the locations of errors ) , and then splitting the resulting string into blocks of size b.
The constant b is chosen so that each block is unlikely to contain more than one error .
In the BBBSS implementation , b was chosen by experiment rather than theory .
Alice and Bob then compare the parity of each block .
If they find a pair of blocks with mismatched parities , they continually bisect the block into smaller and smaller blocks , comparing parities each time , until the error is found .
To ensure that Eve learns nothing from this process , Alice and Bob discard the last bit of each block whose parity they disclose .
After completing this process once , there will still be mismatches in those blocks which happened to contain an even number of errors .
So Alice and Bob repeat the process several more times with increasing block sizes until they believe the total number of errors to be low .
At this point , the above strategy becomes inefficient because Alice and Bob must discard a bit for each block they compare , and the probability of finding an error in each block is low .
So Alice and Bob switch to a new strategy , which they again perform multiple times .
Each time , they choose a random subset of the bit positions in their complete strings , and compare parities .
The probability of disagreement if the subset strings are not identical is exactly 1 / 2 .
If a disagreement occurs , a bisective search for the error is performed , this time using random subsets rather than blocks .
The last bit of each subset is discarded .
Eventually , all the errors will have been removed , and Alice and Bob will go through enough parity checks without discovering any errors that they may assume their strings are identical .
Back to TOC
Privacy Amplification
At this point , Alice and Bob posses identical strings , but those strings are not completely private .
Eve may have gained some information about them either by beamsplitting or through intercept / resend .
Although this second strategy may cause some errors in Bob 's string , if Eve uses it on only a small number of bits , the induced errors will be lost among the errors caused by noise in the detectors and other physical problems .
During the reconciliation phase ,
Eve did not gain any information , since the last bit of each parity check set was discarded .
However , some of her original information about specific bits may have been converted to information about parity bits .
For instance , if she knew the value of a bit x in string y , and Alice and Bob revealed the parity of y and discarded x , Eve would then know the parity of the remaining bits of y .
If we say that Eve knows a parity bit about a string if she knows the parity of a non-empty subset of that string , then if Eve started out knowing at most k physical bits of the key , she will know at most k parity bits of the key after reconciliation [ 1 ] .
In any case , Alice and Bob share an n-bit string S , and we will suppose that Eve knows at most k deterministic ( i.e. parity or physical ) bits of S. Alice and Bob wish to compute an r-bit key K , where r < n , such that Eve 's expected information about K is below some specified bound .
To do so , they will choose a compression function g : { 0,1}n -> { 0,1}r and compute K = g ( S ) .
The question is , what kinds of functions are appropriate for this purpose ?
That is , which functions , when applied to S , will yield a K about which Eve knows almost nothing ?
Definition : [ 2 ]
A class G of functions A ->
B is universal 2 if for any distinct x 1 and x 2 in A , the probability that g(x 1 ) = g(x 2 ) is at most 1 / | B| when g is chosen at random from G according to the uniform distribution .
An example of a universal class is the set of permutations of A onto itself , since for any g in the set , the probability that g(x 1 ) = g(x 2 ) is zero , which is less than 1 / | A| .
It is shown in [ 2 ] that if Eve knows k deterministic bits of S , and Alice and Bob choose their compression function g at random from a universal class of hash functions { 0,1}n -> { 0,1 }r where r = n - k - s for some safety parameter 0 < s < n-k , then Eve 's expected information about K = g ( S ) is less than or equal to 2 - s / ln2 bits .
One such hash function to generate K [ 1 ] is for Alice and Bob to compute an additional r random subset parities of S , this time keeping the results secret .
The r results of the parities will be the final r-bit key .
Given this result , one might ask how Alice and Bob are to determine the value of k , i.e. how much information has been leaked to Eve .
As a conservative estimate , they can simply assume that all transmission errors were caused by eavesdropping ( although most likely some came from detection errors ) .
Eavesdropping errors could come from either intercept / resend or beamsplitting .
Alice and Bob can use the beam intensity m and the bit error rate to calculate the expected fraction of S that Eve has learned .
If they are conservative in their assumptions and add several standard deviations to their results , they will have a safe upper bound on the number of bits leaked to Eve .
( See [ 1 ] for more details . )
The above discussion assumes that Eve knows only deterministic bits , so another issue is whether it might be more useful to her to obtain probabilistic information about S instead .
In other words , rather than measuring photons in the same bases as Alice and Bob , she could pick a basis halfway in between them .
This will give her a result that matches Alice 's with probability approximately 85 % , regardless of which basis Alice uses [ 3 ] .
She will not gain any information when Bob reveals his measurement choices , so with this strategy all of her information is probabilistic rather than deterministic .
Conceivably , this probabilistic information could be more resistant to privacy amplification than deterministic information .
However , it turns out that this is not the case [ 3 ] , so if Eve wishes to optimize her expected information on the final key , she should use the same bases as Alice and Bob , obtaining only deterministic bits .

Practicality
An appropriate question to ask at this point is whether it is possible to actually implement the above quantum key distribution system .
The answer is a qualified yes .
The authors of [ 1 ] actually built the apparatus to carry out the protocol they describe , and showed that the protocol worked .
However , the quantum channel was only 32 cm long .
The problem with implementing their system over long distances is that fiber optic cables ruin the polarization of the light , so the photons need to be sent through a vacuum in a straight tube .
A 200 yard quantum channel was built in 1992 using interference rather than polarization , because interference patterns survive somewhat better in fiber optic cables [ 10 ] .
In 1993 , the interference technique was used to build a 10 km long quantum channel [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
Nevertheless , there is still one major problem with extending quantum channels to longer distances .
Messages passed along commercial fiber optic cables weaken after some distance and must periodically go through " booster " stations to amplify the signals , but quantum signals cannot be amplified without ruining them in the same way that eavesdropping ruins them .
In the time since the first quantum key distribution protocol was proposed , however , other quantum cryptographic protocols have been developed which make more sense over short distances .
In particular , quantum protocols for oblivious transfer [ 3 ] and bit commitment [ 6 ] have been proposed which use the same techniques of transmission , reconciliation , and privacy amplification .
Oblivious transfer and bit commitment are used in zero - knowledge proofs and other situations with two cooperating but mutually distrustful parties .
Such situations can arise even in face - to - face negotiations , where a tabletop quantum device could be useful .
Other researchers in quantum cryptography have explored different ways to implement the established protocols .
One alternative implementation [ 10 ] , [ 7 ] involves using so - called " entangled pairs , " which are pairs of photons generated by certain particle reactions .
Each pair contains two photons of opposite polarization .
In this system , the pairs are emitted at some point between Alice and Bob , who each measure the photons with randomly selected bases .
They then compare which bases they used , and keep as their key only those photons which they have measured with the same basis .
If Eve tries to read one of the photons before it gets to Alice or Bob , but uses a different basis than they do , they will no longer always measure opposite polarization .
Again , by comparing a few bits , they can determine if eavesdropping has occurred .
The theoretical advantage of this system over the BB84 protocol is that with BB84 , Alice and Bob must store the key in their computers ( or some other non-quantum device ) after they have agreed upon it , and Eve could possibly break in and look at the key without detection .
But entangled pairs of photons could theoretically be stored indefinitely without ever being observed .
Alice and Bob would measure them only when they actually needed to use the key .
If Eve ever looked at them , Alice and Bob would know .
Of course , current technology does not allow us to store photons for any reasonable length of time , so right now this approach is no better than BB84 .
So although quantum cryptography is not very practical right now , it is still worthy of study for several reasons .
Unlike public - key cryptosystems , its security is provable and will not be compromised no matter how fast computers get , or even if P = NP .
Currently it works only over short distances , but there are situations in which even short - distance transmission is useful .
Also , with sufficient technical improvements , it might be possible in the future to implement quantum cryptography over long distances , so that private - key systems would no longer require face - to - face meetings .
And finally , the concept of privacy amplification by public discussion , which was originally developed for use in quantum cryptography , can be extended to any situation in which Eve has partial knowledge of a string shared by Alice and Bob .
In general , the differences between quantum cryptography and other cryptographic techniques are enough to encourage researchers to explore ideas that otherwise might not have arisen .

Violence broke out in Leigh where a BNP event was being held
A British National Party ( BNP ) member was attacked with a hammer when protesters arrived at a campaign event in Greater Manchester .
Violence broke out as 30 people surrounded a BNP vehicle outside the Ellesmere Pub in St Helens Road in Leigh on Friday evening , said police .
Tony Ward , 48 , was hit with a hammer and later treated in hospital .
A 25 - year - old man arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm has since been given police bail .
Officers arrived at the pub to discover the BNP 's trailer had been overturned , said a police spokesman .
A traffic diversion was put in place on St Helen 's Road , while the trailer was removed and the road was closed .
It has since reopened .
One witness told BBC News : " They had hammers and they smacked the vehicle to pieces , smashed all the windows and tore off the bumper , completely decimated it .
" I was shocked at what I saw . "
A BNP fundraising event had been due to take place at Pure nightclub in Leigh , but it was cancelled at the last minute .
Simon Darby , the party 's deputy leader said : " This was a violent attack by a group of thugs in which one of our members was badly injured .
" But we will not be put off . "
The BNP 's Nick Griffin has been in the area to host the event , said Mr Darby .

Photographers and packing for travelling has long since been a love - hate relationship .
Some photographers find packing to be an irritating necessary evil while others find it fun and challenging .
Personally I find packing to similar to playing a game of Tetris .
Every trip is different ; each journey has its own needs and wants .
First and foremost , ahead of everything else , is the safety of my equipment as I pack my equipment properly .
For me , I can get on a plane with a Mountainsmith Borealis AT backpack and a camera on each shoulder to fly halfway around the world with nothing else ; or I can pack a fully loaded Mountainsmith Parallax with two bodies , 8 lenses , and macro tubes .
ETTL cords along with a fully loaded LowePro Pro Roller II case loaded with a mobile location lighting kit to fly just a few hundred miles away for the afternoon .
Whether I am travelling light or travelling heavy the fundamentals are the same .
As this is the first installment of Flying With Fish on PhotographyBLOG.com
I 'd like to start with the basics of packing .
I can write about packing equipment all day and all night , but one issue comes before all others for me , how to protect your cameras and lenses from impact damage while travelling .
For some reason photographers like to pack their lenses for travelling attached to their camera bodies .
For some even stranger reason photographers seem to pack their longer , heavier , lenses attached to their camera bodies .
Why do photographers pack this way ?
I have no idea .
When you pack your equipment you should think of Sir Isaac Newton and his theory that an object in motion will remain in motion until something stops the motion .
Another way to look at this is that that a force of impact on your camera will need to dissipate that force .
Newton ’s theory looks something like this :
So what does this mean for photographers when they pack their 70 - 200 f2.8 attached to their Nikon D700 body ?
It means that if your bag should sustain an impact the force through your camera , or through your lens , will transfer from one object to the next , often damaging the weakest link .
What is usually the weakest link between a camera and a lens ?
The mount !
If your bag is dropped , knocked , hit , or otherwise ‘ whacked ’ your camera body can be spun one way while your lens is spun another way .
The result of this impact is you torquing the two mounts significantly damaging both your camera and your lens .
If you pack your body and your lens separately the twisting motion of the camera body and the lens are only felt by the body and the lens individually .
The impact dissipates into the padding of the bag .
Since neither your camera body nor your lens is attached to the bag there is no damage to either the camera or the lens .
I have heard many photographers say , “ If my camera is attached to my lens then I can act faster to capture the photo . ”
I have news for you , if you need to put your backpack down , open the flap and remove your camera and lens kit … ……. you ’ve already ‘ missed the moment . ’
I have spent years covering news and fast paced situations and I can’t think of a single moment where I thought , “ if only my camera and lens were attached in the backpack I am wearing on my back I might have captured that image . ”
Fleeting moments happen non-stop .
You ’ll see photos all day long if you ’re looking , and if that is your intention you need to travel with your cameras out , on your shoulders , ready to shoot .
When you pack your equipment you need to pack it securely .
Pack your gear relatively snug so it does not bounce .
You need to maximize your space in small area of a bag , backpack or rolling case .
Not only does traveling with your lens attached to your camera significantly increase the chances of damaging your camera equipment while traveling , but it also decreases your packing flexibility .
When you pack your camera body and your lenses detached from each other you increase the space in your bag to pack more effectively .
By having each item separate you are no longer packing ‘ around a camera - lens combo , ’ you are free to stand lenses up , stack lenses , lay lenses down , adjust the location of our camera body within the bag .
All of these elements make for a safer and more practical way to pack your equipment .
… and besides , Murphy ’s Law dictates that whatever lens you have attached to your camera will be the wrong lens for the moment .
In future columns for PhotographyBLOG.com
I will address a wide range of packing issues for photographers , as well as equipment , logistics and pretty much any other topic that comes to mind .

The crazed doom - and - gloom prophets of our world have this troubling ability to occupy the airwaves , becoming strangely confused with qualified experts .
Gerald Celente is the latest soothsayer operating on his hunches — now being celebrated on Digg , Reddit , and just about every damn aggregator imaginable .
His predictions sound suspiciously similar to the storyline for Brian Francis Slattery ’s excellent new novel , Liberation , but Gerald Celente , the CEO of Trends Research Institute , is determined to deliver .
By 2012 , Celente forecasts revolution in America , food riots , and tax rebellions .
In four years , America will become an undeveloped nation .
Holidays will be about food rather than gifts .
Mass hysteria , dogs and cats living together .
Doom and gloom .
The media — or , rather , FOX News and conservative websites — is listening to Celente because he “ predicted ” the 1997 currency crisis in Asia , the subprime mortgage disaster , and the dollar dipping south .
But Infowars , a website run by paleoconservative radio show host Alex Jones , is basking in this dystopic news like an AIG executive riding high on Uncle Sam ’s dime .
What ’s particularly strange is that Infowars has n’t bothered to quibble with Celente ’s statements , much less point to any of his inaccurate predictions .
How does Celente do it ?
From Invest in Yourself by Mark Eisenson , Gerri Detweiler , and Nancy Castleman :
According to Gerald Celente , Director of the Trends Research Institute and author of Trends 2000 , the key to tracking trends is to read two newspapers every day with a purpose — either The Wall Street Journal or The Financial Times , plus The New York Times or USA Today .
Look for stories with social , economic , and political significance , be it about the difficulties older suburbs face or the current currency crisis .
( You ’ll know by the headline or the first paragraph . )
Skip the stories that are purely human interest or that are about something that has n’t happened yet ( for example , a jury resuming deliberation on a sensational trial ) .
When a crisis does occur , tune in to the extra in - depth analyses that you ’ll find in accompanying background pieces probably in more than one of the newspapers .
Read them as though you ’re a “ political atheist , ” Celente recommends — not for what you want or hope , but for what is really going on , not only in your own profession or industry , but for trends that may directly or indirectly shape the future .
Aside from the Dale Carnegie - style language here , much of Celente ’s “ suggestions ” seem more like a series of guidelines on how to become a successful “ futurist ” predicting a good deal of generalist nonsense that scares the shit out of people , using language lifted from a newspaper story ’s barebones and riding on a few hunches .
Of course , it also helps to have an aesthetic touch — something along the lines of a desktop covered with 12 globes , just so you can impress a New York Times reporter who comes by to write a small profile .
Since Infowars could not be bothered to perform even the most rudimentary act of journalism , the time has come to see if Celente ’s record truly cuts the mustard .
In May 1993 , in a story about fiftysomethings losing their jobs written for the Orange County Register , Celente was quoted .
He was advising IBM at the time during a period of downsizing .
What was Celente ’s golden advice ?
He informed displaced executives to “ go for some kind of counseling . ”
Asked to comment on this situation , Celente offered the same doom and gloom boilerplate that he ’s telling us today : “ The Industrial Age is ending .
All the systems are breaking down and that means disappointment and disillusionment for the people who grew up in the ’ 50’s . ”
He elaborated , “ These people believed in the Ozzie and Harriet way of life .
That concept is dead .
So is the concept of retiring at 65 . ”
These were hardly prescient or specific thoughts , but they were certainly dramatic enough to make it into an Orange County newspaper .

These were hardly prescient or specific thoughts , but they were certainly dramatic enough to make it into an Orange County newspaper .
Why not get topical ?
Let ’s take Celente on a more specialized subject like restaurants .
In 1993 , Celente predicted “ growing demands for take - out food , high - and low - end restaurants , and restaurants that offer live entertainment .
Middle - range restaurants with mainstream fare will suffer . ”
Aside from the fact that Celente ’s prediction accounts for about 90 % of restaurants , does n’t the fact that human beings need to eat remain a comfy ledge to launch a prediction ?
In 1998 , Celente told Money Magazine that , as the population grows older , “ Americans will be spending more time at home than ever before both for pleasure and business . ”
Imagine that .
You grow old , retire , and then you suddenly have more time .
How the hell did Celente know ?

In the September 21 , 2000 edition of Newsweek , the great futurist weighed in on mindless chores .
Why are they called mindless ?
“ Your mind ca n’t be going all the time . ”
And when any problem becomes bigger , it becomes bigger than burnout .
“ It ’s road rage , it ’s air rage , it ’s Columbine , it ’s stress — and people do n’t get it . ”
I ’m wondering if it ’s also the kind of impulse that will cause you to make impetuous predictions about the United States ’s future .

I ’m wondering if it ’s also the kind of impulse that will cause you to make impetuous predictions about the United States ’s future .
Asked by CBS News in May 2005 to comment upon where Dillard ’s planned to go , Celente had this to say : “ There is nothing Dillard ’s has that you ca n’t find in 1,000 other places .
America is vastly overstored . ”
Take out “ Dillard ’s ” and sub it in with another department store chain name , and you begin to see what little Celente ’s remarks say .
But if we ’re in for a future of doom and gloom , Celente has been sending us some mixed messages .
He told the Associated Press in May 2005 , “ The bottom of the luxury market is not going to fall out . ”
Talking with the Associated Press in September 2005 , Celente suggested that Wal - Mart could deflect its negative image with its philanthropy .
That ’s hardly a stunning insight .
Any positive action has the probability of causing a company to look good .
This is rudimentary probability .
But what profound thoughts did our great seer tell the AP ?
“ We try to refrain from making value judgments — what the motive is .
But the fact is that [ Wal - Mart was ] there with trailer trucks being turned away .
Amazing , is n’t it ? ” Amazing indeed .
Presumably , the AP reporter who talked with Celente did so because the reporter needed somebody to describe the situation as “ amazing ” or “ magnificent . ”
Some casual modifier that might be confused for profound thought .
Celente was asked to weigh in on Internet trends by the San Francisco Chronicle ‘s Patricia Yollin in December 2006 .
“ People are more electronically connected and less humanly connected , ” opined our great psychic .
And if that general piece of advice was n’t enough , Celente also took the time to badmouth public displays of affection , pointing out how unacceptable it was to put PDA in “ techno jargon . ”
Perhaps Celente confused PDA with another type of PDA , but what he did n’t seem to tell the reporter was that acronyms have existed long before the Internet .
Here you have a history of a man who not only makes his living spouting this generalist nonsense at corporations , but who is listened to by the media .
If we were n’t all scared shitless , this wingnut would be chased out of boardrooms and newsrooms with pitchforks .
But who needs rational thinking when you have the comforts of defeatism ?
If you really want to get your dose of passive - aggressive dystopia , just call up Gerald Celente .
He ’s on Line 2 and he ’ll take your money when you have no faith in humanity or when you do n’t have a clue about how to do your job .
Have him rant in your newspaper .
Give him money to advise your corporation .
Above all , do n’t look at history , science , or specific statistics .
Because Celente will boil them all down for you with one of his seemingly pithy and mysterious predictions .
And he ’ll be right .
Because like a trusted astrology columnist or a two - bit faith healer , Celente leaves just enough room in his answer to wiggle out .
And you swallow it every time .
Because you ’re too scared to think for yourself , or do a background check on the guy in the lobby waving his arms .

A three - part screencast providing a quick tour of some of the facilities available when editing Haskell code , using Vim ( a lot of this is based on simply instantiating Vim's generalized program editing support for Haskell ) , haskellmode for Vim , and possibly other Vim plugins .
Part I demonstrates some basics of program editing ( leaving out Vim's general text editing support ) : syntax colouring , text folds , navigating to imported modules , generating tags file , jump to definition , open definition in split window , display lines containing keywords , haskellmode help , display / add type information , show : info , and , of course , quickfix mode :
Part II moves on to Haddock documentation lookup ( identifier docs , module docs , library overview ) , GHC documentation lookup ( users guide , flag reference ) , adding ( qualified ) imports , adding module qualifiers , making imports explicit , adding LANGUAGE or OPTIONS_GHC pragmas :
Part III concludes with some of the obligatory insert mode completions ( by haddocks , by imports , by text ) , GHCi expression evaluation , then hints at other capabilities , such as surround.vim for managing all kinds of parens , align.vim for alignment , or vimdiff for comparing file versions :
As the 100 - day honeymoon period for the new administration comes to an end , President Obama appears content to emulate his predecessor on matters of secrecy , on the legal treatment of detainees , and on unflappable optimism that escalation is going to ultimately win its wars , Congressional Democrats are expressing growing discontent with his hawkish stances .
The House passed its $ 96.7 billion war spending bill today by a wide margin , but a lot of that support , particularly on the President ’s own side of the aisle , was decidedly tepid .
Rep. David Obey ( D – WI ) voted for the measure , but said that “ with respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan , I am extremely dubious that the administration will be able to accomplish what it wants to accomplish . ”
Obey added that he was following the same approach he did with President Nixon in 1969 , and that if Obama has not altered the policy by the end of the year , he would begin to oppose the war .
Of the 60 votes against the war funding bill , 51 were Democrats .
The concerns over the open - ended war in Afghanistan seem to be growing , and few seem to believe in the administration ’s “ new ” war plan in the nation .
While so far it does n’t appear to be translating into a significant threat to vote down the administration ’s war funding bills , Rep. Murtha predicts that could change rapidly , and that opposition may intensify in the next few weeks as next year ’s defense spending bill moves forward .
Right now , Murtha says , “ the public is not focused on the war at all . ”
That could change rapidly if the Afghan war continues to sour , which every high ranking military official seems to treat as a virtual inevitability .

Disinfo operative Glenn Beck ’s shabby and comical attempt to “ debunk ” FEMA camps was theater of the absurd at its most revealing .
Recall Beck a few weeks ago trying to bait us with a promise to investigate the camps .
He came off as alarmed over the prospect of internment camps and this set the hook .
Stay tuned , folks , he teased , we ’ll get to the bottom of this .
Beck and Meigs Part 1
Glenn Beck , the seasoned operative , never intended a serious exposé .
He planned to make those of us who know FEMA camps exist look like fools and churls .
In order to do this he enlisted the retread James Meigs , editor - in - chief of the washed - up Hearst publication , Popular Mechanics .
Back in 2005 , Meigs spearheaded an effort to debunk the 9/11 truth movement with a Popular Mechanic cover story .
Meigs and his crew of supposed debunkers approached the science of 9/11 very selectively and were more interested in ad hominem attacks leveled against researchers .
Meigs concluded his diatribe by stating that “ those who peddle fantasies that this country encouraged , permitted or actually carried out the attacks are libeling the truth — and disgracing the memories of the thousands who died that day . ”
Meigs turned his “ fact checking ” ( through omission ) into a book — Debunking 9/11 Myths : Why Conspiracy Theories Ca n’t Stand Up to the Facts .
It was published by Hearst , the media corporation famous for its association with the expression “ yellow journalism . ”
Hearst told the illustrationist Frederic Remington during the Spanish - American War : “ You furnish the pictures and I ’ll furnish the war . ”
Nothing much as changed since 1895 .
In the video here , Beck says Meigs heads up the “ independent group ” he assigned the task of debunking the conspiracy nuts who believe in the existence of FEMA camps .
As evidence the nutters are way out in left field , Meigs dissects a widely discredited video of a Beech Grove , Indiana , Amtrak facility filmed by the Indianapolis attorney Linda Thompson .
Beck and Meigs Part 2
You may recall Thompson ’s earlier video about the government siege and subsequent incineration of the Branch Davidians in Waco , Texas .
She made a series of absurd claims about the siege , for instance insisting the BATF and FBI used flame throwers mounted on tanks against the Davidians .
It did n’t take long for Soldier of Fortune Magazine to discredit Thompson ’s accusations .
She mysteriously vanished into the ether after people began asking if she might be a government operative .
Meigs and Beck say nothing about this .
“ This footage , which appears in multiple videos on YouTube , is from a ‘ documentary ’ filmed 15 years ago , ” explains Beck ’s Fox News web page .
“ Yet today , it ’s been viewed nearly 1.5 million times online .
The woman who made the video , Linda Thompson , was one of the pioneers of the militia movement in the United States — except she was so extreme , she embarrassed even her fellow militants .
Far from a death camp , Beech Grove is the primary maintenance facility for Amtrak ’s long - distance trains , overhauling and repairing approximately 700 passenger cars a year .
Company officials , who ’ve heard these theories for years , welcomed our film crew , and the superintendent of the facility showed us anything we wanted to see . ”
Beck does not bother to mention the fact serious FEMA camp researchers discarded the video years ago .
Meigs and Beck are more interested in linking the video to Thompson and the “ militia movement ” ( created as a scary bogeyman by the corporate media in the 1990s ) and connecting that up with the ugly specter of the Timothy McVeigh — the same McVeigh photographed at Camp Grafton , North Dakota ( the base specializes in demolitions training ) in 1993 , a mere 18 months before the Oklahoma City bombing .
The FBI insisted he was not in the military at the time .
In the second installment of this “ definitive debunking , ” Beck and his sidekick Meigs show us a satellite photo of a real concentration camp the conspiracy theorists supposedly claim is a FEMA camp .
As Alex Jones called it when the photo was used as a teaser at the close of the first installment the previous evening , the camp is located in North Korea ( because only communists operate concentration camps , never mind the forcible relocation and internment of approximately 110,000 Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans by Roosevelt during World War 2 , a criminal act lavishly defended by the neocon darling Michelle Malkin , a regular on Fox News ) .
After “ debunking ” Camp Grayling , Michigan , where there is a mock camp complete with barbed wire and watch towers for National Guard training , Beck and Meigs begin talking about how the conspiracy theorists are out of touch with reality and refuse to accept the obvious truth there are no camps and our loving government would never do such a thing , not like the evil communists in North Korea ( or the evil mullahs in Iran , although our intrepid investigators do not mention the latter ) .
As expected , Beck ’s long awaited “ debunking ” does not bother to cover more substantial territory and instead relies on old discredited video footage and photos that look good on television .
Beck and his protégé completely ignore solid and irrefutable evidence that does not look good on television and might prompt bored viewers to switch over to the Comedy Channel or actually turn off the idiot tube and read a book .
No mention of the contract awarded in January of 2006 to Kellogg , Brown and Root , a subsidiary of Halliburton , to build “ temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing ICE ( Immigration Customs Enforcement ) Detention and Removal Operations ( DRO ) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs , ” ( emphasis added ) according to Fox News .
Col . Oliver North questioned about Rex - 84 by Rep. Jack Brooks
It was said Rex - 84 , short for Readiness Exercise 1984 , was also about rounding up and detaining illegal immigrants .
“ The Rex 84 Program was originally established on the reasoning that if a ‘ mass exodus ’ of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican / US border , they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA , ” notes Allen L Roland .
In fact , Rex - 84 Alpha Explan ( as it was also known ) was cooked up by FEMA and 34 other federal civil departments and agencies ( with a few NATO nations to boot ) for the express purpose of detaining large numbers of American citizens .
“ The exercise anticipated civil disturbances , major demonstrations and strikes that would affect continuity of government and / or resource mobilization .
To fight subversive activities , there was authorization for the military to implement government ordered movements of civilian populations at state and regional levels , the arrest of certain unidentified segments of the population , and the imposition of martial law , ” Diana Reynolds writes ( The Rise of the National Security State : FEMA and the NSC ) .
No mention of master military contingency plan Operation Garden Plot developed in response to the civil disorders of the 1960s and still operational under the control of the U.S. Northern Command .
Garden plot was last activated ( as Noble Eagle ) to provide military assistance to civil authorities following September 11 , 2001 .
The Pentagon also activated it to restore order during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots .
Operation Garden Plot is “ the program to control the population . ”
[ efoods ] Rex 84 , Operation Garden Plot and its sister program Operation Cable Splicer were not enough for the control freaks in government , so in May , 2007 , George Bush signed executive new orders NSDP51 ( also known as PDD 51 ) and HSDP20 to replace Rex 84 .
Bush ’s orders established that the executive would take over all state and local governments during a national state of emergency .
More recently the National Emergency Centers Act or HR 645 was introduced in Congress .
It mandates the establishment of “ national emergency centers ” to be located on military installations for the purpose of to providing “ temporary housing , medical , and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster , ” according to the bill ( see Paul Joseph Watson : New Legislation Authorizes FEMA Camps In U.S. ) .
“ Ominously , the bill also states that the camps can be used to ‘ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security , ’ an open ended mandate which many fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic collapse , ” writes Watson .
None of this was mentioned by Beck or Meigs .
Or did they mention the long list of executive orders establishing draconian mechanisms for martial law and detention and work camps , all in violation of Article 4 Section 4 of the United States Constitution ( see Establishing martial law in the United States ) .
Finally , Beck and Meigs do n’t want you to know about and would certainly never cover the U.S. Army ’s “ Civilian Inmate Labor Program ” under Army Regulation 210–35 .
Maybe in the future Glenn Beck will commission another investigation into the existence of not only FEMA camps but the plans formulated by government to impose martial law in the United States .
I ’m not going to hold my breath in the meantime .

Die für den 5 . Juni in Karlsruhe geplante Intel Fridy Night der " Bundesliga für Computerspiele " wird nicht stattfinden .
In einer Mitteilung des Veranstalters Turtle Entertainment heißt es , er habe sich mit Oberbürgermeister Heinz Fenrich ( CDU ) , der sich für den Wettbewerb eingesetzt hatte , " darauf verständigt , von unserem Vertragsrecht Abstand zu nehmen und die Veranstaltung abzusagen " .
Damit kommt Turtle Entertainment einem möglichen Beschluss einer für heute Nachmittag angesetzten Sondersitzung des Gemeinderats zuvor .
Auf dieser wollte die Karlsruher CDU ein Verbot des Computerspiele - Wettbewerbs fordern .
" Wir haben den Eindruck , im Karlsruher Kommunalwahlkampf instrumentalisiert zu werden " , teilen die Veranstalter mit .
Jeder konstruktiven Diskussion über den Umgang mit Computerspielen und neuen Medien werde die Grundlage entzogen , wenn von demokratischen Parteien öffentlich die Kündigung rechtsgültiger Verträge angeregt wird .
Die CDU wollte auf der Gemeinderatssitzung erreichen , dass die Karlruher Messe - und Kongress - GmbH ihren Mietvertrag mit Turtle Entertainment für die Schwarzwaldhalle kündigt .
Dort sollte die Veranstaltung als Ersatz für Stuttgart stattfinden , wo die Intel Friday Night kurz nach dem Amoklauf von Winnenden abgesagt wurde .
Auch in Nürnberg wurde der Wettbewerb abgesagt , hierfür springt am 29 .
Mai Hannover ein .
" In der technologiefreundlichen Stadt Karlsruhe , in welcher auch das Bundesverfassungsgericht seinen Sitz hat , hätten wir einen solchen Umgang nicht erwartet " , sagt Turtle - Entertainment - Geschäftsführer Ralf Reichert .
Die große Distanz zur Jugend und zu den neuen Medien lege einen schweren Generationskonflikt offen .
Der Veranstalter verwahrt sich gegen die Behauptung von Gegnern des Wettbewerbs , dort sei der Jugendschutz nicht gewährleistet .
Ein zusammen mit der Intel Friday Night geplantes , unter anderem von der Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung betreutes " Eltern - LAN " wird ebenso nicht in Karlsruhe stattfinden .

( CNN ) --
A potentially deadly new strain of the swine flu virus cropped up in more places in the United States and Mexico on Saturday , in what the World Health Organization called " a public health emergency of international concern . "
Women wearing masks wait at a health clinic Saturday in Mexico City .
The most recent reports Saturday afternoon were of two confirmed cases of the virus in Kansas -- bringing the number of confirmed U.S. cases to 11 .
Those joined nine confirmed cases in Texas and California and an apparent outbreak at a private school in New York City , where officials say eight children likely have the virus .
By Saturday night , health officials in Mexico said 81 deaths there were " likely linked " to the swine flu .
Dr. Jose A. Cordova Villalobos , Mexico's Secretary of Health , said viral testing has confirmed 20 cases of swine flu across the country .
President Felipe Calderon on Saturday issued an executive decree detailing emergency powers of the Ministry of Health , according to the president 's office .
The order gives the ministry with the authority to isolate sick patients , inspect travelers ' luggage and their vehicles and conduct house inspections , the statement said .
The government also has the authority to prevent public gatherings , shut down public venues and regulate air , sea and overland travel .
The WHO 's Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains .
" Any time that there is a virus which changes ... it means perhaps the immunities the human body has built up to dealing with influenza might not be adjusted well enough to dealing with this new virus , " Hartl told CNN .
In Mexico , otherwise young and healthy people have been hit by the virus -- " one of the pieces of the puzzle that is worrying us , " he said .
Mexico City has closed all of its schools and universities because of the virus , and the country 's National Health Council said all Saturday 's soccer games would be played without public audiences .

WHO has sent experts to Mexico at the request of the country 's government , Chan said .
All of the U.S. patients have recovered or are expected to .
Two of the border cases were in Texas , near San Antonio , and seven of the cases were in southern California , the CDC said .
Watch for more on the U.S. cases »
More than 1,300 people with flu - like symptoms have been admitted to hospitals in Mexico , and officials are trying to determine how many of those patients have swine flu , the country 's health minister , Cordova said .
U.S. health officials said Friday that some cases of the virus matched samples of the deadly Mexican virus .
On Saturday , New York 's Bureau of Communicable Diseases said preliminary tests from a Queens school suggest that eight out of the nine children tested probably have the swine flu virus .
Dr. Don Weiss said up to 200 students at the school reported feeling ill .
He said the samples will be sent to the CDC in Atlanta , Georgia , to determine the subtype of the strain .
The results could be known as early as Sunday .
" What 's concerning about this is , first , that it 's likely swine flu ; second is that at this time it is spreading from person to person , " said New York City health Commissioner Thomas Frieden .

When the flu spreads person to person , instead of from animals to humans , it can continue to mutate , making it a tougher strain that is harder to treat or fight off .

The infected people in Kansas are a man who had recently traveled to Mexico and his wife , officials said .
Neither of them was hospitalized , said Dr. Jason Eberhart - Phillips , director of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment .

A frog , Litoria sp. , believed to be new to science , and which uses a loud ringing song to call for a mate , was discovered in a rainforest during a Conservation International ( CI ) led Rapid Assessment Program ( RAP ) expedition of Papua New Guinea 's highlands wilderness in 2008 .
A tiny chirping frog , a striped gecko and dozens of species of jumping spiders — all thought to be new to science — have been found in one of the largest undeveloped areas of Papua New Guinea , scientists announced today .
The discoveries were made during a month - long exploration of the Pacific nation 's central mountains by scientists with Conservation International ( CI ) in July and August 2008 .
More than 600 species were documented during the expedition .
Of those , 50 spider species , two plants , three frogs and the gecko are thought to be new to science .
The three frogs include a tiny brown frog with a sharp chirping call ( Oreophryne sp. ) , a bright green tree frog with enormous eyes ( Nyctimystes sp. ) , and a torrent - dwelling frog that has a loud ringing call ( Litoria sp . ) .
The gecko ( Cyrtodactylus sp. ) was the only specimen of its kind found in the dense rainforest .
The discovery of three entirely novel genera from among the spider species discovered is particularly noteworthy , said expedition scientist Wayne Maddison of the University of British Columbia .
They shed light on a branch of the evolutionary tree previously thought to be sparse .
" They are strikingly distinctive evolutionary lineages that had been unknown before , with a group that is already very distinctive on the evolutionary tree of jumping spiders , " said Maddison .
" Their key position on the evolutionary tree will help us understand how this unique group of jumping spiders has evolved . "
Jumping spiders are found in every part of the world except Antarctica .
Capable of jumping 30 times their body length , some of the 5,000 documented species are common in households .
They come in many shapes and sizes , some resembling ants or beetles .
Two of the jumping spiders ' eight eyes have evolved to be large with high - resolution vision to spot prey .
Female jumping spiders also use this heightened visual sense to watch males , who show off their colorful bodies during courtship dances .
Maddison said the smaller animals — like insects and spiders — and plants may hold the secret to many of the world 's unknown chemicals .
" Spider venom has evolved for millions of years to affect the neurological systems of the spider 's insect prey , and each species of spider gives us another opportunity to find medically useful chemicals , " says Maddison .
" Jumping spiders with their remarkably miniaturized yet acute eyes could help us understand how to push the limits of vision .
In addition to filling in the gaps in our planet 's natural history , exploring spider biodiversity and evolution could potentially inform fields as diverse as medicine and robotics . "
CI plans three more expeditions to the country in 2009 , with the first beginning in early April .
The expedition was funded by Porgera Joint Venture , principally owned by Barrick Gold Corporation .
Most cultures bury their dead , but here , we lavish them with hordes of backup dancers , expensive stylists and the best Swedish pop hits money can buy just to prop them up on a stage and watch them entertain us .
So it goes with Britney Spears , who , despite all outward signs of being unable to count to 11 , much less headline a big - budget revue , has been getting dragged around the country for the past two months to promote her sixth album , " Circus . "
Then again , whoever is in charge of Spears ' affairs these days has gone to great lengths to make sure people actually pay very little attention to Spears .
At her sold - out concert at Oakland 's Oracle Arena on Wednesday , the beleaguered 27 - year - old tabloid pet was the least interesting part of the show - a wobbly figure making very little effort to lip-sync along to the mediocre songs from her most recent releases while all around her acrobats , clowns , contortionists and magicians offered a dramatic re-enactment of a real big - top spectacular .
Spears never fully recovered from the upheavals that sidelined her career a few years ago - from stealing backup dancer Kevin Federline from his then - pregnant wife and shedding tears on cue for Matt Lauer , to her pantyless late - night Hollywood excursions , head shaving , the use of one of her kids as a steering wheel , and on and on .
She may have made a decent album , but on Wednesday , it was hard not to look past the gleaming blond extensions and meticulous dance routines to see the same broken , bald - headed girl that just two years ago was smashing car windows with an umbrella .
Part of the reason people shelled out the big bucks for the concert probably had to do with wanting something to go wrong , like in Vancouver , where Spears inexplicably walked off the stage after only three songs , or in San Jose , where the star welcomed the audience with , " What 's up , Sacramento ? "
But Spears notwithstanding , the tour itself is almost flawless , with a great sound system and dazzling video effects .
The set list , however , which leaned heavily on tracks from " Circus " and its predecessor , " Blackout , " offered just a few musical highlights , such as latter - day hits " If U Seek Amy , " " Womanizer " and " Toxic . "
The only glance back at Spears ' glory years was served up in a remixed version of her first hit , " ... Baby One More Time . "
Even that was a extravagance , considering that during the 90 - minute set , Spears spent nearly as much time off the stage as she did on it , letting the circus acts carry most of the show .
The capacity crowd - the female to male ratio was roughly 100 to one - did n't seem to care , cheering wilding every time a backup dancer did a flip or a metal shop worker made sparks fly - do n't ask .
They even applauded the awkward mid-concert advertisement for a mobile phone carrier .
So there 's the upside .
While Spears may have lost her children , sanity and personal freedom - her father , Jamie Spears , was granted legal conservatorship over her last year - she still has a thriving career .
But as much as you want to join the masses and root her on for the bad lip - synching , it 's hard to put aside the feeling that Spears should n't be paraded around like this just to make everyone involved a tidy profit , that maybe she would be better off at home with her two boys , eating a bowl of cereal and watching " The Princess Diaries . "
Chrysler will not pay the $ 7 + billion it owes to taxpayers :
Chrysler LLC will not repay U.S. taxpayers more than $ 7 billion in bailout money it received earlier this year and as part of its bankruptcy filing .
This revelation was buried within Chrysler ’s bankruptcy filings last week and confirmed by the Obama administration Tuesday .
The filings included a list of business assumptions from one of the company ’s key financial advisors in the bankruptcy case .
Some of the main assumptions listed by Robert Manzo of Capstone Advisory Group were that the Treasury would forgive a $ 4 billion bridge loan given to Chrysler in the closing days of the Bush administration , a $ 300 million fee on that loan , and the $ 3.2 billion in financing approved last week by the Obama administration to fund Chrysler ’s operations during bankruptcy .
An Obama administration official confirmed Tuesday that Chrysler wo n’t be repaying the loans , though a portion of the bridge loan may be recovered by Treasury from the assets of Chrysler Financial , the former credit arm of the automaker which is essentially going out of business as part of the reorganization .
The Irish artist Conor Casby caused a bit of a stir recently by surreptitiously hanging unflattering likenesses of the Irish Prime Minister , Brian Cowen , in a couple of Dublin galleries .
The Taoiseach himself remarked " that 's not funny " when shown them .
One artwork has the leader of the Irish nation holding a pair of veteran underpants ; the other features him with pendulous man-boobs .
Not funny then , and not pretty , but as good a description as any of the Irish economy right now .
The mighty of the G20 meeting in London are unlikely to give much thought to Mr Cowen and his artistic and economic challenges .
Yet , in its own small way , Ireland and the other economic sick men of Europe could presage the most violent international currency crisis in decades ; the break - up of the euro .
Alarmist ?
Certainly .
Impossible ?
Certainly not .
On Tuesday , the Standard and Poor 's ratings agency downgraded Ireland 's debt from its prime AAA rating to a AA + , with a " negative " outlook .
It was expected , but no less disquieting for that .
Ireland 's budget deficit will approach 11 per cent of GDP next year ; as bad as the UK .
However , Britain 's deficit is essentially a matter of private grief .
Ireland 's deficit , like those of Spain , Greece , Italy , Portugal and other fiscally incontinent states , is not .
For they all have to share a financial bed – the euro – with the fastidious Germans .
And the Germans may soon get a little impatient at the financial mess being created all around them .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ireland joins Spain , Greece and Portugal , the other bad boys of the eurozone , in having her sovereign debt downgraded .
Italy tumbled a while back .
More may follow .
The markets are already demanding " risk premia " – much higher interest on euro debt issued by the Greek and these other sub - prime governments compared to that issued by German government securities , the relatively safe Bunds .
So what ?
Well , simply that it makes no sense in a single - currency zone if one nation – or a group for that matter – just do their own thing on the public finances , endangering the credibility of the whole scheme and leaving the fiscally responsible , principally Germany , to pick up the pieces , and the bills .
Now , to be sure , the Germans are ideologically , almost mystically , committed to the euro in a way that few in these islands can properly comprehend .
Since Helmut Kohl , at least , it has been an unwritten article of German nationhood to anchor the federal republic in the European project , the single currency being the proud symbol and instrument of that .
But , even in the Kohl era , there were limits to that ambition .
Hence the strictures on budget deficits and national debt in the Maastricht Treaty , which framed the euro and left the UK with its famous " opt out " .
True , that was never designed with the credit crunch and deflation in mind and the Treaty provides wriggle - room .
Nonetheless , the Maastricht criteria were the next best thing to a Europe - wide Treasury controlling the budget deficits of member states .
Without even the Maastricht barriers there is little to prevent the euro taking on the shape of a new drachma rather than the stentorian qualities of the old Deutschemark , guarded as it was for 40 years by the ever vigilant Bundesbank .
The independent European Central Bank , headquartered in Frankfurt , was created on the Bundesbank model , yet that has not stopped big beasts such as Sarkozy and Berlusconi from trying to bully it .
Soon , though , the Germans may run out of cash , if not patience .
The OECD say that the German economy will contract by 5.7 per cent in 2009 – even worse than the UK – and grow only very slowly after that .
German unemployment is already at 8 per cent , and her exports are collapsing .
Even if Berlin wanted to write blank cheques to Club Med , it may not be able to : Heaven knows what might happen if Germany 's public finances spiral out of control and she has her own debt downgraded .
The problem with the euro – as federalists and eurosceptics in fact agree – is that it suffers from not having a single Treasury function behind it ; someone or something to ensure that national budget deficits do n't threaten the viability of the currency .
The politics of it are just too difficult , and the European Commission seems to have given up trying to shadow the role .
In the end , monetary policy and fiscal policy must face in the same direction , and that means a single Treasury working in harmony with a single central bank : the eurozone is a one - legged man auditioning for the part of Tarzan .
None of this would matter if the euro were the dollar , the yen , the pound , the Swedish kroner or even the Thai baht – the currencies of single indivisible states .
The euro is not .
Think about the US , say .
If West Virginia or Michigan are having an especially rough time in the recession , no one pops up to say they ought to have their own currency and opt out of the dollar so they can devalue their way out of trouble .
Neither will they be chucked out of the US .
That is because West Virginia and Michigan are not sovereign states .
New York famously went bust in 1975 without leaving the US or exploding the dollar .
Yet that possibility is attached to the fortunes of Italy , Greece and the others .
It is not clear that the euro will be able to withstand these strains .
Could Germany allow these nations to go bust ?
Could she actually afford to prop them up ?
And if she did , would she not then be " infected " by their debts and crumbling credit ratings ?
All extreme scenarios , but we live in a world of extreme scenarios , one where Toyota makes a loss and the Royal Bank of Scotland ends up half nationalised .
The euro too could be a casualty .
It may well be that a euro , rather than the euro , would emerge ; a curious currency made up of a mix of nations with relatively solid public finances and those so tiny they do n't matter .
Thus the new euro might comprise , under German leadership , Finland , Malta , Cyprus , Luxembourg and Slovenia , with France in borderline contention for membership .
Ireland , Greece , Spain and the rest would go back to their old currencies , but flexibly pegged to the new euro .
Not pretty , but not impossible .

So where is the $ 6 trillion going to come from this year , and beyond ?
For now we must fall back on the Fed , the Bank of England , and fellow central banks , relying on QE ( printing money ) to pay for our schools , roads , and administration .
It is necessary , alas , to stave off debt deflation .
But it is also a slippery slope , as Fed hawks keep reminding their chairman Ben Bernanke .

omen in Kenya , sick of all the political infighting in the country , are going ahead with a 7 - day sex ban , according to the BBC .
Several activist groups are participating and they are even urging prostitutes to join in .
" Even commercial sex workers should join in the campaign which is so vital to the country , " said Patricia Nyaundi , executive director of the Federation of Women Lawyers .
Not only that , but they want the two political leaders ' wives to join them as well .
" Great decisions are made during pillow talk , so we are asking the two ladies at that intimate moment to ask their husbands : ' Darling can you do something for Kenya ?
'" Wow , I love the line in there where it says the women are likely to face some stiff resistance .
Wonder if a sex ban could ever work in the USA ( actually quite a few are already being enforced , um , I heard ) .

Character Creation Rules
Okay , so first , the basics ...
I like simplicity , and in order to keep the system as simplistic as possible , I ’ve kept the dice needed for this game down to just your standard six sided dice ( D6's ) so that anybody can play .
With this system , all you really need to play are a couple sheets of paper , a couple pencils , some supermarket or dollar store dice , some friends , and your imagination .
I have nothing against games that use massive lists and compendiums or a thousand different polyhedral dice ( I love my polyhedral dice ) but I like having easier , more kickback RPGs that can be thrown together anywhere with little or no warning and still be fun .
Also in the name of simplicity , I ’ve forced the stats down to three physical ( Perception / Initiative , Strength / Stamina , and Speed / Dodge ) and three Jutsu ( knowledge ) ( Genjutsu , Ninjutsu , Kinjutsu , Taijutsu , and Fuuinjutsu ) stats .
I ’ll admit , I took a little tiny bit of artistic license here tying them into elements , but the game mechanic is more interesting and fun this way .
Read on past the empty character sheet to find out how .
What the Numbers Indicate
Essentially , the numbers indicate the number of dice you can roll when using a specific stat ( like dodge , when you ’re faced with an attack ) or when using a skill ( like a ninjutsu ) .
Three in any stat is average for a Genin Ninja , but everyone has their strengths and weaknesses .
Your core knowledge stats apply themselves to any skills that fall into the same category , giving you a basic bonus to however many dice you have in any particular skill of the same time ( say Pre -Genin Naruto wants to use Kage Bushin no Jutsu–he can roll up to 12 dice [ 3 Ninjutsu + 9 Kage Bushin ] with each success on the dice [ a five or a six ] indicating a shadow clone was created and a Chakra point was spent . )
Additional Dice
Additional dice can be added to this if your character has the skill “ Change In Chakra Nature ” and your character ’s element ( a character with multiple elements can get multiple bonuses , but we ’ll discuss that in another installment ) is the same as whatever discipline you ’re using .
( I.e. Naruto is Air , so he would get a bonus to Genjutsu skills and skills that he chooses to apply an Air nature to [ like Rasengan ] equal to however many levels are in his Change in Chakra Nature skill . )
This reflects the affinity that individual characters have in regards to their own natural chakra element .
Numbers in Your Core Knowledge Stats
The numbers in your core knowledge stats also indicate your character ’s skill at breaking out of an enemy ’s skill of the same type or element .
( I.e. Naruto would have 1 die to help him escape from an enemy Genjutsu , which is n’t very promising , especially if it ’s a high level Genjutsu , but he ’d have 3 dice if he was trying to escape from a prison of earth - natured chakra )
Only Taijutsus are immune to this , and must be met with Strength , Speed , or a defensive move .
( Like using throw with a kunai to get a +1 die in addition to your speed )
Hit Points
Hit Points are determined by multiplying your Strength by two and then adding any additional HP purchased as a “ High Endurance ” quality , ( 1 HP / quality point spent . )
And indicate the number of successes an enemy can get against you in his roll for a skill or attack ( like throwing a kunai ) before you become unconscious .
The only way to really “ die ” is for an attacker to consciously announce that they ’re going to deliver the killing blow to an unconscious opponent .
Your character ’s dodge stat is how many dice you can roll to avoid just about anything , and your successes in that roll are subtracted from your opponent ’s attacking successes , leaving the remainder of the attack to be soaked by your Hit Points .
Chakra / Ki points
Chakra / Ki points ( I added Ki because I ’m considering expanding the system beyond Naruto to Fullmetal Alchemist and / or DBZ ) are determined by adding a base pool of 10 to one die roll ( in Naruto ’s case , I figured he rolled high , giving him a 16 ) and adding in any extra Chakra points purchased at a rate of two Chakra points per quality point spent .
Chakra points are spent on hits for Jutsu used , meaning that if you roll ten dice for a skill ( except Taijutsu or physical stat attacks ) and you get five successes , you spend five Chakra points .
Taijutsu and physical stat attacks ( like unarmed combat , throwing , or weapon skills ) use one chakra regardless of how many hits turn up on the roll .
Luck
Luck are extra dice you can use at any time , and your starting number is determined by a 1d6 roll .
They are rare , and cannot be regained except by spending 5 Mission Points ( experience ) per luck point , so spend them wisely .
Points When Creating a Character
When creating a character , you are given 60 points to spend on stats , skills and qualities , but keep in mind the following limitations :
No more than 25 points may be spent on stats ( Knowledge and Physical combined ) or on skills .
You may spend any number of points on qualities , but your Core stats can never be less than one .
It is recommended that in purchasing skills , you think about the sorts of skills that a ninja should have in order to survive in the Naruto universe .
Concentrate
Concentrate is a key one , ( 5 points for first level , 10 for second , 15 for third , etc. ) as it allows you to spend a turn building chakra by rolling a number of dice equal to your HP , recovering a number of points equal to the number of hits you get .
Henge , Replacement , and Sneak
You might also want to think about Henge ( Genjutsu / Transform ) , Replacement ( Ninjutsu / Evade ) , and Sneak ( which is tested against an opponent ’s Perception , with applicable bonuses or penalties , depending on the situation as the Ninja Master ( NM , aka referee ) sees it .
In this game , a lot of decisions are left up to the NM .
( After all , it ’s the story he or she is telling . )
The emphasis in skills is , however , primarily on creating your own jutsu .
Pick something , give it a name and an effect , and then put some levels in it .
( I.e. Poison Moth Cave Vision ( Genjutsu ) which makes the target think they ’re in a cave full of poisonous moths , with the strength of the illusion being the number of hits you get when you create it .
If you ’re flinging fireballs , ( Katon : Chakra burst ) the number of hits can reflect the size of the fireball or the number of them that are thrown at once .
Talk with your Ninja Master about the effect you ’re going for so the two of you can come up with something you both agree upon .
Ninja Masters are encouraged to give small bonuses or advantages to players who really get into the game , come up with creative jutsus , or get everybody else excited and talking .
It can really be a blast to get all the players so into the game that they ’re shouting “ Gatsuuga ! ” instead of saying “ I ’m gonna use that charge jutsu thing against the dude . ”
What Do the Different “ Jutsu ” Stats Mean
If you ’re unclear as to what the different “ Jutsu ” stats mean , check the tables of skills at the end of this page for descriptions .
Also : Elements names in the Naruto universe are as follows : Katon ( Fire ) , Fuuton ( Air ) , Suiton ( Water ) , Doton ( Earth ) , and Raiton ( Lightning ) .
Notes on Ninja Tools
Kunai , shiruken , needles and most small blades add +1 die ,
Large stars add +2 ,
Windmill stars add +3 .
Melee weapons like Kunai and daggers add +1 ,
Short swords add +2 ,
Large weapons add +3 .
I ’m still working on more general equipment , like night vision goggles and radio gear , but you can find more information about chakra conducting weapons ( like Asuma 's knives ) below .
Breakdown of How Mission Points Work
Lastly , but not leastly ( before the skill tables ) I ’ll give a quick breakdown of how Mission Points ( aka experience ) work .
As you complete missions and defeat enemy shinobi or spirits , your Ninja Master will award you Mission Points that you can spend upgrading your stats .
Upgrading
Core Stat Upgrade : New value of stat x2
Skill Upgrade : New value of skill
Chakra pool / HP : 1 point / 1 point

Jutsu dice pools are used primarily to determine in combat effects .
If a character chooses to focus on the jutsu before performing it , he or she can reroll the dice that did not turn up with hits and add the new hits to the old ones , and may do this once for every round he or she spends focusing before performing .
( Theoretically meaning that if you spend lots of time , you ’ll get it perfect .
Great for healing . )
Qualities
When it comes to qualities , there are two main categories : GM qualities , which are high power , costless , story - driven qualities assigned by the Ninja Master ( like Jinchuruuki ) , and normal qualities , which give you small bonuses to give your character a little edge in the field ( like an increased chakra pool , etc . )
Normal Qualities :
Unusually High Chakra : ( + 2 chakra points per quality point spent . )
( +2 chakra points per quality point spent . )
High Endurance : ( +2 HP per quality point spent . )
Examples of GM Qualities :
Jinchuruuki :
Those who have had a spirit sealed within them ( such as the Kyuubi or the Shikaku ) The Kyuubi is detailed on the sheets for Naruto , but the rest will be detailed in another installment concerned specifically with Jinchuruuki and their Bijou .
A Note About Combat
When a character throws a jutsu at an opponent who is aware of the attack , the target always gets a chance to react , dodge , or defend in response .
This happens in addition to a player ’s normal turn .
( Meaning there ’s a chance that , if two players attack and react by attacking back multiple times , they ’re essentially going nuts in the middle of everyone . )
More importantly , it means that , if one person has fifty guys after him , he has a chance to strike each of them in turn ... for all the good that might do him .
Afterword
This is n’t the end all and be all by any means .
It ’s enough to get you started out as Genin and maybe build a Chunnin or Jounin to run a team of characters through a mission , but I ’m working on implementing more material as you ’re reading this .
I ’ll add the links up under this paragraph as they come in , right here :
If you have any questions or comments ( except for “ OMG NARUTARD ! ” ) or want to drop me a link to something you ’ve done using this system , feel free to post in the comments area below !
I ’d love to hear from ya !
Since I do n’t own Naruto and this system is based on the series , I ’m not going to hunt you down if you use anything you find here .
What I would ask though , is that you credit me back with a link or a byline , and even send me a link to whatever you ’ve created so I can witness the sweetness and appreciate what you ’ve done with the materials I ’ve assembled here .
I ’d love to see what other people come up with for this system !
Also : if you , who are wandering into this page , happen to own Naruto , I ’d love to work with you on making this available in some form commercially so we can get it out there to more people .

Have you thought about , doing the standard Persception , knowledge , strenght , dexterity and endurance ?
And put ninjutsu , genjutsu and taijutsu in a section and base techniques learnt by using knowledge and attacks formed by using strenght and endurace to do chakra levels and endurace to form life ?

Emende on June 01 , 2011 :
TO KageSabers :
I expanded on on Mr Wynn 's system and noticed you needed some inspiration for the Sharingan .
Here 's what has worked in " my " system , maybe it can help you .
SHARINGAN - BLOODLINE LIMIT
2 CHAKRA PER TURN ( COST ) WHILE ACTIVATED
SHARINGAN LEVEL 1 : SEE THROUGH D-RANK GENJUTSU
SHARINGAN LEVEL 2 : SEE THROUGH C-RANK GENJUTSU
SHARINGAN LEVEL 3 : SEE THROUGH B-RANK GENJUTSU
SHARINGAN LEVEN ( ALL ) : +( LEVEL OF SHARINGAN ) ROLLS AGAINST
TAIJUTSU AND NINJUTSU ATTACKS .
[ COST TO PURCHASE : 10MP X LEVEL BEING PURCHASED ]
I have a MSharingan and an ESharingan limit as well , but this should take a while to level up . :) hope this helps .
TO Mr Wynn and others :
Since there is continuing interest
in Wynn 's system , and he is still getting things together for everyone , I will be putting my version of his system online , along with ' core rules ' and character creation , etc. for use .
Give me a few days to upload everything .
I will post the link when it is all uploaded .
KageSabers on April 23 , 2011 :
Hey , do n't know if you 're still working on this but how about addding in kekagenkai and such like , i'm looking forward to being able to make a character with the sharingan .
Also maybe add in a story of you 're own and maybe some bosses , like Orochimaru , Sasuke , Zabusa and so on so that people can fight the battles from the series and , if the made a sharingan user have a chance at getting an eternal mongekyou by defeting either Itachi , Sasuke or if there really op Madara ?
Dracopol on January 31 , 2011 :
That 's good , but maybe this belongs in the section Tabletop RPGs .
Role - playing games make people think of many things including computer games but dice - using games go in Tabletop .
crackers on September 23 , 2010 :
how many points does it cost for 1 level of each skill that is n't listed
dante uchiha on June 29 , 2010 :
intriuging , not entirely different from one i wrote a while back , but the difference is u actually finished urs and it turned out awesome
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on June 09 , 2010 :
Sure thing !
Develop away , just make sure to link back to this page . :)
I 'll see what I can do about the stat sheet . :)
Valor on June 09 , 2010 :
Is it possible for you to develop just basic rules of designing enemies / foes ?
like a simple bad guy stat sheet that wo n't conflict ?
I have tried and failed so many times .
Oh , and if you would n't mind , I 'd like to develop more on this system with my idea's .
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on April 12 , 2010 :
Mission points .
They 're like experience or plot points .
naruto rpg fan on April 12 , 2010 :
what is Mpoints which naruto have 0 in ?
trevor a. on April 07 , 2010 :
i was wondering what you do with Rasengan , would it stun the enemy for one turn if it hits ?
hojin2002003 on March 07 , 2010 :
can u elaborate a little bit more on the level up system ?
how to distribute exp etc ?
trevor a. on March 05 , 2010 :
looks cool , i've been trying to make a naruto pen and paper rpg .
cool game , i'll try it with my friends .
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on February 28 , 2010 :
Successful rolls .
Leo on February 28 , 2010 :
One thing I was wondering was how damage worked versus physical attacks , ninjutsu etc. , is it how many successful rolls or specified depending on how many levels you have for a specific skill , like a ninjutsu or is it just something the DM decides ?
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on February 01 , 2010 :
+ 2HP/1
Naruto Fan on February 01 , 2010 :
A question : Both the naruto character sheets say that the high endurance quality was purchased at +2 HP / 1 quality point spent , while the qualities section states that high endurance is +1 HP /1 Quality point .
Which one is it ?
Naruto Fan on January 29 , 2010 :
Thanks !
Your advice helped greatly .
It would also be nice to have more on character creation .
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on January 28 , 2010 :
I have n't worked on this system in a long time , but it should n't be too hard to fill in the extra details ( like cost , etc. ) until I get a chance to make up a table , etc .
As for printing , click on the image , save it , then print it either as a 1 tall , 2 wide or on one sheet .
( Printer preferences with paint , etc. if you have a PC )
Naruto Fan on January 28 , 2010 :
How do I print the character sheet ?
Also , how about the finer points of battle ?
Does it cost anything to get weapons and gear ?
Alex Blais on December 28 , 2009 :
OMG NARUTARD !
( just kidding )
But seriously , ever thought about doing a D20 version ?
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on June 14 , 2009 :
Yuppers .
Keep an eye out , it 'll be up before too long ! :)
LaserTaGisAwesome on June 13 , 2009 :

Kisame on May 29 , 2009 :

Very Interesting .!!!
THE Rudd Government will next month try to lock Parliament in to approving the sale of its new broadband company by 2022 in a bid to avoid a repeat of the bitter Senate debates over the privatisation of Telstra .
In an interview with the Herald , the Broadband and Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , revealed the legislation to set up the company will also prevent the government from keeping it in majority public ownership .
" We 're legislating that sell - down provision .
It will be a mandatory requirement to do it , " he said .
It represents an ideological shift from the position Labor held in the 1990s and 2000s in government and opposition when one of its most sacred policies was to keep Telstra in public ownership because it was a vital asset .
The Government this week made the shock announcement that it was setting up its own broadband company to provide superfast internet to homes , schools and workplaces because no private company could offer a deal that offered value for taxpayer dollars .
When I was in college we had a guy in our fraternity named “ Eh ” .
He was called Eh because he had this weird tic where after every sentence he would say “ eh ” .
As in “ I think I want a francheezie…eh . ”
One afternoon , during fall semester junior year , Eh accidentally broke his foot fighting over the remote control .
He wanted to watch “ Walker Texas Ranger ” but another fraternity brother , Shatty ( who had the unfortunate luck of shitting his pants when he drank ) , grabbed the remote so he could watch “ Iron Chef ” .
Eh attacked Shatty , a scuffle ensued ( “ fuck you…eh ! ” ) and when the smoke cleared Eh had cracked the third metatarsal of his right foot .
He had to wear crutches and a corrective boot for the rest of the semester .
I call Eh the greatest man whoever lived .
He understood the power of the remote control .
See , it ’s not so much about watching TV as it is about ruling over the TV .
When you have the remote , you are in charge .
Even if you never change the channel you still have the power .
Watching TV while someone else has the remote is like riding bitch on a Harley .
It ’s no fun , you ’re a little embarrassed and you feel slightly less than a man .
I would rather watch a crappy show with the remote in hand than watch my favorite show and have someone else controlling the remote .
For instance , I would rather suffer through “ Housewives of Orange County ” with the Tivo remote in my hand than watch “ The Office ” while my girlfriend has it in hers .
Sure , she maybe enjoying her show about ugly old skanks who wish they were milfs , but I ’m still in control .
I control the volume .
I control the fast - forward .
I control the mute .
And is n’t that way more important than actually enjoying what you ’re watching ?
Is n’t it ?
Eh understood the power of the remote control .
He understood its importance .
The remote control is an extension of a man ’s dick [ And if you doubt me ask yourself this – how often do you watch TV with the remote in one hand and your dick in the other ?
Yeah , that ’s what I thought ! ] .
As men we need to be in control of our dicks – constantly .
Eh had the clarity and insight to know this .
The man was a genius .
And what ever happened to my hero ?
Where ’s
Eh now ?
He dropped out of school his senior year .
Last I heard he lives with his mom and is an assistant manager at Barnes and Noble .
I still think he was a genius…eh .
Strasbourg , May 6 2009 −
The debates on the Telecoms Package , thanks to a remarkable citizen mobilization , led to an extremely strong recognition of the access to internet as a fundamental right with the re-adoption of amendment 138/46 in second reading by a qualified majority .
It is the final blow against three - strike laws such as Nicolas Sarkozy ’s HADOPI bill , which are explicitely banned .
The European Parliament nevertheless adopted a soft compromise on issues of network equity : no strong protection against “ net discrimination ” was adopted .
La Quadrature warmly thanks the numerous European citizens who have contributed to the possibility of this new and stronger than ever statement for fundamental rights .
Even on issues connected to network offers , the worst provisions introduced since the beginning of the legislative process were not adopted .
Thanks to the public debate , the ill - intended co-operation between ISPs and right holders and discrimination of Net services and contents will not be forced , even though doors are still open for introducing it in Members States .
“ A formidable campaign from the citizens put the issues of freedoms on the Internet at the center of the debates of the Telecoms Package .
This is a victory by itself .
It started with the declaration of commissioner Viviane Reding considering access to Internet as a fundamental right .
The massive re-adoption of amendment 138/46 rather than the softer compromise negotiated by rapporteur Trautmann with the Council is an even stronger statement .
These two elements alone confirm that the French ‘ three strikes ’ scheme , HADOPI , is dead already . ” explains Jérémie Zimmermann , co-founder of La Quadrature du Net .
To safeguard these provisions , the European civil society will have to be strongly mobilized during a conciliation phase that would proceed with a newly elected Parliament and a new Presidency .
Furthermore , some provisions in the compromise amendments to the Harbour directive adopted today allow telecoms operators to alter the Internet as we know it .
Nothing will forbid them to turn the Internet away from a neutral zone where people have equal access to all content applications and services .
As these provisions have been negotiatied with the Council , they are likely to become law .
Citizens will have to be particularly attentive to the transposition and implementation of the adopted provisions .
It would be disastrous for the Internet to stop being a space where all can create innovative services and contents without permission from gatekeepers .
In order for consumers to be in a position to endorse equitable network offers and reject the discriminatory offers , it is essential for at least some of the offers to be non-discriminatory .
We will call the regulatory authorities and the Commission to ensure it by all policy means .
“ The strong statement for the access to the Internet as a fundamental right demonstrates that the Parliament can be courageous and reject the pressure to compromise when essential values are at stake .
Unfortunately , on issues that appear more technical such as the absence of discrimination of services and contents on the Internet , the Parliament did not take the full measure of what it is at stake yet .
Citizens must remain mobilized on these crucial questions . ” , concludes Gérald Sédrati - Dinet , analyst for La Quadrature .
The Republican National Committee recently dropped its resolution to brand the moderate pro-corporate Democratic Party “ Socialists . ”
As the late , great Democratic Socialist leader Michael Harrington liked to tell it when he testified before a dying Senator Hubert Humphrey on the Humphrey - Hawkins Work Bill , that would theoretically guarantee every American a right to a job , Humphrey bluntly asked him “ Is my bill socialism ? ” Harrington replied , “ Senator , your bill ’s not half that good . ”
Here ’s why the Democratic Party is also not half that good .
Obama ’s “ Me too ” bailout policy to the largest and most irresponsible banks and investment houses has nothing to do with socializing capital .
Democratic Socialists believe in democratizing and socializing money matters .
They favor credit unions and co-ops with democratically elected boards over large welfare checks to transnational corporations .
In fact , there ’s little difference between Obama ’s approach to the big bankers and George W. Bush’s .
If the Democrats were European Democratic Socialists or Social Democrats , they would have never allowed 20 % of all U.S. workers and 47 million people in the U.S. to live without health care .
They would have at least called for a general strike to shut down the system until the injustice was stopped .
If you want to look at the history of democratic socialism as a barometer for that esteemed label in American history , let ’s start with the legendary Eugene Victor Debs .
Unlike the cowardly Democratic Party and its then - leaders – John Kerry and Hillary Clinton who both supported Bush ’s illegal imperialist occupation of Iraq to remain politically viable as presidential candidates – Debs went to jail to oppose World War I .
Not only that , he ran as a Socialist Party presidential candidate from jail and received a million votes defending the First Amendment .
What was Debs ’ great crime ?
Claiming the rich have always declared war and the poor and working class have always fought and died .
Historically , U.S. Socialist leaders like Debs , Norman Thomas , and Michael Harrington were not cowards hiding behind pragmatism and popularity polls .
When virtually no U.S. politicians spoke on behalf of accepting Jewish immigrants from Nazi Germany during the Great Depression , Thomas fought for their admittance .
Martin Luther King , Jr. called Norman Thomas “ the bravest man ” he ever met .
When Thomas gave his nominal blessing for the last remains of the Socialist Party to merge into the Democratic Party in 1960 , he did not surrender his conscience .
For example , he called John F. Kennedy “ all profile and no courage , ” particularly in regards to the President ’s civil rights actions .
In 1965 , Thomas spoke at the first major anti-Vietnam War rally in Washington D.C. and announced he had come to “ cleanse ” the American flag , not to burn it .
Thomas spoke out and wrote a book against the torture of pacifists during World War I , asking the key question , “ Is conscience a crime ? ”
He understood that when you strung pacifists up by their thumbs , it was torture .
I ’m sure if he had ever been briefed on it , as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi allegedly was , he would have denounced it immediately .
Michael Harrington was the architect of the Great Society and the War on Poverty .
His book , “ The Other America , ” stands as a lasting monument to the principles of Democratic Socialism .
When both the Democrat and Republican Parties were ignoring the 22 % of U.S. population living in poverty during the Eisenhower years , it was Harrington who documented their desperate plight .
Harrington later went on to champion the rights of the wretched of the Earth in his book “ The Vast Majority . ”
He helped write the policy perspectives that tilted the European Social Democrats toward massive aid to Africa , Asia and South America .
Debs , Thomas and Harrington came to realize that democracy was more important than socialism and that decision - making from the bottom up was the key .
To label the timid , triangulating Obama Democratic Party as Democratic Socialists is absurd .
Not only is Obama not half as good as Debs , Thomas and Harrington , he ’s not yet a pale imitation of FDR .
And we can only dream that he would adopt the infrastructure programs and progressive tax policies of President Dwight Eisenhower from the 50s .
Perhaps the best we can do is raise the slogan demanding that Obama “ Be like Ike . ” America needs a Marshall Plan , that ’s something an FDR or Ike would understand .
Debs , on the other hand , would be calling for an army of a million men to arrest Bush and Cheney for crimes against humanity .
And Debs would be talking about his desire to resurrect from the dead the more than a million dead Iraqis killed in a corporate capitalist war for oil .
That ’s the legacy of American Democratic Socialism .

When we ’re very young , certainly before we hit our teenage years , our favorite characters from our favorite movies and TV shows tend to reflect our nature during this period of our lives .
They ’re often innocents , like us .
Possibly naïve and often untrained in the ways of life , our icons at this time almost have a virginal status about them .
As we mature – certainly as we enter and move through puberty – we tend to look for increasingly darker characters for inspiration .
These new icons , while rarely all bad or certainly evil , are significantly less good , clean and wholesome than the folk we used to appreciate .
They ’re mostly heroic , but have an unsavoury edge that is enormously appealing .
Once we are well into our teenage years , and certainly as we approach adulthood , even those guys are n’t dark enough .
They ’ll always be somewhat cool , but as we age and the demands of life weigh heavily upon us , we become more cynical and appreciative of darkness .
Often we will find ourselves , consciously or otherwise , thinking that the mostly bad or downright evil creations are the epitome of style and sophistication .
I present to you , then , four examples of this evolution of cool .
Star Wars ( IV - VI )
Stage 1 : Luke Skywalker
Stage 2 : Han Solo
Stage 3 : Boba Fett
Stage 4 : Darth Vader
( Indeed , one can argue that Luke became far more appealing as he himself became a darker character .
But he ’s no Vader . )
Star Trek ( TNG )
Stage 1 : Commander Data
Stage 2 : Jean Luc Picard
Stage 3 : Q
Stage 4 : The Borg
( It ’s worth observing that Picard himself became significantly cooler when Borgified into Locutus in The Best of Both Worlds . )
Marvel
Stage 1 : Spider - Man
Stage 2 : Wolverine
Stage 3 : Magneto
Stage 4 : Venom
( Magneto in the movies is cooler than Magneto in the comics , and vice versa for Venom . )
DC
Stage 1 : Superman
Stage 2 : Batman
Stage 3 : Lex Luthor
Stage 4 : The Joker
I ’m sure you have your own favorites and your personal order might differ slightly from the above .
I urge you to hit the comments and list your own evolutionary cool timelines .
One summer night in 2007 , a pair of 13 - year - old northeastern Pennsylvania girls decided to strip down to their skivvies to beat the heat .
As Marissa Miller talked on the phone and Grace Kelly flashed a peace sign , a third girl took a candid shot of the teens in their white bras .
It was harmless , innocent fun , the teens say .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the picture somehow wound up on classmates ' cell phones , and a prosecutor has threatened to charge Miller and Kelly with child pornography or open lewdness unless they participate in a five - week after - school program followed by probation .
On Wednesday , the American Civil Liberties Union asked a federal judge to block Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick Jr. from filing charges , saying that the teens did n't consent to having the picture distributed and that the image is not pornography , in any event .
The photos surfaced in October , when officials at Tunkhannock Area High School confiscated five cell phones and found that boys had been trading photos of scantily clad , semi-nude or nude teenage girls .
The students with the cell phones ranged in age from 11 to 17 .
Called " sexting " when it 's done by cell phone , teenagers ' habit of sending sexually suggestive photos of themselves and others to one another is a nationwide problem that has confounded parents , school administrators and law enforcement officials .
" There was absolutely nothing wrong with that photograph , " said Marissa 's mother , MaryJo Miller , 44 , of Tunkhannock .
" I certainly do n't want paedophiles looking at my daughter in her bra , but I do n't think that was the intention to begin with , " she said .
" This is absolutely wrong on his part .
It 's abuse of his authority . "
A hearing on the ACLU 's request for a temporary restraining order is scheduled for Thursday in Scranton .
Marissa Miller , Kelly and their parents were joined in the lawsuit by a 17 - year - old Tunkhannock girl from the same school who was photographed topless last year in a separate setting .
The teen , also facing felony charges unless she takes the class , is called " Nancy Doe " in the lawsuit to protect her privacy .
Skumanick said he would fight the lawsuit .
" Frankly , we just wanted to protect these kids , and say , ' Doing this is not right . '
We wanted to offer this course to educate them , and make them understand the long - term ramifications of having photos like this out there , " he said .
Prosecutors in a number of states , including Pennsylvania , Connecticut , North Dakota , Ohio , Utah , Vermont , Virginia and Wisconsin , have tried to put a stop to it by charging teens who send and receive the pictures .
In Tunkhannock , a town about 210 kilometres north of Philadelphia , Skumanick met with about 20 students and their parents last month and offered them a deal :
The youths would n't be prosecuted if they took a class on sexual harassment , sexual violence and gender roles .
" If we were just out to be nasty about this , we would have just charged everybody , " Skumanick said .
Seventeen of the students accepted his offer .
But when MaryJo Miller protested to Skumanick that the photo portraying her daughter and Kelly could n't possibly be considered child porn , he replied that the girls were posed " provocatively , " according to the lawsuit .
Marissa Miller , now 15 and a freshman , said nothing could be further from the truth .
" It was a first - ever bra that your parents buy you , an old grandma bra , " she said .
" I think it was even a padded bra , " her mother added .
But Skumanick said the image was n't appropriate .
" You 'd have to see the photo and see the setting , which I 'm not going to show to the public because I do n't think it 's appropriate , " he said .
The year - old photo of Nancy Doe , meanwhile , shows her just out of the shower , with a towel wrapped around her waist and her breasts exposed .
Vic Walczak , legal director of the Pennsylvania ACLU , would not say who took the photo or whether she sent it to anybody .
But he said she did not intend for it to be widely distributed .
" Our client has absolutely no idea how it ended up on strange people 's cell phones , " he said .
Under Pennsylvania 's child pornography law , it 's a felony to possess or disseminate photos of a minor engaged in sexual activity , " lewd exhibition of the genitals , " or nudity that is meant to titillate .
Open lewdness , a misdemeanour , includes any lewd act that is likely to be observed by others .
The ACLU 's lawsuit claims both photos are protected First Amendment speech .
" One of the concerns all of these kids have is it 's getting to be summertime , they 're going to the beach and the pool , and do they need to be worried about taking photos of themselves swimming around ? "
Walczak said .
" Who knows what he decides will be too provocative ? "
Skumanick said swimsuit - clad kids have nothing to fear from him .
Enlarge By David Goldman for USA TODAY A 1 kilo gold bar and a 1621 Sigismund III Gold 100 Ducat coin at Stack 's Rare Coins in New York .
Auto sales have plunged the past 12 months .
Home sales ?
Nothing good to report there , either .
And if you 're trying to sell $ 5 cups of coffee these days , well , good luck with that .
But in this recession - racked world one thing is selling : gold .
" We 're selling 10 times the amount we were selling a year ago , " says Arthur Blumenthal , representative for Stack's , a Manhattan bullion and coin dealer .
Even as department stores slash prices , the price of gold has soared from a low of $ 713 in October .
Wednesday , as the Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index fell 0.75 points , gold leaped nearly $ 11 to $ 977.70 an ounce .
The sizzle in this steak : fear .
Terror that the economic system will collapse .
Worries that the government will run the printing presses to pay the massive bailout program , fueling inflation and weakening the currency .
" Gold is almost an insurance policy , " Blumenthal says .
" It will always be there , and always pay . "
The question : Is the fear warranted ?
Economists today are more worried about a long period of falling prices , not skyrocketing inflation .
But to gold bugs — some of whom have been predicting hyperinflation for nearly three decades — there 's no doubt .
" What 's going on now is just really serious , the most serious recession since the start of the Industrial Revolution , " says Doug Casey , president of Casey Research and author of the 1979 best seller Crisis Investing .
And if Casey is right , what 's wrong with the world will be great for gold .
Glittering sales
Gold has become so popular that , for the first time , a gold dealer ran an ad during the Super Bowl .
Cash4Gold.com 's ad featured Tonight Show sidekick Ed McMahon and rapper MC Hammer talking about selling everything from gold records to gold hip replacements .
Selling your old gold certainly makes more sense now than it did in April 2001 , when gold hit a low of $ 256 per ounce .
But for gold investors , buying gold near $ 1,000 an ounce seems to make a great deal of sense , too .
Sales of 1 - ounce gold U.S. Eagle coins soared to 92,000 ounces in January , vs. 22,500 ounces a year ago .
" January was the best month we 've ever had , and February is shaping up to be the same , " says David Breahm , vice president of economic research at Blanchard & Co. , a New Orleans bullion dealer .
" We sold more gold in January than in all of 2007 . "
Why the big interest in gold ?
Gold has always had a reputation as a store of value .
It has been used as money as long as there has been money .
Gold is rare , easily transportable ( and concealable ) .
And it 's a noble metal , which means that it resists rust and oxidation .
Quite simply , people have always valued gold .
But people value gold most highly in times of crisis , because it can be used as money when paper money is worthless .
During war , for example , gold soars in value when a country 's chances of losing increase .
People figure they can eventually buy new currency with gold .
War is n't the only thing that devalues a currency : Inflation does , too .
A country that simply prints more and more money eventually winds up with a worthless currency .
In Zimbabwe , for example , the inflation rate is 98 % a day , according to the Cato Institute , a conservative think tank .
The country rolled out a $ 100 trillion bank note , worth about $ 30 U.S. dollars , in January .
Both fear of financial collapse and hyperinflation is fueling the interest in gold .
Stack 's Blumenthal said that the gold business really took off when Merrill Lynch started to teeter in September and sold itself to Bank of America .
" We saw people who have worked in financial markets for 10 , 20 , 30 years , buying physical gold for the first time , " Blumenthal says .
That 's unusual : Wall Streeters often look down their noses at gold , which pays no interest and has no earnings potential .
But there 's no broad consensus that gold is a panacea for all types of financial ills .
Peter Kendall , co-editor of the Elliott Wave Financial Forecast , thinks that the nation is headed for deflation — and when consumer prices fall , the price of gold will fall with them .
" We think gold will tumble , " he says .
Kendall thinks gold will be a buy when it 's about a third cheaper , at $ 600 per ounce .
And , it should be pointed out , gold has lost ground to inflation from its 1980 peak of $ 850 to now .
Adjusted for inflation , $ 850 in 1980 would be $ 2,221 .
Those who bought gold during the last inflation scare are still waiting for the big payoff .
And many investors who have invested in gold mutual funds , which invest primarily in gold mining stocks , have been on a roller coaster .
Gold funds lost 37.5 % in October , according to Morningstar , and soared 21 % in November .
Dread ahead ?
James Dines , editor of the Dines Letter , has followed gold since the 1970s , and thinks that hard times ahead will drive the yellow metal higher .
When government senses an economic downturn , he says , the first instinct is to cure potential deflation — falling prices — with inflation .
" It 's seductive logic , but it 's like adding sugar to cyanide , " Dines says .
Dines foresees a slight economic recovery as the money from the economic stimulus kicks in .
" It will look as if prosperity is returning , " he says .
But by 2010 or 2011 , all those trillions of stimulus dollars will bite back , in the form of hyperinflation .
" It 's a trap from which there is no escape , " he says .
Douglas Casey holds similar views .
He thinks that the economy is going to head into a severe contraction .
" The entire world has been living above its means , " Casey says .
" You get wealthy by saving , and you get poor by spending more than you produce . "
Normally , an economic contraction leads to deflation , not inflation .
But Casey says the opposite of an economic depression is prosperity , not inflation .
You can have an economic contraction with inflation , as Zimbabwe is , or with deflation , as the U.S. did during the Great Depression .
Like Dines ,
Casey thinks that the current economic downturn will eventually be an inflationary one .
" The government is in the process of destroying the currency , " he says .
The best government action ?
None at all : Recessions have the seeds of their own recoveries , once all the economic excesses have been purged .
" What the government should do is rescue itself from any involvement in the economy whatsoever , " Casey says .
At the moment , Wall Street does n't betray a hint of concern about inflation .
Bond yields , which tend to rise when inflation is a worry , are exceptionally low .
The benchmark 10 - year Treasury note yields just 2.9 % , and the yield on 5 - year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities , or TIPS , imply a zero inflation rate .
The consumer price index , the government 's main gauge of inflation , has declined every month since August .
And wages , which contribute to a wage - price spiral , certainly are n't soaring — nor will they , as unemployment rises .
Former Federal Reserve governor Lyle Gramley argues that talk of inflation is premature , to put it mildly .
" We have no alternative , " he says .
" We have to step on the gas pedal , hard . "
Eventually , however , both the Fed and the government need an exit strategy .
For the Fed , the strategy is relatively simple :
Most of its loans are short - term , and made at its discretion .
The Fed 's loan terms are onerous , he says :
When its borrowers can get cheaper loans , they will .
Congress and the president will face hard choices in getting the federal budget under control , Gramley says .
But inflation is a monetary problem more than a fiscal one , and the Fed has many tools at its disposal to whip inflation when the time comes .
Nevertheless , both Casey and Dines are not entirely outside the mainstream of economic thought for once .
" We 're more worried about it ( inflation ) than might be reflected in the market currently , " says Kim Rupert , managing director of Action Economics .
" There 's so much stimulus in the system .
It 's mind - boggling . "
If the gold gurus are correct , you should be buying gold and putting it somewhere where others can't get it .
Dines , for example , recommends gold in offshore safe - deposit boxes .
After all , the U.S. government restricted ownership of gold during the Depression .
" I do n't know of a better way to store it , " he says .
Casey likes gold - mining stocks for aggressive investors .
But for basic protection , he recommends owning gold coins , which do n't have to be assayed , or tested for gold content and purity .
Dines winces at being called a perennial gold bug :
He has moved his subscribers into various investments over the years .
But right now , he thinks it 's gold 's moment to shine .
" The monetary system is fundamentally flawed , " he says .
" You can't keep running the printing press .
There 's a punishment for that . "

Comments
The brouhaha over what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) knew about torture , and when she knew it , is typical of the American " debate " over the events of the past eight years — the long Bush Interregnum , when we slipped into an alternate universe , and Bizarro World ethics displaced our regular moral compass , effectively inverting traditional concepts of right and wrong .
Typical in that the real issues are avoided , or not mentioned at all .
We keep hearing arguments from defenders of the administration ’s " enhanced interrogation techniques " that go something like this : you have to remember that everything was different way back then , the smoke was still rising from the ruins of the World Trade Center and if you had asked the archetypal man - in - the - street if it was okay to torture the terrorists , nary a single one of them would have said no .
Everyone — or so the argument goes — is forgetting what it was like .
To begin with , it does n’t matter what the man - in - the - street believes is justifiable — quite aside from its dubious utility , torture is flat - out wrong under any and all circumstances .
Period .
Yet this argument makes a valid point , albeit one that fails to justify torture : the elected leadership of the country , and much of the US population , went collectively mad in the weeks — and years — after the worst terrorist attack in American history .
It is n’t at all hard to believe that Pelosi , too — being human , all too human — was swept up in the hysteria , and went along with those " enhanced interrogation techniques " without uttering a word of protest .
Pelosi says she was never informed that one particular terrorist suspect was water - boarded , in spite of recently - released CIA documents that clearly indicate she was briefed on the specific details of the " enhanced interrogation techniques " performed on this prisoner — a reputed high - level al - Qaeda operative who was water - boarded 83 times in a single month .
On the other hand , Pelosi contends — well , it ’s hard to say what she contends , because her story keeps changing .
First she said she knew nothing about it .
Then she said she knew about the " enhanced " techniques , but only that this was an option , not that they were going to be used or had actually been used .
Now she ’s changed her story yet again , and is claiming that the Bush administration " misled " her , and carried out these torture sessions before she was briefed .
Regardless of what shape her story takes on any particular day , what she says and what the CIA documents say ca n’t both be true .
Somebody is fibbing , bigtime — and I do n’t think it ’s Leon Panetta over at the CIA .
By all means , let us have a " truth commission , " as Speaker Pelosi has advocated , with one difference : it ought not to be mandated or controlled in any way by Congress — since we do n’t know how many members , or which ones , are implicated in these crimes .
Instead , let an independent commission made up of professional researchers and investigators in this field , along with competent academics , hold public sessions at which the testimony of witnesses can be heard .
And as long as we ’re in an investigative mood , there ’s plenty in the legacy of the Bush years that cries out for a vigorous probe .
Here ’s my own personal wish list :
Let ’s investigate the " intelligence " that got us into the Iraq war — starting with the Niger uranium forgeries [ . pdf ] .
You ’ll recall the once - famous " sixteen words " uttered by Bush in the course of a speech , in which he claimed that the African nation of Niger had been the site of an attempt by Saddam Hussein to procure uranium ore .
The " intelligence " behind this assertion turned out to be a very crude forgery , the provenance of which has remained a mystery to this day — although we have a few important clues .
In any case , that ’s not the only example of outright fraud when it comes to " evidence " of Iraqi WMD , proffered during the run-up to the invasion , only the most glaring .
Remember Ahmed Chalabi , the smooth - talking slickster and neocon hero who bamboozled us out of millions in exchange for phony " intelligence " purportedly " proving " Iraq was harboring all kinds of WMD ?
He disappeared for a while , after characterizing himself and his confreres as " heroes in error , " and popped up months later as a possible oil minister in the new Iraqi government .
Right before he disappeared , however , the CIA raided his Iraqi headquarters and stories appeared in the American media reporting that he was suspected of committing espionage against the United States : the Iranians apparently learned through Chalabi that the Americans had broken their code and were eavesdropping on the internal deliberations of the Iranian government .
The Iranians changed their code , and an invaluable window on the Iranian leadership was closed .
Chalabi dropped out of sight , resurfacing as putative oil minister — and that was the last we heard of the probe into Chalabi ’s activities .
At one point , you ’ll recall , the FBI was running lie - detector tests on Pentagon employees to determine if any of them had leaked information to Chalabi .
That ’s one investigation that needs to be resumed .
By the way , another possibly related investigation into Israeli spying activities in the US — the same probe that led to the indictment of Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , two top AIPAC officials — is still ongoing .
According to former DIA analyst Pat Lang , writing on his Sic Semper Tyrannis blog :
" Sources familiar with the FBI investigation of the AIPAC espionage case , say that the investigation is continuing even though the charges against Rosen and Weissman were dropped .
Harman was interviewed by DoJ prosecutors after the Rosen / Weissman charges were dropped .
" Sources indicate that based on multi-agency reports of Israeli espionage activities in the US prior to 9/11 , George Tenet as DCI ordered his senior staff to assemble for him a study of all the files available concerning the history of Israeli espionage activities in the US .
The resulting study shocked him . "
No doubt .
That ’s one subject on which we ’ll never see a congressional investigation , of that you can be sure .
Fortunately , however , when it comes to all of the above topics , and more , we have a source of investigative reporting that is on the ball and on the War Party ’s case .
Yes , that ’s right , I ’m talking about Antiwar.com .
From the Niger uranium forgeries to the " Mohammed Atta in Prague " story , from the Scooter Libby case to the Rosen - Weissman - AIPAC spy nest , Antiwar.com has gone where most " mainstream " media outlets were very slow to tread .
We nailed Scooter Libby from day one , and were all over the Niger uranium forgeries with reportage and detailed analysis , while the " mainstream " never covered the story in depth .
What ’s important in running a news portal and commentary site such as this is that the editors know what ’s going to be significant — before it becomes a big deal .
A good example of our news judgment in this regard is our comprehensive coverage of the AIPAC spy scandal , the arrest and conviction of former Pentagon analyst Larry Frankliln , and the long legal process following the indictment of Rosen and Weissman — which we reported and commented on every step of the way , while the " mainstream " ignored it after the indictments went down .
Our persistence paid off when Rep. Jane Harman was caught red -handed talking to " a suspected Israeli agent " offering her assistance in getting lenient treatment for Rosen and Weissman in exchange for AIPAC ’s help in securing the chair of the House intelligence committee .
As the Harman scandal roiled official Washington , regular readers of this site had a fuller understanding of the context in which it was occurring .
There ’s a lot more going on than they want us to know — that is a given .
The key to discovering it is to look behind the headlines , at the larger narrative taking shape , a method that gives our readers the real lowdown on what the War Party has in store .
That ’s what the spirit of independent journalism is all about , and it ’s alive and well here at Antiwar.com — but only as long as our money holds out , and it ’s going fast .
We depend entirely on the generosity of our readers to keep going , and our current fundraising drive is now going full - gear .
I know you ’ve been hectored endlessly for the past couple of days , but believe me , it ’s necessary — because if we do n’t make our fundraising goal , the spirit of independent journalism as represented by this web site is going to wilt considerably .
So do n’t delay — contribute today .
Three new bacterial species found in the upper stratosphere are probably not alien visitors — but they 're still quite remarkable .
The microbes were collected in a balloon sent by the Indian Space Research Agency to the boundary between Earth 's atmosphere and space , and are extremely resistant to ultraviolet radiation .
One species was dubbed Janibacter hoylei , a reference to astronomer Fred Hoyle , who believed that Earth 's first life came from space .
In a press release , the agency noted that the bugs " are not found on Earth " and that " the present study does not conclusively establish the extra- terrestrial origin of the microorganisms " — implying , of course , that they might be alien in origin .
Not so fast , said University of Washington astrobiologist John Baross .
" It is extremely unlikely that these organisms are extraterrestrial , " wrote Baross in an email , " and they are likely to originate from soil on Earth . "
Bacteria is often found in the stratosphere , and most can be traced to wind - borne dust particles .
That the new species were previously unknown means little .
Scientists have identified just one percent of all Earthly bacteria .
And though the species had n't been seen , their gene sequences were familiar ; they represent a variation on known life , rather than an entirely new form .
But they might still be useful , said Baross .
For years , researchers have wondered if bacteria might be capable not only of surviving space , but growing in it .
If the new bugs turn out to thrive at the edges of Earth 's atmosphere — baked by solar radiation and deprived of liquid water , at Antarctic temperatures — researchers can study them to learn how a spacecraft - riding terrestrial microbe contaminate another extreme - but - liveable environment , such as the surface of Mars .
Of course , Baross wants to prevent such contamination .
But humanity might someday want to live on Mars — and that process could very well start with adding terraforming bacteria to the planet .

Few topics in psychology are gaining more momentum than the origin of religious beliefs .
Questions of whether we ’re born with neural apparatus that predisposes us to belief , or whether we learn to becomes believers , or some combination of both , are on the minds of researchers from all quarters .
Bruce Hood , experimental psychologist at Bristol University , is a groundbreaker among the curious .
In his new book , SuperSense : Why We Believe in the Unbelievable , Hood argues that we are each born with an innate “ SuperSense ” rooted in our capacity for intuitive reasoning .
Drawing on recent research and historical examples , Hood convincingly makes a case that supernatural belief arises spontaneously well before cultural influences assert themselves .
I recently spent a few minutes with Professor Hood discussing his SuperSense theory and other topics from his book .
DiSalvo :
What is the “ SuperSense ” ?
Hood :
The SuperSense is a set of related beliefs that there are hidden dimensions to reality manifesting as energies , patterns and forces accounting for paranormal claims and experiences .
How would you describe these “ hidden dimensions to reality ” ?
Hood : People infer from their experience that there are hidden forces , energies and entities operating in the world .
From luck to God , people think there are hidden elements .
The main argument of the book is stated as , “ Children generate knowledge through their own intuitive reasoning about the world around them , which leads to both natural and supernatural beliefs . ”
Do children arrive at supernatural beliefs entirely before culture makes an imprint on their developing minds ?
If that ’s true , then what ’s the role of culture , to provide content for these beliefs ?
Hood : Not entirely .
Rather , children are inclined to those beliefs from culture which resonate with what they believe could be possible .
For example , pre-school children do not understand death as a final state .
When they are told that something has died they want to know where it has gone , so after - life beliefs either from religion or paranormal accounts are readily accepted .
However , if there was no culture to feed the children with after - life beliefs then the SuperSense theory predicts that such notions would arise spontaneously .
What we need is a “ Lord of the Flies ” scenario to test this prediction but the fact that after - life beliefs are present in all cultures strongly suggests that this is a universal belief .
You discuss the history of supernaturalism and mention a couple of surprising examples : one is the “ lion - man ” statuette that dates to 32,000 years ago , and another is evidence of ritualistic burials dating back 45,000 years .
What do these examples tell us about our species ’ supernatural leanings ?
Hood :
The lion - man statuette found in Germany is a therianthrope – part human part animal .
Many of the early religions dealt with such mythical creatures and possibly reflect early man ’s pre-occupation with hunting and how to improve success by appeasing the animal gods .
This is still present in a number of remaining hunting societies such as the Inuits .
I also think that it is no coincidence that therianthropy resembles young children ’s early anthropomorphism which is to attribute human properties to animals , though I neglected to cover this in SuperSense .
The early emergence of these beliefs , including ritualistic burials , in the dawn of civilization across differing groups strongly suggests that they are part of our mental machinery .
You say that the number one reason people believe in the supernatural is their own personal experience – and this for many is a sort of permanent inoculation against scientific explanations .
In light of that , is all of the time and energy spent by the scientific community and others to dispel supernatural explanations simple going to waste ?
Hood :
No , education is always a good thing .
But my point is that even scientists can seem to fence - ring their supernatural beliefs from their science .
For example , I recently attended a conference and discussed the nature of the book with colleagues .
What surprised me was that many colleagues admitted to superstitious rituals when it came to submitting grants and papers for review .
What do you think explains religious scientists ?
Hood :
Some scientists seem to happily shift from their rational , analytical approach to their topic and the supernatural aspects of their spiritual life .
Some endorse religion as a community activity whereas others are quite happy to entertain the possibility of secular supernaturalism .
I find it ironic that psychology , which is often considered a “ soft ” science , has more skeptics than physics , for example .
Maybe psychologists are more familiar with the foibles of the human mind whereas physicists understand the rules that govern the natural world .
You spend some time in the book discussing “ intuitive essentialism ” and how many supernatural beliefs arise from a sense of “ essentialist violation . ”
Please explain a bit about this .
Hood : Intuitive essentialism is an untaught notion that children spontaneously develop that living things have an inner substance ( essence ) that makes something what it truly is .
For example , pre-school children understand that there is a ‘ doggy ’ essence that makes dogs different from cats that have a ‘ catty ’ essence .
Well there is .
It ’s called DNA , but no pre-school child is taught this .
They simply infer this as part of their intuitive essentialism .
This is why apparent violation of the essence –for example , mixing up the species through either weird experiments or genetic modification –presents a violation to our notion that the essential integrity of an individual should not be violated .
How does this tie back to supernaturalism ?
Hood :
Well , in the book I explain how psychological essentialism helps the child to carve up the living world into different species and that this reflects an inference of essential integrity .
Hence , violations ( such as genetic modification ) challenge the identity of the animal .
Psychological essentialism also explains why individuals feel there is something inside living things that can be imbibed or transferred ; this property is considered the vitalistic essence of the animal .
This is why we eat certain foods for virility or animal strength , for example .
We all have , you say , “ totems and sacred objects , ” religious or otherwise , and that within each of us is a “ sacred super sense . ”
When I read that , I immediately thought of the pushback you ’ll likely receive for using the word “ sacred ” in reference to the secular .
Why does “ sacred ” fit here for you as a defensible description ?
Hood : I borrowed the term from the economic psychologist , Philip Tetlock who talked about sacred values , a set of taboos and beliefs that members of a social group share .
They are sacred because members of group should not violate them and hence they operate to sustain cohesion in the group .
In SuperSense , I argued how sacred values could be the totems , places , objects , rituals and all manner of items that are thought to have supernatural powers .
These objects are deemed to be supernatural because of our inherent SuperSense and so they are revered as being profound rather than mundane .
Otherwise , they would be just ordinary clumps of matter – which , of course , is exactly what they are , as indeed we all are .

“ Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano stunned many listeners during an appearance on CNN when she asserted that illegal immigration is really not a crime , ” reports Newsmax.com .
Questioning the actions of Sheriffs who are trying to impose the law and prevent illegal immigration , Napolitano stated , “ And yes , when we find illegal workers , yes , appropriate action , some of which is criminal , most of that is civil , because crossing the border is not a crime per se .
It is civil .
But anyway , going after those as well . ”
In actual fact , illegal immigration is …. you guessed it – illegal !
It ’s a crime .
“ Any alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers . . . shall , for the first commission of any such offense , be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 6 months , or both , ” the law states .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
One of the people named this week to President Obama 's new Task Force on Tax Reform is a member of the AIG board of directors .
Martin Feldstein , a professor of economics at Harvard University , has been on the board of American International Group since 1988 .
He also was a prominent economic adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush .
Asked about the AIG connection , a senior administration official said Friday that the White House declined to comment on the story .
Like the others named to the tax reform task force , Feldstein also serves on Obama 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board , which is headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker .
Joining Feldstein on the task force are Laura Tyson of the University of California at Berkeley and a former chairman of President Bill Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers ; Roger Ferguson , CEO of TIAA - CREF ; and Bill Donaldson , a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
In a teleconference briefing Wednesday , Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag said Obama believes the " prospective members of the board would be especially well - suited to carry out the mission of tax reform . "
The task force 's job description is to propose ways to simplify the tax code , reduce tax evasion , close loopholes and make changes in corporate tax breaks .
It is to provide recommendations to the president by December 4 .
No revenue target is being set , but the administration said it is placing two constraints on the group 's efforts : Members may not propose tax increases for 2009 and 2010 ; and beyond 2010 , they may not propose tax increases on families making less than $ 250,000 .
A major focus for the task force will be to reduce the estimated $ 300 billion - a - year tax gap , the difference between what individual and corporate taxpayers owe and what they actually pay .
The announcement of the tax - reform task force drew a cool reaction this week from the top Senate Democratic tax writer .
" We 'll certainly look at [ its recommendations ] , but we 're the Congress , we 'll do what we think makes sense , " Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus , D - Montana , told reporters .
CNN 's Jennifer Rizzo , CNNMoney.com 's Jeanne Sahadi and CNN White House Producer Shawna Shepherd contributed to this report .

Whatever happened to Robot Wars ?
That show was huge for a while but now seems to have disappeared into the ether .
It was probably canceled because the robots were always so rubbish .
This video shows footage from the Robo - One championships in Tokyo last year .
This category sees two - legged robots battling for the crown of ‘ Best Robot Fighter ’ .
It ’s like watching Muhammad Ali at the height of his powers .
The Japanese are obsessed with robotics , which is why the technology is evolving there much faster than anywhere else in the world .
Although , I ’m not too sure whether boxing robots are really going to change the world .
As robots become more advanced , it makes me worry about The Matrix coming true .
But , I do n’t think we yet have to worry because on this evidence , one little push can knock them over .
In fact , I could probably blow a robot … over .

The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , appears to have declared war on the government ’s own secret terror court , overruling decisions made by judges in the Special Immigration Appeals Court ( SIAC ) yesterday , and — in what can only be described as an act of executive fiat — unilaterally revoking their bail , kidnapping them on their way home from the London courtroom ( or in raids on their homes ) and imprisoning them in Belmarsh high - security prison in south east London .
After the Law Lords ’ ruling last week that Abu Qatada and two Algerians — known only as U and RB — can be deported to Jordan and Algeria , the government petitioned to revoke the bail conditions of U and RB , as well as three other men — known only as Y , Z and VV — but failed to inform their lawyers until Wednesday , and then gagged them , preventing them from discussing the cases until yesterday , when they mounted a challenge at a SIAC hearing in London .
An observer noted that the government ’s claims that it now had the right to revoke the bail of the five men was “ comprehensively trashed ” by Dinah Rose QC , representing the men .
More importantly , the SIAC judges ruled that no further action in respect of the men ’s cases was to be taken until next week at the earliest , and scheduled a full hearing for next Thursday morning .
However , when the two men who attended the hearing — U and VV — were driven away from the court , expecting to return home , as ordered by the SIAC judges , they were , instead , delivered to Belmarsh prison , where they were joined by the other three men , who had been seized in raids on their homes .
This was clearly planned by the Home Secretary in advance , even though she had informed neither the men ’s lawyers nor the SIAC judges .
The first the lawyers heard about it was when one of the men ’s wives rang , inquiring why he had not yet returned home .
SIAC is meeting again today , and the whole situation threatens to turn into a colossal headache for the government .
The men ’s lawyers will argue that the government was in contempt of court , and it is expected that Mr. Justice Mitting , the chief judge , will not be happy to hear that the government behaved as though SIAC ’s decisions were irrelevant , and , moreover , that the Home Secretary then acted in a manner that would have pleased King John , in those days before England ’s nobles forced him to sign the Magna Carta in 1215 , establishing for the first time that the king had no right to imprison his subjects “ except upon the lawful judgment of his peers or the law of the land . ”
Today , we seem to be experiencing a new version of the divine right of kings : the self - declared right of an elected government official to ignore her own judges , and to cast foreign “ terror suspects ” into the modern day version of the Tower of London — Belmarsh prison — with no regard for the laws established over the last 794 years .
UPDATE at 1 pm :
In a humiliating defeat for the government , the SIAC judges have just ruled that all of the men — except U — are to be released from Belmarsh and allowed to return home under previously agreed conditions .
The humiliation of Jacqui Smith will hopefully soon be announced in greater detail .
UPDATE at 3 pm : I ’ve just heard from observers that the judges ’ decision to order four of the five men to be sent home was chosen as an alternative to the lawyers ’ recommended course of action : nailing Jacqui Smith for contempt of court and kidnap .
SIAC will now be meeting next Wednesday ( March 4 ) to discuss the European Court of Human Rights ’ objections to the British government ’s use of Special Advocates in closed court sessions , and the rules preventing the Special Advocates from reporting any information whatsoever to either the accused or their lawyers .
A hearing to review U ’s bail conditions is scheduled for March 5 , and another hearing , examining the government ’s request to revoke all the men ’s existing bail conditions and to imprison them in Belmarsh by legal means is scheduled for March 11 .
Please come along if you can .
Hearings start at 9.30 am.
SIAC is located at Field House , 15 Bream ’s Buildings , London EC4A 1DZ .

The band played Wembley Stadium for Live Earth in 2007 Spoof band Spinal Tap have announced a " world tour " consisting of a single June date at London 's Wembley Arena .
The tour marks the 25th anniversary of mockumentary film , This is Spinal Tap , which launched the band 's career .
The band will be backed by 1960s folk trio The Folksmen , the focus of another spoof film , 2003's A Mighty Wind .
Spinal Tap 's lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel commented : " If we 're going to do a World tour on only one night , at least it 's this world . "
Bassist Derek Smalls added : " one night is not enough , and it 's way too much " .
Spinal
Tap have used a variety of drummers over the years due several untimely deaths , including a spontaneous combustion on stage .
The rest of the line - up for the world tour has not been announced but the group paid tribute to former members .
Singer and rhythm guitarist David St Hubbins said : " This show will be dedicated to all of our drummers who have passed on , either to their reward or to middle management at Sainsbury 's . "
' Unstoppable '
The band also announced that they had tried in vain to produce some new material and will instead be releasing a new lost album this summer .
Their last tour was the Back from the Dead series of gigs in the US and Canada in 2000 and in 2007 they appeared at Live Earth .
Bassists from almost every other act on the bill including Metallica , Foo Fighters and Beastie Boys , joined Spinal Tap on stage in an effort to get the noise level up to 11 - a comedy reference to the film .
The announcement of the new tour comes after the band revealed on their website that their Unstoppable tour , scheduled for this year , had been cancelled .
The men behind Spinal Tap will be touring in their own right this summer A letter from the tour promoter explained : " The poor economy plays a role in this decision , as does the band 's history , pertaining to shows . "
Spinal Tap are played by Harry Shearer , Christopher Guest and Michael McKean .
The three actors will be touring America this summer in their own personae for a series of acoustic gigs called Unwigged and Unplugged .

Failed republican presidential candidate John McCain 's daughter has been a strong and outspoken ally of the LGBT community , in a party where alliance with queers is frowned upon , and downright politically suicidal .
Meghan McCain feels free to voice her opinion , not as a candidate but merely as a concerned progressive republican who supports abortion rights and gay marriage .
She maintains that gay issues are a generational divide and that the younger generation supports gay rights in record high numbers .
She goes on to say :
" If the Republican Party has any hope of gaining substantial support from a wider , younger base , we need to get past our anti-gay rhetoric . "

After three weeks of carnage in Gaza , there were tentative signs of a ceasefire last night .
But the bitter legacy of the past 22 days for Israel is that , while it declares victory on the battlefield , the country 's reputation has rarely sunk so low .
Yesterday the United Nations called for a war crimes investigation after two children , aged five and seven , were killed when , it claimed , an Israeli tank shell hit a school sheltering some of the more than 40,000 internally displaced refugees .
" These two little boys are as innocent , indisputably , as they are dead , " said John Ging , head of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) in Gaza .
In Jerusalem , Chris Gunness , the organisation 's spokesman , added : " There has to be an investigation to determine whether a war crime has been committed . "

Mr Gunness used unusually strong language .
But the call came at the culmination not only of a rising civilian death toll but also a series of attacks on UN installations and , in some cases , the people who were under the UN 's care at the time .
The most lethal of these was an earlier shelling in which 43 internally displaced Gazans , sheltering in the Fakhura UNRWA school in Jabalya , were killed on 6 January .
Yet last week , an attack was launched that was – or should have been – as diplomatically embarrassing .
For while the UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon was in the region for talks with Israeli ministers , an attack was launched on the main UNRWA compound , injuring three , setting fire to fuel and food in the depot with what Mr Ging said was white phosphorus , and sending up a dense plume of black smoke which became the defining image of the day 's television coverage .
While Mr Ban said that the defence minister , Ehud Barak , had apologised for a " grave error " , government spokesmen immediately suggested – just as they had initially in the Jabalya case , although UNRWA officials say this was later retracted in private conversations – that there had been firing by militants from in or around the UN compound .
Mr Ging described the claim as " nonsense " , adding that the UN had warned the Israelis that the compound was in danger from shelling , and had provided them with GPS co-ordinates to prevent an attack .
It began to seem like a pattern : after each episode of " collateral damage " , international organisations would accuse the Israeli military of targeting buildings and civilian areas ; then the Israelis would respond that they had simply returned fire after Hamas fighters had used these places to launch attacks .
There was no discussion of whether the Israeli military 's use of force was proportionate or not .
But while international concern grew over the rising daily toll of deaths in Gaza , the Israeli government continued to receive consistent majority support domestically .
A common view expressed by many Israelis was that Hamas had brought it all upon itself by continuing to fire rockets into southern Israel for the past eight years .
By last night , it was beginning to look as if the Israeli mood was changing .
With an election looming and , even more decisively perhaps , a new US president ready to take office on Tuesday , foreign minister Tzipi Livni and Mr Barak were both – however belatedly – ready to call a halt at the beginning of last week .
Only the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , apparently eager to exorcise the failures of Lebanon in 2006 , appeared to be pursuing the war with enthusiasm .
Few Israelis have yet publicly recalled the prescient remark of one of the fathers of modern Zionism , Chaim Weizmann : " The world will judge the Jewish state by the way it will treat the Arabs . "
For many Israelis the cost of the war became clear when a Hebrew - speaking physician , Izz el - Deen Aboul Aish , who had been frequently interviewed on prime - time TV by a top reporter , Shlomi Eldar , phoned the journalist live on air to announce that his three daughters had been killed .
" My God , my girls , Shlomi , " viewers heard him say .
" Ca n't anybody get to us , please ? "
As Mr Eldar got the authorities to allow rescue services to the stricken family , it was not lost on commentators that the same disaster was striking hundreds of other families without direct access to Israeli TV .
Ari Shavit , a leading columnist on the newspaper , ' Haaretz ' , was a fervent proponent of the " just war " at the outset .
By Friday , he was writing : " Shelling a United Nations facility is something not to be done at any time , but doing it on the day when the UN Secretary - General is visiting Jerusalem is beyond lunacy .
The level of pressure the Israel Defence Forces have been exerting on Gaza may be squeezing Hamas , but it is destroying Israel .
Destroying its soul and its image .
Destroying it on world television screens , destroying it in the living rooms of the international community ... "
And that really irritates me .
Here are the rest of us , from the the family of four having trouble paying for college education to your neighbor just trying to make ends meet , who have to pick up the slack .
Is it any wonder that when you combine the tax breaks for the richest Americans with the lack of income tax from corporations , that our country ’s infrastructure is headed down the tubes ?
Nearly two - thirds of U.S. companies and 68 % of foreign corporations do not pay federal income taxes , according to a congressional report released Tuesday .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) examined samples of corporate tax returns filed between 1998 and 2005 .
In that time period , an annual average of 1.3 million U.S. companies and 39,000 foreign companies doing business in the United States paid no income taxes – despite having a combined $ 2.5 trillion in revenue .
The article says the method for the various companies ( who remain unnamed ) to escape paying income taxes varies – some of them report $ 0 income before deducting their expenses and others find deductions equaling more than their reported income .
Some of the companies are small businesses , but they say they still end up paying taxes because the income gets moved onto personal tax returns ( kind of like individual LLC companies ) .
“ The tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking Americans who pay their fair share of taxes , ” Dorgan said in a statement .
I could not agree more , and something needs to be done asap .
It is not fair to individual tax payers who have to worry about being audited or getting trapped by the AMT .
If I somehow found enough deductions to escape paying income taxes , I am sure that I would have a visit from the government .
It ’s just not right .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Below are reactions to Chancellor Alistair Darling ’s budget statement to parliament on Wednesday .
MARKET REACTION
KEITH BOWMAN , ANALYST , HARGREAVES LANDSDOWN
“ I do n’t think we ’re seeing a massive amount of movement .
I think the market as always was attempting to price in some of the comments that we heard beforehand .
“ We already had some of the house builders a little firmer prior to the budget , the life insurance sector , again , was already a little weaker .
“ You could get a secondary reaction from the equity market , depending if the fixed interest markets were to take things badly . ”
MARK PRIEST , SENIOR TRADER , ETX CAPITAL
“ Some of the banking stocks came down and we saw ( insurer ) Prudential fall quite sharply .
“ I mean to be honest with you the ( equity ) markets have n’t really reacted .
They are down but they have n’t reacted massively negatively . ”
“ ( The budget ) does n’t paint a particularly rosy picture I did n’t think .
Unemployment figures as we saw today were back up , with the level of debt that the government has thrown us into I think people are going to be very concerned to be honest . ”
GEOFFREY YU , CURRENCY STRAGETIST , UBS
“ That debt - to - GDP ratio is a bit to the high side ...
People are wondering if the UK will be able to sustain its borrowing needs .
“ I ’m going to be interested in seeing what the ratings agencies have to say in the next few days .
Any whiff that they will have to review the UK ’s ratings because of this , then you ’re going to see a wave of sterling selling .
That ’s the risk right now .
“ The market ’s not going to like the tax bit either .
You ca n’t run an international financial centre with a top tax bracket of 50 percent .
The UK has a funding gap problem , and you want people to bring money into the country ; people will have second thoughts about that . ”
LAUREN ROSBOROUGH , FX STRATEGIST , WESTPAC
“ At the margin , the UK Budget is worse than the market had anticipated .
Over the medium term , potential growth in the UK has fallen and the fair value of sterling is lower .
Net net , this will weigh on cable and in the short - term it could stymie the recent appreciation in sterling crosses . ”
RUSSELL BLOOM , FOREX ANALYST , ACTION ECONOMICS
“ The FX market is worried about the debt market ’s ability to absorb the amount of issuance for the next year .
A lack of interest could see speculation of IMF aid rear its head again .
I think this is the fear that is being priced into the market . ”
PHYLLIS PAPADAVID , FOREX STRATEGIST , SOCGEN
“ It ’s not positive , and we ’re seeing sterling weaken on the news .
The fiscal slippage in the near - term is not doing sterling any favours . ”
NEIL JONES , HEAD OF HEDGE FUND FOREX SALES , MIZUHO
“ I would expect sterling to weaken across the board following the income tax changes .
The market will consider the disincentive to effort and possible brain drain effects of possible talent moving abroad . ”
CHRIS HOSSAIN , SENIOR SALES MANAGER , ODL SECURITIES
“ Darling was in an unenviable position .
Paint an encouraging picture and the markets do n’t believe him , and add to the gloom , and see markets fall away .
“ The initial reaction from the ( stock ) market is muted -- it ’s encouraging that we have n’t seen a dramatic decline , which could be deemed positive in these turbulent times .
“ It will be more pertinent to see how markets react over the next few sessions as we have more time to digest the news . ”
POLITICAL REACTION
DAVID CAMERON , LEADER , OPPOSITION CONSERVATIVE PARTY
“ He is planning to borrow 348 billion pounds over the next two years , that is more -- over just two years -- than every previous government put together , not just every government since World War Two ... but since the Bank of England was first founded more than 300 years ago .
“ This budget does not do enough to bring the public finances under control . ”
NICK CLEGG , LEADER , OPPOSITION LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
“ The worst of times demands the best of budgets but today we got a mish mash of recycled announcements .
“ The economic crash is not the result of a few minor mistakes , patchwork repairs wont fix it .
We need to do something fundamentally different and that needs to start with a different kind of banking system .
“ We need a banking system where no bank is too big to fail , where high street banks take no unnecessary risks with people ’s money . ”
GOVERNMENT BORROWING
PHILIP SHAW , CHIEF ECONOMIST , INVESTEC
“ The Chancellor has hinted at some tightening in fiscal policy from next year and together with stronger economic growth that should begin to deliver an improvement in the budget deficit .
“ However with net borrowing expected to be 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013 / 14 we would still point out that this is an extremely high level of government borrowing over the medium term .
“ In pound terms the 97 billion is greater than the deficit which was recorded in 2008 / 09 , just to give an idea of the scale of it . ”
ECONOMIC FORECASTS
ALAN CLARKE , UK ECONOMIST , BNP PARIBAS
“ On GDP I think - 3.5 percent is still too optimistic ... I think its more like - 4.5 than - 3.5 .
“ I think he is too optimistic on growth in the out years , 2010 and 2011 .
To have a bounceback of 3.5 percent in 2011 when you are taxing people , when interest rates are going to be normalised , I think that is a bit too optimistic so ultimately borrowing will probably be a bit higher in the later years . ”
STEPHEN LEWIS , CHIEF ECONOMIST , INSINGER DE BEAUFORT
“ I think this year ’s forecast is probably fairly realistic .
It ’s probably going to sit somewhere between between three and four percent ( contraction ) .
“ Next year , it seems a shade optimistic to me .
Most forecasters would be looking for recovery to start early next year and therefore looking for slightly less growth than what he sees .
It would be in the 0.5 to 1 percent range .
“ What ’s most unrealistic of all is his projection for years 2011 onwards because I think it ’s going to be difficult to achieve 3.5 pct growth annually over that period . ”
JONATHAN LOYNES , CHIEF ECONOMIST , CAPITAL ECONOMICS
“ I think they are as we expected him to announce but they are stronger than ours , we ’ve got the economy contracting by 4 percent this year and then by another 1 next year so we would be more pessimistic than him .
“ It is a bit more optimistic than the consensus forecast for next year but not dramatically so . ”
BUDGET MEASURES
HENK POTTS , STRATEGIST , BARCLAYS WEALTH
“ The Chancellor is being more cautious than he has been on his estimates , highlighting what a perilous state the country ’s finances are in and what a desperate state the UK economy is in . ”
Sometimes when I ’m in the kitchen making fresh cheese , I imagine what it must have been like for the primitive nomads who first discovered that the fresh , sweet liquid they had so laboriously milked from their precious flocks quickly soured in the goatskin storage bag .
The choice was simple -- either throw it away or learn how to preserve and enjoy it .
The solution was ingenious , though not surprising : the invention of sour - milk - based dairy products and cheeses .
FOR THE RECORD :
Jewish festival : A Food section article about the Jewish holiday Shavuot said the festival ended at sundown Friday .
That is the practice in Israel .
For most Jews in the United States , it ended at sundown Saturday . —
I ’ll be making fresh cheeses again for Shavuot , the Jewish harvest festival celebrated this year beginning at sundown Thursday and running through sundown Friday .
In ancient times , Shavuot was a joyous pilgrimage festival celebrating the annual wheat harvest , when thousands of farmers and their extended families traveled to the Great Temple in Jerusalem to offer a basket of wheat and their first fruits to God .
Then , acting on behalf of the whole nation , the high priest would place on the altar the offering that is unique to Shavuot : two loaves of bread , baked from the newly harvested wheat .
So why make cheese ?
Because just as the holiday has changed over the millenniums , so have the culinary customs .
Centuries after the destruction of the Temple , exiled to foreign shores , the scholars of the Talmud infused the holiday with new meaning ; the ancient harvest festival , they explained , coincided with a “ spiritual harvest ” -- namely , the date the Torah was revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai .
To prepare for this blessed event , legend has it that the children of Israel ate only dairy products to purify themselves , and in Hebrew numerology , or gematria , the word for milk ( halav ) equals 40 -- the same number of days Moses spent on Mt. Sinai as he waited to receive the laws .
This was incentive enough to have dairy products evolve as an integral part in the holiday ’s fare .
Nature itself , though , provides another explanation .
Like the spring holidays of ancient Canaan and Rome , Shavuot occurs in the season when animals grazing in the lush pastures green from winter rains produce an abundance of milk ; cheese - making , too , was part of spring harvest festivals around the world .
But in those days , you would n’t expect to find a Roquefort or a cheddar .
Even before the advent of global warming , the hot climate in the Middle East precluded the aging of cheese .
Instead , what you would expect to find is creamy fresh white cheeses that were eaten fresh , rolled into balls and packed in olive oil , or dried in lumps for transporting on camelback to be grated as need be .
For example , yogurt cheese ( labneh ) was an excellent way to expand the limited repertoire of foods in the diet and prolong the “ shelf life ” of yogurt .
It could be drained until soft and used as a spread , or left to drain until firm and turned into balls , which could then be marinated in olive oil and herbs for extended storage .
To make it , place a large wire - mesh strainer inside a large bowl .
Cut three or four layers of cheesecloth into 20 - inch squares .
Moisten the cheesecloth in cold water , then wring out and line the strainer .
Spoon a quart of cow ’s , sheep ’s or goat ’s milk yogurt into the cheesecloth , then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth , pressing the yogurt just a little to extract some of the liquid .
Twist the four corners to squeeze out more of the liquid .
Untwist the cloth and tie two sides of the fabric together .
Suspend the package over the bowl or a sink , leaving it to drain at room temperature until the yogurt is the consistency of cream cheese , several hours to overnight .
( Squeeze the package from time to time to speed draining . )
Or do the same thing with a quart of sour cream ( seasoned with about one - half teaspoon salt ) , leaving it to drain until it is soft -- three or four hours -- and you can use it as a first course for dipping with bread , in the same way that hummus or labneh is used today .
Allowed to drain slightly longer -- say , overnight -- it can become sufficiently firm to be made into balls , like labneh .
It is a superb substitute for regular cream cheese in any recipe .
So to add a little authenticity to my holiday table , I already have my yogurt and sour cream draining in separate cheesecloth bundles over my kitchen sink .
We ’re certainly no longer nomads , and our shiny refrigerators will keep milk fresh just about as long as we want it .
But making your own fresh cheese takes virtually no work and tastes better than anything you could buy in a store .

Ivor van Heerden -- knows too much about why Katrina happened
A message from Mr. [ Michael ]
Ruffner , the vice chancellor for communications [ at LSU ] , to Dr. van Heerden after their meeting stated that the university wanted to be in on helping with the recovery of Louisiana , " not in pointing blame . ”
In an interview Mr. Ruffner said Dr. van Heerden 's training in environmental management did not qualify him to comment on engineering matters .
" We do n't see him as a viable source to be discussing the engineering aspect of the levees , " he said .
" I have an advanced degree in communications , but that does n't qualify me to comment on the New York Philharmonic . "
The federal government is the largest source of research funding for universities , and LSU was lining up tens of millions of dollars for coastal and wetlands work -- much of which might be partnered with the corps .
Having one of its professors lobbing bombs at the feds made some at the university fear for the LSU pocketbook .
Besides eating too much utility pizza and writing all day , I ’m working with a non -profit group here in New York .
We recently sat down for an interview and casual show and tell with Carl Deal and Tia Lessin , the directors of , a documentary about Hurricane Katrina .
Now bear in mind that these guys produced , so as you can imagine , they have some pretty strong and well articulated opinions about Katrina .
At the end of our time together , I asked Mr. Deal the question “ what do you think was the real reason behind Katrina ? ” -- a question I ask of anyone involved in a substantial way just to see their answer .
His reply stuck with me because it was the most lucid and simple thing I have ever heard about Katrina : “ The tragedy of Katrina happened because people in power made a decision that other people were going to die .
” Indeed , the chess board is that simple , but the pieces have complex stories .
As a simple boy from Louisiana now spending a little time in the Big Apple , I have found that one way to explain the convoluted mess of Hurricane Katrina to people is to compare some of its features to 9/11 .
Both of these events were life - changing for many people , they both created many casualties , they both involved a massive clean - up effort , and they both were completely predictable by anyone who knew anything about intelligence management , communication science , and had half a brain in their head .
They both were , to use the language of Max Bazerman , a “ predictable surprise ” -- a type of event that is empirically predictable , but psychologically unacceptable to predict .
In other words , something that happens because of the human tendency to avoid making a decision that involves incurring significant cost in the present in exchange for the mitigation of theoretically catastrophic cost in the future .
( Wall Street , anyone ? )
It is here that the similarities between 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina end .
Hurricane Katrina obviously did not receive the same level of coordinated response as 9/11 .
More importantly , 9/11 did not take place in Louisiana , a place that is as wonderful and charming as it is backwards and corrupt .
At this moment , I am scared for my friends and family in New Orleans and South Louisiana .
Hurricane Katrina was The Event for many people because it was like watching a nightmare in slow motion .
At this moment I know that it will happen again .
It is as predictable as algebra and inevitable as gravity .
Because Louisiana State University has fired Dr. Ivor van Heerden , a research scientist who has criticized the Army Corps of Engineers and their role in the construction of the levees , I worry that the state itself and New Orleans in particular are headed in direction that will make the re-flooding of New Orleans another predictable surprise , again .
Was Louisiana State University professor Dr. van Heerden fired from his position because he dared to criticize the engineering skills of the Army Corps of Engineers ?
Is LSU worried about their funding from the Feds so much that they are willing to throw out the truth along with their dignity and responsibility towards the citizens of Louisiana ?
Does this criticism of the ACE put LSU in a position where they have to fire van Heerden because they are dependent on Federal grant money to keep up the status quo ?
Probably .
The facts of the case seem to answer all of these questions in the affirmative .
But because LSU won’t / ca n’t release any comments or documents about ongoing personnel decisions , we may never really know .
Instead of drawing the dots that may or may not be there , I ’ll stick to the ones that glare out to me , namely , the dots that , when looked at from far above the fog of bureaucracy , spell out the words .
How is the role of expertise corrupted when it comes to public safety ?
These are the relevant facts : Dr.Ivor van Heerden was the Deputy Director of the LSU Hurricane Center and Associate Professor of Research with the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at LSU .
He will be let go within a year .
Now , there ’s a lot of people in various comment sections of the blogosphere that argue that since he ’s still there , why is everybody up in arms that he was fired ?
The answer is that egg - head jobs are n’t like normal jobs .
If you are a professor and you have n’t made tenure yet , you can be fired for all kinds of reasons : not publishing enough , not glad handing the right departmental oldsters , anything really that the tenure committee decides .
Yet , unlike regular jobs , most of the time your get a 6 month or 1 year heads up before you canned .
Nevertheless , he still got the axe .
Recently thepointed out that Van Heerden was the leader of " Team Louisiana , " the official independent state - funded investigation of the Katrina flooding .
That panel found that the levee failures reflected poor design , bad science and shoddy engineering on the part of the Corps .
The Bush Administration had held the levee failures were an " act of God .
" Calling the failures an act of God essentially means that no one is responsible for the failure of the levees because no one could have planned for an event like Hurricane Katrina .
Van Heerden ’s point is that the danger was always there , and we could have planned for it .
My point is that if we ca n’t put our finger on the reasons why the levees fail , then they will fail again .
At this point , I ’m sure some Bushite will throw up their hands and mash their teeth about how they do n’t want to play the .
Indeed , the blame game does not interest me in the slightest , but thebehind the levee failures is still a pertinent and scientifically valid question .
It is not our job to sue the company that made the toxic waste that allegedly caused the cancer , but it is our task to find out where that waste may be .
Recently , van Heerden was removed as the deputy director of the LSU Hurricane Center .
Soon he will be without a job at all .
Engineering professor Marc Levitan resigned from his position as the director of the LSU Hurricane Center over the firing of van Heerden .
Less than two weeks ago , students at LSU protested the firing of Dr. van Heerden .
Citizens of New Orleans have also protested the firing of van Heerden , who has become somewhat of a local hero .
As a former academic , I can tell you that when the public starts protesting against the firing of a professor , then something is up .
So here ’s a quick review -- Back in 2006 , when van Heerden ’s book ( a wonderful book full of data , although the prose is somewhat tortuous ) came out , a work that was critical of the Government and the Army Corps of Engineers , the reported that :
This type of dangerous and infantile argument is repeatedly leveled , both officially and unofficially , against van Heerden and in general anybody who speaks about the Gov ’s FUBAR before , during , and after Katrina .
Now , despite the dozens of issues with this situation , here ’s where things really start to go down the toilet for LSU , because this is the point where LSU officials , true to their style , begin to depart from any semblance of reality .
What has to be made clear is that van Heerden has a PhD in marine science .
Apparently , Ruffner does n’t understand that levees that hold back water from drowning cities occasionally have interaction with substances called “ water ” and “ soil , ” topics which are covered in monastic detail by marine scientists .
In fact , van Heerden is an expert on geotechnical soil issues that pertain to foundational failures .
Or , to parse it down a bit for the Ruffner crowd , van Heerden knows a lot about dirt that goes under stuff , stuff like levees .
Ruffner admits that he is n’t qualified to conduct the Philharmonic , but omitted in his reasoning is the fact that he is n’t qualified to speak about geotechnical soil issues either .
But , his job is to be the chief spin-minister of LSU , so this is to be expected .
Even more interesting is the implication of this for experts caught in similar circumstances between the truth and hard place ( made of government funding ) .
What does it mean to be an expert in an academic and research environment composed of various , interlocking , monetary fulcrums ?
I ’m old enough to know the reality is that funding trumps scientific validity half the time anyway , but the funding that LSU might be buying by firing van Heerden is not purchased with firing one man , it is purchased via the safety of over a million human beings living in the New Orleans metropolitan area who will not be protected in the future because the truth of an engineering failure has been willfully oppressed , and therefore will not be corrected to any substantial degree .
What the bureaucrats at LSU do n’t get is thatis no longer a matter of simple .
Although we still see the conflation of the two in some of the natural sciences , and perhaps even some branches of theoretical mathematics , the idea that the topical area on your PhD diploma means that you are only an expert in that area is laughable .
First , sometimes people who get advanced degrees keep learning , reading , and doing things in other areas , which is sometimes part of being a responsible intellectual -- you go where the evidence demands , even if its into a related field that is n’t written on your diploma .
Second , technology such as levees is cannot be compartmentalized into a specialization such as civil engineering .
Levees are a type of technology that represents a sort of expertise “ nexus , ” a physical manifestation of where many specializations meet .
For example , consider the science and art of prosthetic limbs .
The A - list for this technology includes electrical engineers , mechanical engineers , rehabilitative therapists , sculptures , and physicians .
What people like Ruffner are arguing is that only the physician is qualified to speak about prosthetic limbs , whereas the mechanical engineer who specializes in prosthetic limb development is not qualified to speak because he is n’t an M.D ...
The same situation is going on with LSU attempting to muzzle van Heerden .
You ca n’t understand an event like Katrina from a viewpoint of academic specialization .
Any attempt to do so will result in a false description and diagnosis of the problem .
Academic specializations were developed in a day and age ( in Germany ) when those categories made sense , but they have no place in a catastrophic failure like Katrina , which requires solid investigative skills and good general scientific expertise , not fidelity to your original specialization .
Even though van Heerden ’s degree is not in civil engineering , he still knows a hell of a lot about levees , and moreover the dirt underneath them , which might be an important thing if , say , a hurricane went over New Orleans and pushed the levees out of the ground because the soil was n’t structurally sound enough to support said levees .
Van Heerden also know a lot about how the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet ( MRGO ) , built by the ACE at tremendous cost with almost zero return , has allowed salt - water into the wetlands and thus destroyed both the marsh and its ability to lessen the effects of storm surge that helped destroy the levees .
Van Heerden was still the deputy director of the Hurricane Center and head of Team Louisiana when the downplaying of this qualifications began , but most damningly against LSU , every other scientific and engineering body that has examined the New Orleans Levee problem agrees with van Heerden , with the exception of the Army Corps of Engineers .
For example , Raymond Seed , a UC Berkeley professor of engineering said very plainly in a letter to the American Society of Civil Engineers that " ' My own University ( U.C. Berkeley ) was also approached in an inappropriate manner during that same Winter of 2005 - 06 , but such untoward pressures were simply rebuffed .
That , in the end , probably goes right to the heart of what really separates a top - flight university with one of the top Colleges of Engineering in the nation ( and the top- rated Department of Civil Engineering in the nation ) from a university like LSU .
" Burn .
It ’s also interesting that the American Society of Civil Engineers refers to the breaking of the New Orleans levees as “ the worst engineering catastrophe in U.S. history . ”
What about the money ?
Nola.com reported that
If you ’re from Louisiana , this might not be a surprise for you .
Because all of Louisiana ’s oil platforms are more 3 miles off our coast , the Federal Government receives all of the oil and gas royalties produced by those facilities , unlike states like Texas and Wyoming that get to keep the money .
Louisiana produces between 20 and 25 % of all of the oil and natural gas in this country , and so obviously if we got to keep that money , I would not be writing this because the levees would have been made out of gold - reinforced concrete topped with diamonds and therefore still standing .
But , because the Feds get all the cash , universities like LSU are almost totally reliant upon them to ration out money , and the Army Corps of Engineers is practically forced to build everything on the cheap .
All of this begs the question of who is really at fault -- I would say that the ACE has some responsibility here , but it is really the Feds that want van Heerden to shut up .
If everyone woke up to the idea that Louisiana would be the richest state in the Union if we kept our own petro-royalities , the Feds might lose their infinite piggy bank .
If people realized that if we had that money we could build levees that would last a thousand years , then the Feds could n’t keep Louisiana on a leash to maintain its golden goose status .
The ACE is not the ultimate problem , the Fed ’s greed is , and the ACE is only an agent of that greed .
Some people might argue that with these kinds of monetary stakes , maybe LSU should fire van Heerden for the greater good of the University , another cash cow with its 35,000 students and kick - ass football team .
Of course , that line of reasoning makes perfect sense , as long as we unblinkingly buy into the unsaid assumption .
It makes sense to fire him as long as the only ethical model we have to gauge this situation is cost - benefit analysis in terms of sheer dollars .
I start from a very different place , namely , preventing people from dying and cities being destroyed .
Consider what will happen to the next guy in this position .
Will he stifle the truth in order to not rock the boat even though it means that south Louisiana will flood again and again ?
Why does funding for LSU take precedence of the safety of the citizenry ?
Money is always a factor , but this entire line of thought is the exact same kind of logic that made the event what it was in the first place -- save money now , spend hundreds of billions in the future to repair the inevitable damage .
Sure , ditching van Heerden means LSU gets its blood money for the next couple years , but the cost will be the re-flooding of New Orleans and hence the rebuilding of the city and the housing of hundreds of thousands of people .
What is LSU going to do , get rid of everyone that wants to talk about the real reasons that New Orleans was made into a wasteland ?
I think they can and they will , and this is my point .
This attack on expertise is not about who is qualified to speak about what .
The attack and firing of van Heerden is n’t even about tenure or academia ; the ivory tower is so corrupt that it is the height of naiveté to look to it as a place of redemption for galvanizing the populace in the quest for truth .
The firing of van Heerden is aboutso that the system that oppresses Louisiana and keeps the Feds happy continues .
It ’s about making the public un - safe so that the people of Louisiana will continue to do what they ’re told , and therefore keep those royalties in the hands of the Man .
The officials at LSU are Bush cronies and lackeys , so what .
Because that administration seemed to reward being incapable and mediocre is not my concern .
We should ferret out stupidity in any form .
And I hate to be a cheese ball and semi-quote Mel Gibson ’s , but I feel like LSU is so concerned with squabbling over scraps from the Feds table that they ’ve missed their god given right to something better .
Is the ACE to blame ?
Sure , sue them to hell if you can ( the lawsuit against them started a few days ago ; interestingly van Heerden is set to be a witness -- too bad his credibility is wrecked ) .
But there ’s plenty of blame to go around , and if you look at this situation with the right frame of mind , you ’re bound to see that the ACE simply for what it is -- just another special interest group .
They ’re selfish and somewhat incompetent , but not the devil behind the strings .
If you want to save van Heerden , save New Orleans , and get the levees rebuilt correctly , then we have to get our own money and stop relying on the Feds and ACE .
Everything else is just fingers in the dam .
Any other path is folly .
Make no mistake , New Orleans will flood again , and then you will see what I am talking about .
For me , it will be another day where I have to blink the tears away from my eyes and say “ I told you so . ”

I found this image on Reddit .
It shows the space needed to transport a certain number of people by car , bus or bicycle .
If you look closely though , you ’ll see that different zoom levels are used in different photos .
This is my attempt to rectify that with a bit of cropping .
The photos still show the significant problems with cars .
I came up with the idea for this particular ice cream for this weekend ’s Bacon Camp , an event put on by Karen ( and … ? ) .
I wanted to make something decadent and amazing that no one had tasted ever before .
I was inspired by a few sources .
Kasey ’s bacon - infused Maker ’s Mark came to mind ( so smoky ! ) , as did Doc Pop ’s limited edition fro-yo with Cinnamon Toast Crunch , bacon bits , and maple syrup on top .
I had the pleasure of having a bowl of it last week .
Utterly delicious .
When I got on the web to start researching how to put this recipe together , I found that I was not the first to attempt this bacon ice cream thing .
The recipe to which I owe the greatest credit was David Lebovitz ’s Candied Bacon Ice Cream .
It even has a bit of alcohol in it , though it is less of a focus .
I ran into trouble with his recipe , though .
The bacon did n’t candy as I ’d hoped it would .
The problem was that the technique did n’t allow the fat and moisture to drain at all– American bacon has a LOT more fat than French bacon , judging from the pictures .
What I got , even after cooking for an additional 10 minutes , was delicious sticky gooey floppy bacon , not crisp little bacon bits encased in hard sugar as I ’d hoped .
I tucked those away in the fridge for , uh , safekeeping and moved on to the next candied bacon recipe — this one posted on epicurious , care of Gourmet magazine , February 2007 .
I used brown sugar instead of demerara sugar , and chopped the bacon into bits before cooking them .
Though it was better than the last , this recipe failed me too .
I found that even after I drained the pan , the residual oil and crusty bacon stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan caused the sugar to melt unevenly and not cover the bacon very well .
Ultimately , the result tasted burnt–partly , I think , because the sugar burnt slightly ( being brown sugar , I could n’t tell when it was caramelized ) , and partly because the bacon stuff on the bottom of the pan burned .
The bacon bits also stuck together , and the candy surrounding them was slightly tacky on the tooth , rather than being crisp , like I wanted .
Lastly , the bacon was overdone .
Still pretty tasty , but not good enough .
Armed with my newfound knowledge , I devised a plan of my own : cook the bacon bits to perfection , let them drain on paper towels .
In a small , clean sauce pan , melt regular white sugar just until the sugar is dissolved .
Add bacon bits and quickly coat them , then pull them out and put them on parchment paper .
Third time ’s the charm ; it worked beautifully !
Well , mostly .
When the sugar cooled almost instantly as it hit the bacon , it all stuck together into a giant bacony , sugary glob .
This made it difficult to get even coverage .
I spent a while painstakingly separating the bits into more managable pieces .
While it could have been a little better , the result was close enough : slightly crisp , slightly tender bacon bits encased in a crisp sugar shell .
For the ice cream itself , I used David Lebovitz ’s recipe , with a few slight alterations : I used 1/ 4 cup Maker ’s Mark * instead of a mere 2 teaspoons , I added 1 1/ 2 teaspoons molasses , and I nixed the cinnamon .
One very important thing I learned when making the custard was not to let the initial butter / brown sugar / half & half mixture get too hot .
It will curdle and you will have to throw it away .
I somehow managed to do this TWICE .
Do n’t let it boil , heck do n’t let it bubble at all .
Just warm it up .
Be similarly careful you ’ve added the eggs in , too .
* Note : do n’t be tempted to try to reduce the bourbon in an attempt to get the ice cream to freeze better .
It just ruins the bourbon , which will make you very , very sad .
The ice cream will freeze just fine , I promise .
Lastly , I had to make the maple caramel swirl for the ice cream .
I used this recipe–also from epicurious / Gourmet November 1998 – and substituted maple sugar for the light corn syrup .
It did n’t turn out perfectly .
I believe I did n’t let the sugar / syrup / water mixture boil for long enough because I could n’t tell when it was an appropriate “ deep golden caramel ” color– the color of the maple syrup threw me off .
A candy thermometer would help with this , though I do n’t know what temp to bring it to .
I ended up adding the cream / vanilla mixture too soon , and it did n’t seize up like it said it would .
I try to cook it for a long time after the cream had been added to compensate , and in the end I got a caramel that was the perfect consistency , except it was a bit grainy in texture .
I ’m not sure if that ’s from the milk solids curdling or the maple syrup crystalizing , but it still tastes DELICIOUS ( and maple syrup is expensive ) so I decided to keep it .
Tonight I finally put it all together .
It is divine .
The ice cream / caramel is ridiculous just on its own , and the bacon is wild– it totally throws me off !
So salty - sweet and crunchy .
Now we just have to see if the crunchiness will stick around after the bacon bits have been immersed in the ice cream for a while .
“ Shut up Heather , just give us the recipe already ! ” you ’re saying .
Okay okay , here it is :
Maker ’s Mark Ice Cream with a Maple Caramel Swirl and Candied Bacon Bits
[ Note : Please do not copy and paste this recipe into your blog without asking me first .
Do feel free to link to it and post excerpts or rewritten / tweaked versions !
Thanks ! ]
Adapted in part from David Lebovitz ’s Candied Bacon Ice Cream recipe , and Gourmet ’s Coffee Caramel Swirl Ice Cream recipe .
This is a multi-step , two day process , so be sure to allot enough time !
INGREDIENTS
For the ice cream custard :
3 tablespoons salted butter
3/4 cup ( packed ) brown sugar
2 3/4 cup half - and - half ( make sure the kind you get has no added carrageenan )
5 large egg yolks
1/4 cup Maker ’s Mark bourbon
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 teaspoons molasses
For the maple caramel swirl :
pinch sea salt
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup water
7 tablespoons heavy cream ( again , no added carrageenan )
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
For the candied bacon bits :
5 slices thick - cut , applewood smoked bacon
1/3 cup sugar
Parchment paper ( or a brown paper bag )
Day 1 :
Make the bacon bits :
Cut the raw bacon into 1 cm squares — cutting each strip in half lengthwise , and several times crosswise .
In a heavy skillet over med - high heat , cook the bacon bits until slightly crisp but still a bit chewy , being careful to not burn or overcook them .
While the bacon is cooking , prepare a plate with paper towels on it to drain the bacon , and lay out a piece of parchment paper for the candied bacon .
Place bacon bits on paper towel to drain ; pat off excess fat .
Pour off fat from pan and save it for some other tasty treat .
Pour 1/3 cup sugar into a small heavy saucepan .
Over low to medium heat , melt the sugar just until all the crystals are dissolved and the sugar syrup looks homogeneous .
Be careful as you ’re doing this ; sugar melts slowly but burns quickly — keep heat lower rather than higher .
As soon as sugar has dissolved , immediately add the bacon bits and stir to cover .
Place bacon bits on parchment paper and separate from each other .
( There may be a better way to do this , like to dip each bacon bit individually , or add them in small batches , or pour the sugar over them , or something .
I have n’t tried it . )
Allow bacon bits to cool on the parchment .
Make the maple caramel swirl :
In a heavy saucepan , boil sugar , maple syrup , water , and a pinch sea salt over moderate heat , stirring , until sugar is dissolved .
Boil mixture , without stirring , gently swirling pan , until it is a deep golden caramel color .
( Note : this is difficult to tell with the maple syrup .
A candy thermometer might help , but I could n’t tell you what temperature to bring it to . *)
Remove pan from heat and carefully pour cream and vanilla down side of pan ( mixture will vigorously steam and caramel will harden ) .
Simmer mixture , stirring , until caramel is dissolved .
Remove pan from heat and cool caramel .
Caramel swirl may be made 1 week ahead and chilled , covered .
Bring to room temp before using ( heat slightly if too stiff to pour ) .
* I added the cream too soon , so I just continued boiling the mixture until it was the correct thickness .
I tested thickness by dropping a bit of it on a cool plate and letting it cool to room temp .
Then I ate it .
Make the ice cream custard :
Pour half of the half - and - half ( about 1 and a little more than 1/3 cup ) into a large bowl and set it in an ice bath . *
Set a mesh strainer over the top of the bowl .
In a separate bowl , lightly whisk together 5 egg yolks .
Melt 3 tablespoons butter over low heat in a heavy , medium sized saucepan .
Stir in the brown sugar and the other half the half - and - half and whisk it till the brown sugar is somewhat dissolved .
Heat just to warm , and keep a close eye on it .
Too hot , and the half - and - half will curdle and you will have to start over .
Gradually add the warm brown sugar mix to the eggs , whisking constantly as you pour .
Pour the entire mixture back into the sauce pan .
Cook over low to moderate heat , constantly stirring and scraping the bottom with a heatproof spatula , until the custard thickens enough to coat the spatula .
Strain the custard into the half - and - half , stirring over the ice bath until cool . *
Add the 1/4 cup bourbon , 1/ 4 teaspoon vanilla , and 1 1/2 teaspoon molasses .
Stir till well mixed .
Place in sealed container and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled .
Overnight is best — it allows the flavors to really mix .
Make sure your ice cream maker ’s bowl is in the freezer so that it ’s frozen by the next day .
* Note : I skipped the ice bath because I did n’t have any ice , and it worked fine .
Day 2
Putting it all together :
Pull the caramel swirl out of the fridge and bring it to room temp .
Put together the ice cream maker , turn it on , and pour in your ice cream custard .
Freeze in the ice cream maker for 1 / 2 hour , at least , until it ’s nearly doubled in volume and seems as frozen as it ’ll get .
It will still be soft — home made ice cream needs to go into the freezer for a few hours to really set .
Working quickly , stir in the bacon bits while the ice cream is still in the frozen bowl .
In a few smaller containers ( I used margarine containers ) , put down a layer of ice cream .
Add a layer of caramel swirl .
Add another layer of ice cream , then another layer of caramel swirl , then another layer of ice cream .
Put the lids on and place ice cream in freezer to finish freezing .
YOU’RE DONE !
Lick the bowls , if you ’re not already sick to your stomach from having done just that for 2 days in a row ! ;)
Following up on yesterday ’s post , the initial round of resistance to the Obama budget from senate Democratic centrists suggests to me that their opposition is rooted in optics and positioning rather than actual policy disagreements about how we should be running the federal government during the worst economic downturn in eighty years .
The key tell so far I think is that they ’ve decided to go on record saying they have serious disagreements but they apparently have n’t decided yet what they disagree with , or are not willing to disclose what that might be .
That may be an arch way to put it .
And maybe they have n’t seen the granular details that will come out in January .
But still , for me that suggests a certain logical disconnect .
Remember , as a number of commentators noted during the Stimulus Bill debate , the ‘ moderates ’ who hash out the final deal complained that one of their big beefs was that a lot of spending was insufficiently stimulative — and then they proceeded to cut out a lot of the spending that would have had the most immediate stimulative effect .
Like I said , optics , not policy .

Well , I did my best but a wonderful book written decades ago which has since sunk without a trace and will not be resurrected in my lifetime and you will not read it , will not learn from it , and a chance for the immortalization of the ideas therein will not come to fruition .
This is because the “ owner ” of the IP — even though he is clueless about the social value of the book — cannot be persuaded to let it be published at a market price .
I ’m trying to be sympathetic to a person ( and person who clearly has not read Against Intellectual Monopoly ) who would fail to give permission for a reprint of his grandfather ’s book , and hence keep good literature out of circulation , possibly forever .
I ’m trying to be sympathetic but it is hard .
Here is a scenario that helps you see how the state ’s IP laws distort people ’s judgment .
Let ’s say I get a phonecall from the company “ Simply Asia ” and they inform me that my grandfather invented a unique noodle shape and that the patent on it passed to me in probate .
Now , until this moment my life had been perfectly normal , flowing by day by day like every other life , but now I am aware of a long - hidden treasure in my family history .
What do I think ?
I think : $ $ $ $
You might too .
You would want to know more about this company , how many noodles they expect to sell , how much money you are going to get per noodle , how big a house you will be able to buy , how fast your new Maserati will drive on the autobahn , and what date you can retire from your day job .
So it is .
Not that you had anything to do with the stupid noodle design .
It is an accident of fate that the patent happened to fall into your hands .
But you do n’t think about that fact .
All you can think about is you newfound wealth .
You are imagining a scene from the opening of the Beverly Hillbillies .
Black gold , Texas tea .
Sadly , the company that wants to put the noodle in production informs me that they want to give me $ 500 and be done with it forever .
I ’m thinking : who do these people think they are ?
What a ripoff .
My family ’s noodle design is fantastically valuable !
Maybe I will produce it myself and not let these robbers in on the deal .
The gears in my wild imagination start turning and turning and turning .
However , it turns out that I really do n’t know anything about the noodle market .
I do n’t know how to make them , package them , sell them , or anything else .
A month or two goes by and I lose interest in the whole noodle thing .
Having turned down the company , I ’m no worse off than I was before .
But I wo n’t call them back and take the $ 500 because , who knows ?
Maybe next year I can get into the whole noodle - making thing .
We know the end of the story .
Nothing happens .
The noodle stays out of production .
The noodle company is sad but not devastated .
There ’s always another shape of noodle it can sell .
Sad to say , many of the books that will fail to be printed are great books .
But they might as well have never been written .
The author is in no position to protest because he or she is six feet in the ground .
His or her legacy , about which the heir cares less than nothing , is buried too .
The problem is that within the structure of IP there is no rational way to price anything .
The property is made scarce only by the state .
Its scarcity is otherwise wholly artificial .
The function of prices is to rationally allocate scarce goods but when goods are infinitely reproducible and made scarce only by the state , pricing too becomes akin to pricing under socialism .
You just end up making things up in the face of radical information asymmetries .
If I were offering to buy this guy ’s planter on his porch — a scarce good with replacement possibilities and involving real expenditure — he could make a rational price and I could decide to meet it or not .
But when offering to buy someone ’s IP , we are both completely blind as to the value .
He imagines infinite value and hence price .
I imagine small price .
There are no objective considerations to resolve the differences in our outlooks .
Now , what of the justice of this situation ?
There is no justice .
The “ heir ” is a fake who , under a free market , would own no more than you or me .
He would be in no position to keep a book published 30 years ago from coming back into print .
He would n’t be owed one thin dime , and he would never know the difference anyway .
But under an interventionist system in which the state makes up this preposterous idea of “ intellectual property rights ” and arbitrarily assigns power to individuals to coerce others into failing to make profitable exchanges possible , enterprise is seriously hampered .
Companies that want to print books can’t and people who want to buy them ca n’t do so .
Society is made worse off .
There is a way out for the wise few who are on the receiving end of a call about one ’s IP .
Think of the greater good .
Ideally you would be fair and wise and liberate the idea and give it back to the world to which it rightly belongs .
If you are n’t that high - minded , fine , take the moderate amount and money and move on .
Whatever you do , do n’t join the state , do n’t join the book burners , pretend you business savvy is going to net you millions , or otherwise behave like a jerk .
Have some respect for your family legacy and say yes to reprints .
The state , through its IP laws , is bringing out the worst in most people .
You can refuse to go along .

No pain , but something is definitely amiss .
You may look okay , but you have the mental capacity of a staple gun .

There is some definite havoc being wreaked upon your bowels .
Three Star Hangover (***)
Slight headache .

Your eyes look like one big red vein , and even your hair hurts .
Your sphincter is in perpetual spasm , and the first of about five shits you take during the day brings water to the eyes of everyone who enters the bathroom .
Five Star Hangover , (*****)
You have a second heartbeat in your head , which is actually annoying
the employee who sits in the next cube .
Vodka vapor is seeping out of

You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth in an attempt to get the remnants of the poop fairy out .
Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva so your tongue is suffocating you .
You do n't have the foggiest idea who the hell the stranger was passed out in your bed this morning .
Any attempt to defecate results in a fire hose like discharge of alcohol - scented fluid with a rare ' floater ' thrown in .
The sole purpose of this ' floater ' seems to be to splash the toilet water all over your ass .
Death sounds pretty good about right now ....

Advertisement Diplomats have walked out of a UN anti-racism conference during a speech by the Iranian president in which he described Israel as " totally racist " .
Dozens of delegates got up and left , moments after two protesters wearing coloured wigs disrupted the start of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech .
Diplomats who remained applauded as Mr Ahmadinejad continued his address .
France said it was a " hate speech " and the US called it " vile " .
Some countries had boycotted the meeting altogether .
The walkout is a public relations disaster for the United Nations , which had hoped the conference would be a shining example of what the UN is supposed to do best - uniting to combat injustice in the world , says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva .
UN dismay Paul Reynolds
World affairs correspondent , BBC News website
The one issue that never seems to go away when conferences of this kind are held is the Israeli - Palestinian one .
A document has been already been agreed among those governments attending and you have to read it quite closely to detect the tremors remaining from the earthquakes in discussions that went before .
But enough contentious issues remain and the result is a boycott by the US , Israel , Germany , Italy , Australia , Canada and New Zealand .
Fault lines split UN summit
The walkout by delegates from at least 30 countries happened within minutes of the start of the speech .
Most officials planned to return later to participate in the rest of the conference , although the Czech delegation announced it would join the boycott .
One of the two protesters escorted out of the conference hall managed to throw a red clown 's nose at the Iranian president , as they yelled " racist , racist " as he stood at the podium .
Mr Ahmadinejad , the only major leader to attend the conference , said Jewish migrants from Europe and the United States had been sent to the Middle East after World War II " in order to establish a racist government in the occupied Palestine " .
He continued , through an interpreter : " And in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in Palestine . "
French Ambassador Jean - Baptiste Mattei said : " As soon as he started to address the question of the Jewish people and Israel , we had no reason to stay in the room , " the Associated Press news agency reported .

Mardell blog : Italy 's anger at split Ahmadinejad speech : full text In quotes : Ahmadinejad 's speech
In quotes : World reaction to speech British Ambassador Peter Gooderham , also among those who left , said " such inflammatory rhetoric has no place whatsoever in a United Nations conference addressing the whole issue of racism and how to address it . "
Speaking to the BBC Radio 4's PM programme , he said of the Iranian leader 's accusation of Israeli racism : " That is a charge we unreservedly condemn and so we had no hesitation at that point in leaving the conference hall . "
The US , Israel , Canada , Australia , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Poland and New Zealand had all boycotted the conference being held in Geneva , in protest at Mr Ahmadinejad 's appearance .
His comments were described as " an absolute disgrace " by Israeli President Shimon Peres , attending a Holocaust Remembrance Day event in Jerusalem .
Israel had earlier recalled its ambassador to Switzerland .
Mr Ahmadinejad told a press conference after his speech that the countries boycotting the forum were showing " arrogance and selfishness " .

The US Deputy Ambassador to the UN , Alejandro Wolff , said the speech was " inaccurate " , as well as showing disregard towards the UN , and " does a grave injustice to the Iranian nation and the Iranian people " .
Speaking at UN headquarters in New York , he said : " We call on the Iranian leadership to show much measured , moderate , honest and constructive rhetoric when dealing with issues in the region , and not this type of vile , hateful , inciteful speech . "
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner had warned that French delegates would walk out if the forum was used as a platform to attack Israel .
HAVE YOUR SAY

Israel : Netanyahu threatens war on Iran , spurns “ two - state solution ”
By Bill Van Auken
2 April 2009
Sworn in Tuesday as prime minister in the most right - wing government in Israel 's history , Benjamin Netanyahu threatened a military strike against Iran and signaled a break with the so - called " two - state solution " to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict backed by Washington .
Netanyahu took office at the head of a fractious coalition after weeks of political horse - trading .
The February 10 election in Israel gave Netanyahu 's Likud party one less seat in the Knesset than the Kadima party of outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni , the former foreign minister and the party 's candidate .
Nonetheless , Netanyahu was tapped to form the government because Likud and other parties on the right of the Israeli political spectrum dominate the Knesset .
Netanyahu 's principal political ally in the new government is Israel Beiteinu , a far - right split - off from Likud led by Avigdor Lieberman , a former Moldovan nightclub bouncer who advances a semi- fascist program promoting the wholesale ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from both Israel and the West Bank .
Lieberman has become foreign minister and Israel 's face to the world .
The party has also been given control of public security , somewhat ironic given that Lieberman is under multiple police investigations on charges of taking bribes .
The Knesset voted 69 - 45 for the new government , with five members of the Labor Party abstaining .
Later , five MPs of the United Torah Judaism party joined the coalition , giving it the backing of 74 of the Knesset 's 120 members .
Labor joined the coalition at the insistence of Ehud Barak , who will retain his position as defense minister , with the party picking up three other cabinet portfolios : industry , trade and labor .
The party was bitterly divided over entering the government , with the losing faction warning that it would spell the end of Labor , erasing its last pretense of representing some kind of social democratic alternative to the Israeli right .
Nonetheless , none of its members voted against the new government .
The government will be the largest in Israel 's history , with Netanyahu naming 30 ministers and 7 deputy ministers in order to placate the parties making up his coalition with posts .
Livni mocked the new government for its " ministers of nothing , " while warning that under conditions of " a profound financial and social crisis , " the Israeli public " will have to carry the enormous weight of a bloated cabinet . "
Livni nonetheless declared her desire to " see the new government succeed " and made no criticism of the policies of the new government .
Netanyahu and Lieberman wasted no time in spelling out the reactionary and bellicose character of these policies .
In an interview with Jonah Goldberg of the Atlantic just before his swearing - in , Netanyahu issued an explicit threat of an Israeli attack on Iran 's nuclear program , warning that if Washington failed to stop it by means of diplomatic pressure , Israel would take military action .
According to Goldberg , Netanyahu told him that the Obama administration " must stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons — and quickly — or an imperiled Israel may be forced to attack Iran 's nuclear facilities itself . "
He described the Iranian government as a " messianic apocalyptic cult " and Iran itself as " a country that glorifies blood and death , including its own self - immolation . "
This provocative language is designed to demonize the entire Iranian people and justify mass killing .
Goldberg quoted one of Netanyahu 's military advisers as asserting that Israel could act " within months " and was capable of carrying out the attack with or without Washington 's approval .
" The problem is not military capability , the problem is whether you have the stomach , the political will , to take action , " one adviser said .
The Israeli threats were echoed Wednesday by General David Petraeus , head of the US Central Command , who told a congressional committee that " the Israeli government may ultimately see itself so threatened by the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon that it would take preemptive military action to derail or delay it . "
Meanwhile , in a speech to the Israeli parliament shortly before he was sworn in as prime minister Tuesday , Netanyahu gave a clear indication that he has no intention of pursuing negotiations aimed at creating an independent Palestinian state .
" We do not want to rule the Palestinians , " he said .
" Under the final accord , the Palestinians will have all the rights to govern themselves , except those that can put in danger the security and the existence of Israel . "
He said he would promote an " economic peace " plan spurring investments in the West Bank economy and declared his support for US efforts to train the Palestinian Authority 's security forces .
In other words , Israeli policy is to maintain its domination over the occupied territories , while relying on the Palestinian Authority 's forces to suppress resistance and utilizing the Palestinian population as cheap labor for Israeli industry .
The viability of this last aim , however , is largely precluded by the maintenance of roadblocks , security fences and a generalized crackdown against the Palestinian population that cripples the movement of materials , goods and labor .
Lieberman was more explicit in his rejection of the so - called two - state solution .
At an official ceremony in Jerusalem on Wednesday , he declared that the statement signed by the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority at the US - sponsored Annapolis Conference of 2007 " has no validity " because it had not been ratified by the Knesset .
The conference marked the first time that Israel committed itself to bilateral negotiations with the aim of creating an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza .
In a television interview following the speech , Lieberman stressed that he had chosen his words to provide " an expression of a change in Israel 's policy regarding the peace process . "
The Israeli daily Haaretz quoted an official in Netanyahu 's Likud party as saying that the new government " intended to distance itself from US - sponsored understandings on working towards a Palestinian state . "
Nonetheless , Washington sought to dismiss Lieberman 's statements , while affirming its continued support for Israeli , a state that it subsidizes with $ 3 billion in military aid every year .
US President Barack Obama called Wednesday to congratulate Netanyahu on his assumption of power and as Haaretz reported , to " reaffirm steadfast US commitment to Israel and its security . "
In the half - hour conversation , Obama " said he looked forward to working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government to address issues of mutual concern , including Iran and Arab - Israeli peace , " according to a White House statement .
Meanwhile , Haaretz reported last Sunday that the transition period has been utilized by Zionist settlers on the West Bank to step up construction activity , further whittling away and dividing the land controlled by Palestinians .
Citing the non-profit organization Yesh Din , the paper pointed to the " extensive earthworks being carried out in preparation for the construction of a road connecting the settlement of Eli , north of Ramallah , with the Hayovel outpost Yuval , just south of the Arab city . "
More than 90 percent of the road is being built on land owned by Palestinians .
In a similar project , settlers at the Havat Gilad outpost , west of Nablus , have built a road to the Nablus bypass road .
The report follows the recent revelation that , as part of their coalition agreement , Netanyahu and Lieberman struck a secret deal to press ahead with the so - called E1 project that would build 3,000 new housing units adjacent to the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumin , effectively linking it with Jerusalem and further bisecting the north of the West Bank from the south .
Earlier proposals for the project had been condemned by the Bush administration and Condoleezza Rice , its secretary of state , as being " at odds with American policy . "
These " facts on the ground " are aimed at rendering even a truncated Palestinian mini-state an impossibility .
Meanwhile in Gaza , shattered by the 23 - day Israeli offensive that claimed the lives of over 1,400 Palestinians , fighting continues with the Israeli Defense Forces killing three people Tuesday in what it claimed was an attack on armed militants .
All of the major Israeli parties backed the murderous assault on Gaza — Olmert took credit for it in his farewell address , while proclaiming the IDF the most " moral " army in the world .
Both Netanyahu and Lieberman , however , criticized the outgoing government for failing to continue the assault until the Hamas administration in Gaza had been overthrown , a policy that strongly suggests Israeli aggression will be redoubled in the coming weeks and months .
Meanwhile , Israel 's economy is increasingly battered by the world crisis , with thousands of workers being laid off and the country 's high - tech sector particularly hard hit .
Social polarization — already among the most intense in the world — is deepening .
The new government is taking office committed to cutting budgets and wages , while it is debating a scheme to bail out the speculative investments of the country 's billionaire tycoons with public funds .
This objective situation and the reactionary policies of Netanyahu , in which militarist aggression will be joined by attacks on the social conditions of the working class in Israel itself , ensures that the new government will be one of extreme crisis and instability .
Based on the only field - by - field datasets publicly available ( Norway and the UK ) and looking at the decline structure we came to the following conclusion :
If the decline structure for the world follows the decline structure that has been observed for UK +
Norway , there is an 85 % chance that the world 's oil production is in final decline .
In the first part , we tried to estimate the implicit decline structure behind the IEA analysis of worldwide decline rates .
We established that only 11.8 mbpd of a total of 69.8 mbpd were not in decline in 2007 ( 17.0 % ) and for the Super - Giants / Giants group , the IEA claims that around 20 % ( 9.2 / 42.5 ) are still growing fields .
I 'm now trying to answer the following question : is the decline structure observed for the world and the SG / G group closer to a pre-peak or a post peak production ?
Observed Decline Structure for the World
Decline Phase 1 Decline Phase 2 Decline Phase 3 Total Super - Giants 0.8 %
3.0 %
4.9 %
3.4 %
Giants 3.0 %
3.7 %
7.6 %
6.5 %
Large 5.5 %
7.2 %
11.8 %
10.4 % World 1.4 % 3.6 % 6.7 % 5.1 %
Table I. Decline rate structure according to the IEA for the Top 580 oil fields in decline .
Decline Phase 1 Decline Phase 2 Decline Phase 3 Total Super - Giants 6.20 8.79 14.40 29.40 Giants 0.26 0.82 2.84 3.92 Large 0.73 1.26 5.21 7.19 World 7.19 10.87 22.44 40.5
Table II .
Estimate of the production matrix P ( in mbpd ) behind the decline rates given in Table I .
Figure 1 .
Amounts of post - peak production by field category used for the global decline rate calculation .
Figure 2 . Decline structure of the Super - Giant / Giant fields and the world .
Figure 3 . Same as Figure 2 but in fraction of the total .
The decline rates for post - peak fields established by the IEA are shown in Table I.We then derived this possible decline structure for the post - peak fields .
Assuming then the repartition between the various decline phases is the same between small and large fields , we get the following :
The figure below is showing what I call the decline structure for the world .
The feature that strikes me the most is how small the fraction of field not in decline is ( between 17 % and 20 % ) .
What the North - Sea Oil Production is Telling Us
Figure 4 . Oil field classification for Norway and the UK .
We took the available data for Norway and the UK and we classified fields according to their production status at a given time ( Figure 4 ) .
Peak production for the North - Sea has been reached when production from phase 3 fields reached 30 % of the total production .

The vertical dotted red line indicates 17 % .

Observed production growth rate versus % of fields in decline phase 3 ( the colored areas from red to yellow indicates confidence areas around the linear fit at 0.5,1.0 , 1.5 and 2.0 standard deviations ) .
What 's the Implication for the World Production
Figure 10 .
Year - on - year total production growth the rate for the world ( BP data ) .
The red circles are the growth rates without Canadian tar sands .
if 100 % of fields were in decline , the total decline rate would be equal to the one estimated by the IEA for fields in decline ( - 5.1 % ) .
if 100 % of fields were in decline phase 3 , according to the IEA numbers , the total decline rate would be equal to - 8.0 % .
if 0 % of fields were in decline phase 3 , the total decline rate would be equal to - 4.5 % .
The maximum growth rate ( i.e. 0 % of fields in decline ) is equal to the maximum decline rate ( i.e. 100 % fields in decline phase 3 ) in absolute value .

The black dots are the observed growth rates ( Figure 9 ) , their horizontal coordinate is a simple linear mapping of the production date on the 17%-100 % interval .
Figure 12 .
Year - on - year total production decline rates as a function of the fraction of fields in Phase 3 decline .
Conclusions
There are mistakes in the IEA report and my calculations are therefore completely wrong .
The table II retrieved is erroneous .
This is a real possibility , however the numbers for the Super - Giant / Giant fields are directly from the report and also indicate a decline structure consistent with a production in plateau or near decline .
This decline is also consistent with a logisitc fit ( see part I ) .
If the numbers and estimates are corrrect , then it seems very likely that the world crude oil production is in decline or about to decline .
The bottom line is that there is not enough contribution coming from fields with still a growing production to support a growing global production .
On Figure 6 , we can see that production plateau corresponds to fields not in decline between 20 % and 30 % which is higher than the value observed for the world ( between 17 and 20 % ) .
Post - peak production is characterized by a fraction of fields not in decline below 30 % and a fraction of fields in decline phase 3 above 25 % .
In addition , if we compute the correlation coefficient between the decline structure for the world ( Figure 3 ) with the Norway + UK history , we get significant positive correlation values only for plateau and post - peak years .
There is strong linear relationship between the amount of field not in decline and the observed production growth / decline rate as shown on Figure 8 below .
The linear fit intersects the 0 % growth rate line around 27.5 % which is therefore the threshold below which the observed production is likely to decline .
According to this model , there is about a 85 % chance that a fraction of 17 % of fields not in decline is an indication of a post - peak situation .
The same analysis can be done when looking at the fraction of fields in phase 3 .
Also , the result indicates a high probability of declining production for values above 40 % .
It seems clear , that from a North - Sea production perspective , the apparent decline structure for the world and the Super - Giants / Giants group does not look very good and indicates that we are in fact past peak .
However , these charts are based on a very small field dataset ( mainly offshore fields with strong decline / growth rates ) whereas the world is believed to be composed of at least 15,000 individual field contributions .
The chart below is showing the observed production growth rate for the world since 1900 .
Values before the 70s were very volatile and around 7 % and around 2 % - 3 % after 1980 .
In order to reconstruct a similar model for the entire world , I make the following assumptions : Figure 11 shows the resulting reconstruction for the world .
Interestingly , the linear fit still intersects the 0 line at around 30 % .
There are several possible conclusions :
Database giant Oracle has agreed to buy Sun Microsystems for $ 7.4bn , or $ 9.5 a share , in cash .
The surprise move comes in the wake of IBM walking away from a possible buyout of Sun Microsystems for $ 6.85bn .
Oracle said the boards of both the firms had given the transaction the thumbs up .
It ’s expected to complete this summer and is subject to shareholder approval as well as the normal regulatory requirements .
" The acquisition of Sun transforms the IT industry , combining best - in - class enterprise software and mission - critical computing systems , " said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison .
" Oracle will be the only company that can engineer an integrated system - applications to disk - where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves .
Our customers benefit as their systems integration costs go down while system performance , reliability and security go up . "
“ We expect this acquisition to be accretive to Oracle ’s earnings by at least 15 cents on a non-GAAP basis in the first full year after closing , ” said Oracle President Safra Catz , in a statement today .
“ We estimate that the acquired business will contribute over $ 1.5 bn to Oracle ’s non-GAAP operating profit in the first year , increasing to over $ 2bn in the second year , ” Catz said .
Today 's announcement was sketchy , with little mention of what Oracle plans to do with Sun 's hardware business , and no reference to Sun 's MySQL 's open source database .
In a message to Sun staff today , Jonathan Schwartz said : " This is one of the toughest emails I 've ever had to write .
It 's also one of the most hopeful about Sun 's future in the industry . "
He said : " Oracle 's interest in Sun is very clear - they aspire to help customers simplify the development , deployment and operation of high value business systems , from applications all the way to datacenters .
By acquiring Sun , Oracle will be well positioned to help customers solve the most complex technology problems related to running a business . "
He added : " A combined Oracle / Sun will be capable of cultivating one of the world 's most vibrant and far reaching developer communities , accelerating the convergence of storage , networking and computing , and delivering one of the world 's most powerful and complete portfolios of business and technical software . "
Ellison and McNealy were two of the prime movers behind the anti-Wintel coaliton which pushed the Network Computer .
This was launched with much hoopla back in 1995 .
It 's nice to know they 've finally got there . ®
And I 'm not the first .
See there have been a startling number of ACTUALLY FAMOUS purveyors of fake news who had their lives turn to shit .
See , I used to be a king around here at Cracked.com .
Hosted a fake news show five days a week .
And then three days a week .
And then one day a week .
And then suddenly , no days a week .
It was right around the time Cracked Editor - in - Chief Jack O'Brien texted " you 're canceled " to me that I realized that maybe , just maybe , I was n't really a king around here at all .
Laugh while you can , Jon Stewart , Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers : Being a fake news anchor is fun while it lasts .
But as Dennis Miller might say , that fun evaporates faster than Rod Blagojevich 's flop sweat at an outdoor Kant reading -- once you get fired .

1 Craig Kilborn
Remember Craig ?
He hosted The Daily Show , back before you watched it .
For a while , Craig was riding high ; his The Daily Show gig was just another notch on his TV hosting belt .
Then , for some reason , he gave an interview to Esquire magazine where he called the women who worked for the show " emotional bitches , " and suggested that series co-creator Lizz Winstead would blow him if he asked her to .

Not too surprisingly , both Craig and Lizz were gone within a year , presumably so that she could focus on blowing him full time .
Kilborn moved on , though , and hosted The Late Show for six years .
And then the curse kicked in .
He abruptly quit in 2006 so that he could pursue other television opportunities .
Those opportunities included playing an asshole in Old School , and culminated with a bit part in the shitty remake The Benchwarmers .
That was three years ago .
Oppurtunity ding - dong ditches Craig Kilborn .
Since then he has dropped off the grid .
How does that happen ?
While he was by all accounts an unrepentant prick , Kilborn was a talented comedy writer , and the first host of the best comedy show on TV today .
Did his infamous ego get the best of him ?
Or is there something darker at work here ?

The Part Where I Bitterly Compare Our Stories
Kilborn 's departure from The Late Show , and anything resembling a career , was strange in that the show was doing fine .
He never gave a reason .
On the other hand , there were several problems with my fake news show , " The News on Cracked , " which eventually morphed into " The Week In Douchebaggery . "
( My mom was so proud . )
The most prominent problem with the show was , in a word , You .
The vast majority of You did n't watch it .
I 'm only laughing at how much I hate you .
So I can't say I was shocked when I got the axe .
I mean , my weekly notes from Jack consisted of things like : " You do n't work here anymore , " " Please stop posting more episodes of The Week in Douchebaggery , " and " As soon as we figure out the password you 're using , we 're going to change it . "
And after all , all good things must come to an end .
( Unless they 're good things that happen to Swaim or fucking Daniel O'Brien , who was still in college when MY SECOND DAUGHTER WAS BORN .
For those two punks , good things just KEEP ON COMING . )

The Part Where I Seamlessly Transition To The Next Victim
But you know who probably WAS surprised to get the axe ?
I recently had fun discussions with both Vikash Mansinghka and Thomas Breuel about approaching AI with machine learning .
The general interest in taking a crack at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts including DARPA .
As a matter of history , there was a great deal of interest in AI which died down before I began research .
There remain many projects and conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave , as well as a good bit of experience about what did not work , or at least did not work yet .
Here are a few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into :
Supply / Product confusion .
Sometimes we think “ Intelligences use X , so I ’ll create X and have an Intelligence . ”
An example of this is the Cyc Project which inspires some people as “ intelligences use ontologies , so I ’ll create an ontology and a system using it to have an Intelligence . ”
The flaw here is that Intelligences create ontologies , which they use , and without the ability to create ontologies you do n’t have an Intelligence .
If we are lucky , the substantial effort invested in Cyc wo n’t be wasted , as it has a large quantity of information stored in a plausibly useful format .
If we are unlucky , it fails to even be partially useful , because the format is unnatural for the internal representations of an Intelligence .
Uncertainty second .
Many of the older AI programs had no role for uncertainty .
If you asked the people working on them , they might agree that uncertainty was an important but secondary concern to be solved after the main problem .
Unfortunately , it seems that uncertainty is a primary concern in practice .
One example of this is blocks world where a system for planning how to rearrange blocks on a table might easily fail in practice because the robot fails to grab a block properly .
Many people think of uncertainty as a second order concern , because they do n’t experience uncertainty in their daily lives .
I believe this is incorrect — a mental illusion due to the effect that focusing attention on a specific subject implies reducing uncertainty on that subject .
More generally , because any Intelligence is a small part of the world , the ability of any intelligence to perceive , understand , and manipulate the world is inherently limited , requiring the ability to deal with uncertainty .
For statistics & ML people , it ’s important to not breath a sigh of relief too easily , as the problem is pernicious .
For example many ML techniques based around conditional independence routinely suffer from excess certainty .
Computation second .
Some people try to create an intelligence without reference to efficient computation .
AIXI is an extreme example of this sort .
The algorithm is very difficult to deploy in practice because there were no computational constraints other than computability designed into it ’s creation .
It ’s important to understand that computational constraints and uncertainty go together : because there are computational constraints , an intelligence is forced to deal with uncertainty since not everything which might follow at a mathematical level can be inferred in the available computational budget .
AI - Hard problems .
There was a time when some people thought , “ If we could just get a program that mastered chess so well it could beat the best humans , we will learn enough about AI to create an AI . ”
Deep Blue put that theory to rest .
Current efforts on Poker and Go seem more promising , but no one believes they are “ AI - Hard ” for good reason .
It ’s not even clear that the Turing Test is a reliable indicator , because ( for example ) we might imagine that there is Intelligence which can not imitate a human , or that there are programs that can imitate humans well enough to fool humans without being able to achieve everything that an Intelligence could .
Perhaps the best evidence is something singularity - style : AI exists when it can substantially improve it ’s own abilities .
Asymptopia .
In machine learning there are many theorems of the form “ learning algorithm A can solve any learning problem in the limit of infinite data ” .
Here A might be nearest neighbors , decision trees , two - layer neural networks , support vector machines , nonparametric statistics , nonparametric Bayes , or something else .
These theorem are ok , but insufficient .
Often the algorithms are not computationally acceptable , and even if so , they are not sufficiently efficient with respect to the amount of experience required to learn .
Solving AI is undeniably hard , as evidenced by the amount of time spent on it , and the set of approaches which have n’t succeeded .
There are a couple reasons for hope this time .
The first is that there is , or soon will be sufficient computation available , unlike the last time .
The second is that the machine learning approach fails well , because there are industrial uses for machine learning .
Consequently , we can expect a lack of success to still see substantial use in practice .
This might sound like “ a good downside ” , but it ’s actually an upside , because it implies that incremental progress has the potential for ultimate success .
Restated at an abstract level : a hard problem can generally be decomposed in many ways into subproblems .
Amongst all such decompositions , a good decomposition is one with the property that solutions to the subproblems are immediately useful .
The machine learning approach to AI has this goodness property , unlike many other approaches , which partially explains why the ML approach is successful despite “ failing ” so far to achieve AI .
One reason why AI is hard , is that it turns out tackling general problems in the world undeniably requires a substantial number of different strategies , including learning , searching , and chunking ( = constructing macros ) , all while respecting constraints of computation and robustness to uncertainty .
Given this , a fair strategy seems to be first mastering one strategy , and then incorporating others , always checking that that incorporation properly addresses real world problems .
In doing this , considering the constraint ignoring approaches as limiting cases of the real system may be helpful .

The Top 10 list of Happiest Countries is as follows :
Denmark Finland Netherlands Sweden Ireland Canada Switzerland New Zealand Norway Belgium
This must really burn up the wingnuts !
Our socialist neighbor Canada is # 6 !
And the US did n't make the top ten .
Well , maybe it 's OK if we 're not happy , because we work hard , while those lazy nanny - state losers lay around all day being coddled .....
While the global economic crisis has taken a toll on every nation , the countries that scored at the top still boast some of the highest gross domestic product per capita in the world .
Denmark , which got the highest score , is not only a wealthy country , it 's also highly productive , with a 2009 GDP per capita of $ 68,000 , according to the International Monetary Fund .
The United States ' GDP per capita , by contrast , is $ 47,335 .
How can this be ?
They 're " socialist " and yet they are productive and have high GDP ?
Higher than the world 's bastion of capitalism ?
Glenn Beck 's mind will not be able to compute this data .
Now , if President Obama takes any steps towards the policies that help create these levels of happiness in those countries ' citizens , the wingnuts will scream bloody murder .
Fox News is already reporting the " end of capitalism . "
Because its our God - given right to make as much money as possible and achieve the American Dream .
Then we 'll all be happy , right ?
Hmm .
The article states :
Wealth alone does not bring the greatest degree of happiness .
Shocking !
Why , that sounds like a socialist statement right there !
Were these words actually printed in Forbes magazine ?
The wingnuts would probably say that those " socialists " are so happy because they 're all on welfare , right ?
Low unemployment also contributes to happiness .
" One thing we know for sure , " says the OECD 's Chapple , " not having a job makes one substantially less satisfied . "
Denmark 's unemployment rate is just 2 % , according the C.I.A. 's World Factbook .
Norway's is just 2.6 % .
The Netherlands : just 4.5 % .
Many economists concur that a 4 % unemployment rate reflects a stable economy .
The U.S. unemployment rate is currently 9 % .
Ouch .
Let 's hear more from the Republicans about how we can never be more like Europe , because they 're all socialists and that 's bad , bad , evil and bad .
No one in America would want social policies that actual contribute to people feeling more content with their lives , right ?
This ranking was based on a Gallup World Poll that asked questions like :
Did you enjoy something you did yesterday ?
Were you proud of something you did yesterday ?
Did you learn something yesterday ?
Were you treated with respect yesterday ?
Try asking yourself those questions .
And think about how people in a truly happy country answered them .
With all the serious work before Congress , it is a colossal waste of time to have to rebut the false claims and warped premises of ardent estate - tax cutters .
Ms. Lincoln ’s and Mr. Kyl ’s colleagues in the Senate should make short work of it and move on to urgent matters .
In addition to creating the false impression that the estate tax eventually hits everyone  by mislabeling it a “ death tax ”  opponents routinely denounce the 45 percent top tax rate as confiscatory .
In fact , the rate applies only to the portion of the estate that exceeds the exemption .
As a result , even estates worth more than $ 20 million end up paying only about 20 percent in taxes .
Another misleading argument is that the estate tax represents double taxation .
In truth , much of the wealth that is taxed at death has never been taxed before .
That ’s because such wealth is often accrued in the form of capital gains on stocks , real estate and other investments .
Capital gains are not taxed until an asset is sold .
Obviously , if someone dies owning an asset , he or she never sold it and thus never paid tax on the gain .
If those arguments are n’t enough to stop the Lincoln - Kyl show , lawmakers should consider this :
The estate tax creates a big incentive for high - end philanthropy , because charitable bequests are exempt .
On Tuesday , Independent Sector , a nonpartisan charitable coalition representing thousands of public charities , private foundations and corporate - giving programs , urged the Senate to reject the Lincoln - Kyl amendment and to keep the tax as proposed in the Obama budget .
Finally , reducing the estate tax from the level proposed by Mr. Obama would cost an additional $ 250 billion in forgone revenue over 10 years , at a time when the nation already has to borrow heavily for real needs .
Ms. Lincoln and Mr. Kyl have made rumblings about offering a way to offset that cost .
Let ’s hear what they say , and once we see how they ’ve come up with a quarter - trillion dollars , let ’s talk about better ways to use the money .

So if all votes hold from January , the pro-science board members should be able to block bad amendments today .
( We said “ if ” and “ should be able . ” )
The board has not yet reached the agenda item on science standards .
9:24 – A representative of the right - wing Texas Public Policy Foundation is talking to the board about early revisions of the social studies standards , which the board will take up after science .
We ’re waiting for a copy of the document the representative is presenting to the board .
9:40 – Board member Terri Leo decries any suggestion to leave out of the social studies standards important historical figures to make room for “ multicultural ” issues and personalities .
“ I ’ve never heard of half of these people , ” Leo says of one proposed list of names .
Well , we have n’t seen the list of proposed names or those who might be left out , and everyone agrees that key historical figures should be covered in social studies classrooms .
But that Ms. Leo has never heard of someone in history is hardly a sound criterion the state should be following for deciding who gets in and who gets left out of standards .
9:53 – Board member Cynthia Dunbar is suggesting that the board should perhaps start the social studies process over .
Let ’s recap : board members have appointed members to social studies writing teams , who have already met once .
The board has received one report on their work , from the Texas Public Policy Foundation .
The teams have not finished their work .
In fact , a representative of the Texas Education Agency has informed the board that writing teams were still very early in the revision process .
Ms. Dunbar , however , is concerned that the writing teams will present drafts based on “ entrenched ” interests ( “ academia , ” she says ) , not parents and others .
( Are many teachers not parents ? )
Chairman Don McLeroy wants to cancel the social studies revision process at this point and then come up with a new proposal for how to proceed .
10:01 – It appears the board will defer a decision until tomorrow on how to proceed on social studies standards .
10:03 – By the way , we now have the document presented by Brooke Dollens Terry of Texas Public Policy Foundation .
Following are the names she says have been added to the standards for third grade .
( Terri Leo says she has never heard of half of the names being added , but it ’s unclear if she means for all the standards or just for third grade . )
Grace Hopper , Margaret Knight , Quanah Parker , Dr. Hector P. Garcia , Maya Lin , Maya Angelou , Sandra Cisneros , Kadir Nelson , Jean Pinkey , Angela Shelf Medear , Elisabet Ney , Carmen Lomas Garza , and Bill Martin .
10:07 – The board is about to begin its debate on science .
10:09 – Board member Ken Mercer of San Antonio moves to add “ strengths and weaknesses ” back into the science standards .
10:12 – Mercer :
This about allowing students to discuss and question strengths and weaknesses of all scientific theories .
He claims receiving 15,0000 - 16,000 e-mails on this from around the state .
10:15 – Mercer goes down the “ microevolution ” vs. “ macroevolution ” path again .
And he brings up “ Piltdown man ” and a list of other “ weaknesses ” he claims plague evolutionary theory .
10:19 – OK , it looks like board member David Bradley ’s computer screen has TFN Insider up .
Good morning , Mr. Bradley !
10:20 – Member Bob Craig of Lubbock offers a substitute amendment .
“ I am fully cognizant to the difference between faith and science .
But I believe they can co-exist . ”
He argues that what the writing teams suggested in December still allows students to freely discuss all aspects of science .
Mr. Craig proposes to keep the work group language ( without “ strengths and weaknesses ” ) but adds “ including discussing what is not fully understood so as to encourage critical thinking by the student . ”
10:26 – Dallas member Geraldine “ Tincy ” Miller supports Mr. Craig ’s motion .
10:30 – This should be interesting .
Mr. Mercer and other creationists have argued that taking “ strengths and weaknesses ” out of the standards will bar students from discussing and asking questions .
Mr. Craig ’s amendment addresses that , explicitly affirms the right of students to discuss and question while keeping phony “ weaknesses ” out of textbooks .
10:32 – Mavis Knight speaks in favor of Mr. Craig ’s motion .
10:34 – The creationists have a difficult decision to make here .
Is this about the freedom of students to ask questions , as they have argued , or is this about promoting phony attacks on evolution in textbooks ?
10:36 – Pat Hardy speaks in favor of Mr. Craig ’s motion .
10:37 – Terri Leo opposes Mr. Craig ’s motion .
She says the language is “ too ambiguous . ”
She wants teachers to tell students specific “ weaknesses . ”
10:38 – Lawrence Allen supports Mr. Craig ’s motion .
10:39 – By the way , Texas Freedom Network supports Mr. Craig ’s motion ( although we had n’t seen it until now ) .
It ’s a wise and responsible way to ensure that students are free to ask questions .
That ’s how they learn .
10:41 – Cynthia Dunbar opposes Mr. Craig ’s motion .
She notes a comment from Ms. Miller that she ( Ms. Miller ) is a committed Christian .
Ms. Dunbar says that religious beliefs are irrelevant to what the board should so .
Oh , really ?
Then why have her creationist colleagues and their allies questioned the faith of those who oppose putting “ strengths and weaknesses ” in the standards .
10:43 – Rick Agosto opposes Mr. Craig ’s amendment .
“ If it ’s not ‘ fully understood , ’ then I do n’t consider that science . ”
10:44 – Once again , Mr. Craig has moved that the board retain the language proposed by writing teams in December ( without “ strengths and weaknesses ” ) but add to the expectation that students analyze and evaluate scientific explanations : “ including discussing what is not fully understood so as to encourage critical thinking by the student . ”
10:46 – Barbara Cargill opposes Mr. Craig ’s motion .
She says “ strengths and weaknesses ” language protects the ability of teachers to tell students “ weaknesses ” of evolution ( however phony those “ weaknesses ” are , apparently ) .
“ Darwinists have tried to smother all the challenges … ( and ) weaknesses of evolution . ”
10:52 – Mr. Mercer opposes Mr. Craig ’s motion .
“ What are they afraid of ?
Why all this national attention over one word , ‘ weaknesses ’ ? ”
10:54 – McLeroy calls a 10 - minute recess .
11:08 – They ’re back .
Ms. Knight moves to change Mr. Craig ’s amendment to read : “ fully understand IN ALL FIELD OF SCIENCE . ”
So the wording would be : “ including discussing what is not fully understood in all fields of science . ”
The board accepts that change without objection .
We ’re back to Mr. Craig ’s motion .
11:12 – Mr. Craig ’s motion fails 6 - 8 . We ’re back to Mr. Mercer ’s original amendment adding back “ strengths and weaknesses . ”
11:13 – Mr. Mercer ’s motion fails 7-7 !!!
11;15 – This is huge victory for sound science education in Texas .
Moreover , the creationists ’ opposition to Mr. Craig ’s motion exposed their hypocrisy about wanting to ensure that students can ask questions about science .

“ Total foreclosure activity in April ended up slightly above the previous month , once again hitting a record - high level , ” said James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac .
“ Much of this activity is at the initial stages of foreclosure – the default and auction stages – while bank repossessions , or REOs , were down on a monthly and annual basis to their lowest level since March 2008 .
This suggests that many lenders and servicers are beginning foreclosure proceedings on delinquent loans that had been delayed by legislative and industry moratoria .
It ’s likely that we ’ll see a corresponding spike in REOs as these loans move through the foreclosure process over the next few months . ”

Despite an 18 percent decrease in foreclosure activity from the previous month , Nevada continued to post the nation ’s highest state foreclosure rate in April , with one in every 68 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing — more than five times the national average .
The decrease in Nevada was driven largely by a 44 percent drop in bank repossessions from the previous month , although default notices also decreased from the previous month .
Total foreclosure activity in Nevada was up 111 percent from April 2008 .
A 37 percent month - over - month increase in foreclosure activity boosted Florida ’s foreclosure rate to second highest among the states in April .
One in every 135 Florida housing units received a foreclosure filing during the month , more than 2.7 times the national average .
The monthly increase in Florida was driven by a spike in default notices and auction notices , but bank repossessions were down 7 percent from the previous month .
Total foreclosure activity in Florida was up 75 percent from April 2008 .
Foreclosure activity in California decreased 10 percent from the previous month , but the state still posted the nation ’s third highest state foreclosure rate in April , with one in every 138 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing during the month .
Total foreclosure activity in California was up 42 percent from April 2008 .
Arizona posted the fourth highest state foreclosure rate , with one in every 164 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing in April , and Idaho posted the fifth highest state foreclosure rate , with one in every 255 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing in April .
Other states with foreclosure rates ranking among the nation ’s 10 highest were Utah , Georgia , Illinois , Colorado and Ohio — although the foreclosure rates in Illinois , Colorado and Ohio were below the national average .
[ Image : A photomicrograph of sand grains ] .
These chains seem to behave like the soaring arches of Gothic cathedrals , which serve to transmit the weight of the roof , perhaps a great dome , outward to the walls , which bear the load .
Most of today 's active sandy deserts are surrounded by vast stretches of old stabilized dunes , formed as the trade - wind belts and arid regions expanded in the cold , dry climate of the last ice age and immobilized as the climate changed .
However , continuing shifts in the climate may bring these fixed ergs , granular reserves awaiting activation , back to life .
The hills were stabilized eight hundred years ago but have had episodes of reincarnation since : a long drought toward the end of the eighteenth century resuscitated dunes on the Great Plains , whose activity caused problems for the westbound wagon trains decades earlier .
I researched different types of construction methods involving pile systems and realised that injection piles could probably be used to get the bacteria down into the sand – a procedure that would be analogous to using an oversized 3D printer , solidifying parts of the dune as needed .
The piles would be pushed through the dune surface and a first layer of bacteria spread out , solidifying an initial surface within the dune .
They would then be pulled up , creating almost any conceivable ( structurally sound ) surface along their way , with the loose sand acting as a jig before being excavated to create the necessary voids .
If we allow ourselves to dream , we could even fantasise about ways in which the wind could do a lot of this work for us : solidifying parts of the surface to force the grains of sand to align in certain patterns , certain shapes , having the wind blow out our voids , creating a structure that would change and change again over the course of a decade , a century , a millenium .
Traditional anti-desertification methods include the planting of trees and cacti , the cultivation of grasses and shrubs , and the construction of sand - catching fences and walls .
More ambitious projects have ventured into the development of agriculture and livestock , water conservation , soil management , forestry , sustainable energy , improved land use , wildlife protection , poverty alleviation , and so on .
This project , apart from utilising a completely new way of turning sand into sandstone , incorporates all of the above .
Inside the dunes , we can take care of our plants and animals , find water and shade , help the soil remain fertile , care for the trees , and so on .
In this way , it 's an environmental project that hopefully provides an innovation for other architects / builders to use and copy time and time again .
[ Images : Synthesizing rare earth compounds – bioterrestriality ; from Magnus Larsson 's Dune : Arenaceous Anti-Desertification Architecture ] .
[ Image : The view from within ; from Magnus Larsson 's Dune : Arenaceous Anti-Desertification Architecture ] .
For an ambitious landscape design project , Magnus Larsson , a student at the Architectural Association in London , has proposed a 6,000 km - long wall of artificially solidified sandstone architecture that would span the Sahara Desert , east to west , offering a combination of refugee housing and a " green wall " against the future spread of the desert .
Larsson 's project deservedly won first prize last fall at the Holcim Foundation 's Awards for Sustainable Construction held in Marrakech , Morocco .
One of the most interesting aspects of the project , I think , is that this solidified dunescape is created through a particularly novel form of " sustainable construction " – that is , through a kind of In other words , Larsson has proposed using bacillus pasteurii , a " microorganism , readily available in marshes and wetlands , [ that ] solidifies loose sand into sandstone , " he explains .
Larsson points out the work of the Soil Interactions Lab at UC - Davis , which describes itself as " harnessing microbial activity to solidify problem soils .
" But the idea of taking this research and applying it on a megascale – that is , to a 6,000 km stretch of the Sahara Desert – boggles the mind .
At the very least , the idea that this might be deployed for the wrong reasons , or by the wrong people , in some delirious hybrid of ice - nine , J.G. Ballard 's The Crystal World , and perhaps a Roger Moore - era James Bond film , deserves further thought .
An epidemic of bacillus pasteurii infects all the loose sand in the world , forming great aerodynamic fins and waves in a kind of global Utah of glassine shapes .
Clarifying the biochemical process through which his project could be realized , Larsson explained in a series of emails that his " structure is made straight from the dunescape by flushing a particular bacteria through the loose sand ... which causes a biological reaction whereby the sand turns into sandstone ; the initial reactions are finished within 24 hours , though it would take about a week to saturate the sand enough to make the structure habitable .
"
The project – a kind of bio-architectural test - landscape – would thus " go from a balloon - like pneumatic structure filled with bacillus pasteurii , which would then be released into the sand and allowed to solidify the same into a permacultural architecture .
" The " architectural form " of the resulting solidified sandscape is actually " derived from tafoni , " Larsson writes , where tafoni is " a cavernous rock structure that formally ties the project back to notions of aggregation and erosion .
On a conceptual scale , the project spans some 6,000 km , putting it on a par with Superstudio 's famous Continuous Monument – but with an environmental agenda .
" I 'm reminded of Michael Welland 's recent book Sand .
There , Welland describes " how deserts operate " ( he compares them to " engines " of mechanical weathering ) ; he points out that you can still find " sand - sized fragments of steel " on the D - Day beaches of Normandy , war having left behind a hidden desert of metal ; and he mentions that the UK now maintains " the world 's first database of sand " – but that it 's used " specifically for police forensics .
"
Welland 's descriptions of sand dune physics are particularly memorable .
He writes , for instance , that an avalanche is really a sand dune being " overwhelmed by the huge number of very small events " on its surface , and that these " very small events " unpredictably lead to one decisive moment of cascading self - collapse .
Fantastically , though , and more relevant to this post , he then compares the internal structure of sand dunes to Gothic cathedrals : the grains of sand piled high form " microscopic chains and networks ... in such a way that they carry most of the pressure from the weight of the material above them . "
This is the architecture of sand : Briefly , though , this image can be sustained through Welland 's descriptions of the great ergs , or sand seas , of today .
These dune seas " are tangibly mobile , ever changing , " Welland writes , " but there are larger areas of ergs past that are now fixed by vegetation .
"
He mentions the Sand Hills of northwestern Nebraska , " formed originally from the debris of the glacial erosion of the Rocky Mountains .
" But if sand dunes are Gothic cathedrals , and if those dunes can come back to life , the resulting image of resuscitated Gothic cathedrals moving slowly over the American landscape is almost too incredible to contemplate .
Larsson 's project descriptions maintain this somewhat hallucinatory feel :
A vast 3D printer made of bacteria crawls undetectably through the deserts of the world , printing new landscapes into existence over the course of 10,000 years ... Larsson goes on to contrast his method with existing vernacular techniques of anti-desertification :
The following images show us the lab - based biochemical practices through which a landscape can be lithified .
However , for me at least , these photos also come with the interesting implication that rogue basement chemists of the future wo n't be like Albert Hofmann or Ann Alexander Shulgin ; the heavily regulated underground rogue chemistry sets of the 21st century will instead synthesize new terrestrial compounds , counter - earths and other illegal geosimulants , rare earth anti-elements that might then catalyze a wholesale resurfacing of the world through radical landscape architecture .
Which leads me to ask : where is landscape architecture 's Aleister Crowley Madame Blavatsky , or even John Dee ?
Mystics of terrestrial form , hacking the periodic table of the elements inside makeshift labs .
In any case , Larsson 's " solidified dunes , " we read , would also " support the existing Green Wall Sahara initiative : 24 African countries coming together to plant a shelterbelt of trees right across the continent , from Mauritania in the west to Djibouti in the east , in order to mitigate against the encroaching desert .
" Clearly having thought through the project in extraordinary detail , Larsson then points out that the structure itself would generate a " temperature difference between the interior of the solidified dunes and the exterior dune surface . "
This then " makes it possible to start building a permacultural network , the nodal points of which would support water harvesting and thermal comfort zones that can be inhabited .
" Eventually , then , a 6000 km - long wall of permaculturally active , inhabited architecture will span the Sahara .

Reconstructing the skeleton of the " walking seal "
Enlarge Image
It may look like a cross between a seal and an otter ; but an Arctic fossil could , scientists say , hold the secret of seal evolution in its feet .
A skeleton unearthed in northern Canada shows a creature with feet that were probably webbed , but were not flippers .
Writing in the journal Nature , scientists suggest the 23 million - year - old proto - seal would have walked on land and swum in fresh water .
It is the oldest seal ancestor found so far and has been named Puijila darwini .
Puijila is the term for " young sea mammal " in the Inuktitut language , spoken by Inuit groups in Devon Island where the fossil was found .
Puijila is the evolutionary evidence we have been lacking for so long
Mary Dawson
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
And the reference to Charles Darwin honours the famous biologist 's contention that land mammals would naturally move into the marine environment via a fresh water stage , just as pinnipeds - seals , sealions and walruses - have apparently done .
" The find suggests that pinnipeds went through a fresh water phase in their evolution , " said Natalia Rybczynski from the Canadian Museum of Nature ( CMN ) in Ottawa , who led the fieldwork .
" It also provides us with a glimpse of what pinnipeds looked like before they had flippers . "
Flip side
The skeleton was about 65 % complete , which enabled the researchers to reconstruct what the animal would have looked like in remarkable detail .
The legs suggest it would have walked upright on land ; but the foot bones hint strongly at webbed feet .
The fact that the remains were found in a former crater lake that has also yielded fossil fish from the same period was additional evidence for a semi-aquatic past .
" The remarkably preserved skeleton of Puijila had heavy limbs , indicative of well developed muscles , and flattened phalanges ( finger or toe bones ) which suggest that the feet were webbed - but not flippers , " said Mary Dawson from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , US , another of the scientists involved .
" This animal was likely adept at both swimming and walking on land .
Puijila is the evolutionary evidence we have been lacking for so long . "
The scientists suggest this proto-seal lived on land and in fresh water
Until now , the most primitive fossil pinniped was a creature called Enaliarctos that dates from about the same period and appears to have lived in the sea along the northwestern coasts of North America .
Enaliarctos had flippers , but may have had to bring its prey to the shore for eating , whereas modern pinnipeds manage it at sea .
Intriguingly , different species of present - day seal swim in different ways - either rotating their flippers , or waving their hind - quarters from side to side , using the hind limbs for propulsion .
Enaliarctos appears to have been capable of both modes of swimming - and as a four - legged animal with four webbed feet , Puijila is a logical fore - runner of this creature which could swim with all four limbs .
The new discovery also shows , the scientists say , that seals , sealions and walruses very likely had their origins in the Arctic .
Darwin forecast the transition from land to sea via fresh water in his seminal work
On the Origin of Species , published 150 years ago this year .
" A strictly terrestrial animal , by occasionally hunting for food in shallow water , then in streams or lakes , might at last be converted in an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open ocean , " he wrote .

Stewart : GOP pundits ' confusing tyranny with losing ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday April 8 , 2009
Print This Email This Daily Show host Jon Stewart made fun of conservative attempts to label President Obama as a tyrannical leader and advised GOP members Tuesday to pace their rage because being in the minority party is supposed to taste like a  sh ** taco . 
Pointing out the inconsistencies in Republican and Fox pundit arguments that Obama is both simultaneously a weak and over - strong president , Stewart said ,  So not only is Obama a total pussy , whos going to let Europe run roughshod over us , hes also an iron - fisted tyrant , who will crush anyone who doesnt bend to his will . 
Stewart mocked Andrew Breitbart , a former editor of the Drudge Report , who now runs his own Web news portal , for saying that since Obama became president , his childrens public school no longer used the term  St. Patricks Day  but rather ,  Potato Day . 
 Im not Irish but I m not sure  Potato Day is more politically correct than St. Patricks Day .
I think it might be worse ,  laughed Stewart before going on to say :
 And while President Bush was the one who started the bailout , nationalizing an insurance company , added a $ 17 trillion drug prescription entitlement program , had a government - mandated public school initiative , literally titled  No Child Left Behind ,  wiretapped citizens without warrants , created secret internment camps in international waters behind the reach of our justice system and allowed his vice president to live in a netherworld between the executive and legislative branch
Only now with the advent of  Potato Day has tyranny come to our shores . 
Stewart advised angry Republicans that they were " confusing tyranny with losing . "
 Now you re in the minority , it s supposed to taste like a sh** taco . 
 And I feel for you , because Ive been there ,  said Stewart , who went on to point out a host of Bush decisions that liberals disagreed with .
 For Gods sake guys , youve been out of power for ten f**king weeks ,  said Stewart .
 Youve got a mid-term election in 20 months .
Pace your rage .
Stewart also chided conservatives for hypocrisy in accusing Obama of tyranny , when they were the ones to accuse liberals , who were angry with President Bush , of being unpatriotic .
 If I remember correctly ,  said Stewart ,  When disagreement was expressed about that presidents actions when yall were in power , I believe the response was  Why do you hate America ,   Watch what you say ,   Love it or leave it  and  Suck on my truck nuts .

CALGARY–One of the most pressing problems in Canada today is the terrible social conditions that exist in many aboriginal communities .
It is well known that the rates of poverty , substance abuse and violence are much higher for the native population , and that health and educational levels remain far below the national average .
Even more disturbing is the fact that the alarming statistics persist despite billions of dollars being spent on programs and services to alleviate these Third World conditions .
Why has so much government funding had so little impact ?
Fifteen years ago we decided to try to provide some answers to these perplexing questions .
The result is Disrobing the Aboriginal Industry : The Deception Behind Indigenous Cultural Preservation , a book that combines our own experiences with 10 years of additional research to investigate all aspects of aboriginal policy .
It shows that the reason for the massive policy failure is that current initiatives are being formulated and implemented by a self - serving " industry " that works behind the scenes in aboriginal organizations .
Legal firms masterminding the residential schools settlement and anthropologists directing " traditional knowledge " studies , for example , have received hundreds of millions of dollars over the years .
Some in this group of non-aboriginal lawyers and consultants have little incentive to solve aboriginal problems because they thrive on the continuation of aboriginal dependency and social dysfunction .
The reality of the aboriginal industry is that grievances result in the dispersal of government funds , and so its members benefit from perpetuating , rather than alleviating , aboriginal deprivation .
The aboriginal industry maintains this state of affairs , in part , by advocating cultural traditionalism in the native population .
No rational person believes that modern problems can be solved by reverting to the ways of our ancestors , as is assumed in aboriginal policy development .
This does not mean that we are prevented from appreciating historical accomplishments , only that we are not obligated to accept all past beliefs and practices under the guise of " preserving our culture . "
Valuing the plays of Shakespeare , for example , does not mean that we have to embrace the Divine Right of Kings , blood - letting or burning witches at the stake .
Aboriginal cultural features , however , are perceived as inexorable .
It is assumed , for example , that since aboriginal peoples were once hunters and gatherers , they should continue to hunt and trap and gather berries so as to preserve their " spiritual relationship " to the land .
Aboriginal languages that are spoken by only a few hundred people should be taught in the elementary grades , we are told , so that aboriginal " worldviews " can continue to find expression .
This is not to deny that aboriginal people , like all Canadians , should have the right to pursue the beliefs and cultural practices that give them satisfaction ; it is only to stress that this is a choice for individuals to make .
The idea that aboriginal peoples are natural hunters , or that they have a predetermined spirituality , is actually a form of racial stereotyping that constrains future possibilities .
Aboriginal people , like all other Canadians , can think for themselves .
Unproductive economic practices , tribal forms of political organization , superstitious " healing " initiatives , pre-literate languages and unscientific forms of " knowledge " are also encouraged because of the condescending assumption that this will raise aboriginal self - esteem and give native people the confidence to participate in modern society .
But such initiatives will not provide aboriginal people with the skills , knowledge and discipline needed to participate in a wide range of socially necessary occupations .
" Native studies " programs in Canadian universities , for example , teach that the myth that aboriginal peoples were placed in North America / Turtle Island by " the Creator " is just as valid as scientific theories about human migrations out of Africa .
But if aboriginal people are not encouraged to approach this myth critically , as occurs with respect to , say , Christian myths such as Genesis , how will aboriginal people become contributors to the fields of archaeology , palæontology and biology ?
The blanket promotion of aboriginal " worldviews " and " ways of life , " therefore , can rationalize aboriginal isolation .
Recognizing the need for aboriginal people to participate in Canadian society , instead of being warehoused on unviable reserves , does not constitute a proposal for " assimilation . "
Rather , it is a plea for integration whereby many aspects of aboriginal culture – humour , artistic sensibilities , noncoercive forms of child rearing and so on – will become part of the wider culture .
At the same time , however , integration recognizes that certain aspects of aboriginal culture are inhibiting aboriginal survival today , and these characteristics , as well as unviable aboriginal reserves and remote communities , should be allowed to gradually " wither away " according to the decline in their expedience .
The aboriginal industry , however , favours segregation over integration .
In order to prevent the recognition of this socially destructive policy direction , the aboriginal industry has developed some very effective tactics over the last 40 years .
It viciously attacks the credibility of opponents , arguing that criticism of aboriginal policy is to denigrate aboriginal people themselves .
" Racist , " " colonialist , " and " right - wing " are the most common insults hurled at those who dare to question the viability and effectiveness of land claims and self - government initiatives .
Recently , organizations like the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs have even argued that critics like us are guilty of " inciting hate , " and some members of the Canadian Political Science Association have asked if we should be charged under the Criminal Code .
As a result of these tactics , most people who are uncomfortable with the obviously unworkable and irrational character of aboriginal policy are discouraged from raising their concerns publicly .
Because the negotiation of land claims and self - government agreements occurs behind closed doors or in remote areas of Canada , most people are unaware of the machinations driving current aboriginal policy initiatives .
They assume that because a number of aboriginal leaders are supportive of the existing policy direction , this must be what most aboriginal people " want . "
These leaders have been corrupted by the financial rewards offered by the aboriginal industry , and therefore are completely unrepresentative of the interests of " their people . "
In fact , these leaders remain in positions of power because of native segregation and marginalization .
Many native leaders are anxious to build an " economic base " in their unviable communities because the aboriginal industry ensures that the leadership will profit from these initiatives .
Native leaders obtain a range of benefits , from " honoraria " to sinecures as members on the boards of the organizations that are set up to administer the transfers of funds and provision of services .
The aboriginal industry also needs the leadership to legitimate its proposals and ensure that community members are brought on side .
The latter acquiesce under the misguided assumption that they will benefit .
The fundamental needs of indigenous people are common to everyone in the modern period : education , health care and housing .
Provision of these services should be considered an obligation of the state and delivered with the consideration of the specific needs of aboriginal people .
Although this proposal for reasserting government control over the delivery of programs and services to the native population will be interpreted by some as " colonialism , " no advocate for social justice is opposed to publicly funded education or health care for other Canadian citizens .
In fact , the opposition is to offloading and contracting out – a circumstance that comes very close to what is actually occurring in aboriginal communities , with the resulting poor quality of care and low educational standards .
It is necessary for the current forms of cultural indoctrination that pass for education in native communities to be replaced by programs designed to address the failure of the system to provide education at the level enjoyed by all other Canadians .
This has occurred , for instance , at the Grandview / Uuquinak 'uuh Elementary School in East Vancouver , where dramatic improvements in educational achievement have been made , not by instituting " culturally sensitive " programs , but through a focus on literacy , academics and objective assessments .
Health care should also be provided at the high scientific standard received by the non-native population .
While housing in Canada is generated in the private sector according to profit motivation , native community housing is government funded .
However , the delivery is through housing boards which have , as their primary function , native board control .
This means that traditional customs determine distribution of housing and leadership administers building contracts .
The result is that relatives and favoured friends are allocated houses before those in direct need and building contracts are awarded to native shadow companies that profit by sub-contracting to outside construction firms .
These firms are then held up as examples of " successful " aboriginal businesses .
Exposing these deplorable circumstances in Disrobing the Aboriginal Industry has resulted in a polarized reaction .
Some have heralded it as a courageous and truthful book , while others have either misrepresented its contents or attacked us personally .
Although responding to the personal attacks has been an emotional strain and the " hate crime " allegation is disconcerting , we have come to realize that this is an inevitable process that we have to go through in order for real debate to take place about aboriginal policy in this country .
Intimidation and smear tactics may have worked in the past , but they are beginning to wear thin .
Now that it has been exposed that the Emperor has no clothes , his nudity cannot be denied indefinitely .

DNA may hold clues to an ancient movement from Ireland to Scotland Scientific evidence of an ancient invasion of Scotland from Ireland may have been uncovered by DNA techniques .
Researchers from Edinburgh University said studies of Scots living on Islay , Lewis , Harris and Skye found strong links with Irish people .
Early historical sources recount how the Gaels came from Ireland about 500 AD and conquered the Picts in Argyll .
Scientists said the study was the first demonstration of a significant Irish genetics component in Scots ' ancestry .
The research , which features work by geneticist Dr Jim Wilson , a specialist in population genetics , is being featured in programmes on Gaelic television channel BBC Alba .
The study also suggests intriguing ancestry of Scots living on the Western Isles and in the north and north east of Scotland .
Trading networks Dr Wilson said : " It was extremely exciting to see for the first time the ancient genetic connection between Scotland and Ireland - the signature of a movement of people from Ireland to Scotland , perhaps of the Scots or Gaels themselves . "
The origin of the Gaels - who by conquering and integrating with Pictish northern tribes created the Kingdom of Alba - has been debated by historians for centuries .
The earliest historical source comes from around the 10th Century and relates that the Gaels came from Ireland in about 500 AD , under King Fergus Mor .
However , more recently archaeologists have suggested the Gaels had lived in Argyll for centuries before Fergus Mor 's invasion .
The study also suggested an east - west genetic divide seen in England and attributed to Anglo - Saxons and Danes was evident in the north of Scotland .
This was noted in places far from Anglo - Saxon and Danish settlements , indicating that this division was older and may have arisen in the Bronze Age through trading networks across the North Sea .
Geneticists also said as many as 40 % of the population on the Western Isles could have Viking ancestry , while no Viking ancestry was found in north east Scotland .

The FOMC's Plan to Buy $ 1.1 + Trillion of T - bonds , Mortgage Debt , and " Other Financial Assets "
March 19 , 2009
The financial media is a -buzz over the Federal Open Market Committees decision yesterday to buy over a trillion dollars in assets .
Here is an example .
Another is here .
Let me parse the text of the FOMC 's press release .
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to contract .
Job losses , declining equity and housing wealth , and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending .
Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment .
U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession .
Although the near - term economic outlook is weak , the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions , together with fiscal and monetary stimulus , will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth .
The facts point to a continuing decline in the economy .
On the other hand , the Committee anticipates that the decisions of the Committee will slowly restore the economy .
This is reassuring .
Think of what the Committee would have had to say if the Committee believed that it was the decisions of the Committee , 2000 to 2007 , that got us into this mess .
In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad , the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued .
Subdued .
I like that .
It conveys an image of a guy in a straight - jacket who is on Valium .
Moreover , the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term .
Here it is , folks : inflation fosters economic growth .
We just do n't have enough inflation .
The Committee will remedy that !
In these circumstances , the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability .
Got that ?
We need more inflation in order to promote price stability .
You read it here first !
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period .
The Committee will maintain a rate that says that capital is a zero - price resource .
Scarcity has been repealed " for an extended period of time . "
To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets , the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $ 750 billion of agency mortgage - backed securities , bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $ 1.25 trillion this year , and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $ 100 billion to a total of up to $ 200 billion .
There will be an additional $ 750 billion in the monetary base , meaning high - powered money .
This will support the housing market .
We would n't want affordable housing .
The job of the Federal Reserve System is to keep housing prices higher than the free market would maintain .
This policy is consistent with the present policy of increasing inflation in order to attain price stability .
Moreover , to help improve conditions in private credit markets , the Committee decided to purchase up to $ 300 billion of longer - term Treasury securities over the next six months .
The Interest rate on 10 - year T - bonds was 2.5 % yesterday .
This is the longest maturity in the plan .
This rate is above 0 % , the rate for federal funds -- overnight loans , bank to bank .
The Treasury would prefer T - bond rates closer to 0 % .
So , the FOMC will add an additional $ 300 billion in high - powered money to achieve this .
The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets .
The FOMC will extend credit -- more high - powered money -- with collateral based on " other financial assets . "
What might these be ?
And how much money will be involved ?
Silence .
The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet in light of evolving financial and economic developments .
The Committee will monitor what the Committee is buying .
This is good .
What if the Committee did not monitor what the Committee is buying ?
Developments are evolving .
Developments have a tendency to do this .
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were : Ben S. Bernanke , Chairman ; William C. Dudley , Vice Chairman ; Elizabeth A. Duke ; Charles L. Evans ; Donald L. Kohn ; Jeffrey M. Lacker ; Dennis P. Lockhart ; Daniel K. Tarullo ; Kevin M. Warsh ; and Janet L. Yellen .
Unanimous !
Presentation to election officials underscores years of reporting at The BRAD BLOG , including dangers of voting machine ' sleepovers , ' and Sequoia Voting Systems ' continuing ties to Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/27/2009 , 4:02 pm PT
- Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
" I follow the vote .
And wherever the vote becomes an electron and touches a computer , that 's an opportunity for a malicious actor potentially to ... make bad things happen , " CIA cybersecurity expert Steven Stigall explained , in a stunning presentation to a U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) field hearing held one month ago in Orlando .
As initially reported earlier this week by Greg Gordon at McClatchy , " Stigall said that voting equipment connected to the Internet could be hacked , and machines that were n't connected could be compromised wirelessly .
Eleven U.S. states have banned or limited wireless capability in voting equipment , but Stigall said that election officials did n't always know it when wireless cards were embedded in their machines . "
" The CIA got interested in electronic systems a few years ago , " Gordon reports Stigall as explaining at the EAC hearing , " after concluding that foreigners might try to hack U.S. election systems . "
But as disturbing as Stigall 's presentation was , what 's almost as disturbing is that it took more than 11 days , McClatchy 's coverage , a number of FOIA requests from VotersUnite 's John Gideon ( a frequent guest blogger here ) , and a couple of articles from BRAD BLOG alum , Michael Richardson of the Examiner ( his coverage is here and here ) , before the EAC finally released the complete transcript of the meeting [ WORD ] , including Stigall 's remarks .
" The presenter did not provide the presentation , ' Computers and Elections : The Growing Potential for Cyber Vote Fraud ' , to the EAC , so we have no materials responsive to your request , " Gideon was told in response to his Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the EAC , as reported by Richardson .
" We received the transcript on March 16 , 2009 , and it will be publicly available in the next few days . "
As of last night , 10 days since the EAC admits they received the transcript of their own event which had taken place 20 days earlier , they had neither sent it to Gideon in response to his request , nor posted it on their website .
As of this morning , a month since the hearing , it 's finally up on their website , thanks in part , no doubt , to the pressure brought on the EAC by the public to do so .
Even then , Stigall 's remarks are not posted separately , as other presentations are , but rather , one has to go looking for the full transcript of the actual event to find it .
So why both the delay and obfuscation from the famously dysfunctional ( a nice way to put it ) federal agency ?
Make your own best guesses , since there is no official explanation for the moment .
Happily , there were others at the meeting who had transcribed the CIA cybersecurity expert 's startling remarks --- decimating the idea of supposedly " secure " e-voting --- independently , who then helped to bring it to the public 's attention .
Clearly , the strongly pro-e-voting EAC had / has little intention of doing so themselves .
Stigall 's presentation , and we 've got much more of it excerpted below , include a passel of disturbing thoughts .
Many of them we 've tried to impart on these pages for years , including comments which point up the dangers we 've tried to warn about concerning pre-election voting machine " sleepovers " at the houses of pollworkers , and more indications of the dangers of Sequoia Voting Systems clandestine , on - going relationship with the Hugo Chavez - tied Venezuelan e-voting firm Smartmatic , as we reported exclusively here one year ago --- to little interest from the corporate media , despite Sequoia 's claims to federal investigators that they had severed all ties with the firm ...
First , here 's a bit more from Gordon 's coverage at McClatchy :
WASHINGTON - The CIA , which has been monitoring foreign countries ' use of electronic voting systems , has reported apparent vote - rigging schemes in Venezuela , Macedonia and Ukraine and a raft of concerns about the machines ' vulnerability to tampering .
Appearing last month before a U.S. Election Assistance Commission field hearing in Orlando , Fla. , a CIA cybersecurity expert suggested that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his allies fixed a 2004 election recount ...
...
Steve Stigall summarized what he described as attempts to use computers to undermine democratic elections in developing nations .
His remarks have received no news media attention until now .
Stigall told the Election Assistance Commission , a tiny agency that Congress created in 2002 to modernize U.S. voting , that computerized electoral systems can be manipulated at five stages , from altering voter registration lists to posting results .
" You heard the old adage ' follow the money , ' " Stigall said , according to a transcript of his hour - long presentation that McClatchy obtained .
" I follow the vote .
And wherever the vote becomes an electron and touches a computer , that 's an opportunity for a malicious actor potentially to ... make bad things happen . "
Stigall said that voting equipment connected to the Internet could be hacked , and machines that were n't connected could be compromised wirelessly .
Eleven U.S. states have banned or limited wireless capability in voting equipment , but Stigall said that election officials did n't always know it when wireless cards were embedded in their machines .
The CIA got interested in electronic systems a few years ago , Stigall said , after concluding that foreigners might try to hack U.S. election systems .
He said he could n't elaborate " in an open , unclassified forum , " but that any concerns would be relayed to U.S. election officials .
We 'll post more disturbing excerpts from the CIA cybersecurity expert 's presentation in a moment , but two issues of note were raised by Stigall , and in McClatchy 's coverage , that we want to make sure to highlight here ...
Exit Polls Are Accurate ... ( Everywhere but in the U.S.A. , of course )
In addition to the troubling ( if well - familiar to readers of The BRAD BLOG ) assertions that Stigall makes about the dangers of e-voting in general , he goes on to explain , via the complete transcript , how a statistical analysis of an August 2004 referendum on recalling Hugo Chavez in Venezuela set off red flags among statisticians that the election was likely gamed by a " subtle algorithm " implanted into the e-voting system .
" [ T ] he mathematicians , " Stigall pointed out in his presentation , " produced lots of interesting facts and figures in the statistics to show that [ the voting patterns were ] statistically really not possible .
And they used that as an argument that Chavez , because of his complete control of the voting machines and their infrastructure , that Chavez was able to insert computer code into the system to adjust the vote surreptitiously . "
Of course , as regular readers here know well , when similar statistics , compiled by well - respected mathematicians and university professors in this country were produced following the 2004 Presidential election , suggesting a similar statistical impossibility for the variance from Exit Polls to the final results declaring George W. Bush the " winner " of that election , the academics were dismissed as crackpots and conspiracy theorists , and the startling numbers were otherwise all but ignored by the establishment media and politicians alike .
" Polls in thirty states were n't just off the mark --- they deviated to an extent that cannot be accounted for by their margin of error , " Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote in Rolling Stone in June of 2006 .
" [ W ] hen exit polls revealed disturbing disparities in the U.S. election , the six media organizations that had commissioned the survey treated its very existence as an embarrassment , " he explained , describing the alarming dismissal of Exit Poll analysis made by U. of Pennsylvania 's Steve Freeman and others .
" Instead of treating the discrepancies as a story meriting investigation , the networks scrubbed the offending results from their Web sites and substituted them with ' corrected ' numbers that had been weighted , retroactively , to match the official vote count .
Rather than finding fault with the election results , the mainstream media preferred to dismiss the polls as flawed . "
" As the last polling stations closed on the West Coast , " RFK continues , " exit polls showed Kerry ahead in ten of eleven battleground states --- including commanding leads in Ohio and Florida --- and winning by a million and a half votes nationally .
The exit polls even showed Kerry breathing down Bush 's neck in supposed GOP strongholds Virginia and North Carolina .
Against these numbers , the statistical likelihood of Bush winning was less than one in 450,000 . "
But , in the end , Kennedy details in his landmark article , " In ten of the eleven battleground states , the tallied margins departed from what the polls had predicted .
In every case , the shift favored Bush . "
If , as Stigall alleges , the CIA 's own mathematicians found a similar statistical anomaly in Venezuelan to be of concern , why then are similar anomalies in the U.S. seen as little more than fringe " conspiracy theories " ?
We report , you decide .
One of U.S. 's Top E - Vote Companies , Still Tied to Chavez - related Firm
McClatchy 's Gordon describes Stigall 's explanation of how Chavez was likely able to " defeat the paper trail " in a post- election " audit " of the " receipts " produced by the country 's , supposedly " open source " , touch - screen e-voting system , before explaining how the concerns about Venezuela 's election system tie directly into concerns about the voting systems used in more than a dozen states across the U.S. :
Questions about Venezuela 's voting equipment caused a stir in the United States ... because Smartmatic , a voting machine company that partnered with a firm hired by Chavez 's government , owned U.S. - based Sequoia Voting Systems until 2007 .
Sequoia machines were in use in 16 states and the District of Columbia at the time .
Reacting to complaints that the arrangement was a national security concern , the Treasury Department 's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States launched an investigation .
Smartmatic then announced in November 2007 that it had sold Sequoia to a group of investors led by Sequoia 's U.S. - based management team , thus ending the inquiry .
But as The BRAD BLOG reported exclusively last year , the " sale " of Sequoia by Smartmatic was not all that it seemed , despite apparently having fooled federal legislators and the media into believing otherwise .
As we revealed , Sequoia --- one of this nation 's largest voting machine companies , controlling 20 % of the votes cast here --- uses software that is still actually owned by Smartmatic , the Venezuelan firm associated with Hugo Chavez .
Despite Sequoia 's claims to have broken all ties with the company , after the matter had piqued the ire of several members of Congress , and a number of rightwingers in the media ( such as CNN's Lou Dobbs ) and in the blogosphere , Smartmatic still retains the Intellectual Property ( IP ) rights to virtually all of the Sequoia voting systems now in use in the United States .
Court documents [ PDF ] obtained and posted by The BRAD BLOG last year , while covering the previously - unreported hostile takeover attempt of Sequoia by Hart Intercivic , a competing e-voting company , confirmed that Sequoia had no claim to the IP rights of voting systems bearing the name Sequoia .
That , despite an agreement between federal investigators from the U.S. Treasury Department 's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) and Smartmatic which disallowed even " indirect " control over Sequoia by the Venezuelan firm with murky ownership associated with Chavez .
Following our story , Sequoia CEO Jack Blaine further confirmed his company 's continuing ties to Smartmatic during a hastily convened , " confidential " company - wide teleconference , scheduled to explain our exposé to Sequoia 's rank - and - file employees who had previously known nothing about the attempted takeover by Hart .
" It does n't matter whether you have the IP rights , or you do n't have the IP rights , " Blaine explained to an employee who inquired on the call about the IP rights licensing agreement Sequoia maintained with Smartmatic , as we 'd disclosed .
Blaine admitted --- while repeatedly stressing that information discussed on the call should remain confidential : " We have the source code , and we have the right to modify it any way we want to modify it ... So it does n't matter really whether we have the IP or not . "
" I did n't particularly want the IP , " Blaine revealed to employees on the " confidential " call , about the agreement he'd struck with Smartmatic when supposedly divesting from the Venezuelan firm .
" As we 've discussed in the past , I believe we 've really come across the perfect time to change our portfolio going forward .
And it's not gonna be dependent on the Smartmatic technology , or the IP or anything else .
It 's gonna be dependent on what we collectively believe the market , and what the future standards , will require . "
In a later report we revealed that Blaine had blatantly lied to Cook County ( Chicago ) , IL officials during testimony , in which they had expressed concern that the Smartmatic divestiture might be " a sham transaction designed to fool regulators . "
But despite Blaine 's misleading testimony to Chicago officials , and his company 's own press release trumpeting the " new corporate ownership " of Sequoia in late 2007 , maintaining that they'd " completely eliminate [d ]
Smartmatic 's ownership , control and operational rights of any kind in Sequoia , " the transaction was a sham which seems to have , apparently , succeeded in fooling federal regulators .
Despite all of the hard evidence unearthed by The BRAD BLOG at the time , the matter has still not been picked up and / or advanced by the mainstream corporate media in this country , despite Sequoia / Smartmatic 's e-voting systems continuing in use in more than a dozen states across the nation .
Gordon 's McClatchy coverage of Stigall 's remarks to the EAC panel represents the first coverage by a major outlet to revisit the matter to any extent since our series in March and April of last year , though he too has yet to deal with the Smartmatic ownership issues that we divulged on these pages a full year ago .
More From Stigall 's Startling Presentation
The complete transcript of Stigall 's remarks [ WORD ] offers much more than Gordon or Richardson 's articles have been able to cover to date .
One point after another underscores so much of what we 've been reporting on these pages for years , but it 's worth highlighting them in the exact words of a CIA expert whose job it is to monitor how electronic voting systems work --- or do n't --- around the world :
" For several years , I 've worked with others in my organization to try and identify foreign threats , emphasis on ' foreign threats , ' to important U.S. computer systems .
A few years ago it occurred to us that that should include potential foreign threats to the computers upon which our elections in this country are increasingly dependent . "
" [ W ] hen I look at an election system , I 'm not an election analyst .
I 'm not a political analyst .
...
When I look at an election system , I see a computer system , because increasingly that 's what they are .
And to the extent that there are foreign hackers who have shown interest in developing unauthorized access into U.S. computer systems , that 's where I get interested in it . "
" I am not a politician , a political analyst .
... I looked at this as a computer network , as a computer security issue .
... [ Y ] ou 've heard the old adage , " Follow the money . "
Here I follow the vote , and wherever the vote becomes an electron and touches a computer that is an opportunity for a malicious actor potentially to get into the system and tamper with the vote count or make bad things happen . "
" I 'm not so much looking at shenanigans on Election Day as I am all of the things that foreign actors try and do to effect the outcome of the election long before Election Day . "
" [ A ]ny computer hooked up to the Internet either through a wire or through a wireless connection is a portal for hackers .
You 've heard that and I 'm here to confirm it very simply . "
" [ I ] f you think a computer is not hooked up to the Internet there 's a variety of things that also are into play .
We now have , of course , wireless connections .
Perhaps a wireless connection is enabled , is file sharing enabled , this kind of thing .
It 's no longer enough simply to unplug something , to unplug that Ethernet jack or that , you know , 56 K modem wire .
A computer that is hooked up to the public Internet is problematic in this regard and the computerized registration of voters is the first indication we see that there 's a potential for fraudulent behavior in the electoral process . "
An electronic voting machine is a computer .
That 's the way we look at it .
It has memory .
It has so - called firmware , it has software built in to the hardware of the machine to tell it what to do , and most interestingly not only can it be networked but it can be interrogated from outside .
It 's a computer .
That 's essentially what it is , and because it 's a computer it carries with it all the vulnerabilities that a computer has .
The first question that one asks about these voting machines is , are they password protected ?
Okay , well there 's passwords and then there 's passwords .
Is the password the name of your granddaughter ?
Is it the name of your pet ?
If it is , I 'm going to have that password in an hour .
Not me personally , but I mean a dedicated hacker .
That 's what they do .
If it 's a so - called " strong password " , in which you use a mix of letters and numbers and special characters , you do greatly complicate the task for a malicious actor .
But then you have to ask yourself , are the passwords changed from election to election or is it the same ?
And our favorite scenario , where I come from , is your password p - a - s - s - w - o - r-d ?
You would be surprised .
( Ed Note : We 're not surprised at all .
Diebold 's default password , often never changed by the administrator , is " 1111 " , and everybody has known that for years .
And still , it 's often not changed by election administrators in this country . )
On " sleepovers " and other pre-election storage issues that we 've long tried to warn about here ( we 've been credited with having coined the word " sleepovers " in regard to the pre-programmed , election - ready voting machines that poll workers are often allowed to take home with them for sometimes days and weeks prior to the election , before bringing them to the polling place themselves on Election Day ) :
" When I look at a foreign country , and I suspect that the regime may be playing games with the computer component of the election system , one of the first questions I ask is , where are those machines stored ?
Or where are they stored , period , long before Election Day and afterwards ?
And I want to know if those machines can be interrogated electronically remotely on Election Day .
Is there a wire or a connection connecting those machines to , quite frankly , the public Internet ? "
" [ I ] n a traditional voting scheme the greatest opportunity for fraud that we have seen in other countries , is at the local level .
When you introduce computers into the equation , you 're moving that fraud potential upstream and you 're allowing an electronic single point failure , meaning the potential for mischief , can occur higher up the food chain electronically much faster and affect a lot more people in terms of the vote count than would be the case of fraud at an individual level where again you 're talking about the classic scenario where ballot boxes get thrown in the river or fraudulent ballots get produced ; here it 's electronic . "
The greatest threat to e-voting security , as we 've reported frequently over the years , based on the repeated warnings from computer scientists and security experts , is not from the voters on Election Day , but from election insiders who have access to the voting machines , memory cards and electronic tabulation computers .
That , despite repeated admonitions from election officials and the e-voting industry that , though their systems may not be secure , we can trust that election officials and the company employees who often program and service them would never do anything untoward .
Stigall seems to concur that assessment , made by election insiders about election insiders , is absurd :
[ W ] hen you look at all the reports from overseas about where computer vote fraud is most likely to occur , if you judge it simply by where all the reports in various foreign press or whatever discuss , it 's pretty clear that the central election headquarters , which is where all the computers are processing the votes or the one computer , this is a place where a lot of this can occur . "
The way the results of the 2004 election in Ukraine were transmitted and reported electronically , Stigall recounts , when the ruling party there was set to lose the election to the challenger , was startlingly similar to the allegations of what may have occurred on Election Night 2004 in Ohio when the incoming vote counts of the state 's 88 counties were surreptitiously rerouted to a hard - right Republican firm in Tennessee , in the middle of the night , before the final numbers were released to the public and the media :
[ The ruling party in Ukraine was ] monitoring the vote count coming in from different parts of the country , and they were making subtle adjustments to the vote .
In other words , intersecting the votes before it goes to the official computer for tabulation .
That 's nearly the precise allegation of those who have questioned the Election Night results reporting system created by then OH SoS J. Kenneth Blackwell in cahoots with the GOP 's high - tech guru Mike Connell .
Based on those concerns , Connell was subpoenaed and then forced by a federal judge to give testimony in Ohio to plaintiffs who have had a long - standing voting rights lawsuit concerning the '04 Presidential election there .
Not long after Connell was compelled to sit for a deposition with plaintiffs , on the Monday prior to Tuesday 's 2008 General Election , following reports that he had been threatened by Karl Rove if he did not " take the fall " for what happened in ' 04 , Connell died in a tragic single - engine plane crash in December .
" I 've referred a lot to hackers in this presentation , but understand I 'm not really concerned about the 18 - year old wannabes .
I 'm concerned about the 28 or the 38 - year old folks who have been doing this a long time and who may be under contract for some other organization .
In other words , an organized structured effort to throw an election , or to compromise a computer system in that context . "
" [ W ] here is the voter registration list before the election ?
Is it sitting on a computer that 's hooked up to the Internet ?
Is it sitting on a computer connected to another computer that 's hooked up to the Internet ?
Basically , that gives me an opportunity , simply , to reassert that the security of these elections that use computers begins long before Election Day and that the computers that hold that voter registration data should be nailed down in terms of their security , just as you would secure an electronic voting machine on Election Day .
...
You dont want it hooked up to the public Internet in terms of , you know , voter registration data if youre concerned about securing those names . "
Other than that , our years of reporting on the many concerns of e-voting here at The BRAD BLOG have been little more than the wacko , kooky , sour - grapes , fringe conspiracy theory ravings of a sore loser ( even though we did n't vote for John Kerry in 2004 ) .
CORRECTION 3/28/09 :
We originally referred to the EAC meeting in Orlando as a " field hearing " , as McClatchy 's piece did as well , and to Stigall 's presentation as " testimony " .
In fact , though Stigall answered questions from election officials at the EAC meeting , at the end of his Powerpoint presentation , he was not under oath , nor cross - examined , and so , as an attendee at the meeting pointed out to us , it 's inaccurate to refer to it as " testimony " .
We 've corrected the article above to more accurately reflect the setting for Stigall 's remarks to the EAC - convened panel .

What 's there : Information about stimulus - related contract proposals and awards from federal , state and local governments , searchable by state , county and city gao.gov / recovery Hosted by : The Government Accountability Office , the non-partisan investigative arm of Congress What 's there : Reports about stimulus spending and links to report abuse , waste and fraud USA TODAY WASHINGTON  Although President Obama has vowed that citizens will be able to track " every dime " of the $ 787 billion stimulus bill , a government website dedicated to the spending wo n't have details on contracts and grants until October and may not be complete until next spring — halfway through the program , administration officials said .
Recovery.gov now lists programs being funded by the stimulus money , but provides no details on who received the grants and contracts .
Agencies wo n't report that data until Oct. 10 , according to Earl Devaney , chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board , which manages the website .
Devaney told a House subcommittee Tuesday that it will be a challenge to have the site ready to present spending data in five months .
He said after the hearing that the board does n't have enough data storage capacity , for example .
Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia , a Republican serving on the House Science and Technology subcommittee , criticized the administration 's decision to require reporting of only the first two recipients of stimulus spending .
Broun said that means if the money goes to a state and then a city , the identities of the city 's contractors will be unavailable .
Devaney said that after the first data become available in October , the board will wait six to nine months for the White House Office of Management and Budget to issue new guidance on how far down the spending chain the money must be tracked .
" I 'm going to push them for as much data as possible , " he said .
Devaney 's spokeswoman , Nancy DiPaolo , said the website may not be completed until next spring .
The board solicited ideas for the site last week during an online " national dialogue " that drew 542 ideas and 1,330 comments .
The suggestions included adding mapping tools and other software to allow users to search the data .
People accustomed to getting easily searchable information quickly could be frustrated , said Greg Elin of the Sunlight Foundation , which is part of a coalition pressing for better access to spending data .
" If we have to wait until October to get the information or to the end of the year to get a powerful recovery.gov site , the Obama administration will have missed an important opportunity , " Elin said .
The site currently lists total amounts available and already spent — as of last week , $ 72.2 billion available and $ 15.4 billion spent .
There 's also an interactive map showing allocations for each state .
As with all federal contracts , information about stimulus contracts is available on the Federal Procurement Data System 's website , but that data is not available on recovery.gov .
In addition , 29 federal departments and agencies provide stimulus spending information .
The quality of those websites varies , from a list of news releases and planning reports from the Justice Department to a chart detailing major programs and a clickable map with state - level funding figures on the Energy Department 's site .
The 50 state stimulus websites also differ .
Most of Mississippi's site , for example , is taken up by a message from Republican Gov. Haley Barbour noting he opposed the stimulus .
Texas , by contrast , has a site featuring links to information about applying for stimulus grants and contracts .
Elin said the Obama administration is moving relatively quickly to gather and present massive amounts of data .
Nevertheless , executives at Onvia , which collects government contracting information for its clients , are skeptical that recovery.gov can meet the administration 's goals .
Onvia , which is posting stimulus - related data on its recovery.org website , took much longer to develop its systems , said Eric Gillespie , Onvia 's chief information officer .
" It 's really , really hard , " Gillespie said , " and it 's taken us 10 years to figure out . "

A partially - submerged tree shows Lake Bosumtwi was shallower in the past Severe droughts lasting centuries have happened often in West Africa 's recent history , and another one is almost inevitable , researchers say .
Analysis of sediments in a Ghanaian lake shows the last of these " megadroughts " ended 250 years ago .
Writing in the journal Science , the researchers suggest man-made climate change may make the situation worse .
But , they say , the droughts are going to happen again anyway , and societies should begin planning for them .
" It 's disconcerting - it suggests we 're vulnerable to a longer - lasting drought than we 've seen in our lifetime , " said Tim Shanahan from the University of Texas in Austin , who led the research team .
What West Africa wo n't handle - and neither will California - is the 100 - year - long , deep megadrought
Professor Michael Schlesinger
" If the region were to shift into one of these droughts it would be very difficult for people to adapt ; and we need to develop an adaptation policy . "
The region 's most recent dry episode was the Sahel drought which claimed at least 100,000 lives , perhaps as many as one million , in the 1970s and 80s .
But the historical " megadroughts " were longer - lasting and even more devoid of precipitation , the researchers found .
Deep impact
The evidence comes from Lake Bosumtwi in southern Ghana , a deep lake formed in a meteorite impact crater .
Sediments laid down each year form neat , precise layers .
" Nothing lives at the bottom of the lake , so nothing disturbs these layers , " said Professor Shanahan .
" Most lakes have this seasonal deposition , but it 's rare in the tropics to find a lake where the bottom is undisturbed . "
Wet and dry years are distinguished by the ratio of two oxygen isotopes in the sediment .
Layers of sediment preserve a record of rainfall
Droughts lasting a few decades occur regularly over the 3,000 years contained in this record .
They appear to be linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) , a natural climatic cycle in which sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean vary over time .
The Sahel drought coincided with a cool phase of the AMO .
This changes wind patterns , and decreases the strength of the monsoon rains in this region .
However , the cause of the longer , multi-century droughts is not clear .
" That 's one of the scary aspects - we have no idea what causes them , " said Jonathan Overpeck from the University of Arizona , who oversaw the research effort .
" In Africa , we could cross the threshold , driving the system into one of these droughts , without even knowing why . "
Money flows Michael Schlesinger , who first characterised the AMO a decade ago but was not involved in the current study , suggested a similarity between the outlook for West Africa and the southwestern portion of the US .
There , research has also shown a history of shorter and longer droughts .
" There are two things that need to be done , one of which California and Arizona and so on have done - and that is put in the water collection and distribution infrastructure to deal with the short periods of not very intense water stress , " the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign scientist told BBC News .
The southwestern US has seen prolonged dry weather " What West Africa wo n't handle - and neither will California - is the 100 - year - long , deep megadrought .
" The only way I can see of dealing with that is desalination ; if push comes to shove and these megadroughts appear - and they will , and it'll probably be exacerbated by man-made global warming - that will be the only thing to do . "
Whereas the southwestern US could afford desalination , it is not clear that West African countries could - nor do they all have the infrastructure to move water inland .
The possibility of man-made climate change causing worse droughts is an example of the impacts that many developing countries fear , and which causes them to seek money from richer countries to protect their societies and economies .
Professor Schlesinger is at one with Tim Shanahan 's team in suggesting that human - induced climate change would be likely to make droughts more severe , although computer models of climate produce varying projections for rainfall change over the West African region .
But even without changing the chances of drought , rising temperatures worsen the region 's outlook , suggested Professor Overpeck .
" Even if we were able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions somewhat , we would still probably have warming in this region of about 2 - 4C over the century , and that could make droughts much harder to adapt to when they occur , " he said .
" What it 's pointing to is the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ; but you can't do it all with mitigation , just as you can't do it all with adaptation . "

About The Film :
( OrganicJar )
An exciting new film called Food Inc. is about to inform the world how little we know about the food we eat .
I think everyone will be shocked at how few corporations control our food supply and how they have dominated the industry .
It ’ll make you think twice about the food you eat and how important it is to buy locally .
How much do we really know about the food we buy at our local supermarkets and serve to our families ?
In Food , Inc. , filmmaker Robert Kenner lifts the veil on our nation 's food industry , exposing the highly mechanized underbelly that 's been hidden from the American consumer with the consent of our government 's regulatory agencies , USDA and FDA .
Our nation 's food supply is now controlled by a handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of consumer health , the livelihood of the American farmer , the safety of workers and our own environment .
We have bigger - breasted chickens , the perfect pork chop , insecticide - resistant soybean seeds , even tomatoes that wo n't go bad , but we also have new strains of e coli-- the harmful bacteria that causes illness for an estimated 73,000 Americans annually .
We are riddled with widespread obesity , particularly among children , and an epidemic level of diabetes among adults .

The debut of Fast And Furious is quickly approaching .
Last year , we went on - set for this exclusive behind - the - scenes look at the vehicles starring in the fourth installment of this high octane and high cheese series .
We braved the surprisingly chilly Los Angeles evening last year to witness the taping of Fast And Furious , the fourth ( and maybe not final ) film in the The Fast And The Furious series .
We were there the night of the famous Vin Diesel Chevelle wheelie , a shot which we can honestly say took forever to setup .

The day 's shooting took place at a parking garage in Los Angeles ' Koreatown neighborhood that doubles as a driving range .
The top level of the garage is covered with a 150 - yard - long green beneath which countless hours and dollars worth of machines rest , safely out of the way of botched drives .
Though quirky , the layout provides an ideal condition for shooting the cars with multiple heights and cameras available without the need for setting up cranes .
Plus it just looks awesome .
We 'll be honest , we 're not the biggest fans of the Fast And The Furious film franchise .
We enjoy car chases , crashes and mayhem as much as anyone but there 's always been a sense that the franchise perhaps takes advantage of this .
Justin Lin , director of the third film in the series , Tokyo Drift , and the latest film aknowledged this in an interview we did with him last year :
Justin Lin , Director
I think one of the knocks against the franchise was that it took and exploited cars .
And made it look kind of cartooney . "

Is this to happen again with the latest movie ?
Hard to say , but In our brief set visit we had a chance to converse with the cast , crew and extras over automotive topics as varied as the steps necessary to convert a Merkur XR4Ti Into a Ford Sierra and the different merits of the two generations of Toyota Tundras .
We were pleased to find most of the people involved , at least on the car side , actually cared about vehicles ( though tastes varied widely ) .
We spoke with Paul Walker , who plays the handsome and serious Brian O'Conner , about the film .
This was mostly boring chatter about the movie - making process .
Eventually we turned the conversation to cars and Walker lit-up .
Apparently , Walker is n't of the get - rich - and - buy - a - Bentley variety of movie stars .
In fact , he's of the not - enough - room - in - my - garage - for - all - the - toys variety a la Jay Leno .

In addition to a fairly predictable Ferrari 360 , Walker boasted at the time of owning a classic late 1940's Chevy Woody and a Toyota Tundra with some modifications , which he loved to talk about .
This is n't surprising , given the first car he bought with his money was a 1986 Ford Ranger .
Most surprisingly , perhaps , is his admission he reads car forums and actually posts occasionally .
Because he seemed like a genuinely nice guy we wo n't " out " the forums or his member name .
The day we visited there were lots of actors running around , including Vin Diesel , what we presume to be his muscles , both zooming to and fro on a pair of motorized scooters and matching fur coats ( no joke ) , but the cars are the real stars for us .
Nearly all of the two dozen cars stationed around the roof have their own stories and , luckily for us , the owners and keepers of the cars are around to share them .

The other most prominent vehicle was the Pontiac Solstice .
The owners of the cars , including the yellow Solstice used in almost every FAF marketing piece , claimed it was probably one of the biggest collections of performance - oriented Solstices in one place .

There 's a lot of information in the galleries above and , we think , no real spoilers .
But here 's one piece of interesting background info .
It was unseasonably cold while they shot the parking garage drag race scene but , in being true to the franchise 's mise en scene , you can't have a drag race without scantily clad girls .
Let 's just say it was a good day to be a blanket .
We 're not sure if it 'll show up in the final print but there was teeth chattering all around .
We can't lay a final verdict on the film until we see it and the dialogue we heard , while predictably comic book , gave no hint to the full tone of the film .
We were actually surprised the trailer had such a Bourne Identity look to it .
We can only hope the marriage of the best characters from the series ( who does n't love Vin Diesel ? ) to arguably the franchise 's best director yields a not - too - serious car flick filled with a lot of metallic eye candy .
A spokesman for the White House said : " This is the fifth time in 15 years that they 've sought to nullify the armistice governing the Korean War . "
He added : " Threats wo n't get North Korea the attention it craves .

Mr Netanyahu 's cabinet is the biggest in Israel 's political history
By Paul Wood
Middle East correspondent
Some political analysts have been known to call Israel 's electoral system the worst - designed in the democratic world .
It took Benjamin Netanyahu a marathon seven weeks of negotiating to stitch together his governing coalition .
It was no surprise that he looked a little weary at the podium in the Knesset , or parliament , last night .
COALITION MEMBERS Likud : 27 seats , 15 ministers Yisrael Beiteinu 15 : 5 ministers Labour : 13 seats , 5 ministers Shas : 11 seats , 4 ministers Jewish Home : 3 seats , 1 minister United Torah Judaism : 5 seats
Profile : Benjamin Netanyahu
The last two weeks of that effort was concerned with bringing the Labour party into the government .
Mr Netanyahu knew that an administration perceived as narrowly right - wing would cause Israel problems internationally .
The result has been one of the biggest governments in Israel 's history .
They even had to bring carpenters into the Knesset to enlarge the cabinet meeting table .
Not everyone is happy , including members of his own Likud party who have seen their own ministerial ambitions shunted aside .
Last - minute meetings were held through the early hours of the previous night so Mr Netanyahu could assuage his colleagues ' bruised feelings .
As he announced the long , long list of his new ministers to the Knesset , he was heckled by those who think the government is just too big .
Opposition MKs ironically called out , " seven , eight , nine ... " each time Mr Netanyahu added a new minister to the list .
" Oh , they know how to count , " he fired back .
' Go to hell '
Mr Netanyahu's big tent now encompasses Avigdor Lieberman , leader of the hard - line Yisrael Beitainu party , and Israel 's new foreign minister .
Already there have been unhelpful rumblings in Egypt , one of only two Arab countries with which Israel has managed to make peace .
Mr Lieberman 's offence was to tell the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , to " go to hell " last year .
Mr Lieberman 's appointment as foreign minister has rankled Arab states Mr Lieberman has toned down the rhetoric since the election .
Mr Netanyahu , too , was on a charm offensive in the Knesset .
He promised that Middle East peace negotiations would continue .
Of course , it will not have passed unnoticed that he failed to say that such a peace would be based on the two - state solution .
Mr Netanyahu opposes a sovereign Palestinian state , arguing that the West Bank could become a launch pad for rockets which would threaten Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport .
This opposition to the two - state solution potentially puts him on a collision course with Washington and the rest of the international community .
Testing times
Perhaps the most significant part of the incoming prime minister 's speech was his oblique reference to Iran 's supposed ambitions to obtain nuclear weapons .
In an apparent reference to Tehran , Mr Netanyahu said the biggest threat to Israel and the world came from " the possibility of a radical regime armed with nuclear weapons " .
Israeli military intelligence assesses that Iran is close to getting the bomb .
Mr Netanyahu feels strongly that this can not be allowed to happen .
Iran , meanwhile , says its nuclear technology is being developed purely for peaceful purposes .
So , although Mr Netanyahu was careful to say to the Knesset that Israel 's existence was not in jeopardy , he believes these will be testing times for the country .
In these circumstances , he wanted a government of national unity .
He did n't get it , but did achieve something close .
Now the challenge - thanks to Israel 's electoral system - will be keeping it together .

Here ’s a story we hear a lot at EFF : You think BadCo , Inc. is a bad actor and you ’ve developed a really cool site to tell the world why .
Maybe just by griping about them or maybe through a bit of parody .
Fast forward two weeks : you ’re basking in the pleasure of calling BadCo out when bam !
You find out your site ’s been shut down .
You call your internet service provider to find out what ’s going on .
After way too much time climbing phone trees and sitting on hold you get an answer — Badco has claimed that your site violates its intellectual property rights .
All too often , the targets of critics and parodists try to strike back with accusations of copyright or trademark infringement .
While such accusations may be something of a badge of honor -- after all , at the very least , it means you 've got your target 's attention -- they can also be frustrating and intimidating .
And , if you rely on a service provider with little interest in protecting free speech , allegations of infringement can result in your site being shut down with little or no warning .
Fortunately , there are several steps you can take to either preempt or significantly dilute gripes about your gripe ( or parody ) site .
We lay out those steps in a new white - paper , Avoiding Gripes About Your Gripe ( or Parody ) Site .
To be clear , you do n't have to follow any of these suggestions to have a perfectly legal site , and following them wo n't guarantee you wo n't get complaints .
But taking these steps should help minimize your legal risk , so you can focus on the primary task of raising public awareness about the issues that are important to you .
And if you get hit with improper legal threats anyway ?
Well , you know where to find us .
And so far I ’m more than underwhelmed .
It looks like a remade Fox News website on the main page with a few extra conservative buzzwords thrown in ( “ Real American Stories ” comes to mind here ) .
Only comments are added .
It ’s kind of a news blog I guess .
Here ’s the site ’s stated “ purpose ” …
The Fox Nation was created for people who believe in the United States of America and its ideals , as expressed in the Constitution , the Declaration of Independence , and the Emancipation Proclamation .
It is a community that believes in the American Dream : Life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
One that believes being an American is an honor , as well as a great responsibility — and a wonderful adventure .
This is a place for people who believe we live in a great country , a welcoming refuge for legal immigrants who want to contribute their talent and abilities to make our way of life even greater .
We believe we should enjoy the company and support of each other , delighting in the creativity , ingenuity , and work ethic of one and all , while observing the basic rules of civility and mutual respect and , most importantly , strengthening our diverse society by striving for unity .
The Fox Nation is for those committed to the core principles of tolerance , open debate , civil discourse–and fair and balanced coverage of the news .
It is for those opposed to intolerance , excessive government control of our lives , and attempts to monopolize opinion or suppress freedom of thought , expression , and worship .
We invite all Americans who share these values to join us here at Fox Nation .
It really chaps my hide to see a news organization create something like this .
News is supposed to chronicle what ’s going on , not organize or represent a movement , be it conservative or liberal .
This is worse than MSNBC going liberal in primetime .
What ’s even sadder is the pandering that FNC is doing here .
It ’s lip service .
If FNC really wanted to accomplish the things that it spelled out above , it would have gone about it in a whole different manner .
This is nothing more than mere window dressing designed to attract in conservatives without really doing anything more than say “ Hey Conservatives , come here ! ”
It ’s quite cynical actually …

When I arrived at the Honda press briefing at the W hotel in Times Square on Tuesday , a woman from Honda asked me , “ What ’s your shoe size ? ”
At that point , I knew it was going to be an unusual experience .
In the corner of a small meeting room , I found a display of two devices .
One looked like robotic legs pulled from the pages of a manga .
The other looked like a mechanical girdle ( strapped around a clear mannequin torso ) .
The devices , I was told by David Iida , a Honda spokesman , are meant for people who have difficulty walking .
Aging is an important issue in Japan right now .
The population has the world ’s highest elderly ratio , which was covered in the Lede blog last year , and many times prior .
Honda has been working on walking assist devices since 1999 out of its Honda Fundamental Research Institute , part of Honda Research and Development .
This is the same group that produced HondaJet , which will go on sale later this year , and the Brain - Machine Interface , which I previously suspected was an April Fool ’s joke ( it ’s not ) .
The two devices Honda had on display on Tuesday were the Body Weight Support Assist ( the robotic legs ) and the Stride Management Assist ( the girdle ) .
Honda officially unveiled them last year in Japan , but has only recently offered “ test walks ” in the United States .
The devices are still in the prototype stage , and Honda does not have a timetable for production , but it ’s safe to say they ’re at least a couple of years away .
The Stride Management Assist straps around the hip , like a fanny pack .
The whole thing weighs 5.6 pounds and is made up of three mechanical parts : a compartment that sits at the small of the back , which contains the control computer and battery , and two small motors that have the diameter of a CD and are positioned at the hipbones .
Two splints snap into the motor and strap to the thighs .
A sensor in each motor detects the angle of each leg and the computer calculates how much assist to provide each leg to improve the strides .
The mechanical pants from Wallace and Gromit ’s “ Wrong Trousers ” came immediately to mind .
But the Stride Management Assist does n’t move on its own ; it only provides subtle assistance when it detects movement .
In tests , Honda said that the device had been shown to lower heart rate because it reduces the level of effort , as well as provide greater muscle activity in the hips and lower legs .
And users ’ bodies eventually develop a wider walking stride after use .
Shoe size came into play for the Body Weight Support Assist , which comes with built - in sneakers that slip on and zip up .
The rest of the slender device is pulled up until its tiny seat ( smaller than a bicycle seat ) reaches your groin .
The device reduces the weight of your body on the legs ( Honda has programmed it for six pounds of relief in a standing position ) .
As you bend your legs , the device relieves an increasing amount of body weight , up to 17 pounds .
“ It makes you feel like you weigh less , ” said Jun Ashihara , the chief engineer on the project .
The technology found in both devices has a direct lineage to Asimo , Honda ’s humanoid robot , which has been in development for nearly 25 years .
The team has gone through at least 30 different prototypes of the Body Weight Support Assist alone over the past 10 years , and there ’s still work to do before the devices are ready for production .
Honda said it hopes to reduce the weight of both devices further , increase the life in the lithium - ion batteries and streamline the overall designs .
While aging might have been the necessity that spawned the walking assist program , there are other uses for them .
Honda is testing the Stride Management Assist in a rehabilitation hospital in Japan .
The Body Weight Support Assist is being used by Honda workers in its Saitama factory .
As I was leaving , Mr. Ashihara told me that at least one surgeon has suggested to him that the Body Weight Support Assist would be useful during long operations , during which doctors are required to stand in a semi-crouched position for hours .
Assuming it is out of the question to hang , draw and quarter Sir Fred Goodwin , pluck out his intestines while they are still warm and wriggling , stuff them into his greedy mouth and then display his severed head on a spike at the Tower of London , could we settle for shooting him instead ?
Yes , I know , I 'm going soft .
Not as soft , mind you , as the politicians who merely condemn him .
Gordon Brown calls it " unjustifiable and unacceptable " that the man who led RBS to ruin should refuse to give up a pension worth in excess of £ 650,000 a year .
Peter Mandelson today escalates the government 's outrage .
In my interview with the business secretary for the Observer , he calls Sir Fred " obscene " .
Trouble is that I doubt being told that he is an obscenity , even when the name - caller is such a grandee as Lord Mandelson , will cause Fred the Shred to lose much sleep .
If Sir Fred had a pound for every time he has been called something rude , he'd be ... well , he'd be as ludicrously rich as he already is .
Politicians can use whatever adjectives they like to deplore this banker and his wretched ilk for demanding gargantuan rewards for abject failures .
The issue is , what is to be done about it ?
Bankers are hated by the voters , universally pilloried in the media and their excesses have been condemned by every political party from the SWP to the BNP and all points between .
And yet still they do n't give a damn .
Exhortation and condemnation is wasted breath unless it is accompanied by action .
Even though the bankers are now supplicants to the taxpayer , the government is still showing them far too much reverence .
Having been in thrall to the erstwhile masters of the universe for a generation , the political class has still not entirely shed its deference to the fallen money changers .
Some of the dilemmas faced by ministers when grappling with these characters are real and tricky .
They worry that attacking the bankers too viciously will further undermine confidence in the financial system .
They fret over the extent to which politicians and civil servants are equipped to interfere in the detailed running of these failed institutions .
Even though the banking system is now effectively nationalised , Gordon Brown wants to keep his distance from managing it .
That leaves the government with responsibility while still being highly hesitant about exercising control .
One minister who is grappling with the toxic issue of Fred the Shred and his pension groans that it is " a legal nightmare " .
They say the same about the bankers ' enthusiasm for continuing to pay themselves whopping bonuses .
Ministers mutter that contractual obligations make it all very difficult .
Yet it should not be beyond the capacity of the politicians to cut through the legal thicket .
This is one of the advantages of being the government : if the law is a ass , you can change it .
Had RBS been any other sort of business , it would now be bust .
But for the billions poured in by the taxpayer , this bank would be kaput .
There would be no pension honey pot for Sir Fred to stick his paw in .
If the law is the problem with stopping him , then the law can be changed .
The voters have seen things more clearly .
Their fury with the feckless financiers has cut through the complexities that fog the minds of ministers .
The bankers behaved with an arrogant recklessness which broke their own businesses and devastated large sections of the economy .
Now they are getting bailed out with everyone else 's money .
Bankers should be grateful if they still have a job and relieved that they have not been lynched .
They should not be slurping up enormous bonuses and vast pensions .
End of story .
The politicians have lacked the clarity of that anger .
Even after the bankers had wrecked the financial system , ministers were hesitant about putting them in their place .
When they launched the first bail - out last autumn , the Treasury and Number 10 appear to have been astonishingly innocent in assuming that the bankers would quickly own up to the full extent of their mistakes .
The epic scale of the horrors has only become apparent to ministers as the government has slowly drilled into the bankers ' books .
A similar naivety has characterised their approach to bankers ' remuneration .
Ministers were taken by surprise by the determination of bailed - out banks to carry on paying lavish bonuses and golden pension parachutes to failed executives .
It is not denied that the City minister Paul Myners knew about the eye - popping size of Sir Fred 's pension .
Yet he did not demand that it be reduced or suggest steps to confiscate it altogether .
Lord Myners did not argue that Sir Fred ought to be given the sack rather than the cushy option of early retirement .
If the government raised no objection , it was because politicians did n't think they had the power to do so .
Even in a case of such manifest and colossal failure , ministers were still programmed to take the softly - softly approach when dealing with bankers .
Lord Myners eventually suggested to Sir Fred that the banker should voluntarily give up part - only part , mind you - of his absurd pension .
The City minister seems to have thought that the threat of unpleasant publicity might be a sufficient inducement for Sir Fred to do the decent thing and hand back some of the cash .
That was to misread his character .
If Sir Fred was bothered about what everyone thought of him , he would have long ago left the country to live the rest of his life caring for the destitute of Mongolia .
Men like Fred the Shred do not feel shame .
They feel only for their wallets .
On the other side of the Atlantic , Barack Obama has had a clearer eye about what he is dealing with , and therefore a firmer grasp of what needs to be done .
The president , being new to office and of a younger generation than Gordon Brown , is not trapped by the past compromises with casino capitalism which were made by the prime minister and other centre - left leaders of his vintage .
Obama did not hesitate .
He crisply told bankers that their salaries would be capped and that they could forget about pocketing any more bonuses until the taxpayers had got their money back .
In his speech a few days ago to both houses of Congress , the new president gave a compelling and unflinching account of the vices of the bubble years .
" The fact is our economy did not fall into decline overnight , " he told America .
" We have lived through an era where too often short - term gains were prized over long - term prosperity . "
He used the pulpit of the presidency to tell his people that they had arrived at a " day of reckoning " .
Follow that , Mr Brown .
Actually , the prime minister does have to follow that .
He is flying to Washington this week where he will both meet the president and address a joint session of Congress .
It is a rare honour for a foreign leader to receive this invitation and Mr Brown is justly proud to be joining the company of Winston Churchill , Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair .
It may be an added satisfaction to Mr Brown that his predecessor was n't rewarded with this accolade until he'd been prime minister for six years and joined George Bush 's war in Iraq .
When they first knew they had landed this big gig for Mr Brown in Washington , Number 10 got terribly excited .
Now , as the deadline to the speech approaches , they are feeling increasingly anxious .
The prime minister knows this is a very important speech for his reputation on both sides of the Atlantic .
Over the last week , he has spent more working hours labouring over his address to Congress than he has devoted to anything else .
His most senior aides and closest allies in the cabinet have been in and out of his office from very early in the morning - a seven o'clock summons has been typical - to help the prime minister prepare for his glittering moment on Capitol Hill .
In some senses , it is not a speech that can fail .
Congress is extremely polite to visiting leaders .
Mr Brown 's rhetorical style may not be one that Americans are all that familiar with , but they will applaud him nevertheless .
He could read out the Kirkcaldy phone directory and he would still be guaranteed several standing ovations .
If inspiration fails him , he can always serve up a routine speech extolling the Special Relationship .
His audience will applaud a lot , inwardly yawn , and then everyone will go home feeling none the wiser .
So he needs to deliver something more ambitious , more interesting and more challenging than that .
The rarity and glamour of this occasion means that this is a speech that the prime minister can use to address not just America , but also to grab the attention of his domestic audience too .
There is more of a chance that British voters will tune into the prime minister when he addresses them from such a big stage as Capitol Hill .
Some of his confidants in the cabinet worry that the spectacle of Mr Brown grandstanding in America could backfire with British voters if he does not have something to say which resonates with them and their concerns .
I recommend that the prime minister watches Obama 's address to Congress .
That succeeded because he gave a candid account of what went wrong during the bubble years and that allowed him to be persuasive about how it can be put right .
How does Gordon Brown follow that ?
He could do a lot worse than copy it .
And that 's where I come in .
My goal is to hold him accountable to the people in his district .
I 've welcomed his emergence as the mouthpiece of the party because his constituents really do n't seem to know a lot about him and what he really stands for .
He 's seen as a business - friendly moderate , the Republican version of Mark Warner , and nothing could be further from the truth .
The more the voters of Virginia 's 7th District learn about him , the less they will like him , I can almost guarantee .
He 's thrived on working in the shadows and running against candidates without the means to set an effective narrative against him .
Based on the search results I 've been getting so far , there 's a real thirst for information on Cantor out there , and my task is to educate these people on who Eric Cantor really is and what he stands for .
It 's an uphill struggle , that 's for sure .
Cantor is considered one of the untouchables of the GOP , winning huge majorities in every election , albeit against unfunded opponents .
I intend to help change that .
Eric Cantor is beatable .
Virginia is changing , fast , and there 's little changing faster than the suburbs of Richmond , Cantor 's home base .
As of right now , I am affiliated with no candidate , nor do I support any candidate to run against him ( although , hint , hint , name - recognition will be high for the two who lose the gov primary , hint , hint ) .
All I ask for is your support .
I 'll be closely following what is said here and elsewhere about Cantor .
I 'm putting together my own research book on Cantor which should be useful not only for me but for whomever eventually takes a shot at him .
I 'll be cross-posting here as time goes on .
If you 'd like to help hold him accountable , visit me at Where 's Eric Cantor ?
If you have any information you think might help , feel free to forward it on .
Every little bit helps .
If there 's anything you think I might do better , also feel free to let me know .
Thanks so much for reading , and I hope to see you soon .
Once upon a time I wrote a formatter for a new hard disk drive product .
I was young and impressionable , and had once lost a bunch of work when I accidentally wiped a disk , and so this utility was paranoid and asked if you were really sure , absolutely positively bloody sure that you wanted to format the disk , and it did this by prompting and forcing you type in the phrase , “ Yes Mother , I really want to format the hard disk . ”
Verbatim .
Including capital - M Mother and the dot at the end .
I was young , and was a jerk .
It was an interim tool anyway , just a hack to get our disk prototypes off the ground .
A couple months later I wrote a GUI - based formatter and that ’s what shipped to end -users .
I forgot about the earlier utility .
Childish things , and all that .
As far as I know , only a couple of people in the s/w development group had had to suffer through my sick little joke , and they did so with complete empathy .
Everyone has lost data to some bright moment of utter stupidity .
( Oh shit , did I really just type Y , return ?
Did I really not back anything up in the last week ? )
About a year later one of my cow - orkers visited the Taiwanese factory where they made the drives , and he returned with a curious story .
It turned out that the official GUI - based formatter had a bug , and it did n’t work on the very first format of some ( low ) percentage of the drives .
We ’d only had a few of the drives to work with , and “ factory fresh ” was n’t a test case we ’d been able to do much with .
But we did n’t even know it was a problem , because the ever - resourceful folks running the factory saved the day without telling us .
Somehow they acquired a copy of the original command - line based formatter , which did work on the troublesome “ fresh ” drives .
And so , on a couple of lab benches in a small re-work area , some workers had been given cue cards and had been taught to type in the phrase “ Yes Mother , I really want to format the hard disk . ”
Capital - M for Mom , and a dot at the end .
I do n’t know if the workers ever found out what the phrase meant .
I ’d like to think they ’d laugh it off , but somehow I doubt it .

Your trouser fly just influenced my friend Ji. Quit smirking , coz his YI earphones concept will take care of a lot of wire - tangle - hassles in the future , if it ever gets to production .
Simple thought process and application !
If pants can have a zipper to hold in the essentials then why the idea ca n’t be used on earphones to manage them when not in use !
Zip then open when you want to use them ; zip them shut when you want to store them .
Did I mention that it even features a volume control button ?
No ?
Oh…ok …now you know , so happy Zipppiiinnnggg !

Consider three different rooms you ’ve never visited .
The first is “ tasteful ” if judged by the sensibility of decor magazines and furniture catalogs .
Judiciously - selected pictures occur on the walls , and judiciously - selected “ coffee - table ” books on horizontal surfaces .
The second is austere .
The walls are empty , their space broken perhaps only by a clock or an occasional piece of art .
An eye cast round the room encounters few if any instances of the printed word .
The third is media - intensive .
Much of the wallspace is occupied by books , by disks in jewel or DVD - format cases , perhaps even by some old LP’s .
In the natural order of things , more of these than you ’d really like have migrated onto one surface or another .
Most such rooms include visible apparatus : the big screen and speakers plus multiple rectangular electronic boxes with glowing LEDs on the front .
What do you think of the people who inhabit each room ?
Which of these surrounds you ?
My suspicion is that readers here tend to the media - intensive , some by choice or inheritance , but many by accident ; our appetite for sounds and pictures and words having inexorably surrounded us with their carriers and playback gear .
How do we feel about this ?
I ’ve long felt a conscious glow when surrounded by book - lined walls ; for many years my vision of ideal peace included them , along with a comfy chair and music in the air .
Less Disks ·
But as I age I ’ve started to feel increasingly crowded by possessions in general and media artifacts in particular .
And in recent weeks , I ’ve taken steps to remove about a thousand CDs from view , along with an FM tuner and a CD player .
The replacement electronics are out of sight in a nice wooden cabinet .
A couple of nights ago I finished ripping R.E.M. , so my alphabetical march through the shelves will soon end .
I ’ll be honest ; I ca n’t wait to shovel the disks into boxes or binders or whatever , and regain a few square feet of wall .
And the table that used to hold the record player , CD player , radio , and pre-amp looks much better with its electronics load halved .
Less Books ·
Why would you keep a book around , once you ’d read it ?
I can think of three reasons :
One , you might read it again .
Two , others in the household might ( a big one when you ’ve got fast - growing kids ) .
Three , because it ’s beautiful .
We try to use these criteria , but still have five walls in two rooms that are substantially covered by books .
How long till I do to the books what I ’m now doing to the music ?
I have issues with the Kindle ’s business model and control structure , but clearly it ’s a signpost .
As I wrote recently in On Paper , books , as we know them , are toast .
Their future is as objets d’art and antiques , and this is a good thing .
A Monastic Cell · A decade or two ago I spent some days in a “ study ” in an old Oxford college : bed , desk , lamp , and a window with a view of the quadrangle ; nothing else .
It made an impression that has n’t faded .
Among other things , I made insane , immense progress on a difficult piece of writing at the front of my to - do list .
Here ’s a prediction :
Geek fashion in particular and intellectual fashion in general will swing hard over : from cluttered to ascetic , from high to low entropy , from library to monastery .
Conventional good taste like you see in furniture catalogs ?
Well , it ’s hard ; takes more time and money than most of us can bring to bear .
Historically my tribe has dodged the issue by making the furnishings of our rooms suggest those of our minds .
The next best thing is the dogma of Less Is More .
Easier to keep clean , to start with .
I ’ll perhaps regret the old vision : the comfy clutter , the whisper of almost - white pages turning in silence after midnight , the rows of titles ascending into darkness .
But now , I dream of a mostly - empty room , brilliantly lit , the outside visible from inside .
The chief furnishings would be a few well - loved faces and voices because it ’s about people not things .
But of course there ’d be handy tools there , to bring the universe of words and sounds and pictures to hand on demand .
But not get dusty or pile up in corners .
What is left of New Labour , beyond a buzz - phrase that recalls a more confident and careless era : Cool Britannia , Noel Gallagher at No 10 and Tony Blair emoting over the death of Diana Windsor ?
Gordon Brown can partly blame the apparent lack of coherent direction in his government on his predecessor .
Mr Blair was always very good at articulating what New Labour was n’t .
It was “ neither old left , nor new right ” .
It was anti-nationalisation ; anti-explicit redistribution ; anti-socialist .
In fact , Mr Blair defined his politics as being against traditional Labour Party and leftist positions .
Mr Brown , as one of three ( along with Peter Mandelson ) architects of New Labour , cannot escape blame for the shedding of all ideology for the sake of popular electability : New Labour was a coalition of pragmatism founded , above all else , on the desire to gain and then hold on to power , at all costs – indeed at any cost – even if it meant Labour allying itself with the extremist and repugnant Bush administration and launching an illegal and ruinous war in Iraq .
New Labour , with Mr Brown as Chancellor , was seldom more than good on rhetoric .
Mr Brown did , however , seek to remain true to Labour ’s social - democratic heritage by attempting to pursue redistribution during a time of plenty , albeit largely by stealth .
Now , the government drifts , at once unable to decide on how to combat David Cameron ’s Conservatives and unsure of its own values : for so long a party of neoliberalism , Labour is , in extremis , seeking to reinvent itself as a party of greater equality and fairness .
Certainly , in recent days , the government has made several promising moves which may appeal to the electorate more than to the Cameron - loving and Brown - hating media .
( The Guardian can scarcely contain its admiration for Mr Cameron ; its interview with the Tory intellectual Michael Gove on 25 April was a model of swooning sycophancy of the kind that the riven and troubled newspaper regularly serves up when reporting on the Conservatives . )
The trick in the run-up to the next general election will be to ensure that such initiatives form part of a larger narrative – and crucially one that is social - democratic in nature .
As the events of the past week have shown , Labour has much to say about some of the most pressing issues affecting the UK .
The move in the Budget to raise the top bracket of tax was symbolic : even with measures to crack down on tax evasion , the most it can aim to raise appears to be several billion pounds .
Nonetheless , the idea that the wealthiest 1 per cent of society should not shoulder more of the burden during a recession is absurd .
If Barack Obama can succeed George W Bush as US president on an open platform of “ sharing the wealth ” , Mr Brown , likewise , should be able to articulate convincingly the case for what in practice is a mild tax increase at the top .
Second , the Equality Bill , introduced on 24 April , is promising in its attempt to create a legal framework against discrimination on class and gender grounds .
Both have been criticised as heralding a “ return to Old Labour ” , whatever that means .
But action on social inequality is necessary , however belated , and even Mr Blair should be praised for his commitment to social liberalism , helped by Labour ’s policy of all - women shortlists for incoming MPs .
The Conservatives and their avid supporters in the press resolutely refuse to contextualise the economic crisis .
This is not a crisis of capitalism , they say .
Instead , the recession and Labour ’s wild spending merely vindicate a return to monetarism and the need to slash spending now .
The urgent issue of national debt , from which the opposition is seeking to make maximum capital , must be set in perspective .
True , there is a hole in the public finances , not least because of a new lack of revenue from the City , rising benefit payments and the ailing housing market .
But , as a proportion of GDP , the UK ’s debt , at roughly 44 per cent , remains smaller than that of the United States ( 60 per cent ) , Japan ( 170 per cent ) and France ( 64 per cent ) .
On debt , indeed , Britain remains positioned mid-table around the world .
However , the economy shows no sign of a quick - fix recovery .
Much will depend on whether the Chancellor ’s revised forecast of an upturn in growth comes good by next spring .
But this is surely wishful thinking from Mr Darling : this recession will be deep and long , and the nation and our politics will emerge from it profoundly changed .

Academia is notoriously resistant to change , which to some extent is a good thing .
It was therefore no surprise that when Wikipedia became a phenomenon most academics scoffed at it as a passing fad , fatally flawed by its very core idea : anybody , and I mean anybody , can become a Wiki author and post new entries or edit existing ones .
Surely , this will inevitably lead to chaos and complete unreliability , the critics said .
But a few years ago a study of a sample of entries compared the accuracy of Wikipedia with that of the unquestionably prestigious Encyclopedia Britannica , and Wikipedia was at least as accurate , in some cases more .
Of course the " open access " model does have its limits and defects , and even Wikipedia has to maintain a certain amount of vigilance and label particular entries as contentious or unreliable if there is too much traffic and a lot of editing and counter - editing ( typically concerning political issues or individual politicians ) .
Still , from apparent chaos the system has allowed for the emergence of a reasonably reliable first - look reference source that truly exploits the power of the internet .
It seems that the next case will come from another sacred cow of academia : peer review .
This is the system used by modern academics -- both in the sciences and the humanities -- to evaluate a scholarly paper before it is published , the chief gateway to insure the high quality of a publication , be it in philosophy , literary criticism , medicine , physics , or what have you .
The way it usually works is that an author submits a paper for consideration to the editor of a journal in the appropriate field .
The editor makes a first assessment of the manuscript and , if deemed suitable to the journal , sends it out to two or more reviewers , chosen from among people actively engaged in research and scholarship in the field addressed by the submitted paper .
A certain amount of time later ( an amount of time that can be irritatingly long for the authors ) , the reviews come back with a thumbs up or down verdict , usually accompanied by ( anonymous , and sometimes nasty ) comments for the authors -- so that they may revise the original manuscript and send it back to either the same journal ( if so invited ) or to another one .
The process repeats itself until either the paper finds its way into a publication or is forever abandoned on the heap of wasted efforts .
The peer review system has its obvious advantages as a gatekeeper for academic publishing quality , but it has equally obvious drawbacks .
First of all , the number of reviewers is fairly small , which means that the comments the authors receive may be reflective of the idiosyncratic views of those individuals , and may not necessarily constitute a good assessment of the general value of the paper .
Second , often ( though not always ) the authors do n't know who the reviewers are , but the converse is not true , which leads to the temptation of stabbing a rival ( or a rival 's student ) in the back .
One can argue that the real peer review actually takes place over a period of yearsthe paper ( or book ) has been published , and it is the result of how , in the long - term , the community at large values the scholarship of the authors .
Some papers and books are cited often , some become classics in their field , most are never heard of again -- which in itself is not necessarily an indication of poor quality , but may be a simple reflection of the fact that too many people publish too much .
What I will call the classic peer review system , the one that relies on a small number of editor - selected referees , however , is increasingly under challenge .
In the physics community , for instance , it has been normal practice for years to post pre-publication versions of one 's paper on internet servers , to get feedback from the rest of the community before formal submission .
People can now refer others to these pre-prints by hyperlinks , almost as if they were actual publications , thereby blurring the distinction between formal and informal scholarship .
Moreover , an increasing number of open access journals now encourages readers ' comments and even rankings to be posted for each paper , occasionally allowing authors to respond and engage in an open dialogue with the community .
This is , I think , a trend that is here to stay , and that will likely completely change the meaning and practice of academic research over the next decade or so .
Still , perhaps the most spectacular -- if somewhat under - reported -- case of open peer review showed how the blogosphere can be a more effective guardian of scholarship than a small number of overworked editors and reviewers .
What happened was that two people affiliated with Inje University in Korea , Mohamad Warda and Jin Han , submitted a paper to the prestigious journal Proteomics .
The paper was entitled " Mitochondria , the missing link between body and soul : Proteomic prospective evidence , " something that should have alerted the Editor , Michael Dunn , and the reviewers that something was amiss ( a proteomic paper on dualism and the question of the soul ? ) .
Warda and Han 's review of the literature was meant as a criticism of the currently accepted theory that the mitochondria ( the cellular organelles that are involved in the production of the energy that keeps the metabolism of the organism going ) are the result of an evolutionary endosymbiotic event ; in other words , that they originated from the engulfment of a bacterial cell by an ancestor of modern plants , animals and fungi .
Warda and Han wrote : " Alternatively , instead of sinking into a swamp of endless debates about the evolution of mitochondria , it is better to come up with a unified assumption .
...
More logically , the points that show proteomics overlapping between different forms of life are more likely to be interpreted as a reflection of a single common fingerprint initiated by a mighty creator than relying on a single cell that is , in a doubtful way , surprisingly originating all other kinds of life .
" It is difficult to make sense of the badly written phrase ( no language editors at Proteomics ? ) , but surely the reviewers should have been a bit surprised by the obviously unscientific phrase " a mighty creator . "
Regardless of whether one thinks that concepts like soul and divine creators make any sense at all ( I do n't ) , they surely do not belong to an ostensibly scientific paper .
I am not at all suggesting that Dunn or his reviewers are intelligent design creationists : they simply missed the supernatural references , presumably because they were too busy and distracted by the mountain of very technical language surrounding that specific phrase ( though how they missed the title is a bit more difficult to rationalize away ) .
The happy ending to the story is the result of the normal practice that Proteomics has , together as do many other journals , of posting papers on their web site before they are actually printed .
According to an article in the National Center for Science Education Reports , the first to note the oddity of Warda and Han 's paper was Steven Salzberg , a professor of computer science at the University of Maryland , who blogged about it .
That led to blog posts by Attila Cordas Lars Juhl Jensen and PZ Myers , and eventually to the editor of Proteomics requesting a withdrawal of the paper by the authors , who complied .
Interestingly , the request to withdraw was not based on the creationist claim , but on the fact that the bloggers had uncovered another problem with the paper that had escaped reviewer and referees : the entire body of the article by Warda and Han had been plagiarized from other , already published , sources !
Apparently , their only original contributions were writing in really awful English and references to the soul and the mighty creator .
The moral of the story is that the much maligned blogosphere ( " you know , anybody can write whatever they want , and nobody 's checking " ) in this case clearly surpassed the official , academically sanctioned system of peer review .
My hunch is that this is n't going to be the last time this happens , and that we are looking at the dawn of a new era of academic practice , when papers will be scrutinized by thousands of reviewers within a matter of hours of publication .
If we can harness this tremendous intellectual power in a reasonably ordered fashion , we will make the next leap toward a truly worldwide community of scholars and authors .
Virgin Media has begun a pilot of a 200 M bit /s broadband service in Kent to gauge future demand for bandwidth in the home .
The pilot , which began last week in Ashford , will see 100 Virgin Media staff and customers connected at the new speed for at least six months .
A spokesman for the firm said the upstream bandwidth for the new service had n't been decided yet , but that a range would be tried .
Virgin Media talked up the speed potential of its network at the launch of its 50 M bit /s service late last year .
Today it claimed the 200 M bit/s pilot area would be the fastest DOCSIS 3.0 network in the world .
Although it does n't believe there is currently a commercial demand for 200 M bit/s , the firm wants to assess how consumers would use it for services such as HDTV , and home security and surveillance .
The triallists have been selected for their high - end PCs and tech savvy .
Virgin Media is working with third party consumer hardware firms on the trial , including Cisco .
As well as dominating the market for ISP routing kit , Cisco owns home networking brand Linksys .
" With the only true next generation network in the UK , we ’re at the forefront of innovation and understanding when it comes to ultrafast broadband services , and the 200 Mb pilot will give us further insight into how true ' wideband ' services might be used by consumers , " said Virgin Media chief executive Neil Berkett .
There is no schedule or confirmed plans for a wider rollout of 200 M bit /s broadband .
Virgin Media 's network - wide upgrade to offer up to 50 Mit /s downstream is due to be completed around the middle of this year .
The firm is attempting to position itself as the UK 's premium internet provider .
Main rival BT is currently trialling faster broadband in London and Wales based on fibre to the cabinet and VDSL , which offers downstream speeds of up to 40 M bit /s .
It plans to roll out the upgrade to 40 per cent of UK homes by 2012 . ®
Dambisa Moyo was born and raised in Zambia .
She has a PhD in Economics from the Oxford University , a Masters from Harvard and an MBA in Finance from the American University in Washington DC .
She previously worked for the Worldbank , and in debt capital markets at Goldman Sachs .
( Full )
Just to illustrate she is not " just anyone " when one considers the insights registered in her book " Dead Aid " , subtitled " Why aid is not working and how there is another way for Africa " .
From her website :
In the past fifty years , more than $ 1 trillion in development - related aid has been transferred from rich countries to Africa .
Has this assistance improved the lives of Africans ?
No .
In fact , across the continent , the recipients of this aid are not better off as a result of it , but worse — much worse .
In Dead Aid , Dambisa Moyo describes the state of postwar development policy in Africa today and unflinchingly confronts one of the greatest myths of our time : that billions of dollars in aid sent from wealthy countries to developing African nations has helped to reduce poverty and increase growth .
In fact , poverty levels continue to escalate and growth rates have steadily declined — and millions continue to suffer .
Provocatively drawing a sharp contrast between African countries that have rejected the aid route and prospered and others that have become aid - dependent and seen poverty increase , Moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency , corruption , market distortion , and further poverty , leaving them with nothing but the “ need ” for more aid .
Debunking the current model of international aid promoted by both Hollywood celebrities and policy makers , Moyo offers a bold new road map for financing development of the world ’s poorest countries that guarantees economic growth and a significant decline in poverty — without reliance on foreign aid or aid - related assistance .
Dead
Aid is an unsettling yet optimistic work , a powerful challenge to the assumptions and arguments that support a profoundly misguided development policy in Africa .
And it is a clarion call to a new , more hopeful vision of how to address the desperate poverty that plagues millions .
Update : Feb 23 :
She makes it clear at the outset what kind of aid she means .
She does not mean humanitarian or emergency aid , mobilised in response to calamities ; she does not mean charity - based aid , given to specific organisations and people on the ground , in order to achieve specific things ( she sits on the boards of several charities , one of which distributes antiretrovirals ) ; she is hopeful about a new attitude to food aid , whereby the money is used to buy food from farmers within a country , and then distribute it to those in need , instead of flooding the place with foreign food that undercuts local growers .
What she means is " systemic aid " , the vast sums regularly transferred from government to government , or via institutions such as the World Bank .

Of course the aid " industry " has reacted .
But barely .
As of today , a Google search only shows two articles : A half - assed reply by the co-founder of " One " in the Financial Times , and a more relativating answer by the CEO of SOS Children UK .
Another half assed answer by Oxfam Dambisa clarifies in one article :
My response , as an aid worker , is this :
If one limits the discussion only to aid given to a government ( bilateral or via IMF / Worldbank ) , we are limiting the discussion too much .
Weneed to question any form of aid .
Even though aid given to government institutions is an obvious ( and easy ) target of criticism .
But also humanitarian aid , emergency aid , should be looked at .
Why , after decennia of foreign aid , is the West still crawling over each other to provide relief in cases of natural disasters ?
What is done to institutionally ensure these countries ( which are always the same , by the way ) , can ( mostly ) take care of their own disaster response ?
It is clear that traditional aid does not work .
And has never worked .
Otherwise aid organisations would have been able to prove at least some progress in countries like Somalia , Ethiopia , DRC , Afghanistan , ... If it took us 40 - 50 years to come to that conclusion , so be it .
A pity of the money wasted , but at least let 's start changing the mechanics now .
Aid has been a self - fulfilling and self - fueling economic mechanism .
I have always said there are three markets in the world economy : the official market , the black market and the aid market .
All three keep the world economy turning .
Unfortunately mostly the " first world economy " .
Here is how I see it work :-
Too many donor governments are all too happy to channel foreign aid through whatever means .
After all , they need to look good on the Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) performance scale .
And it is good for public opinion .
Helps get people re-elected .-
Too many aid organisations are all too happy to transform that donor money into projects .
After all , they need to sustain themselves .
No , or hardly ANY aid agency will turn down money from a donor .
No matter how ridiculous or un-needed the targets are ( hats off to MSF for refusing more Tsunami aid two weeks after the disaster , stating they had sufficient funding .
Which aid agency would have the courage to do that ? ) -
So one loves to give , the other loves to accept .
All happy - happy .- Foreign " aid " as such is an industry by itself .
It employs people , it keeps " the economy " running .
But whose economy ?
No surprise a lot , if not most , of the goods procured by aid organisations is produced in " the West " .
Many services are procured from companies in " the West " .
In this aspect , not much difference between " a war in Iraq " and " foreign aid " , is there ?
Both are wagging the dog of ' our economy ' .-
Foreign " aid " has been targeting mostly countries a donor country had a political , economical or military connection with .
" Aid " was just a way of keeping government counterparts happy .
No matter if the aid was effective or not .
It kept the targeted country as an ally .
We got cheap resources from them , or they did not ' fall ' into the hands of the communists , or more recently in the hands of the islamists .
For the ' west ' , it has always been best if a developing country sitting on a lot of natural resources ( oil , diamonds , gold , minerals ) was unstable .
It was a way to get those resources cheaply .
During the Angola civil war , their oil was sold for many years in advance , only to keep the cost of war going .
Look around you : which countries have gone through the most devastating levels of poverty and civil war ?
Liberia , Sierra Leone , Angola , DRC , Somalia , Sudan ...
I bet you if we make a top 10 list of the countries ( in the world ) with the longest civil wars , and you tick those with abundant natural resources , you would be surprised of the correlation .
OK , I will relativate : natural resources or a country 's strategic ( political , religious or geographical ) position ..
Should cover all on the top 10 , top 20 list .
So if aid would have been effective , and would have brought peace , prosperity or stability , in what way would it not have been decremental to the Western Economy ?
God forgive if a country like that would become an economical power .
An independent political entity with its own mind .
Gosh , think what that would have done to the political position of the powers - that - be ? - I agree with Dambisa : government to government aid does not work .
As electorate , we should hold our governments accountable to give us real and verifiable figures of effectiveness . -
Worldbank aid does not work .
Same thing :
Show us verifiable figures of effectiveness .-
Effectiveness of aid in no matter what shape or form , should be measurable along the same criteria .
Criteria should include clear and concrete targets from the onset , and measures of achievement .
Aid should measured by the effectiveness for the individuals targeted , not by the effectiveness for institutions ( which can not be measured ) . -
Any aid organisation , any humanitarian organisation should work on a voluntary funding basis .
No guaranteed annual funding .
Funding per project .
You do n't perform ?
Next time you do n't get funding anymore .
Worldbank the first to start .-
Aid , any aid , should be audited by external bodies .
Objective figures should be provided for overhead . -
Aid , any aid , should be governed by the same measures of governance quality as the commercial market ( as long as it is not the US - standards of governance .
We all saw where that one brought us ) .
Why do n't we apply ISO - 9002 to aid ?
Let 's make an ISO standard for aid .
After all we spent trillions on aid .
And it our money .
Us , tax payers , need to know .
We cry foul when we see the government wasting money on ineffective road building or useless prestige projects , but do n't cry foul when we pour billions over the ' poor ' ?
Because we get soft hearted when seeing children crying on TV ?
Think what you do to that child to ensure it stops crying the next year .
And the year after .
And the year after .
OkayOkayOkay .
I am getting off my soapbox now .
Global depression .
Climate chaos .
Billions starving .
Why ?
Most of the world ’s problems today can be traced back to a single cause .
Greed .
For decades , the rich went on a feeding frenzy .
They piled up profits galore .
They devoured the world ’s resources and ignited global warming .
They grabbed more and more wealth for themselves at the expense of everyone else .
One per cent of the UK population now own 34 times as much wealth as the bottom 50 per cent .
Never in human history has so much been owned by so few .
How the rich caused the slump
With more cash than they could ever dream of spending , the rich went on a gambling binge .
Instead of using their wealth to create jobs and fuel the real economy , they squandered trillions in the casinos of global capitalism .
Greed has also corrupted the political system with politicians pocketing expenses for everything from 32 - inch TVs to having their moats cleaned and making money playing the property market .
Now the orgy of greed has turned sour .
But who will pay the price ?
The Scottish Socialist Party has launched a European - wide Make Greed History Campaign .
The reckless rich caused this crisis – and they must foot the bill .
Why we need a wealth tax to create jobs
In Europe today , the wealthiest one per cent of the population own liquid assets worth $ 10 trillion dollars .
A modest , one - off wealth tax of just 10 per cent would generate a trillion dollars to create eight million jobs across Europe .
Scotland ’s share of that tax would amount to £ 6.5 billion – enough to create and sustain 80,000 jobs over the next three years , with an average annual salary of £ 25,000 .
We could build tens of thousands of new homes to rent .
We could reduce class sizes by employing thousands more teachers and learning assistants .
We could insulate every home in Scotland .
Call it a ``wealth tax '' , call it a ``crisis tax '' – or even call it a ``greed tax ' ' .
It would be a mighty step out of recession , paid for by those who caused the crisis .
The Scottish Socialist Party stands for a green socialist Scotland in a green socialist Europe , an independent socialist Scotland .

With a flying lady on the bonnet , its vast classical radiator and familiar contours , it looks for all the world like a Rolls - Royce .
Hop inside , and the massage seats , pure wool carpet , subdued lighting and wine cabinet add to the impression .
But the car in question could hardly be less British .
It is actually a Geely GE , made in China .
Hauntingly familiar : The Geely GE , with flying lady circled , at the Shanghai show
Although Geely claims to be ‘ re - inventing the classic ’ , it seems Rolls - Royce bosses disagree .
They are consulting lawyers after seeing this Chinese - made car audaciously displayed just feet from the classic brand ’s Phantom at the Shanghai Motor Show .
‘ Our colleagues in Shanghai are taking a serious look at it , ’ a spokesman said .
‘ Rolls - Royce Motor Cars is very protective of its brand image and takes seriously any attempt to imitate its products .
‘ Rolls - Royce is currently keeping its options open and is in consultation with its legal advisers . ’
The real deal : A Rolls Royce Phantom which costs £ 250,000 - compared to £ 30,000 for the Geely GE
The grille , the Flying Lady mascot , also known as the Spirit of Ecstasy , and the Rolls - Royce name and initials are specifically protected .
With its £ 250,000 price - tag , the original Rolls - Royce Phantom has always been the preserve of the privileged few .
But costing just £ 30,000 , the GE , which stands for Geely Excellence , appears to offer a ‘ luxurious mobile palace ’ on a much tighter budget .
For your money , you get an air purifier with separate air conditioning , described as an ‘ oxygen bar ’ , cigar storage , a refrigerator and a ‘ starlight ’ interior roof lining – a signal feature of the original Phantom .
Spot the difference :
The original Spirit of Ecstasy on the Rolls Royce Phantom ( right ) and on the Geely GE ( left )
Chinese car companies have a reputation for copying foreign classics – sometimes leading to legal action .
Four years ago Shuang - Huan Auto created a lookalikeof Honda ’s CR - V grass - and - gravel off - roader .
So incensed were Honda that they sued Shuang - Huan , which counter - sued .
Geely already has links with British icons .
It builds taxis for London under licence .
Class act :
An artist 's impression shows the GE 's single rear ' throne ' and luxurious star effect roof ( above and below )
And it is one of the companies said to be considering buying out Britain ’s Vauxhall and Germany ’s Opel from the ailing U.S. parent company General Motors , which is on the brink of bankruptcy .

In what the French government denounced as a “ sad comedy , ” lawmakers on Thursday rejected President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plan to bolster the movie and music industries by cutting off the Internet connections of persistent copyright pirates .
The surprise outcome delayed , but may not kill , the most far - reaching initiative by any government in the battle against unauthorized file - sharing .
It is also a major embarrassment for Mr. Sarkozy , who has rallied sufficient legislative support for other measures popular with French media companies , like phasing out advertising on public television .
Until Thursday afternoon , the anti-piracy plan appeared on track for passage in the National Assembly , after having been approved by the other house of Parliament , the Senate .
A committee of members of both chambers had worked out differences this week .
But the measure , while supported by many members of the French cultural establishment , had always been unpopular with ordinary voters .
File - sharing is widespread in France , where legitimate online services like Apple ’s iTunes music store have never caught on to the extent that they have in the United States .
May 27 , 2009  -- Last Wednesday , former Vice President Dick Cheney took aim at President Obama on national security .
Today , Cheney turned his ire to the new administration 's economic programs , denouncing the government 's increased involvement in the private sector , from bankrupt automakers to bailed - out banks .
" I think the recession we 've been through is being used by the administration in ways that fundamentally change the relationship between government and the private sector , " Cheney told CNBC 's Larry Kudlow in an interview airing Wednesday night on " The Kudlow Report . "
" That 's what worries me most . "
So , is Obama a socialist , as some Republicans have alleged in recent weeks ?
" I agree with the criticism without using the labels , " Cheney noted .
" I do n't want to get into trying to label President Obama .
" We 're seeing a vast expansion -- not only the power of the federal government over the private sector , but also in terms of spending , " he continued .
" Massive , massive amounts of new spending and presumably new taxes to pay for it that I think will do fundamental , long - term damage to the country . "
Cheney said the Bush administration never even anticipated the present extent of government control , such as the influence Congress now wields over the nation 's banks after the implementation of the $ 700 billion bailout program implemented by former Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson .
" I do n't recall any debate within the administration , " Cheney said .
" There may have been some over at Treasury or someplace that focused on the extent of which government would try to control these institutions once they provided financing for them . "
The government involvement that the Troubled Asset Relief Program has caused , he added , brings back bad memories .
" I 've got experiences going back to the wage price controls in the Nixon administration , " he said , " where , in effect , we had what I think was a terrible mistake -- in that case , [ under ] a Republican administration -- where [ government ] moved in and tried to control the wages , prices and profits of every enterprise in America .
It was a huge mistake .
We finally got out of it , but it took a long time to do it , and it does a lot of damage .
Cheney Advocated Early On to Allow GM Bankruptcy
" One of the things we see now ... is the fact that government , in some cases Congress , in some cases the Obama administration , [ is ] telling General Motors they 've got to fire Rick Wagoner , making decisions that traditionally and historically have been made by the private sector . "
GM is currently staring down a Monday deadline to successfully restructure or else face bankruptcy .
Before the Bush administration made the initial loan to GM last December , Cheney said he pushed internally for the struggling automaker to declare bankruptcy .
" Some of us , at the time , wanted GM to go bankrupt , go to Chapter 11 , " Cheney recalled , noting that he was ultimately overruled .
" The decision was made that , in the final analysis , since our administration was almost over and a brand new team was about to take over , that the president wanted , in effect , not to take a step that was n't necessarily going to be followed by his successor , but rather to set up a situation which the new guys could address that issue and make a decision about what the long - term policy was going to be , " Cheney said .
" And we came up with a short - term package , in effect , that got us through the inauguration . "
Now , just over 100 days into the Obama administration , Cheney predicted that the size of government is only going to get larger .
" He 's already talking about a set of policies that I think grossly undermine the notion that the way you grow the economy is to stimulate the private sector , to minimize government 's role in the private sector , to cut taxes as much as possible , to minimize the regulatory burden that the government imposes on the private sector , " Cheney said .
" All of those principles that I think a lot of us believe in are now pretty much being ignored in favor of a much larger government , a much greater involvement in the society . "
Cheney Optimistic on End to Recession
Despite his criticisms of Obama 's economic program , Cheney said he thought the country 's recession soon will come to an end .
" [ There are ] some signs out there that are positive , " Cheney said .
" I follow the stock market , home sales and unemployment numbers and so forth , and they all seem to indicate that we 're , if we are n't at the bottom , we 're getting close . "
Mind that age !
This blog post is 11 years old !
Most likely , its content is outdated .
Especially if it 's technical .
I 've now made a vastly improved spellcorrector specifically tied into Django and it's models .
It 's the old class as before but hooked up to models so Django can take care of persisting the trained words .
Again , I have to give tribute to Peter Norvig for his inspirational blog How to Write a Spelling Corrector which a large majority of my code is based in .
At least in the tricky parts .
What 's nice about this little app is that it 's very easy to plug in and use .
You just download it , put it on your PATH and include it in your INSTALLED_APPS .
Then from another app you do something like this :
from spellcorrector.views import Spellcorrector sc = Spellcorrector ( ) sc . load ( ) # nothing will happen the first time sc .
train ( u " peter " ) print sc .
correct ( u " petter " ) # will print peter sc . save ( ) sc2 = Spellcorrector ( ) sc2 . load ( ) print sc2 .
correct ( u " petter " ) # will print peter
This is my first django -*** app I 've wrapped up and released in github so I 'm not even near certain that I 've done it right .
I 'll try to keep the project updated and more approachable but right now it works in one of my production sites so I 'm confident the code is ok .

Last week the House passed another budget that increases federal power , raises taxes , and increases the national debt .
I voted against it , and was pleased to see that not a single Republican representative voted for it .
Legislators often see bipartisanship as constructive , but I disagree especially where the destruction of our economy or our liberty is concerned .
There has been too much bipartisan consensus on expanding government far beyond the bounds of the Constitution which we all swore to defend and uphold .
Because of this , I have never been able to vote for a budget .
However , it was good to see Republicans come together on this important vote , even if their alternative budget was almost as bad .
Despite the deterioration of our economy , this is the largest budget ever passed , at $ 3.6 trillion .
Gross domestic product and tax receipts are shrinking .
The government has less money to spend this year , and so it spends more — $ 1.5 trillion more — than it has .
When the economy expands , the government expands .
Worse , when the economy contracts , the government expands more .
Even more troubling is that even though the size of the budget boggles the mind , it is never the final word on federal spending .
No allowance has been made for future bailouts and stimulus plans that are highly likely .
There are always supplemental bills passed later in the year .
War spending is one of those .
Spending on Afghanistan is only partially included in budget , with a supplemental request expected in the future .
History shows that true costs far exceed estimates .
So even though these numbers sound appalling enough , I predict spending will top $ 4 trillion this year , raising the national debt by over $ 2 trillion when all is said and done .
Some may notice that the neo-conservatives who masterminded the policy of global interventions are not complaining about the level of military and foreign spending .
This is because rather than drawing down our costly interventions , Obama is largely staying the course on these issues .
In fact , this week a group of leading neoconservatives met to discuss how best to support the President on foreign policy !
I am disappointed and concerned that , in spite of a change in leadership , we will remain the policeman of the world , placing ourselves at grave danger in many ways .
As our mountain of debt is projected to double with the new budget , many are wondering how long our country can keep this up before serious repercussions are felt .
Obviously we can’t continue down this road indefinitely .
Certainly , no country has ever prospered when their public sector spent half or all of the nation ’s GDP .
Yet we are saddled with leadership that seems unwaveringly convinced that the key to prosperity is public spending .
This will be exposed for the lie that it is when our creditors wake up and call in our debt .
The temptation at that time will be for the government to simply print up dollars in the amount needed .
This type of debt repudiation could signal the end of the dollar as its value sinks to zero .
We are seeing all the signs that this could happen .
Certainly there are no signs of the alternative , which is paying down debt and taking the path of fiscal responsibility .
Tragically , it is those who save their dollars , the most prudent and responsible among us , that will be hurt most by this irresponsibility in Washington .

Better They Learn It From Their Friends …
This is a parenting rant ; this is more conceptual than particular , and directed to more than one person .
“ But she does n’t know about that yet ” is not an answer .
That ’s when she needs to know it : before she needs to know it .
If she already knew it , she would n’t need you to tell her .
So tell her now , when she does n’t need to know it .
The time to tell her is when it ’s a strange rumor about someone ’s friend ’s cousin at another school .
She ’s fishing for information .
If you dodge the question , she ’ll let you .
And she ’ll know not to ask again .
“ You can talk to me about anything ” is a platitude .
She ’s not stupid ; she knows it ’s a platitude .
She knows it ’s a platitude because she sees that you do n’t want to deal with the questions when she raises them .
When you dodge , she knows she ca n’t talk to you about anything ; only things you ’re ready to talk about .
That ’s why you should n’t dodge it .
Even in what passes for comprehensive sex ed , they wo n’t cover it .
Popular culture wo n’t teach her , they just pitch jokes that assume knowledge .
So that leaves her friends , who are all 14 .
I did n’t have much access to accurate information then and neither did you .
Do you think they are much better ?
If you wait long enough , you can avoid the conversation entirely .
She ’ll get inaccurate half - assed information from somewhere else .

Joe Biden went after Dick Cheney today in an interview with Wolf Blitzer -- in a way that one can only conclude his boss gave him clearance to come after him with both barrels , with double - aught ammo .
" I do n't think [ Cheney ] is out of line , but he is dead wrong , " he told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
" This administration — the last administration left us in a weaker posture than we 've been any time since World War II : less regarded in the world , stretched more thinly than we ever have been in the past , two wars under way , virtually no respect in entire parts of the world .
" ... I guarantee you we are safer today , our interests are more secure today than they were any time during the eight years " of the Bush administration .
Ouch .
You can tell Biden 's been wanting to let Cheney have it for some time .

Hamas and Fatah agreed on Sunday to hold presidential and legislative elections by January 2010 but remained deadlocked over the key issues of forming a unity government as well as dealings with Israel .
Diplomats and analysts see the success of the Egyptian - sponsored talks as key to reuniting Palestinians after 21 months of schism between Hamas - ruled Gaza and the West Bank , where the Fatah group of President Mahmoud Abbas holds sway .
One Key Issue Hamas :
We will never recognize Israel Reuters Group shuns Abbas ' offer of unity gov't , which he says must agree to two - state solution with Israel Hamas :
We will never recognize Israel
The groups agreed on holding presidential and legislative elections by Jan. 25 , 2010 , Wasil Abou Youssef , secretary - general of the Palestine Liberation Front , told Egypt 's state - run Middle East News Agency .
But participants said differences remained between Fatah and Hamas on whether the unity cabinet that would emerge from the talks be composed of political groups or non-partisan technocrats , as demanded by Western powers and Egypt .
" It is a standstill on the issue of the government , " said Walid al - Awad of the communist People 's Party .
The groups agreed on Feb. 26 to form five committees to also tackle issues such as the composition of security agencies in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank .
The groups have yet to agree on an electoral law and whether it would be based on proportional representation or constituencies , Awad and Abou Youssef told Reuters .
Awad said two committees discussing national reconciliation and the reform of the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) concluded their work on Saturday .
The PLO , dominated by Abbas and the groups loyal to him , have represented the Palestinians since 1964 but the more recently created Islamist movements , such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad , have never been part of it despite a 2005 agreement to bring them under its umbrella .
In Gaza , Hamas official Taher al - Nono told Reuters : " There was progress in some issues last night .
There is an optimism , a cautious optimism . "
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said this month he intended to resign by the end of March to pave the way for the formation of a unity cabinet .
Abbas , who appointed Fayyad after Hamas routed Fatah in Gaza in June 2007 , asked him to remain in office until results emerged from the talks in Cairo .
The new government is also expected to lead efforts to reconstruct the Gaza Strip after Israel 's three - week military offensive , which ended in January .
Awad said his party has put forward a suggestion that the prime minister and six cabinet posts – foreign affairs , interior , reconstruction , education , information and finance – be held by independent ministers .
The remaining seats would be decided on political basis , he added .

If the financial system is at a risk of collapse , and if so many of our basic goods depend on the financial system , then what , if anything can we do to be more resilient to economic shocks ?
Below the fold is a description of a project I am working on that may provide some answers .
Rethinking Food Security
Most institutions , such as food aid NGOs or the US Department of Agriculture , express concern about food security in terms of the ability for low income people to purchase adequate food .
This is a valid way to think of food security .
If food prices are high relative to income , or if other compelling expenses such as housing , health care and transportation also require a large portion of income , then securing adequate food on an individual or family level will be problematic .
Programs that disperse food to the needy , redistribute income through tax policies , assist with the high costs of non -food expenses , guarantee a living wage , etc. all address distribution inequity and are laudable .
But the question I want to ask is whether they are now sufficient ?
Two unspoken assumptions underpinning the framing food security narrowly as an “ income problem ” require rethinking .
The first assumption is that enough food can actually be grown and delivered to wherever it needs to go .
A study of the intersection of supply limits to water , energy and topsoil combined with climate change should dispel the notion that food abundance can simply be taken for granted .
Over 90 % of transportation relies on oil , and extraction of oil appears to be entering a permanent global decline .
The fuel cost spike of 2008 severely hampered food distribution in some parts of the world .
Cheap transportation , which permits food to be grown thousands of miles from where it is eaten , stored in centralized facilities , and delivered daily to where we live , should n’t be taken for granted either .
The second assumption is that the money we have now will remain a reliable medium of exchange that enables a smooth flow of production and distribution .
Few people realize that most money comes into existence through bank credit that is backed by the borrower ’s debt and any collateral .
Banks do n’t actually have money to lend , they simply decide who is “ credit worthy , ” and for how much .
After a borrower signs the loan documents the bank creates the corresponding money in electronic accounts , such as a checking account .
Credit and debt are therefore “ flip sides of a coin . ”
People receiving bank credit are in debt to banks , but , correspondingly , banks are in debt to people for all the deposits on hand .
When too many loans default , banks are at risk of defaulting on their own promise to maintain the savings of depositors .
This is why credit dries up as debts go bad :
As debts are cancelled through bankruptcy then a corresponding level of credit must disappear also .
In the present banking system it is mathematically impossible for all loans to return their principal plus interest without a constant expansion of debt / credit .
But a system that depends upon unending growth eventually ends .
The actions of the Federal Reserve to re-inflate the reserves of the banking system are a desperate attempt to fix something that is permanently broken .
Unfortunately , the systemic problems are deeper than the surface actions currently being taken by the Federal Reserve , The U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Government .
When I think of the global financial system nowadays what comes to mind is the " Humpty Dumpty " rhyme .
Knowing that the debt - based money system we currently rely on is failing , we created Mendo Credits to function without debt or interest .
Food - Backed Local Currency
The money I had printed was created with all the above - mentioned issues in mind : wide income disparity , lack of practical self - reliance , unsustainable agriculture , resource depletion , climate change , a fragile just - in - time delivery system , a failing money system , and rising unemployment .
When I said that “ Ben Bernanke does n’t make money as good as this ” I meant that today ’s dominant money actually creates or exacerbates those troubles , whereas Mendo Credits can be part of their solution .
Along with several other people , I am working with Patty Bruder and Cyndee Logan of a local non-profit called North Coast Opportunities ( NCO ) .
NCO mainly provides social services , such as running preschools , senior support , and managing community gardens .
Mendo Credits is a new food - backed local currency project partly funded by a grant from the California Endowment .
The overall goals of the project are to improve community health , economic vitality and environmental sustainability through local food system development .
For as long as I have known Patty and Cyndee they have been thinking about the importance of system change and practical self - reliance .
They ’d prefer to develop a community garden where low income families can grow their own food rather than hand out meal money .
Historically in the United States and elsewhere , local currencies are known to stabilize local economies when national currencies are troubled , such as bouts of hyper inflation or deflation and joblessness .
This works because those accepting local money are also likely to seek out others who accept it too , creating a social dynamic that forms new , local economic associations .
As these strengthen , the flow of local money picks up and work can get done even in the face of economic disaster outside the community .
Because they can only be spent locally , profits on economic transactions done with a local currency remain in the community and spur more local investment .
Local governments , regional business associations , community banks , and worker cooperatives are examples of the kinds of institutions who tend to successfully issue local currency .
They have the social capital to be broadly accepted , and the capacity to manage the task of issuing and redeeming money .
Mendo Credits are backed by a tangible asset .
In other words , Mendo Credits are a “ reserve currency ” as opposed to a “ fiat currency ” like Federal Reserve dollars .
Many people are familiar with money backed by gold , which was once the case with U.S. dollars , but Mendo Credits are backed by reserves of stored food .
Our reserve currency has a number of desirable properties at this time in history .
The asset value of Mendo Credits remains stable over a significant time period because we lock in an exchange rate for specific quantities of food for one year from the date of issue .
Whereas gold and silver are inedible , Mendo Credits can be redeemed for the sustenance of life .
When you hold a Mendo Credit note , you know it represents the quantity of food printed on its face and , if you want or need to , you can actually get that food .
Mendo Credits help with our goal of greater community self - reliance by directing investment towards essential long - term capital .
For example , if a small grain silo costs $ 5000 to build , credits can be issued with prices that reflect both the cost of grain and storage .
Eventually , local farmers could be contracted to supply grains and dry beans to our silos .
Our land base would then have higher value and be able to support more jobs .
Currently we buy grains and beans from farms about 150 miles away , which is as close as we can locate .
These farms are organic and family owned .
The point is that we can decide to support agricultural best practices and once we establish relationships with farmers and become significant buyers , we can seek improvements when warranted .
Our goal to move product aligns with the needs of households to be financially frugal and eat healthy foods .
We are selling organic grains and beans at lower prices than in stores , and are developing informative guides for preparing meals around whole and seasonal foods .
Our guides also help families assess how much they eat to decide how many Mendo Credits to buy and whether they want to store significant amounts in their home .
Emergency preparedness is enhanced as more families buy in bulk , habitually eat , and restock their food stores .
Mendo Credits in Practice
When I told my friend Sara about Mendo Credits she beamed with delight , opened her wallet , and showed me an UDIS .
A Honduran food and farmer cooperative , COMAL , issues its own local currency called the UDIS for many of the same reasons we started Mendo Credits .
It was great to learn that these same ideas had already taken hold elsewhere and have a record of success .
Mendo Credits are just beginning to circulate in the town of Willits , CA and we hope this spreads around our region .
Four central downtown businesses are serving as sales outlets for the new currency :
The Bank of Willits , Mendonesia Café , The Book Juggler , and Leaves of Grass Bookstore .
NCO also sells them at the Willits Farmers ’ Market .
A local business is currently assisting with transportation and storage .
Their truck picks up from farms in the Sacramento Valley and hauls one ton totes on pallets to their warehouse .
We transfer from the totes into 3.5 or 5 gallon buckets and take these to a convenient downtown location for distribution .
To make it quick and easy to distribute grains and beans , we only sell in specified increments as given on each Mendo Credits slip .
For example , 11 lbs of rice can be redeemed for a single Mendo Credits note .
We have several buckets of rice to distribute from , each one containing about 40 lbs of rice .
When a customer wants to redeem a note for rice , we can place their container on our commercial scale , zero the readout , and pour out 11 lbs .
Mendo Credits are a 100 % reserve currency with each note representing some fixed quantity of food .
Therefore , the Mendo Credits brought to us for redemption are moved out of circulation .
However , redemption of Mendo Credits signals a potential demand , which allows us to issue new notes .
We have to watch our supplies of grains and beans and estimate future demand .
At some point before all our current food stores are claimed we will issue more Mendo Credits .
A combination of profits from previous sales plus the income from new notes , which may not be sold out yet , can go towards buying more food supplies .
This is a small beginning but we are already looking at what it would entail to expand Mendo Credits significantly .
We have cost estimates for building large silos along the railroad tracks , for example , and are actively raising funds for several small silos in the meantime .
The investment required is substantial , but compared to what our society typically spends it looks like a bargain .
For perspective , the storage capacity to hold enough grains and dry beans to feed the Willits area ( about 14,000 people ) for one month costs $ 120,000 .
A half million dollars would build the silos , fill them with food , and give us the peace of mind of a one month supply of food for the community , and potentially spawn a revitalization of the local food system , including jobs in farming , food processing , waste recapture , and transportation .
Initial enthusiasm suggests that Mendo Credits will begin circulating like cash within town .
However , since the supply of Mendo Credits is limited to the supply of grains and beans in storage , they ca n’t become a dominant means of exchange until our local economy has very large storage facilities and is on its way towards food self - sufficiency .
In the meantime , they are a fantastic educational device and may spur investment towards local food security .

Combine all ingredients , press into ca. 9 x 13 inch pan and let sit for 3 hours .
Cut into bars and store in covered container .
Sweet is the spectacle of a home secretary bitten by her own snake .
The outrage of Jacqui Smith 's television expenses claim lies not in its content , lurid as it is , but in the way it was exposed .
How many times must the home secretary have been assured in security briefings that her latest purchase of some data storage gizmo was " totally secure " ?
" Do n't worry , " the briefers would have said , " the material will be protected by the finest firewalls , the most foolproof anti-hacking devices and the most savage legal defence .
Nothing will be transferable and only the highest in the land will have access .
Besides , home secretary , as you have so often said , the innocent have nothing to fear . "
Yes , they do .
They have the revelation of their husband 's taste in movies , apparently leaked by contractors in receipt of easily copied discs , now on offer to anyone with £ 300,000 .
Anyone who knows anything about computers knows computer security is a contradiction in terms .
It is garbage .
Yet this is not believed by gullible ministers and MPs who troop through the Commons lobby to vote through new measures for more state surveillance .
I am sure when they submitted invoiced expenses to the fee office last year MPs were told they would be secure .
They may have believed it .
They thought that what they told their constituents about the security of ID and NHS records also applied to them .
They thought their dodgy second homes , mildly sleazy fiddles and squalid movies would be a private matter between them and a silver disc somewhere in the Palace of Westminster .
Every chit for a new bathplug or dining room suite or blue movie was invested with " adequate safeguards " .
No phrase is more beloved of a minister than that .
We now learn that Virgin Media lists every downloaded TV movie by title and distributes the list via the public post .
If a customer hopes to reclaim the expense from an employer , the list is passed to the relevant accounts department .
There it will be shown gleefully round the office before being shared with the world on YouTube .
How many times must we repeat this ?
There is no such thing as a secure computer .
It does not exist .
The secrets of the Pentagon have been penetrated by Chinese hackers and British nerds .
The most carefully programmed firewalls in east Europe were crashed at the click of a mouse by Russian agents .
Such is the magnetism of secrecy that poachers will always be a step ahead of gamekeepers .
In the last eight years , the same MPs who are howling at their data vulnerability have voted for the most extensive surveillance system in Europe , as well as the biggest data storage in the most expensive and inept computers .
Britain under Labour has become the world capital of privacy intrusion .
A fifth of all closed - circuit cameras in existence are in Britain , despite the Home Office admitting they appear to make no difference to crime or drunkenness .
Smith has legislated or approved an astonishing range of powers .
She is contracting with private firms to set up a data storage device to record all emails and internet uses , costing £ 46 m .
This is a precursor to her £ 12bn " interception modernisation upgrade " also to record every text and phone call .
This is ludicrous and illiberal extravagance .
Smith wants , under the coroners and justice bill , to " remove barriers to effective data sharing to support improved public services " .
Improve at what cost in liberty ?
She supports the Metropolitan police 's evidence gatherer teams .
These claim powers to " record identifiable details " of citizens at any gathering who might be " bordering on civil disobedience " ( including journalists reporting them ) .
As the Guardian has revealed , such filmed material is put on " spotter cards " and stored in a " corporate intelligence database " , in gross breach of the European Convention on Human Rights .
ID cards and NHS computers promise to store the defining details and medical records of the entire population .
As data sharing spreads , these records will be virtually open to public view .
In 2000 , just nine organisations were allowed warrants to access secure government records : the figure is now almost 800 .
For a small fee , anyone will be able to learn anything about anyone else .
It may be illegal , but like computer downloads it will happen .
This means every patient 's medical history will become available to insurance firms , rendering some uninsurable .
Court and criminal records will end the privacy of a spent conviction and make many , including those who have committed no crime , unemployable for being on a police data system .
It was reported last week that terrorism laws are more used for local government and crowd control than national security .
As she battles to extend detention without trial , traveller surveillance and electronic databases , Smith will incant the presence of safeguards .
Like most ministers and Whitehall officials , she is putty in the hands of high - pressure computer salesmen .
She believes what they say , against all the evidence of the liberty lobby and computer failure .
Perhaps she now knows better .
One of the few home secretaries who dominated his department rather than be cowed by it was Lord Whitelaw in the 1980s .
He boasted how after any security lapse , the police would come to beg for new and draconian powers .
He laughed and sent them packing , saying only a bunch of softies would erode British liberty to give themselves an easier job .
He said they laughed in return and remarked that " it was worth a try " .
Now the try always works .
What is extraordinary is the weakness of the liberty lobby in opposition .
It almost never wins .
The Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne is proposing an excellent " freedom bill " , repealing repressive legislation in 20 areas , from pre-charge detention through DNA databases to children 's records .
But it stands no chance of enactment .
Nor are the Tories any longer libertarians - witness Chris Grayling this week absurdly protesting inadequate security for the G20 .
The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust recently recorded just 15 % of 50 government databases as " effective , proportionate or necessary " .
It concluded that 10 actually broke privacy law .
Yet a staggering £ 100bn is to be spent on them in the next five years .
The only hope is that now MPs have been hoist by their own petard , they might be more mindful of the liberties - and privacies - of others .
I would not hold my breath .

Frank McKinney 's highly anticipated $ 29 million green mansion in an illusionary and spectacular theatrical assault on the senses .
The estate is the first home of its size to be certified green by the rigorous environmental standards of the U.S. Green Building Council and the Florida Green Building Council .
Manalapan , Fla. ( PRWEB ) January 22 , 2009 -- Risk - taking real estate daredevil and bestselling author Frank McKinney makes his fortune doing things like no one else .
This February , on Friday the 13th , he unveils " Acqua Liana , " his highly anticipated $ 29 million green mansion in an illusionary and spectacular theatrical assault on the senses .
During this artistic display , in just one evening , McKinney has promised to single - handedly revive the American Dream .
But how will he do it ?
With the grand unveiling of his daring new masterpiece , McKinney once again illustrates his incomparable talent for predicting and creating demand for the next hot trend in real estate .
South Florida coastal architecture is long overdue for the bold statement made by Acqua Liana 's dazzling , tropical and environmentally responsible design .
Acqua Liana , named after the Tahitian and Fijian words for water flower , is set on 1.6 acres and 23 feet above sea level , with over 150 breathtaking feet fronting direct Atlantic Ocean - to - Intracoastal Waterway property in Manalapan , Fla .
The estate is the first home of its size to be certified green by the rigorous environmental standards of the U.S. Green Building Council and the Florida Green Building Council .
Inspired by trips to Bali , Fiji , Tahiti and Hawaii , the three - story , 15,000 - square - foot , 7 - bedroom , 11 - bath mansion features thatched roofs , meandering water gardens , floating sun terraces , a waterfall spa with a fire feature in the water , an interior glass " water floor , " a suspended double - helix main glass staircase , an arched aquarium wet bar ( walk below with exotic fish above ! ) and a guesthouse constructed out of palm and bamboo that is partially submerged in a lagoon .
Green features of the home include :
--- enough solar panels to cover a regulation - size basketball court and could generate enough energy for two average - size homes ;
--- a water system that collects enough runoff water to fill the average swimming pool every 14 days ;
--- environmentally conscious lighting that reduces fixture consumption by 70 % ;
--- enough reclaimed wood to save 10.5 acres of Brazilian rain forest ;
--- renewable woods that regenerate every three years vs. every 50 years for other hardwoods ;
--- pools , reflecting ponds , water gardens , misters , etc. , to drop the site temperature 2 to 3 degrees lower than neighboring properties ;
--- recycling 340,000 pounds of debris during construction ; and
--- air conditioning and air purification systems four times better than a hospital 's operating room .
Among the home 's many spectacular features are a 2,180 - square - foot oceanfront master bedroom suite with his / hers ocean - view baths , magnificent oceanfront Hawaiian Koa - wood kitchen and catering kitchen , fitness studio , oceanfront glass office , two glass elevators , two laundry rooms , glass wine cellar , subterranean air - conditioned and marbled oversize garage with window views of the pool above and much more .
In distinctive McKinney style , which defies the ordinary , he also releases three new books : Burst This !
Frank McKinney 's Bubble - Proof Real Estate Strategies ;
The Tap ; and Dead Fred , Flying Lunchboxes , and the Good Luck Circle , all published by Health Communications , Inc . " I wrote all three over the last eighteen months from my oceanfront treehouse office , three hours a day , every day , " McKinney notes of his literary triple play .
" It meant constantly shifting between the challenging arena of bubble - proof real estate investing to a rich fantasy world to deep within my personal faith and spirituality . "
Proceeds from the sale of the books are donated to his Caring House Project Foundation , which creates a self - sustaining existence for poor and homeless families around the world .
Asked to " accentuate the dichotomy " in their attire , some of the 500 invited guests at the unveiling of Acqua Liana will appear to have walked out of a Friday the 13th horror film and others are expected to assume the guise of famous sweethearts for Valentine 's Day .
Gathered on the beach and sipping specially concocted " Friday the 13th Manalapan Mojitos , " with McKinney 's island - inspired Acqua Liana masterpiece shrouded behind a giant curtain , they will anxiously await their host 's arrival and the dramatic unveiling of the world 's most opulent green home .
With vibrant pyrotechnics and spotlights searing the night sky , McKinney will amaze the assembled VIPs with a stunning entry , complete with an illusion worthy of the world 's great magicians -- and even more impactful than his grand entrances to previous events , where he appeared as a pirate descending into the crowd from a high - speed zip line , jumped his motorcycle over a replica of his first home or raced up the shore on a jet ski while clad in black .
The opening spectacle of the night notwithstanding , " It 's when you cross the threshold into Acqua Liana that the show really begins , " says McKinney .
His theatrical " symphony of the senses " for this event was created to demonstrate that the American Dream is very much alive .
" At this Grand Unveiling , guests will hear nothing about a credit crisis or other gloom and doom , " he says .
" With Acqua Liana in the spotlight , they will be surrounded by beacons of realistic optimism and opportunity : other visionaries and market makers who pay no attention to the bubbleheads and who make their fortunes doing so . "
Anticipation for the first look at McKinney 's latest masterpiece has accelerated for months , as guests watched the countdown ticker at Frank - McKinney.com and then received an extraordinary invitation : a red , heart - shaped box decorated with a black ribbon -- Friday the 13th courting Valentine 's Day -- with custom candies inside saying Burst This ! , Buy Me , Green , Acqua Liana and twenty - six other words related to the big event .
Only two of the coveted invitations contained a gold coin with the word Sold on it , entitling the guest to a private lunch in McKinney 's famous treehouse office , copies of all three books , a ride in his 1988 Yugo mini - book - tour - mobile and a private tour of Acqua Liana .
The recent departure of Big Red Kitty caused me to do some serious reflection about World of Warcraft .
I had not yet reached the point that I was ignoring or neglecting family members while making podcasts and videos or raiding ( Raiding ?
What ’s that ? ) .
But I had reached the point where I would be flying around Storm Peaks on my green proto drake ( Thanks , Oracles ! ) hunting for the time - lost proto drake .
Why ?
Was n’t the time - lost proto drake exactly the same as the green proto drake except that it was n’t green but more time - lost colored ?
Was it really necessary that I run through the Scholomance quest chain in order to get the skeleton key so that I could read that one last book and get the Well Read achievement ?
Why did I go all the way back out to Netherstorm to buy pets for some goofy pet collecting achievement ?
Lord have mercy , Jesus , how many days in a row did I brave shark infested waters to feed fish to the lazy and horribly ugly sea lion so that it could find it ’s equally hideous mate ?
I do n’t even want to talk about how long I sat there trying to fish up Old Ironjaw ( I finally did ! ) .
I took the death knight out to Westfall to hunt down Edwin Van Cleef .
For ten lousy achievement points .
My reflection brought me to this conclusion : None of these things were at all fun for me .
None of these things changed the game one bit .
I enjoy [ most of ]
World of Warcraft , but it was high time I cut out things that were largely unnecessary and unenjoyable wastes of time .
It was then that I decided to start over .
From scratch .
I created a brand new blood elf rogue on Earthen Ring .
I ’ve never seriously tried horde before .
I played an orc hunter once to about level 24 or so on another server , but most of that time was spent in the barren wasteland known as , well , the Barrens , and I do n’t think even that was enough experience to let me know what playing on the horde side is really like .
I have no horde characters on this server and no way to be a sugar daddy to myself .
I ’m going to have to earn everything .
And I am earning it without the use of professions .
That ’s right , ladies and gentlemen , my rogue is only going to be able to do first aid .
No skinning , no mining , no herbalism .
No dressmaking , no meth labs , no way to make bendy straws .
My rogue is going to exist entirely off of what she finds lying around and nifty quest rewards .
I am going even further out on a limb by not leveling in a combat spec .
I once got a gnome rogue to level 30 with a combat spec in what would be the most boring 30 levels of my WoW career .
Nope , this time I am going assassination .
I know , I know .
It does n’t have the sustained DPS that ’s recommended for leveling .
But playing a combat rogue to me just does n’t seem very … rogueish .
It ’s more pirate - ish .
And I do n’t want to be a pirate ( though they do get cool hats ) .
I ’m not doing anything in this game that I do n’t want to anymore .
I do n’t need to grind rep for vanity pets .
I do n’t need the extra special shoulders from the So - and - so faction , especially since all my characters end up in PvP anyway .
So if you ’re on Earthen Ring and you see a lonely blood elf rogue slithering around happily hunting for quest targets , that ’s me .
The announcement of Bea Arthur 's death today made me think about actresses that we think of as kind of grandmotherly types .
Obviously , they did n't always look like nanas .
Here are five ladies that we know and love (d ) for their portrayal of older women , but I think the pictures will make you see them in a different light .
They made me see them in a different light , at least !
Betty White
Betty
White has been on the screen - small and silver - since 1945 when she had a part in Time to Kill , a George Reeves movie .
But she was modeling before that , which I totally believe looking at that picture .
Who knew Betty White was such a stunner ?
By the mid-50s she had her own sitcom called Life With Elizabeth ( clip below ) and ever since then she 's been in high demand , starring in shows such as Date with the Angels , Mary Tyler Moore , The Betty White Show , Mama 's Family , and , of course , Golden Girls .
Her latest work is The Proposal , a movie due to be released in June starring Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock .
Angela Lansbury
Anyone who associates Angela Lansbury with Jessica Fletcher - and let 's face it , who does n't ?
- is probably pretty shocked by how gorgeous she was in her younger days .
I know I was .
She and her mother and brother moved to L.A. in the early ' 40s when her mother , actress Moyna Macgill , decided to seek work there .
A former resident of England , Angela 's mother often held parties and get - togethers for British actors and actresses who had come to L.A. to make it big just like she had .
It was at one of these little shindigs that she met an actor who introduced her to a casting director who ended up putting Angela in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight .
Both performances earned her Oscar nominations , so Angela was a sought - after actress right from her debut in Hollywood .
Since then she 's done everything from playing a singing baker who specializes in people pies ( Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd ) to voicing an animated tea pot ( Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast .
And there 's obviously her Murder She Wrote streak - 12 Emmy noms in as many years .
The picture is from 1943's Samson and Delilah , which starred Hedy Lamarr .
She would have been 18 or 19 at the time .
Jessica Tandy
I 've only ever known Jessica Tandy for her roles as elderly women - Fried Green Tomatoes and Driving Miss Daisy to be exact .
I love Alfred Hitchcock films and have been enjoying The Birds for years without realizing that she played Lydia Brenner - I did n't recognize her at all .
But I really did n't recognize her in this amazing picture from Life magazine .
She was only 16 when she started acting in London , starting her career out with the likes of Laurence Olivier .
But when she and actor Jack Hawkins divorced , she picked up and moved to the U.S. to pursue a career there instead .
She won a Tony for A Streetcar Named Desire in 1948 , but lost the movie role to Vivien Leigh .
Convinced her movie career was n't really going to pan out , she mostly stuck to Broadway for the next 30 years or so ( except for couple of movies here and there , like The Birds ) .
She returned to movies in the ' 80s and started working with her husband , Hume Cronyn .
She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1989 for playing Miss Daisy Werthan - she was 80 at the time , making her the oldest actress to ever win an Oscar .
She was also nominated for Fried Green Tomatoes in 1991 but was beaten by Mercedes Ruehl for The Fisher King .
Jessica died in 1994 at the age of 85 .
Gloria Stuart
These days , 98 - year - old Gloria Stuart is best known for playing the older version of Rose in 1997 's Titanic , but she made her movie debut more than 60 years earlier .
She graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1927 and immediately took up at the Pasadena Playhouse , where she was " discovered . "
She was selected as a WAMPAS ( Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers ) Baby Star in 1932 along with Ginger Rogers .
She played Flora Cranley opposite Claude Rains in The Invisible Man ( and received top billing ! ) and was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild .
By the end of the ' 30 s she had been in more than 40 films and was ready for a break ; she took up oil painting and was good enough to book one - woman shows in galleries in New York .
Gloria did n't come back to the industry until the 1975 made - for - TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden - the one with Elizabeth Montgomery as Lizzie .
It was n't until she played Rose in Titanic , though , that she really came back to light as an actress .
She became the oldest person to ever be nominated for a non -honorary Oscar , but she lost out to Kim Basinger for L.A. Confidential .
She 's still around today and is good friends with Olivia de Havilland - she , Oliva , Joan Fontaine , Shirley Temple , Maureen O'Hara , Deanna Durbin and Luise Rainer are the last of the big female stars from the '30s .
Rue McClanahan
We can't forget the other surviving Golden Girl , Miss Blanche Devereaux herself .
Rue hails from Healdton , Oklahoma , and headed to New York to make her name on Broadway after she graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1957 .
She starred in a couple of B movies during the ' 60s but really gained notoriety as Caroline Johnson on Another World in 1970 .
She and Bea Arthur first teamed up in 1972 on Maude and was on the first few seasons of Mama 's Family with Betty White , the Girls were all familiar with one another by the time Golden Girls rolled around in 1985 .
She 's still quite active today , appearing in various Broadway roles and TV guest spots .
And she 's still pretty !
Woody Allen said he hoped the outcome would " discourage " others Woody Allen has won a $ 5 m ( £ 3.3 m ) out - of - court settlement from American Apparel after the US company used his image on adverts without consent .
He sued the clothing firm for using an image of him from his 1977 film Annie Hall without permission on billboards .
The firm had initially planned to bring up his personal life in its defence .
American Apparel had argued Allen was not worth the $ 10 m he was originally seeking because of the controversy surrounding his family life .
I sued American Apparel because they calculatingly took my name , likeness and image and used them publicly to promote their business
Woody Allen Speaking outside Manhattan federal court in New York - where the case had been due to take place - Allen said $ 5 m was " enough to discourage American Apparel or anyone else from ever trying such a thing again " .
He said : " I sued American Apparel because they calculatingly took my name , likeness and image and used them publicly to promote their business .
" Testimony revealed that American Apparel believed that fear of publicity would keep me from ever taking action . "
He said a scheme " to call a long list of witnesses who had obviously nothing to do with this case " had been rejected by the court .
" I suspect this dose of legal reality led to their 11th - hour settlement , " he said .
Meanwhile , American Apparel founder Dov Charney , who had the idea for the adverts - which also appeared on a website - told reporters the case was about " the dignity of ideas " .
" I am not sorry for expressing myself , " he said .
' Free speech '
Allen , 73 , who does not endorse products in the US , had said he had not authorised the use of the image , which depicted him dressed as an Hasidic Jew .
Woody Allen and Soon - Yi Previn 's relationship sparked headlines Last week , the company 's legal teams dismissed reports that it would bring up Allen 's relationships with wife Soon - Yi Previn and ex-partner Mia Farrow as part of its defence .
In 1992 , Allen 's then - girlfriend Farrow discovered he was having an affair with her adopted daughter Soon - Yi , then 22 .
American Apparel had earlier alleged that the relationship breakdown led to headlines around the world which had made the image worth less than the $ 10 m ( £ 6.5 m )
Allen was initially suing for .
But last week , the company 's lawyer Stuart Slotnick said the trial would , instead , focus on the right to free speech .
" At trial we will explain how the use of the image from the Annie Hall film was used to make a social statement and address social issues that were already subject to public discourse , " he said .
American Apparel had apologised for using Allen 's image in the billboards , which were taken down within a week of going up .

“ Tactics in Counterinsurgency ” ( large pdf ) , a new Army Field Manual that was published on the website of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and then removed from public access , is now available on the FAS website .
The new manual , a substantial addition to the literature of counterinsurgency , was reported last week in the Washington Post and Inside the Army .
“ After The Post raised questions about its contents last week , ” wrote Walter Pincus of the Post on March 31 , “ it was taken down ” from the Army website , even though the document is marked for unrestricted release .
An email inquiry to the Army inquiring why it had been removed was not answered .
See “ Tactics in Counterinsurgency , ” U.S. Army Field Manual Interim 3-24.2 , March 2009 ( 6.2 MB PDF , 307 pages ) .
“ Setbacks are normal in counterinsurgency , as in every other form of war , ” the new manual advises ( p. C - 5 ) .
“ You will make mistakes , lose people , or occasionally kill or detain the wrong person … .
If this happens , do n’t lose heart , simply drop back to the previous phase of your game plan and recover your balance . ”
Size 12 woman told she was too big by model agencies will compete for Miss England title
Healthy attitude : Aspiring size 12 model Leah Green , who was told she needed to lose weight by modelling agencies , has now been crowned Miss London
An aspiring model who was rejected by leading model agencies for being a size 12 has beaten 200 other girls to be crowned Miss London .
Leah Green , 22 , will next month compete for the Miss England title with regional finalists from across the country .
Today she told how she was rejected by several model agencies , despite being two dress sizes smaller than the average British woman .
Her experiences follow the debate over the trend for size - zero models - equivalent to a British size four .
" I have tried to get into modelling , " she said .
" But I have been turned away as I 'm apparently too big to be a regular model .
I 've been told I 'm too fat and I need to lose weight .
One agent told me I would have to work hard to achieve the gaunt look he was after .
" If you have to be the size of Victoria Beckham or Girls Aloud to even get a look in , then it just is n't for me . "
One of the agencies that rejected Miss Green , of Primrose Hill , North London , over her size was Models 1 .
Only a plus - size agency showed any interest .
The London College of Fashion graduate , who works as a design assistant at French Connection , said the industry was fixated with thin models and was responsible for many girls developing eating disorders .
" I helped out with London Fashion Week last year and many of the models looked like they were about to keel over and die , " she said .
A spokeswoman for Models 1 said it did not employ models larger than size 10 , but it was not the agency that labelled Miss Green " fat " or told her to lose weight .
Storm Model Management also rejected Miss Green but its owner said it was not because of her size .
Sarah Doukas said she had not been aware of Miss Green 's case but added : " I think she has a fantastic figure .
We have four girls on our books who are more than a size 12 .
If she was rejected , it might simply be that her look was n't right for us .
I 'm shocked that anybody would say such terrible things . "
Miss Green hopes to offer women an alternative role model by competing in Miss England .
" I saw it as a chance to get my message across , " she said .
The Miss England final takes place on 18 July at the Troxy , in Stepney , London .
" largely unreported is that several in the U.S. leadership became aware of the reality that many of the detainees were innocent of any substantial wrongdoing , had little intelligence value , and should be immediately released .
But to have admitted this reality would have been a black mark on their leadership from virtually day one of the so - called Global War on Terror and these leaders already had black marks enough : the dead in a field in Pennsylvania , in the ashes of the Pentagon , and in the ruins of the World Trade Towers .
They were not about to admit to their further errors at Guantanamo Bay .
Better to claim that everyone there was a hardcore terrorist , was of enduring intelligence value , and would return to jihad if released . "
Updated
The age - old battle between Microsoft and Apple is heating up again , and this time , Redmond is cheating .
On Thursday , Microsoft released a company - sponsored snark - fest written by Roger L. Kay of Endpoint Technology Associates that is , simply put , an embarrassment .
This report , entitled What Price Cool ?
( PDF ) and breathlessly pimped by The Windows Experience Blog- poodle Brandon LeBlanc , is riddled with inaccuracies , misstatements , and distortions .
The premise of WPC ?
is two - fold : first , that the Mac is a success because Mac fanbois simply want to be " cool , " and second , that there 's an enormous hidden " Apple tax " lurking to devour the wallets of Mac users .
We wo n't even touch the " cool " bait .
Sure , ridiculing coolness is becoming a centerpiece of Redmond 's latest assault on Cupertino - cf. Lauren 's " I 'm just not cool enough to be a Mac person " TV advert - but we 'll leave a discussion of the powers of peer pressure and fashion fever to the social scientists and trend - spotters .
We 're geeks .
But before we continue with a deconstruction of some of Kay 's more concrete arguments , let 's establish one simple fact :
Yes , it 's nearly always possible to buy a Windows - based PC for less than a Mac .
It you want a utilitarian box with which to check your email , browse the web , and wrestle with Excel and Word , a PC can usually get you there more cheaply .
But , then again , both a Fiat 500 and a Mercedes S - Class can take you across town .
Which is not to say that Macs are S - Class machines - we 'd suggest E - Class , with S - Class reserved for laptops like a 13.3 - inch Sony VAIO Z model VGN - Z698Y / X , which runs a cool $ 4,399.99 .
Kay 's point in WPC ?
is not just that you can find cheaper , crappier machines than those from Apple - and more - expensive , better - equipped ones as well .
No news there .
What he 's trying to prove is that when you buy a Mac you get less bang for your buck - and that 's where his arguments begin to get a bit sketchy .
For example - and for reasons that can at best be described as opportunistic - Kay repeatedly fixates on Blu-ray .
After first admitting that it's " arguable whether Blu-ray will ever be adopted by mainstream buyers , " he goes on to compare an internal LiteOn DH - 401S Blu-ray player to " Apple 's solution - a standalone player from Sony , the BDP - S350 . "
Apple 's solution ?
Says who ?
The BDP - S350 is nowhere to be found on Apple 's website or in its online store .
It gets sketchier .
In his laptop comparisons , Kay compares a defunct Apple MacBook with entry - level Dell , HP , and Sony units , using MacBook specs that have been out of date for months .
He also ignores Bluetooth 2.1+EDR , 802.11n , and Nvidia GeForce 9400 M graphics .
His comparison of desktop models is also disingenuous .
Again , he uses the wrong specs for the Mac mini : wrong processor , wrong RAM , wrong graphics , wrong hard - drive size , wrong ports .
You get the picture .
Now , it 's possible - probable , even - that Kay is merely being unprofessionally sloppy , not bothering to go back and redo his work after the recent round of Mac upgrades .
But that 's no excuse for Microsoft to publish arguments citing these incorrect stats nearly six weeks after they went out of date .
Kay 's next boner , though , is more egregious .
In his comparison of desktop Macs , he states that " At the high end , the gap is particularly wide " - and then price - compares a quad - core Xeon Mac Pro with a quad - core Core 2 Duo HP d5100t .
Aside from the fact that his text does n't agree with his chart , equating a Xeon with a Core 2 Duo is ludicrous .
( Kay could have upgraded his chart to reflect the new Mac Pro - after all , it was released over a month ago .
But maybe his PC crashed ) .
And so instead of Kay 's risible comparison of a now - defunct Xeon 5400 - based Mac Pro to a Core 2 Duo- based HP Pavilion Elite d5100t , let 's try the more - direct comparison of two Xeon 5500 workstations : a current single - processor Apple Mac Pro versus a single - processor Dell Precision T5500 that we 've configured to be as close , spec-wise - as we could to the Mac Pro .
Let 's see how they stack up ...
Driving overseas can be a great way to travel , but you need to make sure you are covered in case something goes wrong .
Here is how to make sure you have the right insurance before you start your trip .
1 . First of all , since we ARE the city that helped bring the country ( and the world ) Barack Obama , so …perhaps our turn - out for this FOX News - driven event might not be as large as it would be , say , deep in the heart of Texas or looking away ( somewhere ) in Dixieland .
I ’d estimate that the crowd I saw down in Kluczynski Federal Plaza was maybe 1/500th of the size of the famous Election Night gathering in Grant Park ( that Tyler and I roamed separately ) … and maybe even only a fiftieth of the ’ 92 pre-Election Day crowd I joined in Daley Plaza to watch and listen to then - candidates Clinton and Gore get the Chicago faithful charged up .
Call it maybe a few hundred…eh , maybe approaching a thousand , tops …
2 . There were plenty o’ signs a - waving in the crowd – about taxes , tea , patriotism , and various slogans that Dr. Paul might approve of ( but would likely SPELL better and more consistently ) … but , sadly , the mostly - GOP - led pretend grassroots gathering still strongly reflected the fact that – duh !
– when you apparently distribute fake handmade signs for your minions to brandish , you should at least try to vary the handmade - ness of said signs .
All of these suspiciously similar signs were clearly the results of some little homework project among a likely smallish group of true believers .
When will the conservatives learn that true grassroots movements are difficult to fake ?
AND that these " astroturfing " attempts they make are so laughably obvious ?
3 . Speaking of signs , the one that stuck with me AND bugged me the most read : " I AM JOHN GALT . "
A few thoughts about that :
A . No , you ’re not .
B. OK – well , I hope you ’re having fun following a fictional character created by someone ( long dead ) who , apparently , could n’t even properly spell her own first name …
C. You know what ?
Since you probably read " Atlas Shrugged " when you were an impressionable 17 – no doubt , at the urging of some righty teacher or professor ( maybe during the Reagan or Daddy Bush years ) , does that mean that I should be walking around toting a sign that says " I AM HOLDEN CAULFIELD " ?
How about " I AM BILLY PILGRIM " ?
Hmm – maybe even one that says " I AM A GOY NATHAN ZUCKERMAN " ?
Nah , all that just means is I had far better taste in formative literature than they did …
D. Yeah , right , Mr. " Galt " … I ’ll bet you pulled yourself away from your vastly creative profession , where you are – no doubt !
– a leading figure in your field that the world just could not do without .
Oh wait , I do n’t remember Galt ever saying " Do you want fries with that ? " or " The venti is the largest size " or " I ’ll go see if we have those in your size … " E. NO , YOU’RE FREAKIN ’ NOT !!!
4 . Um , I do so hope that someone explained to these grumpy , vaguely directionless protestors that the tax rates they are complaining about are – indeed ; of course – the ones enacted under President George W. Bush , NOT President Barack Obama …
5 . And , of course , as we ’ve tried to inform them – several times !
– will someone PLEASE send a note up the ladder of blind , semi-pointless , " Well , we must do SOMETHING , right ? " opposition and let them know to try to fully research nasty , sexually related slang terms before they label their little " movements . "
I mean – " tea bagging , " huh ?
What – did they first reject " Dirty Sanchez , " " Cleveland Steamer , " and " Rusty Trombone " as handy , colorful names for their protests ?
( Coming soon : The " Dirty Sanchez " clean - up of immigration laws ! )
Like I ’ve pointed out , next time maybe they should just ask former PA Sen .
Rick Santorum if he truthfully cringes every time he thinks about one of his kids later Google - ing their own last name …
" But , Dad – it says something about a resulting foamy and disgusting mixture of lube and … "
Ew !
Copenhagen , Denmark , Thursday 23 April :
The first - proof - of - concept for a DNA - based therapeutic vaccination against chronic hepatitis C was announced today at EASL 2009 , the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in Copenhagen , Denmark .
In the first clinical trial of a therapeutic vaccination using naked DNA delivered by in vivo electroporation ( EP ) , antiviral effects were shown in patients with hepatitis C ( HCV ) .
Researchers hope that this will encourage further clinical development .
The data also provide further evidence for the antiviral role of the HCV - specific T cell response .
It is estimated that some 3 % of the world 's population is infected with HCV .
In industrialised countries , hepatitis C accounts for 70 % of chronic hepatitis cases .
One of the main concerns is that HCV infection remains asymptomatic until advanced stages of the disease .
Clearance of HCV infection correlates with activation of the host T cell response .
Therefore , in this study , researchers developed a T cell vaccine based on a codon - optimised HCV non-structural ( NS ) 3/4A DNA - gene expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate - early promoter ( ChronVac - C® ) delivered by in vivo electroporation ( EP ) .
A first phase I / IIa clinical trial in HCV infected patients is currently ongoing .
Professor Matti Sallberg of Laboratory Medicine , the Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden , who led the study , said : " In 50 - 80 % of adult cases , the immune system fails to eliminate the HCV virus and the disease becomes chronic .
Given that only about 50 % of HCV infected persons are diagnosed in most developed countries and that two - thirds need to undergo antiviral treatment , this new vaccination has huge implications in terms of the future management of this widespread disease . "
In this study , a volume of 0.5 ml saline containing ChronVac - C® DNA was injected at 1 cm depth in the deltoid muscle .
This was followed by two 60ms electrical pulses administered using a 1.5 cm four - electrode array ( Medpulser DDS ; Inovio , CA , US ) .
The study aims were safety , immunogenicity , and effects on the viral load .
Twelve treatment naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and a viral load < 800,000 IU / ml were divided in four groups of 167 μg , 500 μg , and 1,500 μg given as four monthly doses of DNA .
In the 167μg group , no severe side effects were observed , two patients mounted transient T cell responses , and none had a reduced viral load .
In the 500μg dose , no severe side effects were observed , and two developed better sustained HCV - specific T cell responses .
Simultaneous with these responses , both patients had reductions in the viral load of up to 0.89 log10 and 1.5 log10 , respectively .
In the third patient , no immune response developed and no clear reductions in the viral load were seen .
In the 1,500μg dose , no severe side effects were observed , and one patient developed HCV - specific T cell response .
Two patients had reductions in the viral load of up to 1.2 log10 and 2.4 log10 , respectively .
Thus , 67 % ( four out of six ) of patients in the two highest dose groups had reductions in the viral load exceeding 0.5 log10 lasting for two to > 10 weeks .
Of these , three had activations of the HCV - specific T cell responses at the time of the reductions in the viral load .

Johnson Rice & Company ( JRCO ) was kind enough to provide their analysis of the current natural gas price situation .
They are predicting a possible rebound in prices in late 2009 , depending on the multiple factors they lay out in their analysis .
We look into the details below the fold .
Natural Gas Supply and Demand Balance
Falling Production , Falling Demand and LNG
The Johnson Rice & Company ( JRCO ) constructed a model of production and demand flows and looked at what it will take to balance these flows at higher prices .
This is exactly the kind of information and insight we need to build an improved dynamic model .
I read the analysis with great interest and rushed to write it up to hear the comments of the TOD contributors .
Here is the summary of factors :
Current Oversupply 4.0 Bcf /d 3 Month Rig Lagged Production Effect - 3.6 Bcf /d Avg. LNG Import Increase 0.5 Bcf /d Avg. U.S. to Mexico Export Drop 0.5 Bcf /d Remaining Industrial Demand Drop 1.0 Bcf /d Canadian Import Drop - 0.9 Bcf /d GOM Production Return 0.9 Bcf / d Steepened Decline Curve Effect - 1.3 Bcf /d Year End 2009 Balance 1.1 Bcf /d Table 1 : Factors in the supply and demand balance
Production Passed Demand in the First Quarter 2008
For context I have added a chart of natural gas prices and rig counts .
It is apparent that some time in the first quarter of 2008 production exceeded demand and prices started to tumble .
Production continued to climb leading to the current oversupply .
The JRCO analysis backs up the production to the first quarter and estimates that the level of over production is 4 Bcf/d ( without considering LNG or a drop in demand ) .
Figure 2 shows that production in Q1 08 was about 53 Bcf/d and Dec 08 production was about 57 Bcf/d .
Production Reduced by Falling Rig Counts
Drilling rates have been falling very rapidly and rigs are down from a peak of near 1600 to just over 810 .
However JRCO points out that it was the shale gas wells that caused the overproduction and that the number of shale gas rigs has only just fallen to the Q1 2008 level .
Baker
Hughes does not break out the active rigs by target and so I found the following graph fascinating .
Most of the pull back in shale drilling has been in Barnett .
Haynesville has built rig count despite the fall in prices .
The JRCO analysis makes a point of saying that most of the total rig count reduction has been in non -shale gas .
They estimate that a drop of 541 non - shale rigs would have same effect as a drop of 400 shale gas rigs , when adjusted for well performance .
The shale rig count is only down 3 rigs over Q1 2008
JRCO provided the following Internal Rate of Return graph .
It clearly shows how the tight gas sands in the Piceance Basin are not competitive against the shale plays , but it is less clear to me why the Barnett shale should be dropping rigs rapidly and not Woodford or Fayetteville .
( Chesapeake has made a clear distinction between the " shale haves " and the " shale have nots " in their March 2009 Investor Report that we will examine in another post . )
The total reduction in rigs ( as of March 20th when the report was published ) is expected to low supply by 3.6 Bcf /d in late 2009 .
However there are many complicating factors , such as the declining economy and increasing LNG supply .
Further Drop Expected in Industrial Demand
One of the largest unknowns is the current state of the economy .
Are we in for a rebound or further declines ?
The JRCO analysis predicts further declines by examining past recessions and how they impacted industrial utilization .
As you can see in Figure 5 that if the current recession matches the severity of either the ' 73 or ' 80 recessions that we still have about a 4 % decline in industrial utilization left to go .
They predict that this further decline in industrial utilization will translate into a drop in natural gas demand of 1 Bcf /d .
( There are some very interesting relationships between natural gas usage , industrial utilization , and GDP noted in the analysis that I hope to explore later ) .
LNG Imports Expected to Increase
One area that has been keenly discussed on TOD lately is how much new LNG will come on line this year and how much of that LNG will make it to the US .
The JRCO analysis offers several insights .
First is Table 2 of major LNG projects coming on line 2009 ( mostly late 2009 ) showing the expected supply and primary market ( mostly long term contracts ) .
Yemen LNG 0.85 Bcf/d U.S. & Mexico on 20 year contracts Tangguh Trains 1 & 2 1.0 Bcf /d Pacific Basin but some to Mexico Qatargas - 2 Train - 1 1.0 Bcf /d Mostly Japan Rasgas - 2 1.0 Bcf /d Mostly Europe ( South Hook ) Sakhalin - 2 0.625 Bcf /d Pacific Basin Table 2 : New LNG
Supplies , capacity and primary market
All told , about 5.1 Bcf /d is coming onto the market .
( Just for context , U.S. gas demand is over 50 Bcf /d and the oversupply is 4 Bcf / d ) .
However most of that natural gas is destined for other locations on long term contract .
The LNG slated for Mexico will reduce U.S. exports and thus must be counted .
JRCO also provided this regression which I found very helpful .
It looks at the price differential between the UK National Balancing Point price and NYMEX .
The correlation is rough , but still useful .
( It would be very helpful if someone explored other relationships and tried to identify the factors that explain the outliers ) .
Trinidad supplies about 2 Bcf /d of natural gas to the Atlantic region .
The cost to ship to Europe is about $ 0.25 per Mcf over the U.S.
So when the NYMEX price is very close to the UK price , there is a good chance the cargos will be diverted to the U.S. JRCO use NYMEX and NBP futures to estimate when that might happen .
It looks like there is possible window for Trinidad LNG to come to the US this summer .
In total , they estimate that the U.S. will receive an increased 0.5 Bcf /d supply of LNG .
They also estimate LNG arriving in Mexico will cause drop exports an additional 0.5 Bcf /d of supply .
Additional Reduction Needed
Table 1 summarized the expected supply and demand balance .
The total oversupply is expected to shrink to 1.1 Bcf /d .
A larger reduction in drilling rigs will be needed to balance the market and bring prices back up .
JRCO estimates that it will take shutting down another 45 conventional rigs and 45 Rockies rigs to take 1.2 Bcf / d off the market by the end of 2009 ( Figure 8 ) .
Since the report was published on March 20 , Baker Hughes reports that the natural gas rig count has fallen another 88 rigs , which is nearly the number to reach balance .
Since prices are still low , it is probable that rig counts will continue to fall .
This may well cause an overshoot condition and supply will fall below demand and cause a price spike .
It will be interesting to watch if the drop in rig count begins to slow or just continues on down .
Watch List
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British author J.G. Ballard , whose novel “ Empire of the Sun ” vividly portrayed his childhood imprisonment in wartime Shanghai and was adapted into a Hollywood film , died on Sunday , his agent said .
He was 78 .
His agent Margaret Hanbury described Ballard , who had been suffering from prostate cancer , as a “ giant on the world literary scene . ”
He died at the riverside home west of London where he had lived since the 1960s .
“ His acute and visionary observation of contemporary life was distilled into a number of brilliant , powerful novels which have been published all over the world , ” Hanbury said .
“ Empire of the Sun ” was based on Ballard ’s privileged childhood with his expatriate parents in China and their subsequent detention in a prison camp after the Japanese invasion during World War Two .
He recalled how his parents ’ rich friends lost their chauffeur - driven cars and ended up “ scrambling for a piece of sweet potato . ”
Director Steven Spielberg adapted the book for the big screen and it was nominated for six Oscars .
Ballard would later write in his memoirs that his early , often violent , experiences shaped all his later work .
“ In many ways my entire fiction is the dissection of a deep pathology that I had witnessed in Shanghai and later in the postwar world , ” Ballard wrote .
“ I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings - up that went on , but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games . ”
Born in Shanghai in 1930 , Ballard enjoyed a comfortable life with his parents -- his father ran a successful textiles company -- before their world was turned upside down by the war .
After more than two years in the detention camp , the family returned to Britain where Ballard resumed his education .
He went on to study medicine at Cambridge University , which he described as an “ academic theme park where I was a reluctant extra , ” before deciding to pursue a career as a writer .
In a career spanning more than 50 years , Ballard gained cult status around the world for a series of dystopian science fiction novels such as “ The Drowned World . ”
One of his most controversial works was “ Crash , ” a novel about people who are sexually aroused by car accidents that was later turned into a film directed by David Cronenberg .
His wife Mary died from pneumonia in 1964 and Ballard raised their three children alone .
The author would fend off critics ’ suggestions that his writing was often excessively bleak .
“ There is nothing inhuman about my fiction , ” he told one interviewer .
“ It is just , I think , that I am chasing a different hare around the track . ”
Regular readers know I am no fan of Jenny McCarthy .
I have called her a public health risk here before , and I stand by that : her claim that vaccines cause ( or contribute to ) autism is nothing short of breathtakingly ridiculous .
And I 'm not the only one who knows this to be true .
Medical doctors Orac and Steve Novella have words about her , as does Skeptic Dad , and the Stop Jenny McCarthy site was created to expose her as the danger she is .
And now the gauntlet is well and truly thrown down : a website has been created called Jenny McCarthy Body Count .
Stark and grim , it has one purpose : to show how many preventable illnesses and preventable deaths have occurred due to unvaccinated people since Jenny McCarthy became the de facto face of the antivaccination movement .
The website , created by skeptic Derek Bartholomaus , stops short of saying she is directly responsible for these illnesses and deaths , but her indirect responsibility is arguably relevant .
We know that some outbreaks of measles have occurred due to the antivax movement , for example .
And there have been deaths -- children have died -- because they were unvaccinated .
McCarthy may have started out as a comedian , but I 'm not laughing at her anymore .
The statistics for the site are from the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality reports , which Bartholomaus has linked for reference .
The diseases specifically include measles , mumps , rubella , polio , tetanus , Hib , the flu , and diphtheria .
In fact , his numbers underestimate the problem , since other vaccine - preventable diseases are not listed in the CDC reports .
Not surprisingly , the vast majority of fatalities are from the pediatric flu , a tragedy I have a difficult time grasping .
The Jenny McCarthy Body Count site itself only launched on March 29 , but it 's already had thousands of views .
Bartholomaus , a self - described " statistics geek " , updates it by hand once a week , when the new CDC reports are issued .
He also has some basic info on McCarthy 's claims there , but for more background info on McCarthy and her pro-disease stance , go to Stop Jenny McCarthy .
It 's too bad we need something like this site , but McCarthy gets a free pass from the media , even from those that claim to " spar " with her ( but really only give her a platform in which she can spew more dangerous nonsense ) .
The Jenny McCarthy Body Count site is a very stark -- and sadly , very necessary -- reminder that just because people 's beliefs are n't real , they can still have a very real and very tragic impact .

It has become a very stressful yet all too predictable scenario for me .
A man and I are walking together .
We might know each other or he might be a stranger who just got distracted for a moment and did n’t notice the closed door looming menacingly before us .
We continue approaching , perhaps a little more slowly now that we both see the writing on the wall , or the door in this case .
I ’m never sure what he ’s thinking at this point , but I know I have two choices : I can hang back and see what he decides to do or I can speed up and reach for the door before he gets the chance .
I ’ve gone both ways here .
Usually I make the decision at the very last moment using my keen peripheral vision to quickly assess his cultural values , upbringing and emotional state of mind .
With a younger guy , I just go for the door myself ( out of pity for both of us ) .
If I think a man is in his sixties or older , I ’ll often wait since I ’m fairly sure he ’ll get the door and gesture for me to go ahead .
But when he ’s between 30 and 60 , it ’s a crap shoot .
If I pause expecting the door to be opened for me I risk the confusion and awkwardness that awaits if the guy was n’t planning to offer me that service .
Of course by the time I realize this , we ’re both already stuck , hands and arms intertwined in a struggle for door supremacy .
Eventually one of us lets go and we both stumble through the doorway and scurry off in shame .
I ’m embarrassed I ever wanted him to hold the door in the first place and I get the feeling he ’s sorry he did n’t .
You might wonder why I even bother with any of this .
I could certainly avoid these clumsy encounters altogether by simply taking charge and opening my own darn door .
After all , I am perfectly capable of handling a simple door - opening by myself .
But to be honest , I really kind of like having a man do it .
Obviously , it ’s not about what I can or ca n’t do on my own .
There ’s just something inside me that seems to enjoy and value the service of men .
And lately , I ’ve been starting to think that “ something ” might be a woman .
If it is , then I ’m pretty sure there ’s a man lurking inside some of the guys I know too .
Just the other day for instance , a male friend of mine — for no reason at all — took my keys right out of my hand and went outside to check on a problem I was having with my car .
I did n’t even ask him or anything .
So all this makes me wonder , could it be that it ’s finally okay for men and women to be …. well men and women again ?
I was born in the 60s and I can’t remember a time when I felt like my identity as a girl or woman was actually about me .
It has always been more about modeling myself after the ideal construct of the strong , liberated modern woman — independent , powerful , assertive ( did I mention independent ? ) .
Need a man ?
Are you nuts ?
Not me .
I am woman hear me roar !
Etcetera , etcetera .
I certainly would not want to appear anti-feminist in any way .
The truth is , I am profoundly grateful for the rights and freedoms I have today .
But there ’s no doubt that the very necessary social movements required to secure fairness for women created some uncertainty around what it means to be male and female .
Feminist activists had to take the spotlight off the things that make us different and focus on our common humanity in order to drive home the point that we all deserve equal treatment .
However decades of emphasizing male and female “ sameness ” have left most of us frustrated and confused about how to reconcile our deeply rooted , biologically - based feelings and desires with our intellectually constructed social values .
Lately , the battle of the sexes has become more of an inner conflict matching our sense of who we are against our idea of who we should be .
Certainly , the noble concept of who we should be has served us well over the years .
Our culture has always placed a high value on the pursuit of justice and fairness for everyone .
The process can be slow , but our collective desire to hold ourselves to a higher and higher standard has been one of the driving forces behind the building of the most fair - minded societies in the world .
There is no question we possess considerable will , reason and intelligence .
We might even be smart enough to figure out that our intellects have only so much power over our biology .
There is no denying the simple fact that we are all here primarily because our fathers and mothers had sex .
Obviously other things had to happen too , but the most critical element in baby - making is surely the act of sex itself .
They say evolution is about “ survival of the fittest , ” but it ’s really more accurate to describe it as “ survival of the fittest and most prolific . ”
No matter how strong or smart or beautiful you are , the only way your genes survive and get passed down to future generations is if you reproduce .
And that puts our behaviours around reproduction front and centre in the process of natural selection .
Bottom line is , we ’ve all inherited the well - honed skills , desires , and impulses that facilitated the impressive reproductive success of our countless ancestors over the millennia .
Men are designed to behave in ways that will get the sexual attention of women and women are naturally inclined to seek out and admire male characteristics that serve to enhance the survival potential of their offspring .
Like it or not , the instincts governing our interactions with the opposite sex are programmed into the most primal recesses of our DNA .
Sure , we can pretend our intellects are completely in charge , but we ’ve all seen how well that works out .
I doubt relations between men and women have ever been more strained than they are today .
Resentment , anger and conflict are prominently featured in so much of male - female interaction these days and the media compounds the problem by reinforcing this dynamic at every turn .
Criticizing men has been in vogue now for quite a while , with positive representations of male qualities absent from most of popular culture .
Women , who ’ve convinced themselves the best route to having it all is doing it all , have unwittingly shut men out of the roles that define them most fundamentally as men .
Add to that the unprecedented availability of meaningless sex and pornography and you have a recipe for disaster : men with little sense of self or purpose and scarcely anything to motivate them to excel .
I ’m afraid women are no better off .
We are relentlessly conditioned to think one way when instinctively we often crave something entirely different .
We roll our eyes at macho posturing even though a man ’s bold strength and courage make us feel safe .
We complain endlessly about the audacity of the male ego , but it ’s a man ’s confidence that gives us faith in his wherewithal .
And while it ’s fashionable to sing the praises of a sensitive guy , I believe most of us prefer men who are thick - skinned and resilient ( all that stuff about not being afraid to cry…please be a little afraid ) .
With so much of what we ’ve been taught to believe conflicting with what we instinctively desire , is it any wonder women are such a jumble of contradictions ?
Unfortunately , admitting the truth leaves us open to being labelled needy , weak and unenlightened .
When I talk to women about this sad state of affairs , they ’re usually quite guarded at first .
But as soon as I open up and share my frustration over feeling unable to express my honest feelings and desires , they almost always jump right in and agree whole - heartedly .
They want to be women , empowered by their many strengths but still vulnerable enough to need men , to enjoy and appreciate their unique talents and offerings .
As for men , they seem even more gung - ho for change .
Most guys I meet light - up at the slightest gesture of affection for their battered masculinity .
They want to be men for us , if only we ’d let them .
I guess the good thing is we ’re getting pretty close to some relief .
Enough of us seem to want the same thing : the freedom to be ourselves .
So where do we go from here ?
Personally , I think we just need to take it one door at a time .
Once we relax and allow ourselves to celebrate and enjoy the pleasures of our differences , the rest should happen naturally .
It ’s just not that complicated .
Even my grade 6 students get it .
After only mild encouragement , the young gentlemen in my class are proud to graciously allow their female classmates to enter and exit through a door first .
The girls are flattered by the gesture and pleased to offer a sincere smile and “ thank you ” in return .
I ’ve even had a number of parents thank me for introducing a little chivalry into the lives of their children .
As for my own predicament , I have decided to go forth bravely into this world full of confusion and closed doors .
Maybe next time , I ’ll even wait a little bit longer before I reach for that door handle .
Hey , why not give the guy a chance to be the man we both want him to be .

Last Sunday , Jim Hoagland , who writes a column on foreign affairs in The Washington Post , wrote that Obama should learn from president John F. Kennedy and call for worldwide nuclear disarmament .
Hoagland 's columns generally express the consensus of the U.S. foreign affairs establishment .
Kennedy was the last American president to have tried to stop the Israeli nuclear project .
He threatened that there would be serious ramifications vis-a - vis U.S. support for Israel if the reactor in Dimona was not opened to frequent visits by inspectors .
The pressure that Kennedy applied on the matter of Dimona was apparently one of the factors in David Ben-Gurion 's resignation in 1963 .
Kennedy 's assassination several months later led to a relaxation of that pressure and Israel was able to complete construction of the reactor in the Negev .
That is , as soon as he gives up on life altogether and begins considering his options , which might include a dignified euthanasia , a hunting trip with Dick Cheney , announcing the abolition of the Federal Reserve , or as Haaretz has suggested , pressuring Israel to open the doors of Dimona to weapons inspectors .
What a stroke of luck that was for the Terror State , eh ?
With Kennedy out of the way , Israel was able to put the finishing touches on its arsenal of death , and become even more belligerent and dangerous than it was when the Zionists stole Palestine and proceeded to wage a series of wars of aggression against its Arab neighbors .
Obama will keep his mouth shut , of course .
Obama is Israel 's bitch .

Unless some announcement is made soon in support of Blu-ray , they are about to get beat out by MS .
pointless May 26 , 2009
As ShaggyDude says , this is just for data backup purposes and NOT about natively playing Blu-ray movies .
mustang - gt - 2002 May 27 , 2009 I dont want Microsoft to have Blu-ray anything .
they are the ones that tryed to stop Blu-ray .
by backing HD - DVD so that downloading would take over .

This seems like a wasted effort considering the short life expectancy of Vista .
It will probably be in place for Windows 7 , but should be integrated in any future SP releases for XP .

Third party iPhone App Store developers have received propositions from a scammer offering to buy large volumes of their iPhone applications and then split the resulting revenue with them , apparently using fraudulent iTunes gift certificates to make the purchases .
AppleInsider has obtained an email sent to the developer of TiltMeter Pro , sent from an individual using a yahoo.com email account to the developer 's customer support email address listed in the iTunes App Store .
The email states , " I 've been taking a look into your application and have an offer to you .
I have many itunes gift certificates for itunes usa , canada and uk to make purchases through the itunes store .
I can buy your product as many times as you want and can share earnings 50 - 50 . "
The scam attempts to exploit Apple 's generous 70 % revenue share of all iTunes mobile software purchases , which the company pays directly to developers .
Counterfeiters have already mastered the algorithm used to generate fraudulent iTunes gift certificate numbers , but can only sell the fake certificates for pennies on the dollar , as few consumers are willing to pay anything significant for the opportunity to download free iTunes while incurring the substantial risk of being caught with a paper trail tied directly to their iTunes account .
One Chinese auction site attempting to sell generated iTunes gift certificate numbers listed an available inventory of over 77,000 codes valued at $ 200 each , but only appeared to be selling a few hundred at around two dollars each , netting just a couple hundred dollars .
Using the counterfeit codes to buy apps instead , and then splitting the proceeds with developers , the scammers could easily syphon thousands of dollars from Apple 's App Store without much effort .
Upping the value of counterfeit iTunes credits
For example , by setting up a thousand fake iTunes accounts , a scammer could offer to buy a thousand copies of a given iPhone application at the average $ 2 price each , resulting in $ 1,400 in fraudulent iTunes developer revenues , with the scammer offering to split the proceeds with the developer .
That amount of money would be unlikely to tip off any suspicions at Apple , given that the company is now handling over 75 million active accounts , according to Phil Schiller in his January 2009 Macworld Expo keynote .
If the scammers understand how to manipulate the iTunes interface using automated tools , a likely scenario given their ability to counterfeit gift certificates , it should be easy to set up tens of thousands of virtual iTunes users , converting the low value gift certificate counterfeiting business into a much more lucrative scam that can generate tens of thousands of dollars per app with very little overhead and little risk to the scammer .
Scammers initially attempted to market illegitimate iTunes Gift Certificates one - by - one for pennies on the dollar .
The risk assumed by developers participating in the scam is much higher than the risk to the counterfeiters , however .
Apple is likely to discover the purchasing patterns that tip - off sales as automated , resulting in offending developers losing their fraudulently obtained revenue and their ability to sell their work in iTunes .
They would also find themselves facing criminal fraud charges in a case where the transactions were all clearly documented within the iTunes Store 's transactions .
Unscrupulous developers might consider participating the scam , not just for a cut of the money but also to generate fake sales volumes for their applications , which could help push their titles up in the rankings and expose them to a much wider audience .
The huge selection of mobile apps in iTunes makes it challenging for developers to get their apps to stand out ; immediate , high volume sales over a short period of time can boost a new title into iTunes ' top ten lists , a status which results in a huge boost in legitimate sales and far more overall purchases than an app could hope to achieve without reaching the critical mass needed to obtain front page promotion in iTunes .
SEO for iTunes apps
Developers are already working to discover Apple 's secret algorithms used to calculate top sales rankings and use their advertising budgets for promotion of their apps as efficiently as possible , generating the types of sales traffic that results in immediate promotion within iTunes .
i Phone developers have stated that being promoted within iTunes is far more effective in reaching new customers and generating sales than anything they can do to promote themselves .
Figuring out exactly how to push their apps into the spotlight is the hard part .
At the recent iGames Summit , developers and game publishers noted that Apple operates its App Store as a level playing field ruled by " meritocracy , " with iPhone app popularity based entirely upon how good the apps are and therefore how popular they become with users , rather than titles being promoted by Payola - style deals that sell titles based on how much the vendors pay to place their products .
This has been a boon for small indie developers , allowing them to compete against much larger software developers that might release titles with less originality and creativity , but also makes it difficult for anyone to game the system .
There 's so much money at stake that such gaming efforts are inevitable .
These efforts to discover the rules at work behind the iTunes App Store are very similar to the " search engine optimization " that many companies offer to help web content producers gain favorable rankings for their websites in Google , resulting in many more visitors and therefore more ad revenue .
Like Google , Apple tries to keep its methods secret to prevent sites from exploiting loopholes and system vulnerabilities or simply gaming the system fraudulently .
In online advertising and SEO , that has included doing things like creating huge arrays of fake websites that point to a promoted site in order to boost its search ranking in Google , or paying armies of low paid sweatshop workers in developing countries to click on ads that appear on a site .
In Google 's case , the scammer is trying to either fool the company into increasing the weight it assigns to a website based on worthless traffic , or to defraud Google and its advertisers into paying a site ad revenue for worthless ad requests .
Too , auto companies have a hard time downsizing to deal with crashing demand .
They are , in a way , highly leveraged , as Tyler Cowen describes Asian countries :
The usual story is that these nations are " heavily dependent upon exports . "
But if I may wear my Don Boudreaux hat for a moment ( or more ) , is not the state of Kentucky also heavily dependent upon exports ?
Is not the Cowen household heavily dependent upon exports ?
Why is being dependent on exports so especially bad for parts of Asia ?
One answer is that Asian exports , which travel great distances , are often consumer durables and such purchases are especially easy to postpone .
Services are often more robust .
Another answer is that many Asian producers have chosen high fixed costs in a way that requires steady or rising revenue over time .
That is their version of being highly leveraged without taking on much explicit debt .
Again a central lesson of this depression will be how many different ways there are to leverage .
Their fixed costs include not just the infamous pension and healthcare costs for retirees , but also plants , environmental liabilities for cleaning up manufacturing sites before they can be sold , and an operating structure that makes it extremely costly to shut down plants for any length of time and then open them up again .
If you plan to keep operating the plant in the future , you have to do things like heat the factory to keep the pipes from freezing , and service the machines ; also , the costs of reassembling a laid off workforce mount with every month that the plant remains shut down .
People will not hang around a dying factory town indefinitely , though the depressed state of the Michigan economy actually does help mitigate these costs relative to a place like Japan .
Though I 've been against the bailout , on the grounds that failing automakers simply do n't pose systemic economic risks , some of the advocates have made a reasonable argument that it was worth spending a tiny fraction of the TARP funds to get the automakers over a temporary hump .
But the hump is clearly , at this point , a rapidly inclining mountain of problems .
And given the reasonable assumption that Chrysler will also need repeated future infusions , the fraction of TARP we will spend on these two companies alone no longer looks that small .
There 's another problem : how long before having to compete against government subsidized bankrupts forces
Ford to jump into line for funds ?
If we keep funneling money to GM and Chrysler , expect to see Ford at the lending window sometime soon .
Their retained earnings borrowings cannot compete with an unlimited well of federal money .
It 's time to stop talking about keeping GM out of bankruptcy , and start talking about what measures might be necessary to keep GM as a ( smaller ) going concern rather than outright liquidation .
One thing to look at is warranties : consumers are understandably worried about buying a car where the warranty may not be good in a year .
There may be a government role in guaranteeing that coverage .
After years when billions have been spent on aid projects in Africa , donors are now picking up on a new trend to put money on the continent 's entrepreneurs .
Next month , a meeting of the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town is set to reinforce the message that " trade not aid '' represents salvation for a continent whose average 5 % growth in the past five years is projected to fall to 1.5 % this year amid the global economic downturn .
Now entrepreneurship is being presented as a panacea .
Earlier this month , the Africa Commission , an initiative by the Danish government , launched a " guarantee facility " worth $ 3bn to mobilize loans for small businesses .
Until now , such entrepreneurs – typically street vendors wishing to own a shop but with needs exceeding the scope of micro-credit – have been ignored by local banks .
Donald Kaberuka , a commission member and president of the African Development Bank , said the move was " the most innovative initiative launched in Africa in decades , which will create millions of productive and decent jobs " .
A bestselling book by the Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo called Dead Aid argues that western assistance has given rise to a dependency culture in developing countries .
It has sparked a furious response from aid organisations angered by the attention given to the former Goldman Sachs strategist , named this month by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world .
But the question is : what should aid be replaced by ?
Aid experts , businesspeople and civil society groups warn that unless the new social entrepreneurs , as they are being called , must be helped not only to get on their bikes but to stay on them .
The world financial crisis has increased protectionist tendencies among rich countries , worsening Africa 's access to markets .
The crisis has set back efforts such as Gordon Brown 's Business Call to Action , which last year asked corporations to help to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015 .
It is estimated that 60 % of Africa 's population is aged under 25 .
Only one in four children go into secondary education and , of those , only 5 % enter vocational training courses .
Business studies are mostly absent from curriculums and apprenticeships often mask child exploitation .
African business people welcome the Africa Commission 's move .
But Sudanese - British entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim – who made his fortune in Africa through the Celtel mobile phone company – said supporting small business was only part of the solution .
Ibrahim , 63 , said : " Africa has no venture capital industry – the kind that supported the Googles and Microsofts of this world .
So the guarantee facility is helpful , but what we really need are local funds to become involved .
We need local investors whose motivation is profit .
The Africa Commission must not become another handout industry . "
He also welcomed the move to raise the glass ceiling of micro-credit , but said African governments must not be let off the hook .
" The World Bank should refuse to fund any project which is not regional .
African governments must be pressed to regionalise their economies and stop being 53 little countries , each with their flag , jealously watching each other . "
Microsoft Africa chairman Cheick Diarra , 57 , warned that encouraging entrepreneurs will build wealth only if bureaucratic obstacles are removed .
" Politicians are doing very little to dynamise their economies or empower their people .
Governments should be dealing with infrastructure development , such as electrification . "
Diarra , from Mali , who made his name as an interplanetary navigator for Nasa , also believes " bad aid " is responsible for many of the continent 's ills .
" In 2002 , I ran the Virtual University in Nairobi , providing distance - learning by internet .
But dealings with most of the donors were a frustration because they set rigid terms and would rarely adapt to the rapidly - changing conditions on the ground . "
African business development does not represent a threat to rich countries .
The continent has 20 % of the world 's population but only a 2 % share of its trade .
Nevertheless , even before decolonisation in the 1960s , rich countries have behaved as though they wished to keep Africa poor .
The one exception to the rule is Coca - Cola , which since 1928 has been fostering entrepreneurship on the continent .
Critics of the Africa Commission say its focus on entrepreneurs implies that it will help urban businesses , but that 65 % of Africa 's people are rural .
Danish development minister Ulla Tornaes said farmers need to become businesslike and added : " We cannot dictate to African countries on agriculture . "
In African civil society – where western - funded lobby groups and welfare organizations have had sharp budget cuts as a result of the downturn – there are fears that the focus on entrepreneurship is a creeping privatisation of aid .
Vuyiseka Dabula , spokesman for the South African Treatment Action Campaign , said : " HIV is not in recession and we are not a business .
About 80 % of our funding comes from international donors and most of them have had 25 % budget cuts . "
Oxfam 's head of research , Duncan Green , said the move to promote entrepreneurship smacked of repackaging .
" Suddenly people are saying that social entrepreneurship is going to get millions of people on to solar energy and that kind of thing .
It 's interesting , but it must not be seen as the new magic bullet . "
The idea being pitched to Long Beach by a small Las Vegas entertainment company is extraordinarily ambitious , if not downright outlandish : Renovate and restore the Queen Mary and return her to sail the oceans of the world .
Cairngorm Entertainment Group is backing the Queen ’s Project , an organization that is soliciting funds for the proposal it estimates could cost as much as $ 1.5 billion and require at least four years of dry - dock restorations .
It would be a new venture for Cairngorm , which specializes in distributing vintage movies and television shows such as “ Ozzie and Harriet ” and “ Love That Bob ! ” for broadcast on cable channels .
Surveying the ship , which has been docked in Long Beach Harbor for nearly 42 years , Robert Sides III , president and chief executive of the project , asked , “ Can you imagine the grandeur of seeing her sail into harbor ? ”

Sides said he believes the ship is worth tens of millions of dollars , adding , “ With that money , the city could pay off its deficit and then some . ”
That kind of talk has attracted considerable attention at Long Beach City Hall , where some regard the Queen Mary -- a floating tourist complex featuring an on - board hotel , restaurants and exhibits -- as a questionable city asset .
The city bought the Queen Mary in 1967 from Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd .
But the ship and roughly 45 acres of contiguous , undeveloped oceanfront surrounding it are controlled by New York - based Garrison Investment Group under a 66 - year lease agreement .
Garrison officials declined to comment on its plans for the Queen Mary and surrounding property .

But Councilman Patrick O’Donnell , who met with Sides ’ group a month ago , said , “ I ’m not dismissing any potential revival of the ship .
“ It is clear that there is a perception that the asset is not as viable as predicted , ” he said .
“ So I ’m open to change . ”
Josh Butler , chief of staff for Councilwoman Gerrie Schipske , said , “ Everyone knows the Queen Mary is not in the condition she used to be . ”
Schipske met with Sides ’ group two weeks ago .
In an interview , Tim Cook , president and chief executive of Cairngorm , said : “ The Queen Mary is in disrepair .
She is at that stage in life when she could implode at any moment .
Instead of rivets , nuts and bolts , she is held together by crustaceans . ”

Cook said his assessment was drawn from city - sponsored surveys of the ship ’s condition conducted in 1992 , which identified numerous problems , including serious corrosion to hull plating , rivets and structures .
However , a marine engineering survey conducted at the time indicated that “ no structural failure was observed and the ship is not in imminent danger of catastrophic failure . ”
Still , there are many formidable hurdles to fulfilling what Sides , 26 , called his lifelong dream of making the Queen Mary luxurious and seaworthy again .
They include an agreement between Long Beach and Cunard prohibiting the Queen Mary from being used for trade at sea or as a commercial cruise line , according to Deputy City Atty .
Charles Parkin .

Beyond that , “ we anticipate that our tenant , Garrison , will come forward with plans of its own for improvements on the ship and on the property , ” Parkin said .
“ Therefore , I ’m not saying it is impossible for the Queen Mary to sail again , but . . . “
Cook dismissed those concerns .
“ Yes , this is a brand new venture for us , ” he said .
“ But remember , Google started out in a garage . ”

Seed balls : microcosms of the living world .
This past weekend , I made my first batch of seed balls : portable , pocket - sized seed - delivery devices commonly used in guerrilla gardening .
I loved it ; it was so satisfying just to get my hands muddy and spend a couple hours in a zen - like trance rolling seed balls …
I highly recommend the process !
Seed ball recipe
5 parts dry red clay *
3 parts dry organic compost
1 part seed **
1 – 2 parts water
I used a 16 oz plastic Solo cup as a measure , which made enough for approximately 300 seed balls .
Using 1 cup as a measure yields approximately 50 seed bombs .
Seed bomb making method
Mix all the dry ingredients together
Add enough water to form a mix that holds together without crumbling but is n’t so wet that it wo n’t roll into balls
Using a spoon or your hands , pinch off quarter - sized balls and set them aside on a tray
Use immediately , or set aside for three or four days until completely dry , then store in a porous container such as a paper bag
Ingredient notes :
* Dry red clay : Yes , this is the stuff that potters use .
Commonly it comes pre-mixed , which you do n’t want .
You want the dry powder so it can be easily mixed .
I ’ve tried using grey clay from a riverbank – it does n’t work so well .
In Greater Vancouver there is something called Red Art Clay which is available at Greenbarn Potters Supply Ltd. , 9548 – 192nd Street in Surrey ( 604-888-3411 ) .
Try asking at your local art supply store .
** Seeds :
The best seeds for making seed balls are non-invasive in your area .
Pollinator blends , native wildflower mixes , and cover crops are good options .
I opt for smaller seeds because I ’ve found that larger seeds sometimes split the seed bombs open as they dry .
For this batch I used crimson clover , white dutch clover , a BC wild flower blend , California poppy , nasturtium and cilantro .
You could also try the edible , perennial and drought - tolerant plants listed at Plants for a Future .

One of these kids is doing their own thing .

What the hell is that around his arm ?
Railroad tracks ?
Are there supposed to be tiny trains carrying all the guns this guy is bringin to the gun show ( the metaphorical gun show where the guns are his arms , and not a real gun show .
also not this comic , gunshow , even tho he is already here in the comic .
oh jesus this is too meta , im done for the night . ) ?
Having been a participant of a number of mathematical programming competitions over the years , I ’ve had to find a number of efficient ways of implementing many common Number Theoretic Functions .
In this write up , I ’m going to go over a method I ’ve found useful for easily factoring numbers using a sieving method , go over some the implementation of a few number theory functions along with time complexity analysis of each .
The cornerstone to many of these implementations relies on the ability to quickly factor integers and find primes .
One of the most popular methods of for finding primes is the Sieve of Eratosthenes .
The algorithm starts by populating a table with every positive integer from 2 to a ceiling value .
Then find the first integer not yet crossed off , in the case 2 , and eliminate every multiple of 2 from the table then return to 2 and find the next positive integer not yet crossed off and repeat the procedure until the end of the table is reached .
The method is fine and all , but a lot of really great information is lost in that computation .
Here is a sample implementation :
bool [ ] is Prime = new bool [ 400 ] ; for ( uint n = 2 ; n < is Prime .
Length ; n++) is Prime [n ] = true ; for ( uint n = 2 ; n < is Prime .
Length ; n++ ) if ( isPrime [n ] ) for ( uint m = 2 , c = 0 ; ( c = m * n ) < is Prime .
Length ; m++) is Prime[c ] = false ;
On the other hand , say we approach sieve a little differently .
Create an empty table as large as the ceiling value .
Start at 2 and for every multiple of 2 , create a record that has two parts : 2 and half of the multiple .
Return to 2 and find the next integer in the table that has yet to be recorded , in this case 3 .
For every multiple of 3 , create a record that has two parts : 3 and third of the multiple ( only if the multiple was not previously recorded .
E.g. , 6 because 2 previously recorded the record ) .
Return to 3 and find the next integer in the table that has yet to be recorded so on and so forth until every integer in the table has been recorded .
The following graphic demonstrates this process for a ceiling values of 25 .
If we wish to factor 16 , we go to 16 ’s record ( 2 , 8 ) , follow to 8 ’s record ( 2,4 ) , again follow 4 ’s record ( 2 , 2 ) and finally 2 ’s record ( 2 , λ ) .
Thus the prime factorization of 16 is 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 .
It should be apparent that this algorithm is a simple dynamic programming solution that yields two major results :
We have factored every positive integer up to a ceiling value .
We have found every positive prime integer up to a ceiling value .
And one major draw back
Uses a lot of memory as a trade off for speed .
Let ’s get into the C# implementation .
To start off , we need a record class that ’ll store the information about the first prime that divides an entry and the composite to jump to if the record corresponds to a composite .
public class Record { public uint Prime {get ; set ;} public uint ?
JumpTo {get ; set;} }
We ’ll have a class called NumberTheory and assume that it has the following structure .
If you want , you could make this a Singleton class but I felt it was unnecessary for the scope of this write up .
public class NumberTheory { private Record [ ] table ; ... }
It makes sense to put the core algorithm in the constructor and then have member methods for each of the functions we ’d like to have .
It should be assumed that for the lifetime of the class that the largest value ever called on the methods will be N otherwise an exception should be thrown by the methods ( omitted here for brevity ) .
public NumberTheory ( uint N ) { uint c = 0 ; table = new Record [ N+1 ] ; for ( uint n = 2 ; n < table .
Length ; n++) { if ( table [n ] != null ) continue ; table [ n ] = new Record ( ) { Prime = n } ; for ( uint m = 2 ; ( c = n * m ) < table .
Length ; m++) if ( table[c ] == null ) table[ c ] = new Record ( ) { JumpTo = m , Prime = n } ; } }
The time complexity of the implementation can be derived using some analysis and by having some knowledge of certain identities .
Starting from 2 there are N – 2 numbers to check of which 1/2 will be visited by the interior loop , starting from 3 there are N – 3 numbers to check of which 1/3 will be visited visited by the interior loop , so on and so forth leading to the following summation :
If we separate the summation into the harmonic series of primes ( HSP ) and prime counting function ( aggregate 1 for every prime less than n ) we get :
Asymptotically , the HSP tends towards and towards .
Giving us our final asymptotic time complexity of .
The first member method we ’ll implement is a trivial check to see if a given number is prime by checking the table ’s Record ’s JumpTo property for null .
public bool Is Prime ( uint N ) { return ! table [ N] .JumpTo.HasValue ; }
The time complexity here is a simple .
From Is Prime , we can easily implement a function that will get every single prime up to a given value by iterating over the table .
public void PrimesLessThan ( uint value , Action < uint > actOnPrime ) { for ( int n = 2 ; n < value ; n++) if ( IsPrime(n ) ) actOnPrime(n ) ; }
We can get the prime counting function but utilizing the PrimeLessThan function .
public uint CountPrimes ( uint n ) { uint count = 0 ; PrimesLessThan(n , ( p ) => { count ++;} ) ; return count ; }
Here the time complexity is the same as PrimesLessThan : .
We can get the prime factorization of a composite easily .
To do so , we simply iterate over the records until we reach a Record with no JumpTo value .
public void PrimeFactorsOf ( uint composite , Action actOnFactor ) { Record temp = table [ composite ] ; while ( temp != null ) { actOnFactor ( temp . Prime ) ; if ( temp.JumpTo.HasValue ) temp = table[ temp.JumpTo.Value ] ; else temp = null ; } }
The time complexity of this implementation relies on the the prime omega function which is the number of prime factors ( not necessarily distinct ) of n .
The function tends to .
From PrimeFactorsOf , we can also easily implement Euler ’s Totient Function – the function tells us how many positive integers less than n are coprime to n .
It is defined as :
Which essentially states that if you multiply all of the repeated prime factors of n together by all of the non-repeat prime factors – 1 of n together , you will have the result of .
public uint EulerTotient ( uint n ) { uint phi = 1 , last = 0 ; PrimeFactorsOf(n , ( p ) => { if ( p != last ) { phi *= p - 1 ; last = p ; } else { phi *= p ; } } ) ; return phi ; }
A similar function known as the Dedekind Function defined as
can be implemented in a similar way as :
public uint DedekindPsi( uint n ) { uint phi = 1 , last = 0 ; PrimeFactorsOf(n , ( p ) => { if ( p != last ) { phi *= p + 1 ; last = p ; } else { phi *= p ; } } ) ; return phi ; }
The Von Mangoldt Function is another interesting function , unfortunately I have n’t had a chance to use it , but it is trivial to implement so I will include it here for completeness .
It is defined as
public double VonMangoldt ( uint n ) { uint P = 0 ; PrimeFactorsOf(n , ( p ) => { if ( P == 0 ) { P = p ; } else if ( P != p ) { P = 1 ; } } ) ; return Math .
Log ( P ) ; }
The Möbius Function is a handy little function for determining if a number is square free or not ( among many more interesting things ) .
It is defined as :
public int MoebiusFunction ( uint N ) { if ( N == 1 ) return 1 ; bool distinct = true ; uint last = 0 , k = 0 ; PrimeFactorsOf( N , ( p ) => { if ( p == last ) { distinct = false ; } else { k++ ; last = p ; } } ) ; if ( distinct ) return ( ( k & 1 ) == 0 ) ? 1 : - 1 ; return 0 ; }
Since EulerTotient , DedekindPsi , VonMangoldt and Moebius each use PrimeFactorsOf without any additional lifting , their time complexities are the same as PrimeFactorsOf – .
The last function I ’ll implement is the Mertens Function which is simply defined as :
public int Mertens ( uint n ) { int m = 0 ; for ( uint k = 1 ; k <= n ; k++ ) m += MoebiusFunction (k ) ; return m ; }
The implementation ’s time complexity is simply .
As the advertising ice age continues killing off media dinosaurs , GigaOm 's announcement of a plan to charge $ 79 a year for premium blog content again raises the issue :
Is anybody actually willing to pay ?
Taken another way :
How much media has to die before users are willing to pay for what 's left ?
With online ad revenue at the four top portals down 3.3 percent during the first quarter , according to eMarketer , publishers are scrambling for new revenue sources .
Whether they will find them is a huge question for readers and publishers alike .
Charging for content seems so easy .
Take your best stuff and attach a price tag to it .
Rupert Murdoch , whose Wall Street Journal is one of a handful of sites successfully charging for content , has promised users " will pay handsomely " to get WSJ content on their iPhones .
Other sites , including the New York Times , have backed away from some paid content they previously offered .
Today , it takes incredible confidence to go to a mostly - paid content model , such as the one used by the WSJ .
Half - hearted attempts , such as those at the NYT , have failed .
Online publishers should prepare themselves for a massive shift toward paid content , a concurrent emphasis on protecting their content from poaching by free sites , and plan for battling those sites that remain free in hopes of grabbing people unwilling to pay for their news and other content .
The great fear is that paid sites will not be able to compete with the remaining free sites .
However , as more newspapers and magazines fail , readers will have fewer sources for information .
This should send more ad revenue to the survivors while making their content more valuable as well .
Whether consolidation will result in fewer news sources divying up enough ad revenue for each to survive seems highly questionable .
For many years , it was considered a " truth " that consumers would not be willing to pay for television programming .
That changed .
The WSJ has proven that valuable , fairly exclusive content can find paying readers .
Whether GigaOm and other blog can generate content people will pay to read and what happens to " news of the day " sites remains to be seen .
Realistically , users need to start preparing for a day when the best content will come with a price attached .
Advertising seems unlikely to carry the load of paying for the free media that it once supported .
This will have the effect , as paid content is delivered ad - free , of making customers more difficult for advertisers to reach .
At which point , free content may become more available and a balance between paid and free will be found .
Just expect more mass extinction , followed by a shift to paid content , before this occurs .

Earlier today I posted an article regarding how patent reform legislation is not certain because it is conceivable that there will not be enough votes for the bill on the floor of the Senate .
As I was writing that post the House Judiciary Committee was holding hearings on patent reform , and the hearing did not bode well for those hoping for reform .
But wait , the House held a patent reform hearing today ?
Yes , and they did not give much notice , announcing the hearing only yesterday .
So on a day Chrysler will declare bankruptcy , and the day after reports of a 6.1 % contraction of the US economy , the House held a patent reform hearing with less than 24 hours notice ?
Something is not right here !
What is going on ?
In any event , Congressman John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , reportedly started the hearing this morning by saying : “ we are not a rubber stamp for the Senate . ”
This was then echoed by Ranking Member Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) and others on the Committee .
So what does this all mean ?
It is early to tell with any certainty .
This may just be chest pounding and not wanting to be viewed as simply being willing to do whatever the Senate wants .
What is clear , however , is that if the House does not adopt the Senate version of the bill there will be no legislative patent reform in 2009 .
There will be more detailed news and analysis in the days ahead no doubt , but in the meantime here are some statements released by interested parties today .
Joint Press Release of U.S. Reps . Mike Michaud ( D - ME ) and Don Manzullo ( R - IL )
U.S. Reps . Mike Michaud ( D - ME ) and Don Manzullo ( R - IL ) , members of the House Manufacturing Caucus , expressed serious concerns with the House patent legislation , H.R. 1260 , in written testimonies presented to Chairman Conyers during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the bill today .
Michaud and Manzullo said significant improvements were needed to both the damages and post grant review provisions of the House bill .
They further suggest that the Senate Judiciary Committee language on damages is a constructive compromise , and offered ideas to fix the post grant provisions so that American innovators are not trapped in an endless loop of challenges to their intellectual property .
As members of the Congressional Manufacturing Caucus , Reps . Michaud and Manzullo are particularly sensitive to how changes in patent law could negatively impact U.S. manufacturers , leaving those companies with fewer resources for hiring workers and investing in research and development .
U.S. manufacturers face intense and myriad competitive pressures in the global market , but America has maintained a competitive advantage in intellectual property by having the strongest patent protections and the highest penalties for infringement .
“ The legislation the committee is considering today has stark consequences for companies that rely on innovation for a competitive edge , ” Manzullo said .
“ At a time when America ’s innovators , manufacturers and laborers need strong patent protection to compete internationally , the net effect of the bill will be to weaken patent protection by making patents less reliable , easier to challenge and cheaper to infringe . ”
“ During this economic downturn , it is critical we pass a patent bill that protects our manufacturing base , ” Michaud said .
“ The House legislation being considered today could result in the migration of hundreds of thousands of high skill , high paying manufacturing jobs overseas .
I sincerely hope we can work with the committee to strengthen the bill . ”
After careful analysis of H.R. 1260 , Michaud and Manzullo recommend that the House adopt the Senate Judiciary Committee compromises that resolved controversial differences on damages and prior art .
Regarding post grant review , they also encouraged the Committee to include : • an appropriate threshold for initiating administrative proceedings ,
• a presumption of validity in those proceedings so the challenger has the burden of establishing invalidity rather than requiring a patent holder to re-establish the validity already verified in the application process ,
• strong estoppel provisions to avoid serial challenges of the same patent by the same infringer or a group of infringers , and
• a clear time - line for concluding administrative challenges .
Without these changes , Michaud and Manzullo said , “ The patent reform bill will increase the length of patent pendency , reduce patent certainty and undermine U.S. innovation and job creation . ”

HARDIN , Montana ( CNN ) --
The tiny town of Hardin , Montana , is offering an answer to a very thorny question :
Where should the nation put terror detainees if the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , is shut down by the end of the year as President Obama has pledged ?
Hardin , Montana , says the Two Rivers Regional Detention Facility should be used for Gitmo detainees .
Hardin , population 3,400 , sits in the southeast corner of Montana , in the state 's poorest county .
Its small downtown is almost deserted at midday .
The Dollar Store is going out of business .
The Hardin Mini Mall is already shut .
The town needs jobs -- and fast .
Hardin borrowed $ 27 million through bonds to build the Two Rivers Regional Correctional Facility in hopes of creating new employment opportunities .
The jail was ready for prisoners two years ago , but has yet to house a single prisoner .
People here say politics in the capital of Helena has kept it empty .
But the city council last month voted 5 - 0 to back a proposal to bring Gitmo detainees -- some of the most hardened terrorists in the world -- to the facility .
Watch town 's fight to be Gitmo West »
" It would bring jobs .
Believe it or not , it would even bring hope and opportunity , " Greg Smith , Hardin 's economic development director , told CNN .
But a decision on whether it becomes a reality is a long way off .
The state 's congressional leaders have lined up against the plan .
" Housing potential terrorists in Montana is not good for our state , " Max Baucus , the state 's senior Democratic senator , wrote to Smith .
" These people stop at nothing .
Their primary goal in life , and death , is to destroy America . "
Adds Sen. Jon Tester , " I just do n't think it 's appropriate , that 's all .
I do n't think they know what they 're asking for . "
On North Central Avenue in downtown Hardin , opinion is mixed .
See where Hardin is located »
Darlene McMillen says if the detainees move in , she is moving out .
A part - time waitress at a Hardin restaurant , McMillen says her opinion is based on her son's experiences serving in the military in Afghanistan .
" He said the people have no respect for any human life , even their own . "
Manicurist Donovan Lindsay says bringing the detainees to Hardin would bring more law enforcement , and that would make the town safer .
She also believes it would generate jobs .
" We are the poorest county in the state of Montana and we need all the help we can get , " she says .
The 464 - bed facility is state of the the art .
Yet scores of surveillance cameras are n't powered up .
A magnetometer near the front door is n't even plugged in .
It 's simply waiting for its intended use .
Bright orange prison jump suits emblazoned with the words " Two Rivers " are stacked in a storage room along with shoes , towels , blankets , even razors and underwear , for prisoners .
Another room contains riot helmets , gas masks , batons , shields , and guns for guards .
Greg Smith says , " We got rooms full of this stuff .
It just sits there ready to go . "
The prison has single , double , and dorm - style cells , but Smith says it could be modified to keep detainees separated from one another .
He says because only terror detainees would be housed here , it would eliminate any risk that they would radicalize others .
He also says the facility could accommodate special dietary and religious needs .
Inside the facility , he motions around a large dormitory - style room filled with empty bunk beds .
" It 's big enough you probably could build a mosque in one of these , " Smith says .
Although the facility was intended to be used as a medium - security prison , Smith says it meets maximum - security criteria .
Smith , a military veteran , does n't have corrections experience , but challenges anyone who doubts the security at Two Rivers .
He says he'd be glad to lock the doubters up to test it .
" We will give them three days and I 'll buy the coffee in the coffee shop if they can get out .
I 'd be happy . "
Glyn Perkins agrees on that score .
He worked for eight years in maximum security prisons in Texas and says Two Rivers is the most secure facility he has ever been in .
Perkins and his wife , Rae , moved to Hardin to take jobs at Two Rivers , but they got laid off earlier this year because there still were no prisoners .
Although holding Gitmo detainees here might mean they would get their jobs back , they do n't want to see it happen .
Despite their confidence in the security of the prison , they worry about the community and their three children .
" I do n't agree with it because it is five blocks from city hall , " says Glyn Perkins .
His wife chimes in , " Yeah , and 11 blocks from the school , and to me that is just a little scary . "
" Bottom line , " she said , " I really do n't want Gitmo in my backyard . "
If the federal government were to move detainees here , it would decide who would run the prison and how it would be staffed .
The Perkinses are skeptical that the federal government would offer many jobs to the people of Hardin .
Rae Perkins does n't think very many of the city 's unemployed would be qualified .
" I have n't met anyone in Hardin that speaks Arabic , " she said .
But Greg Smith thinks the prison would generate business for gas stations , restaurants , and other local enterprises , giving the entire region an economic boost .
And , he says , it would benefit the country .
If Obama closes Guantanamo in January as pledged , Smith maintains Hardin would be a safe place to keep the detainees that nobody else wants .
Obama last week defended his plan to shutter the military detention center at Guantanamo , saying it has become a " rallying cry for our enemies . "
The Senate and House have both passed measures that would prevent the detainees from being transferred to the United States .
Smith voices disdain for members of Congress who supported closing Guantanamo but now oppose putting its prisoners in the U.S .
" All of the senators are running for the hills , and all of the representatives .
So we really are nowhere except we 've got a town that says , ' We have the place and we have the will . ' "
He is waiting for Washington to call .
CNN 's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .

How Do Bats Land ?
Well ,
That 's Complicated ...
People have always been fascinated by bats , but mostly in their erratic flying and their bizarre habit of sleeping upside down .
But landing with bad eyesight is not so easy either and a research team is the first to document the landing approaches of three species of bats — two that live in caves and one that roosts in trees .
What they found was that bats landing are like people parallel parking their cars ; we recognize it , but they do n't all do it the same way .
Using sophisticated motion capture cameras in a special flight enclosure , the team filmed each species of bat as it swooped toward a latticed landing pad and landed on it .
Cynopterus brachyotis , a tree - roosting bat common in tropical parts of southeast Asia , executed a half - backflip as it swooped upward to the landing site , landing as its hind legs and thumbs touched the pad simultaneously — a four - point landing , the group observed .
The landing is hard , said Daniel Riskin , a postdoctoral researcher in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at Brown and lead author on a paper published in the Journal of Experimental Biology , with an impact force more than four times the species ' body weight .
A Brown University - led research team for the first time has caught on film how bats land .
Their findings were surprising : tree - roosting bats execute a different landing maneuver than cave - dwelling species .

The team then turned its attention to two cave - roosting species , Carollia perspicillata and Glossophaga soricina .
These bats , common in Central and South America , approach their landing target with a vertical pitch and then , at the last instant , yaw to the left or to the right — executing a cartwheel of sorts — before grasping the landing pad with just their hind legs .
The two - point landing is much gentler than the impact force exerted by the tree - roosting bats , the researchers observed ; the cave - roosting bats have a landing impact force of just one - third of their body weight .
There are about 1,200 recognized bat species worldwide , so Riskin was cautious about not drawing any grand conclusions .
Still , he said , the fact that the team has documented that bats land differently could open new insights into a species that makes up roughly one - fifth of all mammals on earth .
" It 's opening the door to how bats evolved , " Riskin said .
" You can say that bats have been hanging upside down since they first evolved , and it has probably been one of the keys to their worldwide success . "
Other Brown researchers who worked on the paper include Sharon Swartz , associate professor of biology ; Tatjana Hubel , a postdoctoral researcher ; and Joseph Bahlman , a graduate student .
John Ratcliffe , a biologist at the University of Southern Denmark , and Thomas Kunz , a biologist at Boston University , contributed to the paper .
The research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation , The U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research , Sigma Xi in the United States , The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada , and the Danish Natural Sciences Research Council .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Japanese researchers said on Sunday they had grown normal - looking teeth from single cells in lab dishes , and transplanted them into mice .

They used primitive cells , not quite as early as stem cells , and injected them into a framework of collagen , the material that holds the body together .
After growing them , they found their structures had matured into the components that make teeth , including dentin , enamel , dental pulp , blood vessels , and periodontal ligaments .
They were “ arranged appropriately when compared with a natural tooth , ” the researchers reported in the journal Nature Methods .
The teeth grew and developed normally when transplanted into a mouse , said Takashi Tsuji of the Tokyo University of Science in Chiba , Japan and colleagues .
They said their method was the first to show an entire organ could be replaced using just a few cells .
“ To restore the partial loss of organ function , stem cell transplantation therapies have been developed , ” they wrote .
“ The ultimate goal of regenerative therapy , however , is to develop fully functioning bioengineered organs that can replace lost or damaged organs after disease , injury or aging . ”
The researchers went after the “ organ germ ” -- the early cells made using partially differentiated cells known as epithelial and mesenchymal cells .
In this case the cells were taken from what is known as the tooth germ , the little bud that appears before an animal grows a tooth .
“ Our reconstituted tooth germ generates a complete and entirely bioengineered tooth , ” they wrote .
“ This study thus provides the first evidence of a successful reconstitution of an entire organ via the transplantation of bioengineered material , ” they added .
“ Our present findings should also encourage the future development of organ replacement by regenerative therapy . ”
Build a news site with Rubyflow
Listen to this article
Ruby journalist extraordinaire , Peter Cooper , is a busy man .
Chances are you ’re already following his work to bring you the latest Ruby news on sites such as Ruby Inside and RubyFlow .
Late last year he even added a tremendously useful site oriented towards iPhone and iPod Touch development called Mobile Orchard .
Somewhere along the line he was also generous enough to leak the source code for Rubyflow , and now a version of that is available through Sutto ’s Github repository .
That ’s great news for anyone looking to start their own news site , especially since it ’s a breeze to get working on Heroku .
Start by cloning the source from Github :
$ git clone git://github.com/Sutto/rubyflow.git
Rubyflow depends the thoughtbot - factorygirl gem , so next we ’ll make sure to install that and unpack it in vendor / gems :
$ rake gems : install $ rake gems : unpack
I also found that the captcha used in Rubyflow ’s user registration requires “ digest / sha1 ” to be required explicitly , so go ahead and add
require ' digest/sha1 '
at the bottom of config / environment.rb .
Once you ’ve done that it ’s time to commit our changes to git :
$ git add .
$ git commit -m " vendored gems and required digest / sha1 "
With that out of the way , it ’s time to create an app on Heroku and deploy to it :
$ cd rubyflow $ heroku create Created http://high-fire-37.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com :high-fire-37.git
Added git remote heroku $ git push heroku master ...
App deployed to Heroku .
Finally , we run migrations to set up the application database :
$ heroku rake db: migrate
… and there you have it !
Be sure to read the docs on site configuration and customization here .
Enjoy !
Vaughan of Mind Hacks came across a paper about a 23 - year - old woman who was mountain climbing and got struck by lightning ( a " bolt from the blue " in a sky that was " clear and sunny " ) .
Upon waking from a three - day - long medically - induced coma , she experienced a series of hyperreal hallucinations that remind me of drawings from one of R. Crumb 's sketchbooks .
These exclusively visual sensations consisted of unknown people , animals and objects acting in different scenes , like a movie .
None of the persons or scenes was familiar to her and she was severely frightened by their occurrence .
For example , an old lady was sitting on a ribbed radiator , then becoming thinner and thinner , and finally vanishing through the slots of the radiator .
Later , on her left side a cowboy riding on a horse came from the distance .
As he approached her , he tried to shoot her , making her feel defenceless because she could not move or shout for help .
In another scene , two male doctors , one fair and one dark haired , and a woman , all with strange metal glasses and unnatural brownish - red faces , were tanning in front of a sunbed , then having sexual intercourse and afterwards trying to draw blood from her .
These formed hallucinations , partially with delusional character , were in the whole visual field and constantly present for approximately 20 h .
At the time of appearance , the patient was not sure whether they were real or unreal , but did not report them for fear that she might be considered insane .

Sen .
Whitehouse ( D - RI ) was just interviewed on MSNBC and he talked about the new reports that Vice President Cheney tried to get the Iraq WMD investigators — after the invasion — to waterboard an Iraqi intelligence official to try to pump him for information about Saddam ’s alleged alliance with al Qaida .
Whitehouse noted that this would dramatically change the legal terms of the question since even the notorious OLC memos allow practices like waterboarding to avoid imminent threats to the US .
But waterboarding this Iraqi guy about Saddam ’s relationship with al Qaida — after the invasion — would have been to get political information , proof of the purported but then largely discredited rationale for the war .
( Also worth noting is that an Iraqi intelligence official captured during the invasion would , I think , very clearly be an old fashioned POW . )
More and more the timeline is raising the question of why , if the torture was to prevent terrorist attacks , it seemed to happen mainly during the period when we were looking for what was essentially political information to justify the invasion of Iraq .
Here are Sen. Whitehouse ’s ( D - RI ) appearances on the topic this afternoon on CNN and MSNBC .
I can only imagine that a number of people looked at the lineup , looked at my inclusion , and thought " What 's that guy doing up there ? "
So here 's the background on that .
When I was working at the ConocoPhillips Refinery in Billings , Montana , we followed the weekly release of the EIA 's Weekly Petroleum Status Report very closely .
We included this information in a weekly supply / demand report , and it helped us to make decisions on how to run the refinery for the upcoming week .
This was the panel I had been asked to participate in .
My fellow panelists were Steven Mufson ( one of my favorite mainstream energy reporters ) , from the Washington Post ; Eric Pooley from Harvard , ( the former managing editor of Fortune ) ; and Barbara Hagenbaugh from USA Today .
The panel was moderated by John Anderson of Resources for the Future .
When I started my blog , I began to follow and report on the weekly inventory release , which happens on Wednesday mornings and is followed in the afternoon by This Week in Petroleum .
Professor Goose liked the weekly reports and asked me to bring them over here to The Oil Drum .
This all helped drive more traffic to the EIA website , and helped more people come to appreciate the value of the EIA data .
Doug MacIntyre , at that time the primary author of This Week In Petroleum , started commenting occasionally on my blog , and was quick to answer any questions that readers had .
Over time I corresponded with several people at the EIA , and they invited me up to the conference last year .
The timing did n't work out last year as I was in the Netherlands , but this year 's conference was doable .
So that 's how I ended up on a panel with the mainstream media .
The panel consisted of us all sitting around a table and taking questions from John , and eventually the audience .
I will mostly report on what I said , because it was pretty difficult to take notes while sitting around the table .
The first question was on the price run-up last summer , and whether the media coverage was adequate .
We all had somewhat different answers on this , but I took the opportunity to point out that the weekly inventory data can be an important predictor of prices .
The plunging gasoline inventory data was the basis of my predictions for $ 3 and $ 4 gasoline in the Spring of 2007 and 2008 respectively ( which we did in fact see ) .
The other thing I pointed out about this issue is that Google searches on " rising oil / gas prices " probably drive more first - time traffic to my blog than anything else .
( Searches for the " water car " are also quite popular ) .
Next John asked about phony , or false balance in reporting .
Before the panel , I had asked readers at my blog and at The Oil Drum for suggestions on topics to cover , and false balance was mentioned by several readers .
An example one reader gave was " Scientists report that the earth is round - Flat Earth Institute objects ... "
So how much credibility do you afford different sides of the debate ?
The others on the panel agreed that this was a problem .
I made two observations .
One , it is n't always easy to figure out which side is the Flat Earth Institute .
I spend a lot of time trying to figure that out at times , especially over newly announced technologies .
Second , the good reporters do a lot of research when they are reporting on a story so they can determine who is credible .
I noted that Steve Mufson had interviewed me by phone in 2005 , and all that came from that hour - long interview was a partial quote in the story .
At the time I was annoyed , but later on I came to understand that Mufson was just doing a lot of homework to get the story .
Most of his questions were designed to figure out if I knew what I was talking about .
The people you have to watch are the ones who call for just a quote .
As an example of false balance , I talked about Brazilian ethanol .
Dan Rather and Frank Sesno have both been guilty on their Brazilian ethanol reporting .
In hindsight , perhaps their reporting was n't false balance so much as completely unbalanced , and lacking any semblance of critical reporting .
They both essentially reported the Brazilian ethanol story as " They did it .
We can be just like them . "
I went on to explain a bit more about the truth of Brazil 's energy independence miracle , which I will update in an upcoming essay ( but is also covered in my ASPO presentation from last September ( Biofuels : Facts and Fallacies ) .
There was more discussion about scale ( e.g. , biofuel versus petroleum usage ) and the role bloggers are playing now with respect to reporting news ( some specialist bloggers can provide a technical analysis that the mainstream media may lack ; on the other hand they do n't always write to journalistic standards ) .
I know I am forgetting some topics , but ultimately John started to take questions .
There were some good questions , but also some instances where the questioner simply wanted to make a point .
Morgan Downey asked what energy books I liked .
I told him that I was about 250 pages into his book , Oil 101 , and that it was a fantastic book .
I also mentioned Twilight in the Desert as an influential book on me .
I noted that while I had some issues with Twilight , I thought it did a great job of driving home the importance of Saudi Arabia in the world oil picture , and just how important it is that we understand what 's going on there .
Finally , I mentioned Gusher of Lies as a book I had really enjoyed .
I was asked about peak oil and the notion that we are running out of oil .
I took the opportunity to clarify that peak oil does not mean we are running out of oil - but the media often misconstrues the issue in this manner .
I said that we would still have oil in 100 years .
Peak oil means that we can't get it out of the ground fast enough to meet demand , and that if the production peak is near that we are facing some difficult years .
( Other than this question and my answer , there was scarce mention of peak oil during the conference ) .
A representative from ( I believe ) the California Independent Petroleum Association got up and made a statement that he felt that despite the important role the industry plays , they are being demonized and singled out for punitive taxes .
I responded that I could empathize ; that one of my greatest concerns is that we will discourage domestic oil and gas production , and then biofuels fail to deliver per expectations .
In that case I think we become even more dependent upon OPEC .
Fellow panelist Eric Pooley disagreed and said we need even stronger incentives for moving away from oil .
That really misses the point I was making , though .
You can have the strongest incentives in the world , but they can't assure that technology breakthroughs will occur .
So while you are promoting one industry at the expense of another , very successful industry that plays a critical role in the world , what is the contingency plan if the incentives do n't pay off ?
As far as I can see our contingency will be to go , hat in hand to oil exporters and plead for more oil .
( The last thing we will do is ask people to make do with less ) .
I was asked about how I come up with ideas for what to write .
I said that I browse the news headlines on energy every morning , and that I have Google news alerts on topics like " energy " , " oil prices " , and " peak oil . "
( Hat tip to Leanan for that bit of advice about a year ago ) .
If something strikes me as particularly interesting - or particularly wrong - then I may write something about it .
After the panel , a number of people came up and introduced themselves .
Some thanked me for speaking up on behalf of the oil and gas industry .
One audience member asked me why I do n't write more about " the global warming scam . "
As I said to him " I am not touching that with a 10 - foot pole . "
He asked why , and I said 1 ) .
I am not an expert ; 2 ) .
Discussions over the issue always seem to degenerate into name - calling .
I will repeat my position on this .
Coming from a science background , I have a healthy respect for scientific consensus in areas where I do n't have specific expertise .
On the other hand , the issue has become so polarized that people who do try to discuss the science are frequently shouted down and called names .
I do n't endorse those sorts of tactics , no matter how correct you think you might be .
Investing in Oil and Natural Gas - Opportunities and Barriers
Once again , there were two sessions going on simultaneously that I wanted to see .
I had to miss Greenhouse Gas Emissions : What 's Next ?
But I have been a big fan of Deutsche Bank 's Paul Sankey for several years , and I was n't about to miss his panel .
Sankey has testified before Congress several times on the oil and gas markets , and I often feel like he is the only one there who knows what he is talking about .
( I formerly summarized one of his appearances in Gouging is an Idiotic Explanation ) .
Joining Sankey on the panel were Susan Farrell of PFC Energy , John Felmy of the American Petroleum Institute , and Michelle Foss of the University of Texas .
The moderator was Bruce Bawks of the EIA .
The panel agreed that $ 50 was about the average cost of oil production today , suggesting that prices are unlikely to fall below that level for long .
Farrell commented that worldwide expenditures on exploration and production amounted to $ 500 billion in 2008 .
She also noted that oil companies have been unable to arrest the decline rate ; that it is in fact increasing .
I believe it was also Farrell who suggested that in 2010 the haves would acquire more of the ' have - nots . '
Someone on the panel stated that the global supply crunch still exists .
I think it was Felmy who said that even if we make a large scale move to hybrids or electric vehicles , 50 % of the world 's lithium reserves are in Bolivia .
So we may end up trading Chavez for Evo Morales .
I do n't know ; I think I would make that trade .
As always , Sankey made a lot of interesting comments .
He said that while the banks might make a lot of money in a cap and trade system , intellectually it did n't seem like a good idea to him .
He said he preferred a direct carbon tax .
He said that we are setting up a slingshot for prices right now , but " 2010 could be a bloodbath . "
He also said that the overall policy imperative of the new administration seems to be " anything but oil " , but he believes that " attacking the oil and gas industry will be incredibly harmful to the U.S. economy . "
Other Sankey zingers :
" Alaska would rate as one of the ' countries ' most hostile to the U.S. oil industry . "
" I am not sure there is any equity in any bank in the U.S. "
" If we stopped producing gold tomorrow , we have 100 years of supply in inventory .
If we stopped producing oil tomorrow , we have 55 days in inventory . "
Finally , someone on the panel ( I think it was Sankey ) recommended the book Oil on the Brain as providing great insight into the industry .
The author , Lisa Margonelli , had a pretty typical view of the industry until she delved deeply into the supply chain , traveling to Iran , Nigeria , Chad , and Venezuela .
I have not read the book , but will put it on my reading list .
Thus ends my recollections of the conference .
As I said in the previous entry , this is not so much a detailed account of everything as it is just my own observations and things that stuck with me as interesting , odd , etc .
If you spot something that you think is in error , please let me know .
For me , this was an interesting experience , and one that I was glad to be a part of .
In conclusion , I want to thank the good people at the EIA for inviting me .

Michael Bennet , the appointed one - term Colorado reactionary who belongs on the other side of the chamber .
Early this morning we started the conversation about how pathetic it is that Harry Reid can't pass any legislation to protect consumers from predatory banksters .
Obama was good on TV today denouncing the sleazy speculators who forced Chrysler into bankruptcy buthas to get putative Democratic senators to remember that they work for their constituents , not their campaign donors .
Before we get into the cramdown foreclosure catastrophe that went down in the Senate today , let 's take a look at the votes in the House on Carolyn Maloney 's Credit Card Bill of Rights .
In the end , it passed 357- 70 , 105 Republicans joining every Democrat but South Dakota bribe - taking Blue Dog Stephanie Herseth Sandlin ( who was also the only Democrat to vote " no " last year ) .
On the Republican side , only the worst of the obstructionists and briber takers voted against the bill , 70 of them .
The dozen ring - leaders who worked the hardest to sabotage the bill and would rather see Americans screwed by unscrupulous credit card companies than save their own constituents from predators are all owned lock , stock and barrel by the banksters :
Yes , the amounts in parenthesis are the legalized bribes each of these members has taken from the banksters directly ( not counting lobbying ) .
Earlier there was an attempt to kill the bill ( a motion to recommit ) by the Republicans and it failed 164-263 , only 16 Republicans voting with the Democrats -- and 5 Chamber of Commerce Democrats voting with the GOP .
Tom Perriello ( D - VA ) explained why this was such an important vote for him and his constituents in central and southern Virginia :
“ The movement for accountability scored a victory today against the tricks , traps and usurious greed in the credit card industry .
If they can't sell the product without using traps , that 's a good time for consumer protection .
This bill and my amendment put in place commonsense regulations that will protect all consumers , but especially college students who are disproportionately targeted .
” If -- and this is a BIG if -- the bill passes the Senate , it would ban retroactive interest rate hikes on existing balances ( except when payments are more than 30 days late ) , ban double - cycle billing , and ban due - date gimmicks .
Specifically , it protects cardholders against arbitrary interest rate increases , and empowers them to set limits on their credit and requires card companies to fairly credit and allocate payments .
It also prohibits charging fees just to pay a bill by phone , charging over - the - limit fees unless a consumer opts - in in advance or issuing credits cards to minors .
Good job , Nancy Pelosi and her team for getting this through with flying colors .
Ultimately , though , it does n't matter .
As Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) explained yesterday , too many senators are so beholden to the banksters that they will never make a move against them -- not even if millions of their constituents are starving and homeless .
The Democrats ' poor excuse for a leader , Harry Reid ( D - NV ) moaned and groaned about the de facto " Republican filibuster , " but it was a handful of his own reactionary and bribe - besotted members who killed the bill that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to intervene with intransigent banksters and keep families in their homes .
It seems beyond belief to me that Democrat would vote against this , except , of course , a fake Democrat like Arlen Specter , who so far is still voting with his right - wing colleagues on the other side of the aisle .
But Specter was hardly the only Democrat on that side of the aisle for this vote ( just the one who 's taken the most bribes from the banksters : $ 5,753,310 -- which failed 45 - 51 Of course every single Republican voted against consumers and for their bankster buddies .
The Democrats who joined them were a motley array of anti-family conservatives ( in order of corruptness ) : Dick Durbin lectures his corrupt , shameless colleagues : " At some point , the senators in this chamber will decide the bankers should n't write the agenda for the United States Senate .
At some point the people in this chamber will decide the people we represent are not the folks working in the big banks but the folks working to make a living and struggling to keep a decent home . "

Although most iPhone users seem satisfied with the smorgasbord of applications delivered by Apple 's iPhone App Store , power users yearn for more .
Copy and paste , video recording and streaming , Internet tethering , and content search are just a few features third - party developers have already delivered to users hungry enough to " jailbreak " their iPhones .
And though Apple 's forthcoming 3.0 firmware update promises to deliver some power - use upgrades , jailbreaking should continue to push the iPhone 's productivity envelope , especially as users increasingly demand the Holy Grail of smartphone power use : applications that run in the background .
Jailbreaking : Inside Apple 's lock - down agenda
To date , the only way to satisfy yearnings for UI improvements such as copy - and - paste and to access locked - down iPhone features like video recording and streaming , Internet tethering , GPS , and content searching has been to " jailbreak " your iPhone , a process that liberates the device from Apple 's tightly controlled App Store , allowing you to install powerful software from a variety of third parties .
Jailbreaking also can enable you to unlock your iPhone from Apple 's exclusive AT&T wireless service contract , leaving you free to use other providers ' networks worldwide .
[ Read InfoWorld blogger Bill Snyder 's call to free the iPhone | View InfoWorld 's best business app picks that do n't require jailbreaking and the 21 apps Apple does n't want you to run on your iPhone ]
Apple 's opposition to the features power users seek is no secret .
Apple claims these features will unacceptably reduce battery life , slow performance , and place an undue burden on Apple 's iPhone support infrastructure .
Apple routinely blocks apps it does n't like from its store , often for inscrutable reasons that some developers attribute to competitive motives rather than concern for iPhone users ' productivity .
Despite its formal opposition , Apple has done little to crack down on consumers who jailbreak their phones , beyond instituting half - hearted firmware changes that jailbreak developers easily circumvent .
The legal status of jailbreaking , however , is not yet settled .
Apple claims it is illegal under the much maligned Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
But major movers in the technology legal arena call Apple 's restrictions both harmful to innovation and an improper application of DMCA rules .
Open source browser developer Mozilla joined the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) in requesting an exemption to the DMCA specifically clarifying that installation of legal apps on cell phones does not infringe the phone manufacturer 's copyright .
Worse , iPhone users belatedly discovered that Apple can reach out and delete applications from their phones .
Developers : Jailbreaking spurs Apple innovation
Jailbreaking began with the first - generation iPhone , under the auspices of a band of volunteer programmers called the iPhone Dev Team , which created the first application installer long before Apple launched its iPhone App Store less than a year ago .
That installer , named Installer , enabled users to download apps from a variety of repositories at a time when Apple limited customers to the apps it delivered with the phone .
Some question whether Apple would have created its own store without the impetus of the rogue Installer .
Apple 's App Store has since become a huge success , and analysts agree it is the single differentiator most responsible for continued growth in iPhone sales , enriching both Apple and third - party developers .
But Apple 's confusing policies on " acceptable " applications continue to rile developers who labor for months over complex apps only to have Apple reject them for nondescript reasons .
Rebuffed developers like Alex Sokirynsky , whose app podcaster got bounced by Apple , tried an end run by delivering their apps via the iPhone SDK distribution channel .
But Apple quickly blocked this trick .
Then last month Jay Freeman , creator of the popular open source Cydia iPhone installer ( " Cydia " refers to a moth larva often considered the " worm in the apple " ) , announced his own Cydia Store in direct competition with Apple 's store .
Cydia
Store collects the same 30 percent commission from developers , but has few if any restrictions to the applications developers can sell .
" Cydia Store gives users a way to get the powerful applications they want but that Apple does n't seem to want them to have .
And it lets developers reap the rewards of their work without worrying about a last - minute slap - down by Apple , " says Freeman , who considers many of Apple 's iPhone innovations , including Apple 's App Store , to be a direct result of iPhone developer activism .
" Without this pressure from developers and users , the iPhone would n't be what it is today . "
Jailbreaking unlocks many latent iPhone capabilities
Power users are n't necessarily looking for geeky developer - type add - ons to their iPhones , just genuinely useful productivity apps and features .
The single most desired feature is copy and paste , a seemingly obvious interface perk that , until iPhone OS 3.0 arrives this summer , Apple has inexplicably blocked .
Users also want features that other smartphones offer but that Apple eschews : video recording , multimedia messaging , file sharing , and interface customization using skins and themes .
And it was to fill this void that Freeman opened Cydia Store with Cyntact , an app he developed to display profile pictures alongside iPhone contact listings .
The second app for sale on Cydia Store , the Okori Group 's Voicemail Forwarder , extended the iPhone 's visual voice mail with a feature business users enjoy on other phones and covet for the iPhone : the ability to forward voice mail to e-mail .
As for video recording , Freeman 's Cycorder turns the iPhone into a camcorder .
As with Apple 's App Store , some Cydia Store apps are available for free .
NetaTalk , for example , lets you mount the iPhone 's disk over Wi-Fi as a file share under Mac OS X .
Some jailbreak - enabled features run afoul of Apple 's relationships with business partners .
For example , tethering an iPhone to a notebook or desktop computer to enable the computer to surf the Web via AT&T's EDGE and 3G networks violates AT&T 's policy for iPhones .
When iPhone developer NullRiver posted its NetShare app on Apple 's store last summer , Apple quickly yanked it once its tethering capabilities became popular .
Confusingly , AT&T offers tethering as a $ 15 - per- month add - on for LG , Motorola , Nokia , RIM , and other handsets .
But not the iPhone -- AT&T 's terms for that handset specifically forbid tethering on the device .
Further impeding developers ' ability to serve the kind of functionality iPhone power users want is Apple 's SDK itself .
The tool , and its restrictive user agreement , corrals developers into a tightly controlled sandbox that makes some applications impossible .
For instance , Veency is a VNC ( virtual network computing ) server that runs on the iPhone , allowing you to manipulate the phone 's interface directly on a computer desktop -- a boon for massive text - entry tasks .
But because Apple 's SDK prohibits server apps , the Cydia Store is the only source for Veency .
TV - Out lets you transmit live video from the iPhone camera to a TV or DVD recorder via a standard video cable ; Apple 's SDK only lets you send still pictures and iPod or YouTube videos to TV .
SwirlySMS sends and receives rich - content SMS , another capability restricted by the SDK .
Searcher lets you scan all iPhone contents -- SMS , contacts , notes , events , bookmarks , and other files -- for any string .
Apple SDK apps do n't have access to global phone contents .
Background apps : The Holy Grail of power use
Jailbreak apps circumvent hardware and software restrictions that Apple says ensure a consistent , responsive user interface and optimal battery endurance .
In particular , jailbroken phones can run apps in the background , a capability Apple reserves for its own apps but prohibits in third - party programs .
Freeman , however , believes a free - market approach is the best way to satisfy power users ' demands for features without compromising the performance of their iPhones .
" Apple should let users , and the marketplace , decide what apps are too strenuous for the iPhone 's performance and battery life , " he says , pointing out the Cydia Store app FindMyi as an example .
The app runs in the background and wakes up every few minutes to sense and transmit the iPhone 's location to a tracking site .
Users can then track their phones via GPS or cell site triangulation by subscribing to the FindMyi service for a monthly fee .
The app locks the iPhone if the user reports it stolen .
The app's developer claims its tracking activities are not battery - intensive and do n't seriously reduce battery endurance .
Apple recently announced a 3.0 firmware upgrade for the iPhone that delivers some capabilities currently unique to jailbroken phones .
Available this summer , the update sports cut and paste , Spotlight global search , the ability to forward SMS and voice mail , and MMS capabilities .
These coincide with some jailbreak capabilities , but do n't provide others , such as background processing , video recording and streaming , and direct video output .
Ironically , some 3.0 features , such as Wi-Fi hotspot auto - login , contradict Apple 's former concerns over battery life .
Interestingly , Apple 's beta 3.0 firmware -- made available to registered developers -- supports tethering , although there is no word from Apple on that capability making it into the final release .
The iPhone Dev Team also announced successfully jailbreaking the 3.0 firmware beta .
Apple could still complicate jailbreaking when 3.0 ships , but if history is any guide , the iPhone Dev Team members will readily crack that code as well .
The bottom line on iPhone development
Although Apple 's iPhone store came in like a lion , months later its success has made it difficult for app developers to stand out from the herd .
The store 's 25,000 apps are virtually impossible to browse in toto , especially on the iPhone 's tiny screen .
Apple ranks applications by popularity and features some applications on a rotating basis , but the process is not transparent , and the huge number of apps mean many will never be highlighted .
Not surprisingly , Apple and third parties are seeking other revenue models .
Both Apple and Cydia have turned to advertising for additional revenue .
Cydia and Apple host ads in their storefront interfaces , while developers for either store can choose to have ads injected into their applications at runtime .
App developers can incorporate their own advertising , using ad aggregators like AdMob , who reported the iPhone as its No. 1 ad platform in February , accounting for half the Web traffic from all U.S. smartphones .
i Phone traffic was more than double the BlackBerry 's 21 percent .
Nokia still leads wordwide handset advertising , with a 43 percent share vs. iPhone 's 33 percent .
As conspicuous consumers , Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch audience are highly sought .
But current iPhone App Store limitations make it tough for app developers to deliver the unique capabilities that could give them the visibility to tap into this market .
Background applications , despite their performance and battery life concerns , are one of the best paths to innovative applications .
A perfect example is AwareSpot , a cross- platform app that alerts drivers to major traffic problems that runs on virtually every smartphone except the iPhone .
Given Apple 's App
Store overcrowding , it seems likely that jailbroken phones and app venues like Cydia Store will continue to be popular with iPhone customers , even after the 3.0 firmware ships .

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - A Saudi man has divorced his wife by text message , a newspaper said Thursday .
The man was in Iraq when he sent the SMS informing her she was no longer his spouse .
He followed up with a telephone call to two of his relatives , the daily Arab News reported .
A court in the Red Sea city of Jeddah finalized the split -- the first known divorce in Saudi Arabia by text message -- after summoning the two relatives to check they had received word of the husband ’s intention , the paper said .
Saudi Arabia practices a strict form of Islamic Sharia law , and clerics preside over Sharia courts as judges .
Under the law a man can divorce his wife by saying “ I divorce you ” three times .
The Saudi man was in Iraq to participate in “ what he described as ‘ jihad ’ , ” according to the Arab News .
Many Saudis have gone to fight with al Qaeda militants against the Iraqi government and U.S. forces .

MINNEAPOLIS , April 13 ( UPI ) --
A three - judge panel ruled Monday that Democrat Al Franken defeated Republican Norm Coleman in Minnesota 's 2008 U.S. Senate race .
However , the legal fight may not be over since Coleman has indicated his intent to take the matter to the Minnesota Supreme Court and supporters have urged him go to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary .

Judges Elizabeth Hayden of Stearns County , Kurt Marben of Pennington County and Denise Reilly of Hennepin County all agreed Coleman lost the seat he had held the previous six years , the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Monday .
" Franken received the highest number of legally cast ballots in the Nov. 4 , 2008 , general election for U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and is entitled to receive the election certificate , " the judges wrote .
The initial vote count showed Coleman leading by 215 votes but an official recount gave Franken a 225 - vote edge .
That margin grew to 312 after Coleman contested the recount and more absentee ballots were allowed to be counted .
While further appeals are possible , Larry Jacobs , a University of Minnesota political science professor , said going to federal court would be a " scorched - earth " strategy with little chance of success , the Star Tribune reported .
If Coleman goes that route , the U.S. Supreme Court could spend months deliberating whether to accept the case , Richard Hasen , an election law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles told the Minneapolis newspaper .

House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , and Immigration Subcommittee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren ( D - Calif . ) , Constitution Subcommittee Chairman Jerrold Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) , and Crime Subcommittee Chairman Bobby Scott ( D - Va. ) called on Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to investigate allegations of misconduct by Maricopa County ( Arizona ) Sheriff Joe Arpaio .

As Frank Sharry observes :
Most micro-ISVs use a serial number / registration code system to allow end users to unlock or activate their purchase .
The problem most of us have run into is that a few days or weeks after our software is released , someone has developed a keygen , a crack , or has leaked a serial number across the internet .
There are several possible solutions to this problem .
You could license a system like Armadillo / Software Passport or ASProtect , or you could distribute a separate full version as a download for your paying customers .
Each option has advantages and disadvantages .
What I am going to show you is a way to keep “ rolling your own ” license key system while making working cracks harder for crackers to produce , and working keygens a thing of the past .
Aside :
If you think it ’s crazy to post this publicly where crackers can see it , do n’t worry about that .
I ’m not posting anything they have n’t seen before .
The entire point of partial key verification is that your code never includes enough information to reverse engineer a key generation algorithm .
Also , I offer no warranty of any kind — this is for your information only !
Now , on with things .
Our license key system must meet some basic requirements .
License keys must be easy enough to type in .
We must be able to blacklist ( revoke ) a license key in the case of chargebacks or purchases with stolen credit cards .
No “ phoning home ” to test keys .
Although this practice is becoming more and more prevalent , I still do not appreciate it as a user , so will not ask my users to put up with it .
It should not be possible for a cracker to disassemble our released application and produce a working “ keygen ” from it .
This means that our application will not fully test a key for verification .
Only some of the key is to be tested .
Further , each release of the application should test a different portion of the key , so that a phony key based on an earlier release will not work on a later release of our software .
Important : it should not be possible for a legitimate user to accidentally type in an invalid key that will appear to work but fail on a future version due to a typographical error .
The solution is called a Partial Key Verification System because your software never tests the full key .
Since your application does not include the code to test every portion of the key , it is impossible for a cracker to build a working valid key generator just by disassembling your executable code .
This system is not a way to prevent cracks entirely .
It will still be possible for a cracker to edit your executable to jump over verification code .
But such cracks only work on one specific release , and I ’ll suggest a couple of tricks to make their job harder to complete successfully .
Let ’s jump right in .
I ’ll show you the system with Delphi code .
( Given the readable nature of Delphi Pascal , you should be able to use these examples to build your own system in any language . )
An aside : if you think it ’s crazy to post this publicly where crackers can see it , do n’t worry !
I ’m not posting anything they do n’t know .
The whole point of this system is that your code never contains enough information for a cracker to reverse - engineer your key system .
My blog post here does n’t give them any information they do n’t already have .
Also , I ’m not offering any kind of warranty with this information .
This is for your information only , and all that .
Now , on with things !
1. The Key Format
This example will create and test keys of 20 characters ( with hyphens added for user convenience ) .
A valid key will look like this :
A279-1717-7D7A-CA2E-7154
Once the hyphens are stripped , this is how the key breaks down :
Seed value Key Byte 0 Key Byte 1 Key Byte 2 Key Byte 3 Checksum A2791717 7D 7A CA 2E 7154
This sample system only uses four bytes for key verification , but a real system should use many more and larger values , so keep that in mind if you begin implementing your own PKVS .
2. The Seed Value
This sample system uses a 64 - bit integer as a “ seed ” to generate the “ Key Bytes ” from .
The example project just generates random values for seeds , but when you implement a system like this , you must ensure that the seeds are always unique , because the seed is used when blacklisting a key .
The seed could itself be a hash of a user name and time of generation , or any number of things
3. Computing Key Bytes
Here is the heart of the PKVS .
Each “ byte ” of the key is a result of an operation on the seed value .
Here is a simple “ byte ” value computation function .
It performs some bit twiddling based on the supplied parameters :
function PKV_GetKeyByte(const Seed : Int64 ; a , b , c : Byte ) : Byte ; begin a := a mod 25 ; b := b mod 3 ;
if a mod 2 = 0 then result := ( ( Seed shr a ) and $ 000000 FF ) xor ( ( Seed shr b ) or c ) else result := ( ( Seed shr a ) and $ 000000 FF ) xor ( ( Seed shr b ) and c ) ; end ;
We ’ll see in a moment how this function is used in the key generation and checking algorithms .
Please keep in mind that this example function is very simplistic .
A more effective function would use larger values than bytes and employ a more complex hashing system .
4 . We need a checksum
Once we have our seed and bytes formed into a string of characters , we need to add a checksum to it .
This way we can know when a user makes a mistake entering their key , without having to actually check each portion of the key for validity .
function PKV_GetChecksum( const s : String ) : String ;
var left , right , sum : Word ; i : Integer ; begin left := $ 0056 ; right := $ 00 AF ;
if Length(s ) > 0 then for i := 1 to Length (s ) do begin right := right + Byte( s[i ] ) ; if right > $ 00 FF then Dec( right , $ 00 FF ) ; Inc( left , right ) ; if left > $ 00 FF then Dec( left , $ 00 FF ) ; end ;
sum := ( left shl 8 ) + right ; result := IntToHex ( sum , 4 ) ; end ;
This function computes a simple 8 - bit value from the supplied string and returns it as a hexidecimal string , which we tack on to the end of our key .
Note that because this routine is always used to check a key in your application , a would - be keygen coder will be able to generate keys that pass the checksum test .
That ’s okay .
The point of the checksum is only to prevent your users from mistyping their own valid license keys , and it will aid in determining if a key was deliberately forged .
5 . Putting it together : generating a valid key
For our key generation program , we ’re going to need a single function we can call to get a license key string from a seed value .
Here it is :
function PKV_MakeKey ( const Seed : Int64 ) : String ; var KeyBytes : array [ 0..3 ] of Byte ; i : Integer ; begin // Fill KeyBytes with values derived from Seed . //
The parameters used here must be extactly the same // as the ones used in the PKV_CheckKey function .
//
A real key system should use more than four bytes .
KeyBytes [ 0 ] := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 24 , 3 , 200 ) ; KeyBytes [ 1 ] := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 10 , 0 , 56 ) ; KeyBytes [ 2 ] := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 1 , 2 , 91 ) ; KeyBytes [ 3 ] := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 7 , 1 , 100 ) ;
// the key string begins with a hexidecimal string of the seed result := IntToHex ( Seed , 8 ) ;
// then is followed by hexidecimal strings of each byte in the key for i := 0 to 3 do result := result + IntToHex(KeyBytes[i ] , 2 ) ;
// add checksum to key string result := result + PKV_GetChecksum( result ) ;
// Add some hyphens to make it easier to type i := Length ( result ) - 3 ; while ( i > 1 ) do begin Insert ( '-' , result , i ) ; Dec( i , 4 ) ; end ; end ;
Important : never compile this valid key generator function into your release application !
It is only to be used on your end to generate valid keys .
The success of a PKVS is based on keeping the parameters used in the PKV_GetKey Byte call secret and away from the prying eyes of crackers .
Remember : if it ’s in your compiled executable , a cracker can see it !
6 . Testing a key in your application
Your application needs two functions for testing a key .
The first is a function for testing only the checksum value .
You ’ll use this to test the key when a user types it in .
To make it harder for a cracker , this is all you want to test at first .
More on this later .
The second function actually verifies portions of the key to see if they are valid , and also checks against the blacklist to see if a key should be rejected based on its seed value .
First we need to define the constants :
const KEY_GOOD = 0 ; KEY_INVALID = 1 ; KEY_BLACKLISTED
= 2 ; KEY_PHONY = 3 ;
BL : array [ 0..0 ] of String = ( ' 11111111 ' ) ;
Above , BL is an array of blacklist strings .
Important : only include the seed portion .
Remember : if you put it in your program , a cracker can see it .
So do not put an entire key in the blacklist .
That just makes it easier for a cracker to see what a valid key should look like .
Here is the checksum check function :
function PKV_CheckKeyChecksum( const Key : String ) : Boolean ; var s , c : String ; begin result := False ;
// remove cosmetic hypens and normalize case s := UpperCase ( StringReplace ( Key , '-' , '' , [ rfReplaceAll ] ) ) ; if Length(s ) <> 20 then exit ; //
Our keys are always 20 characters long
// last four characters are the checksum c := Copy(s , 17 , 4 ) ; SetLength(s , 16 ) ;
// compare the supplied checksum against the real checksum for // the key string .
result := c = PKV_GetChecksum(s ) ; end ;
And finally , we come to the function that tests keys for validity .
In the sample code , I am using conditional defines to allow me to easily exclude “ key bytes ” from the checking function , but you could just as easily comment them out .
My advice is to only include one or two checks in a release , and to change which ones are checked for each release .
Again , our example only has four “ check bytes ” but you should use many more .
function PKV_CheckKey( const S : String ) : Integer ; var Key , kb : String ; Seed : Int64 ; i : Integer ; b : Byte ; begin result := KEY_INVALID ; if not PKV_CheckKeyChecksum( S ) then exit ; // bad checksum or wrong number of characters
// remove cosmetic hypens and normalize case Key := UpperCase ( StringReplace( S , '-' , '' , [ rfReplaceAll ] ) ) ;
// test against blacklist if Length ( BL ) > 0 then for i := Low ( BL ) to High ( BL ) do if Starts Str ( BL[i ] , Key ) then begin result := KEY_BLACKLISTED ; exit ; end ;
//
At this point , the key is either valid or forged , // because a forged key can have a valid checksum .
//
We now test the " bytes " of the key to determine if it is // actually valid .
//
When building your release application , use conditional defines // or comment out most of the byte checks !
This is the heart // of the partial key verification system .
By not compiling in // each check , there is no way for someone to build a keygen that // will produce valid keys .
If an invalid keygen is released , you // simply change which byte checks are compiled in , and any serial // number built with the fake keygen no longer works .
// Note that the parameters used for PKV_GetKey Byte calls MUST // MATCH the values that PKV_MakeKey uses to make the key in the // first place !
result := KEY_PHONY ;
// extract the Seed from the supplied key string if not TryStrToInt64 ( ' $ ' + Copy ( Key , 1 , 8 ) , Seed ) then exit ;
{$IFDEF KEY00} kb := Copy ( Key , 9 , 2 ) ; b := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 24 , 3 , 200 ) ; if kb <> IntToHex ( b , 2 ) then exit ; {$ENDIF}
{$IFDEF KEY01} kb := Copy ( Key , 11 , 2 ) ; b := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 10 , 0 , 56 ) ; if kb <> IntToHex ( b , 2 ) then exit ;
{$ENDIF}
{$IFDEF KEY02} kb := Copy ( Key , 13 , 2 ) ; b := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 1 , 2 , 91 ) ; if kb <> IntToHex ( b , 2 ) then exit ; {$ENDIF}
{$IFDEF KEY03} kb := Copy ( Key , 15 , 2 ) ; b := PKV_GetKeyByte( Seed , 7 , 1 , 100 ) ; if kb <> IntToHex ( b , 2 ) then exit ; {$ENDIF}
//
If we get this far , then it means the key is either good , or was made // with a keygen derived from " this " release .
result := KEY_GOOD ; end ;
6 . Making it harder for crackers
So far you have the tools you need to make a license key system that is virtually impervious to being “ keygenned , ” as far as valid keys go .
It is still possible for a cracker to alter your executable to skip key verification , and a cracker will still be able to create a keygen that works for whatever version of your application he has .
So what else is there to do ?
The first step I suggest is inlining the PKV_GetKeyByte , PKV_GetChecksum , PKV_CheckKeyChecksum , and PKV_CheckKey functions .
Recent versions of Delphi support the inline compiler directive that forces the compiler to “ unroll ” the function in - place rather than actually make a function call .
This results in larger code , but also gives the cracker that many more places to examine while he is dissecting your executable .
It also prevents him from finding the single entry point for PKV_CheckKey and making it always return KEY_GOOD .
When your application tests the stored key at startup , and when the user enters the key , only check the checksum .
If your program immediately goes into its “ key byte ” verification code when it starts up or when the key is entered by the user , it ’s just asking the cracker to watch carefully and see how it ’s done !
Just verify the checksum first , and give a polite error message if it is invalid ( remember , this is where your customer is putting in his key that he gave you money for ! ) .
Elsewhere in your code , sprinkle the real checks into various operations .
User clicks File > Save ?
There ’s a good time to really check the key , instead of just the checksum .
Perhaps set up a timer and check it a full minute after the code is entered .
The possibilities are endless , and any unique ideas you come up with will make your program that much more tedious for a cracker to work on .
Crackers have lots of programs to fool around with , and if yours gets to be too frustrating , they may get sloppy and release only a partially working crack , or skip your application altogether .
Keep on top of cracks , phony keygens , and leaked keys .
Even though it is n’t possible for a cracker to create a fully valid key based on what you compiled into your program , he can ( and probably will ) release a keygen that works with whatever version he downloaded .
Set up a Google Alert for “ Your_program keygen serial crack ” and when one is released , immediately change which “ key bytes ” your program checks , or add the leaked key to the blacklist , and recompile .
Suddenly none of the keys , keygens , and cracks released work anymore .
Also , do a “ silent ” update of your download file when you are just recompiling for this reason .
No need to announce to the cracker that their keygen suddenly does n’t work any more .
7 . Further development
This PKVS example is very simple in its implementation .
There are several things that could be added to make it more powerful .
Replace PKV_GetKey
Byte with a more robust version .
There are many hashing algorithms available that can be used as a starting point for calculating the portions of your key used to determine if it is valid .
Using the sample function presented here would be a mistake as it could be reverse engineered with valid leaked keys and brute - force algorithms .
Instead of using hexidecimal , use the entire alphabet .
This will let you pack a lot more data into the key string without making it too long .
Note that the comparisons and byte generation checks in this example will have to be re-written to work with any other base numbering system .
The example implementation is a simple “ serial number ” system and does not tie the key to a user name or other information .
However , it would be trivial to make the seed itself a checksum value of another string , such as the user ’s name .
Anything could be added to the key string .
You could add additional values to store activation or expiration dates , for example .
Your key generation system should maintain a database of issued keys .
You should always test your key check function against every key you have issued .
Also , keep a database of blacklisted or leaked keys , and always test your check function against them to ensure it returns the expected results .
Concluding remarks
Whatever you do , do n’t focus all of your energy on your licensing system .
It is important , but creating usable software that customers need is more important .
A good license key system will certainly improve your sales , but you ca n’t hope to convert every one searching for “ MyProgram Serialz ” into a customer .
A system like the one described here can be implemented in a day or two , but constantly trying to outsmart crackers is a never - ending battle .
It all started in December of 2003 , when Sci - Fi ( or do I call it Sy - Fy now ? ) aired its annual Winter mini-series .
Buzz on the Internet was n’t exactly kind , you do n’t remake a cult classic without getting the wrath of sci - fi geeks upon you .
But the mini-series was successful enough to spawn a series , and the new Battlestar Galactica soon carved its own niche , full of character development , dark and gritty themes , and interesting action .
Fast forward to 2009 , where it will all end on March 20th .
Spanning four season , the show has become quite popular , at least online , and has picked up fans like Dwight Schrute .
So as we say farewell to one of the better Sci - Fi shows in recent memory , we ’ll honor them the way Gunaxin does best .
With pictures of women .
Here are the women of Battlestar Galactica :
Tricia Helfer
The Canadian and former Ford ’s “ Supermodel of the World ” winner plays one of the twelve Cylon models , better known as Number Six or simply Six .
Here ’s plenty more Tricia :
Grace Park
Although born in California , Park was raised and educated in Canada .
So with Helfer , you can consider her another Canadian .
And like Helfer , she ’s also a Cylon , playing model Number Eight .
One of her Cylon models was Lieutenant Sharon “ Boomer ” Valerii , and another model married Captain Karl “ Helo ” Agathon under the code name Athena .
Here ’s more of the lovely Ms. Park :
Katee Sackhoff
Battlestar Galactica producers initially took a lot of grief for turning the Starbuck character into a female ( played by the A - Team ’s Dirk Benedict in the original ) , but I ’m not complaining with the results .
As Captain Kara Thrace , Sackhoff has emerged as a great actress , so much so we even profiled her in our Television Stars Destined for Greater Things post .
And yes , we have more Katee :
Lucy Lawless
It ’s about time Xena was seen in something more regularly .
Lawless plays D’Anna Biers , better known as the third Cylon model .
There ’s something about Cylons and the women on this show is n’t there ?
And we could n’t resist showing you some more Lucy :
Kate Vernon
Vernon plays Ellen Tigh , the wife of second in command Colonel Saul Tigh .
And yes , she ’s a Cylon too .
One of the original five , and the last to be revealed .
Sorry , no gallery on her .
Mary McDonnell
No , we ca n’t leave out President Laura Roslin .
Mary McDonnell plays the strong leader , and she would have cracked our Top Twelve Fictional Presidents list , except we limited it to U.S. Presidents .
As head of the twelve colonies , she did n’t qualify .
Kandyse McClure
McClure played Lieutenant Anastasia “ Dee ” Dualla , wife of Lee “ Apollo ” Adama , and former Communications Officer of Galactica .
Michelle Forbes
Forbes took on the role made famous by Lloyd Bridges in the original Battlestar Galactica , and was cast as Admiral Helena Cain .
Cain was the commander of the Battlestar Pegasus and was the highest ranking military officer in the fleet .
Of course Forbes is no stranger to science fiction fans , as she was known for her role as Ensign Ro Laren on Star Trek : The Next Generation .
Nicki Clyne
Callandra Henderson , better known by her nickname “ Cally ” , was a young deckhand that helped fix what needed fixing .
During her tenure on Galactica , she fell in love with her boss , Chief Galen Tyrol , and married him .
Leah Cairns
Lieutenant Margaret ‘ Racetrack ’ Edmonson is a Cylon - hating Raptor pilot who betrayed Admiral Adama during Gaeta ’s Mutiny and was subsequently jailed .
Tiffany Lyndall - Knight
If you ’re a Galactica fan and do n’t recognize Ms. Lyndall - Knight , that ’s because she played the Hybrid , an entity that represents the first step in the Cylon evolution from pure machines to organic beings .
Hybrids serve as the central computer inside a basestar .
Rekha Sharma
And finally we have Tory Foster , played by Rekha Sharma .
Foster became President Roslin ’s aide and campaign manager following the death of Billy Keikeya .
Like many on this rundown she is a Cylon , as she was later revealed to be one of the final five .
Thanks for the memories Battlestar , and we ’ll await your upcoming TV movieand anything beyond it .
Also , thanks once again to the women of Galactica :
ASUNCION , Paraguay ( CNN ) -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo acknowledged Monday that he is the father of a 2 - year - old child who was conceived when he was a Roman Catholic bishop .
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo speaks at a news conference in Asuncion on Monday .
" It 's true that there was a relationship with Viviana Carrillo , " Lugo told reporters , citing the mother .
" I assume all the responsibilities that could derive from such an act , recognizing the paternity of the child . "
He said he was making the acknowledgment " with the most absolute honesty , transparency and feeling of obligation . "
The announcement came in the week after Carrillo had filed suit in a city in southern Paraguay seeking a paternity test .
Judge Evelyn Peralta , who is overseeing the case , said she was treating it routinely .
" It is a case like any other , which involves the president and nothing more , " she said .
" It will be processed as it should be . "
Some Cabinet members interpreted Lugo 's acknowledgment of paternity as an indication of the change he has promised to bring about to achieve greater transparency in the public sector .
" This is the Paraguay that we want , " said Liz Torres , minister of children 's issues .
" This is the Paraguay of serious change , in which there is no double standard or secrets .
It seems to be an example , a very big lesson . "
But some opposition party members said it appeared that Lugo had practically been forced to acknowledge what happened ; that he had not done so willingly .
Sen. Julio Cesar Velasquez of the opposition Colorado Party called on the Vatican to excommunicate Lugo .
Lugo was laicized last year , around the time he assumed the presidency .
Journalist Sanie Lopez Garelli contributed to this report from Asuncion .

Receiver Chad Johnson did n’t show for the start of Bengals ’ offseason conditioning on Monday .
“ I ’m not worried about him ; I ’m worried about the guys we have here , ” Palmer said at a news conference Monday .
“ The guys that want to be here and want to work now are the guys who are in the locker room right now and are here today . ”
Despite Palmer ’s confirmation , Bengals coach Marvin Lewis would not say what players were present .
Palmer did sound more upbeat when asked about other receivers such as Laveranues Coles , who was present .
Last year Ocho Cinco caused a major stir by skipping “ voluntary ” workouts and publicly stating his desire to be traded .
It is not known if this absence is again hinting that he wants out of Cincinnati .
Ocho Cinco has not been in contact with the Bengals recently .
Last year Cincinnati passed up trade offers because the team was unwilling to take an $ 8 million salary cap hit .
This year that cap number is reduced to $ 4.87 million to trade Ocho Cinco , making it more of a possibility .
Bodie began as a mining camp of little note following the discovery of gold in 1859 by prospector W. S. Bodey ( also spelled Body ) .
That November , Bodey perished in a blizzard after making a supply trip to nearby Monoville .
In 1876 , the Standard Company discovered a profitable deposit of gold - bearing ore , which transformed Bodie from an isolated mining camp comprising a few prospectors and company employees to a Wild West boomtown .
Rich discoveries in the adjacent Bodie Mine during 1878 attracted even more hopeful people .
By 1880 , Bodie boasted a population of 7,000 , maybe 8,000 .
Over the years , Bodie 's mines produced gold valued at more than $ 34 million .
As a bustling gold mining center , Bodie had the amenities of larger towns , including two banks , a brass band , railroad , miner 's and mechanic 's unions , several newspapers , and a jail .
At its peak 65 saloons lined Main Street , which was a mile long .
Murders , shootouts , barroom brawls , and stagecoach holdups were regular occurrences .
Legend has it that a little girl , upon learning that her family was moving there , prayed one night , " Goodbye God , we are going to Bodie . "
But a local editor claimed she had really prayed , " Good !
By God , we are going to Bodie .

Police have charged a fifth teacher from Sydney 's prestigious Knox Grammar School with child sex offences .
Police said the 66 - year - old man was arrested at Port Macquarie today and questioned about the alleged indecent assault of a former student .
The offences were alleged to have occurred while the man was a teacher at the school in 1976 and 1977 , police said .
The 66 - year - old was charged with two counts of indecency and one count of assault .
He will face Port Macquarie Local Court on May 18 .
The arrest was made by Strike Force Arika , launched to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of students at the Wahroonga school dating back to the 1970s .

Dear Cecil : I 've climbed the highest mountains , searched the darkest depths of the public library and even asked my mother .
Still I come up with a blank .
So here 's my question : have you ever looked at your zipper ?
I mean really looked ?
On 90 percent of them there are the letters YKK .
Please tell me what YKK means so I can again know inner peace .
Ken Green , Chicago
Cecil replies :
It means Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha .
Feeling peaceful ?
Did n’t think so .
See if the following bonus info helps .
YKK translated means Yoshida Industries Limited .
Tadao Yoshida is the Japanese tycoon who founded the company in 1934 and built it into “ the foremost manufacturer of closures [ zippers , mostly ] in the world , ” the company ’s annual report notes .
It ’s unfortunate that YKK is not better known , but face it , a zipper is n’t exactly the ideal billboard — the only time you get close enough to read the lettering , typically your mind is on other things .
Your idea of a zipper factory might be a couple guys named Izzy and Mort ( or the equivalent in Japanese ) in some crummy loft in the garment district .
Little do you know — this is a mighty industry here .
We ’re talking 54 plants and 114 sales offices in 40 countries with a total of 25,000 employees .
( Hey , everybody needs zippers . )
We ’re talking mammoth production lines , giant automatic weaving machines , and barrel oscillation plating equipment .
( I do n’t know what it is either , but it looks impressive in the pictures . )
We ’re talking heavy - duty R&D , as dedicated YKK scientists strive to perfect the zippers of tomorrow .
Also the aluminum building materials of tomorrow , YKK having diversified thereinto a while back .
Tadao Yoshida ’s genius was to understand the poetry of zipper manufacture .
( No kidding — the guy even does calligraphy . )
The company ’s charmingly loopy brochures explain that the YKK philosophy is “ the Cycle of Goodness . ”
Says here , “ the concept means that no one prospers unless he renders profit or benefit to others . …
The people of YKK have dedicated themselves to manufacturing perfection — delivering goods and services that benefit their customers and society as well as their company and their own personal lives . …
[ They are dedicated ] to the continued enhancement of everyday life for citizens throughout the U.S.A . ”
OK , it ’s just zippers , but Yoshida ’s idea is , they might as well be great zippers .
One more reason why the Japanese are kicking Occidental butt in the fields of commerce .

A 'GRANDIOSE ' idea by a Northern Rivers farmer to grow cannabis and then use the funds to restock his acreage with native trees and buy chickens backfired when police discovered his secret stash with a street value of $ 556,000 .
Peter Stear Jackson , a grandfather from Koonorigan , was sentenced to 18 months of weekend detention after pleading guilty in Lismore District Court to growing and commercial supply charges , involving 134 cannabis plants , 25.9kg of cannabis leaf and head , 1.067kg of cannabis resin , and 577 cannabis seeds .
When police discovered the drugs on May 1 , 2008 , Jackson told the officers he only smoked cannabis ' once a year ' at the annual Nimbin Mardi Grass festival .
Defence lawyer Ralph James successfully argued for a minimum sentence on the grounds that medical evidence including psychiatric reports revealed his client had been having mental health problems ( a bipolar disorder ) , suffering severe depression , and having ' grandiose thoughts ' during a hypermanic episode involving substantial departure from reality .
“ He says it ( cannabis ) was for a specific purpose , but there is no trafficking , ” Mr James said .
The Crown agreed Jackson 's mental health was relevant in assessing his moral culpability , but alone was not enough to move the case to the realm of exceptional circumstances .
He had known what he was doing and that it was wrong , and a 20 - litre tub was found under his house filled with cannabis leaf and head .
Judge James
Black said he accepted Jackson was unlikely to re- offend , had no record of offences , was of good character , with clear evidence he was ' a good man in the community ' , and also took into account the medical matters .
Canadian officials contacted the Afghan government Tuesday to express concern about controversial new legislation that would reportedly force women to have sex with their husbands .
The Canadian government reacted with outrage following reports that the administration of President Hamid Karzai has approved a wide - ranging family law for the country 's Shia minority .
Various reports say the legislation would make it illegal for Shia women to refuse their husbands sex , leave the house without their permission or have custody of children .
Canadian officials contacted the Karzai's office , and Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon spoke to two Afghan cabinet ministers Tuesday seeking clarification .
Karzai's office has so far refused to comment on the legislation , which has been criticized by some Afghan parliamentarians and a UN women 's agency but has not yet been published .
Critics say Karzai's government approved it in a hurry to win support in the upcoming election from ethnic Hazaras — a Shia Muslim minority that constitutes a crucial block of swing voters .
" If these reports are true , this will create serious problems for Canada , " said International Trade Minister Stockwell Day , who fielded questions in the House of Commons .
" The onus is on the government of Afghanistan to live up to its responsibilities for human rights , absolutely including rights of women .
" If there 's any wavering on this point from the government of Afghanistan , this will create serious problems and be a serious disappointment for us " Day said .
Late Tuesday , Canadian officials said they had learned the law was not yet in effect but that they remained " very concerned . "
The Afghan constitution guarantees equal rights for women , but also allows the Shia to have separate family law based on religious tradition .
Some international monitors have avoided discussing the issue , for fear of feeding the impression that exists among Afghans that their government takes its marching orders from the West .
Female parliamentarians in Afghanistan have condemned the legislation , as has the United Nations Development Fund for Women .
They were joined Tuesday by the NDP , which has opposed the Afghan military mission .
" How can we say that our soldiers are there to protect women 's rights when the Western - backed leader of this nation pushes through laws like this ? " said NDP MP Dawn Black .
" Allowing women to be treated like a piece of property … is this what we 're fighting for ?
Is this what our people are dying for in Afghanistan ? "
Ratings Results for the Week of March 29th – A Bit of Good News for Some Shows
By John J. Joex
After last week ’s dismal results in which almost every network show in the Science Fiction and Fantasy genre showed a drop in their ratings , this week brought a bit of good news for several shows .
On NBC , Kings halted its decline , which is about as good of news as that show can expect these days .
And on Monday night , both Heroes and Medium improved on their rating in the 18 - 49 demographic from last week .
Heroes Volume 4 continues to get stronger each week and it appears that viewers are slowly migrating back .
On ABC , while the premiere numbers for Cupid were nothing to get excited about , it was not a complete disaster , pulling a 2.3 rating in the 18 - 49 demographic and 7.56 million viewers .
Those numbers are n’t quite strong enough to win it a second season , but at least it is not DOA ( from a ratings perspective that is ) like I originally thought .
I ’m actually going to bump down the Cancellation Alert on that one to “ Medium ” for now .
On Wednesday , Lost ’s numbers rebounded some from the prior week with a 4.2 rating in the 18 - 49 demo and 9.35 million viewers .
And the Life on Mars finale delivered more total viewers than that show has seen in two months .
On the CW , Reaper remained pretty much steady with the numbers it saw the prior week , and both Smallville and Supernatural saw a healthy boost to their ratings .
In fact , Supernatural improved on its Smallville lead - in with the numbers in the 18 - 49 demo and actually posted its best numbers in the 18 - 34 demo since October 2006 .
On CBS , The Eleventh Hour was not so lucky .
It ’s one week pre-emption because of College Basketball lead to viewers forgetting about it and it posted is lowest numbers for a new episode since December .
On FOX , Dollhouse improved its rating in the 18 - 49 demo from last week and The Sarah Connor Chronicles stayed even , though both dropped some in total viewers .
Both appear pretty much finished , though , as neither has made any significant move out of the ratings cellar they have been in all year .

A member of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has dismissed claims that more than 150 people have died from swine flu , saying it has officially recorded only seven deaths around the world .
Mexico has lowered its confirmed death toll from swine flu from 20 to seven , Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters .
He also raised the toll of " probable ' ' deaths from the H1N1 virus from 152 to 159 .
A total of 1311 people remain in hospital after exhibiting symptoms of the flu , he said .
Vivienne Allan , from WHO 's patient safety program , said the body had confirmed that worldwide there had been just seven deaths - all in Mexico - and 79 confirmed cases of the disease .
" Unfortunately that [ 150 - plus deaths ] is incorrect information and it does happen , but that 's not information that 's come from the World Health Organisation , " Ms Allan told ABC Radio today .
ALBANY 
The State Legislature took pivotal steps on Wednesday toward repealing much of what remains of the state ’s 1970s - era drug laws , which have tied judges ’ hands and required them to impose mandatory prison terms for many nonviolent drug offenses .
The Assembly approved legislation , 96 to 46 , that would restore judges ’ discretion in many lower - level drug- possession crimes that are felonies by eliminating laws that require a prosecutor ’s consent before judges can send certain felons to drug treatment instead of prison .
In addition , the measure would permit about 2,000 prisoners to apply to have their sentences reduced .
The same bill was introduced on Wednesday in the Senate , where Democratic leaders vowed to quickly take it up .
But the task now confronting legislative leaders and Gov. David A. Paterson is to reconcile the Assembly bill  which is considered the widest - reaching of the proposals under consideration  with the governor ’s plan and the bill that Senate Democrats expect to pass after amending the Assembly bill .
HYDERABAD : An NRI who flew to Hyderabad from Texas , the US state which reported the first swine flu death outside Mexico , was on Wednesday found to have the flu symptoms .
Authorities , who refused to divulge the identity of the person , only said he had arrived in the city two days ago and has now been quarantined .
Special teams of doctors who are screening passengers from US and other affected countries who entered in the last 10 days have also been going to their homes to conduct health check - ups .
It was during one such check that the person was found to have signs of swine flu .
Blog : Swine flu and St Jude
Doctors are checking for symptoms like running nose , fever , body aches and other viral fever symptoms among the passengers .
The first death in the Texan city of Brownsville , which borders Mexico , was that of a two - year - old Mexican boy who had come across the frontier .
The cause of death on Monday was pneumonia brought on by the flu virus , which is spreading human to human .
So far , 91 cases have been reported from the United States and 2,400 from Mexico , where 150 people have died of the flu .
The case in Hyderabad , if confirmed as swine flu , would be India 's first .
According to Andhra Pradesh principal secretary ( health ) L V Subramanyam , the patient was brought to the Institute of Preventive Medicine , Narayanguda , to go through the preliminary tests for respiratory problems , cold and cough .
After this he was referred to the Government Chest Hospital at Erragadda which is a quarantine centre .
The patient will be kept there for 10 days of observation .
The family members of the passengers do not have any symptoms and were not quarantined .
`` The medical and health officials are looking at the records of all international passengers who landed in the city in the last 10 days and medical tests are being conducted on them , '' Subramanyam said .
However , the chest hospital superintendent denied that any patient had been admitted with swine flu symptoms .
``We were informed that a patient would be sent to the quarantine facility but he did not turn up , '' superintendent S V Prasad said .
Meanwhile , health officials who started screening international passengers conducted initial tests on passengers from 15 international flights which landed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport , Shamshabad on Wednesday .
According to the doctors , none of the passengers were found to have symptoms of the flu .
`` The passengers from all the 15 flights were checked at the boarding point , by the flight attendants and also by the doctors who were stationed in the airport , '' an airport health official , Dr K N Reddy told TOI .
He said that two duty doctors screened more than 1,000 passengers from early Wednesday morning .
`` While some of the passengers were ailing with other infections , including stomach aches , no one was found with conditions which are like that of swine flu , '' Reddy said .
He said that chances of such passengers on board a plane were less as no one with swine flu symptoms was being allowed to leave their countries .
The Coca Cola company has invested over $ 1 billion dollars building a market for its products in India , but the company ’s welcome has been less than effervescent , considering the contentious issues raised by the company ’s business practices .

The company uses thousands of liters of water every year to make its well known drink and to clean bottles and machinery .
The water is drawn from wells and aquifers it shares with neighboring farmers .
The water is virtually free to all users , however , in a land with a completely irrational groundwater policy ( where , if you have the means and the resources , you can extract as much groundwater as you like and use as much as you want at no cost ) , the company ends up using most available water at the expense of its low income farmers .
The fields surrounding Coca Cola factories in India were once fertile enough to grow rice and other staples .
However , since the factories have opened , the water levels have shrunk dramatically , not to mention that toxic waste - waters have changed the chemical nature of the soil .
Many farmers have now become farm laborers who completely depend upon rainwater for their survival .
Following the media attention pursuant to an outcry by local farmers , Coca Cola has agreed to subsidize a sizeable portion of the cost of water - efficient drip irrigation systems for Indian farmers .
The company has also set up concrete collection systems for rainwater , and Coca Cola CEO Atul Singh claims that by the end of 2009 , the company will become “ water - neutral , ” returning at least as much groundwater as it withdraws in India .
Blockbuster may be counting down the days until it 's forced to close its retail stores , the company revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week .
In the filing , the company revealed that it may not be able to meet the terms of a recent $ 250 million loan , and that there was " substantial doubt " about its ability to continue as a business in the near future .
Blockbuster 's revolving and term loan agreement was amended last week , allowing its $ 250 million loan to mature at the end of September 2010 .
However , the company said in its SEC filing ( summary ) that its lenders wo n't fund the loan unless Blockbuster meets specific conditions , which may or may not happen .
If the lenders decide to back out or if Blockbuster is n't able to keep things going even with the loan , the company will find itself up the proverbial creek without a paddle .
The ability to walk into a Blockbuster on a whim and rent a movie will be lost if the company goes under .
In the 1980s and 1990s , the company was a true juggernaut , putting scores of mom-and - pop video rental shops out of business .
For the past several years , however , the company has struggled to stay relevant amid heavy competition from the likes of Netflix , the iTunes Store , Hulu , Amazon 's Video on Demand , and the plethora of other video services that have popped up .
Instead of innovating on its own , Blockbuster has been stuck playing catch - up .
And its staple $ 4.99 in - store rentals are n't so attractive in light of the $ 1 rentals available at the Redbox kiosks spreading across the country .
In November of 2008 , the company delivered a set - top box called MediaPoint , which is meant to stream movies from Blockbuster 's online library .
This past January , Blockbuster announced that it would begin slapping its logo on CinemaNow 's online movie service , allowing Blockbuster to deliver content over the Internet to a " wide assortment of home and mobile electronic devices . "
And , just last month , Blockbuster announced that its On Demand service would be coming to the TiVo .
This would have been a great announcement to make several years ago , but with Amazon 's Video on Demand service and now Netflix available on the TiVo , Blockbuster is n't breaking any new ground ; it 's just late to the party .
It 's clear that Blockbuster is having trouble keeping up , and it continues to lose money in the process .
We may be approaching the time when Blockbuster takes Circuit City 's hand and joins CompUSA at the great strip mall in the sky .

Polish Family Seeks Return Of Old Royal Palace
A campaign by heirs of Polish aristocrats to recover a palace seized by the communists has exposed Poland 's continued failure to resolve the restitution of property to former owners after two decades of democracy .
The Branicki family says it has now decided to demand the return of the entire estate at Wilanow Palace , not just family heirlooms and archives as previously planned , due to frustration over lack of progress in a legal battle dating back to 1990 .
The baroque palace of Wilanow , situated in a rolling green park in a southern suburb of Warsaw and now a museum , has been dubbed " the Polish Versailles . "
It was built in the late 17th century by the Polish king Jan III Sobieski .

Many of us eat bacon for breakfast without a thought for the animals that provide it , but what are pigs really like ?
Richard da Costa took time out from his life as a corporate communications consultant and actor to spend four days living with them .
How did he cope ?
Sleeping up to your ears in pig - poo might not be everybody 's cup of tea , although I can honestly say I enjoyed it .
But I was n't thinking that as I entered the pen for the first time , to meet my 10 piggy companions .
My new home was about three metres wide and 11 metres long , with a concrete floor covered in mud , straw and you can guess what else .
Knowing I would be staying there ( apart from surprise excursions like to artificially inseminate a sow ) for a few days was pretty daunting .
It was a bit like jumping off something very high .

My Life as an Animal is broadcast on BBC Three on Thursday , 16 April at 2100BST
Or catch up using the iPlayer If I was going to get through it I knew I had to block out thoughts of hygiene and reset the rules in my head .
When I first went in , the bites from the pigs were quite hard .
It was n't like a dog play - fighting with you , these were real nips .
It was n't until I had managed to form some bonds that they became more affectionate .
I was visited by an expert who taught me some piggy " vocabulary " and that led to some real breakthroughs .
At times they were sucking my toes and nibbling my ear , which is apparently a sign of real affection .
I returned the compliment once or twice .
The females were the first to want to get to know me , but with the males there were a few tussles to be had before we became real buddies .
The nights were probably the hardest .
Constant squabbles breaking out in other pens provided a nightmarish soundtrack .
With my lot there was hardly a time when one of them was n't getting up to go to the toilet and have a snack or a nibble at me .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The solitude , the hunger , the smell , the cold , the constant night - time disturbances , the boredom , the scrutiny of the television cameras gazing down like an alien observer .
My biggest challenge was not the mud but the isolation .
No conversation , no computer , no phone , no paper , no way to organise your thoughts , nowhere to wash .
Not being able to play with my phone or send an e-mail or write anything down .
Much of the time I was just lying there and thinking , like you would in bed at night , but you can't sustain that unless you have a way of capturing those thoughts .
I 'm quite an extrovert so if I 'm on my own for a long time I need to see someone .
Pangs of guilt
The one luxury was a portable toilet which was stationed nearby .
This was better than having to do anything in the pen itself but it was a mixed blessing .
Leaving the barn meant you had to come back in again , and the brief blast of outdoor air meant the smell coming back seemed so much worse each time .
Fortunately , I was eating so little that my trips to the portable toilet were pretty infrequent .
The dried pellets of crushed soya , alfalfa and vitamins were so disgusting that you would rather go hungry and I probably ate less than a cupful in total over the four days .
I was spared electrocution followed by the knife through the heart
However bitter the pellets , it was hardly starvation and unlike the pigs , I had an exit strategy that involved survival .
One of the main things I learnt was how grotesquely efficient we are when it comes to the production of cheap meat - from the production - line seeding and breeding at the pellet - pushing pig-penitentiary which was the intensive unit I called home , through to the mechanised killing machine that was the abattoir .
We have selectively bred and overfed these animals so that the product - meat - is cheaper than cheese and everybody 's happy .
To be forced to have to connect with our pink pals made me appreciate how disconnected from it all we have conveniently become .
Sobering
On my last day I visited an abattoir to see how pigs are exterminated on a massive scale .
I was put through the whole process with the pigs and it was absolutely clear to me that they had a very good idea that life was taking a significant turn for the worse .
You only had to listen to the screaming .
Thankfully , I was spared electrocution followed by the knife through the heart .
If we are going to eat animals , particularly the more sentient ones , then we must accept that they must be killed to be eaten .
I can not think of a nice way of doing that part .
For my last night , I was moved from the intensive farm - where the pigs were bored , neurotic , aggressive and largely pathetic creatures - to an outdoor one .
UP CLOSE WITH PIGS Fourth most intelligent animals
They are omnivorous and can even develop a taste for blood
They sleep about eight hours a day , including a siesta Life expectancy is 10 - 15 years
But usually killed at 28 weeks 70 % of UK pigs farmed intensively Pigs eat without getting full Male orgasm can last 30 minutes Source : Naturalist Terry Nutkins Outdoors , they were real animals , putting their snouts into mud rather than concrete , having to cross a field for a munch rather than having it in their bedding area , having a trough to jump up to , rather than being drip - fed from a convenient water bottle .
When I saw a pig scratch its ear with its hind leg I was amazed - the indoor pigs could n't physically have done that .
Yes , their lives would also be short but what a difference a field makes .
Looking back , it was without a doubt an experience that has broadened me and provided a sobering point of reference .
A little voluntary dehumanization in a controlled environment is certainly a good way of making you appreciate how good you really have it on the outside .
It was two months before I could eat pig after coming out of the farm .
I finally cracked and hypocrisy played its role as I was lured back to tearing my former bedfellow 's flesh with my teeth .
And by what ?
Spare ribs .
Chorizo .
Plain old bacon .
As much as I hate to say it , they really do taste very good .
But I am a responsible shopper now .
I think more about where all the things that I buy come from .
As consumers , we drive all production and - by how much we value something - the methods of that production .
Often enough we turn a blind eye to where our food comes from .
We may suffer the occasional pang of guilt but this will soon subside with the next two - for - one offer .
So as I trot around in my busy , aspirational , self - centred , self - important and ultimately pretty small life , sometimes , remembering my life as as an animal will do me no harm at all .
Below is a selection of your comments .
There are better ways of studying the habitats / behaviours of factory - farmed animals than actually sleeping with them .
This is an utterly ridiculous experiment .
We 're human .
Not animals , so how we feel living in a pen is not the same as how an animal feels .
A stupid excuse for a TV show .
John , Preston
The more we see of how animals are tortured for us to have cheap , low nutrition food the better .
No -one has the right to make an animal suffer so that they can afford to smoke cigarettes , drink alcohol or do the lottery .
Bad animal husbandry should be banned entirely and only meat from well - reared animals allowed .
I 'm a single parent on a low income , but I do n't have the right to eat the meat of animals who are treated in this inhumane way .
Helen , Cardiff
My son took a year out of his job as a furniture restorer to work on a small free range pig farm in northern Spain .
He loved it and became a very adept piggy midwife .
His favourite pig was " the Teaser " who had the unenviable job of checking whether the ladies were " ready " but he was not allowed to touch .
However , Nick occasionally took pity on him .
Before Nick left we had to dispose of his working clothes as the smell was permanent .
Nick really came to appreciate these intelligent animals and it took him a long time before he could happily eat pork .
Linda Arnell , Chichester , West Sussex
Eat only free range ENGLISH pork then at least you are reasonably sure they have had a good life , not a miserable existence that intensive pigs have .
Pigs are intelligent creatures NOT machines & deserve to be treated well .
( That goes without saying for all animals . )
Shirley Taylor , Eccleshall
What a brave and humbling step to take to live in a pen for four days .
I definitely think it 's time we as a nation stopped closing our eyes to mindless consumption via cruel production methods and have respect for other creatures not just ourselves .
Cathy , Belfast
If this stops just one person eating pork again , then these were days very well spent .
And please be aware that pork ( and beef ) gelatine finds its way into a variety of products , many of them sweet - fruit gums , jellies , desserts etc .
Veggie Sue , London
How ridiculous .
I have raised hogs for our family consumption for this last couple of years and they are quite clean and personable .
I do n't see what you can learn by sleeping in their pen , only as a publicity stunt .
If you want to learn about agriculture why do n't you work at it for a few years and try to make a living .
Current opinions seem quite critical of production practices which are driven by a desperate need of farmers to make a profit .
Yet few of the critics are willing to take up farming as a lifestyle .
Brian , Lafayette , IN , USA
What an utter waste of our money .
Is there enough licence money left for me to make documentaries about " My life lying on a beach for 2 weeks " ?
It 's no wonder people get annoyed with the BBC .
Keith Lovatt , Leeds Believe what you like John from Preston , if it makes you feel better .
Some of us are capable of empathy !
Humans and animals are emotionally more similar than you give believe .
Especially intelligent creatures such as pigs !
John , Harlow I think it 's reasonable to add the fact that the taste of free range products is also better !
Win / win situation in my eyes .
I 'm not going to stop eating meat , but also like to consider the way the animal was treated in it 's short life span .
Gary , London I am interested in how people can connect with an animal such as the pig and happily see it slaughtered at a very young age simply because they taste nice and not through any real need .
Pigs are intelligent sentient animals , just like dogs , but we would be aghast at eating dogs .
A lot of people seem to suffer from moral schizophrenia .
Brian , Clackmannanshire Interesting .
I will be even more interested in next week 's episode when a boar spends four days as a corporate communications consultant .

Privacy and the Fourth Amendment
In the United States , the concept of “ expectation of privacy ” matters because it ’s the constitutional test , based on the Fourth Amendment , that governs when and how the government can invade your privacy .
Based on the 1967 Katz v. United States Supreme Court decision , this test actually has two parts .
First , the government ’s action can’t contravene an individual ’s subjective expectation of privacy ; and second , that expectation of privacy must be one that society in general recognizes as reasonable .
That second part is n’t based on anything like polling data ; it is more of a normative idea of what level of privacy people should be allowed to expect , given the competing importance of personal privacy on one hand and the government ’s interest in public safety on the other .
The problem is , in today ’s information society , that definition test will rapidly leave us with no privacy at all .
In Katz , the Court ruled that the police could not eavesdrop on a phone call without a warrant : Katz expected his phone conversations to be private and this expectation resulted from a reasonable balance between personal privacy and societal security .
Given NSA ’s large - scale warrantless eavesdropping , and the previous administration ’s continual insistence that it was necessary to keep America safe from terrorism , is it still reasonable to expect that our phone conversations are private ?
Between the NSA ’s massive internet eavesdropping program and Gmail ’s content - dependent advertising , does anyone actually expect their e-mail to be private ?
Between calls for ISPs to retain user data and companies serving content - dependent web ads , does anyone expect their web browsing to be private ?
Between the various computer - infecting malware , and world governments increasingly demanding to see laptop data at borders , hard drives are barely private .
I certainly do n’t believe that my SMSes , any of my telephone data , or anything I say on LiveJournal or Facebook — regardless of the privacy settings — is private .
Aerial surveillance , data mining , automatic face recognition , terahertz radar that can “ see ” through walls , wholesale surveillance , brain scans , RFID , “ life recorders ” that save everything :
Even if society still has some small expectation of digital privacy , that will change as these and other technologies become ubiquitous .
In short , the problem with a normative expectation of privacy is that it changes with perceived threats , technology and large - scale abuses .
Clearly , something has to change if we are to be left with any privacy at all .
Three legal scholars have written law review articles that wrestle with the problems of applying the Fourth Amendment to cyberspace and to our computer - mediated world in general .
George Washington University ’s Daniel Solove , who blogs at Concurring Opinions , has tried to capture the byzantine complexities of modern privacy .
He points out , for example , that the following privacy violations — all real — are very different :
A company markets a list of 5 million elderly incontinent women ; reporters deceitfully gain entry to a person ’s home and secretly photograph and record the person ; the government uses a thermal sensor device to detect heat patterns in a person ’s home ; and a newspaper reports the name of a rape victim .
Going beyond simple definitions such as the divulging of a secret , Solove has developed a taxonomy of privacy , and the harms that result from their violation .
His 16 categories are : surveillance , interrogation , aggregation , identification , insecurity , secondary use , exclusion , breach of confidentiality , disclosure , exposure , increased accessibility , blackmail , appropriation , distortion , intrusion and decisional interference .
Solove ’s goal is to provide a coherent and comprehensive understanding of what is traditionally an elusive and hard - to - explain concept : privacy violations .
( This taxonomy is also discussed in Solove ’s book , Understanding Privacy . )
Orin Kerr , also a law professor at George Washington University , and a blogger at Volokh Conspiracy , has attempted to lay out general principles for applying the Fourth Amendment to the internet .
First , he points out that the traditional inside / outside distinction — the police can watch you in a public place without a warrant , but not in your home — does n’t work very well with regard to cyberspace .
Instead , he proposes a distinction between content and non-content information : the body of an e-mail versus the header information , for example .
The police should be required to get a warrant for the former , but not for the latter .
Second , he proposes that search warrants should be written for particular individuals and not for particular internet accounts .
Meanwhile , Jed Rubenfeld of Yale Law School has tried to reinterpret the Fourth Amendment not in terms of privacy , but in terms of security .
Pointing out that the whole “ expectations ” test is circular — what the government does affects what the government can do — he redefines everything in terms of security : the security that our private affairs are private .
This security is violated when , for example , the government makes widespread use of informants , or engages in widespread eavesdropping — even if no one ’s privacy is actually violated .
This neatly bypasses the whole individual privacy versus societal security question — a balancing that the individual usually loses — by framing both sides in terms of personal security .
I have issues with all of these articles .
Solove ’s taxonomy is excellent , but the sense of outrage that accompanies a privacy violation —
“ How could they know / do / say that ! ? ” — is an important part of the harm resulting from a privacy violation .
The non-content information that Kerr believes should be collectible without a warrant can be very private and personal : URLs can be very personal , and it ’s possible to figure out browsed content just from the size of encrypted SSL traffic .
Also , the ease with which the government can collect all of it — the calling and called party of every phone call in the country — makes the balance very different .
I believe these need to be protected with a warrant requirement .
Rubenfeld ’s reframing is interesting , but the devil is in the details .
Reframing privacy in terms of security still results in a balancing of competing rights .
I ’d rather take the approach of stating the — obvious to me — individual and societal value of privacy , and giving privacy its rightful place as a fundamental human right .
( There ’s additional commentary on Rubenfeld ’s thesis at ArsTechnica . )
The trick here is to realize that a normative definition of the expectation of privacy does n’t need to depend on threats or technology , but rather on what we — as society — decide it should be .
Sure , today ’s technology make it easier than ever to violate privacy .
But it does n’t necessarily follow that we have to violate privacy .
Today ’s guns make it easier than ever to shoot virtually anyone for any reason .
That does n’t mean our laws have to change .
No one knows how this will shake out legally .
These three articles are from law professors ; they ’re not judicial opinions .
But clearly something has to change , and ideas like these may someday form the basis of new Supreme Court decisions that brings legal notions of privacy into the 21st century .

After ordering a cameraman to turn off his camera , Israeli Ambassador to Australia Yuval Rotem engaged in a very frank discussion about the recent Israeli war in the Gaza Strip , calling it “ a preintroduction ” to an attack on Iran that Israel apparently expects within the year .
Before the camera was turned off , Ambassador Rotem said “ the best thing to do is to have a very open dialogue if there are no reporters or journalists here , ” adding “ I am far more reserved in the way I am saying my things ( on camera ) . ”
Unbeknownst to him however Sarah Cummings , a reporter for Australia ’s Seven News service , was actually in attendance at the meeting after having been “ accidentally ” invited .
Israel has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran , and while its officials have repeatedly attempted to tie the Iranian government to its war on the Gaza Strip this is the first time one of their officials has publicly ( if inadvertently so ) suggested that the attack on the strip was a warm - up to its long talked about attack on Iran .
VS Acharya said he was just paying a courtesy visit A minister in the Indian state of Karnataka has made a quick exit after realising he was addressing the wrong election rally .
VS Acharya , the home minister of the southern state and a Bharatiya Janata Party member , saw an opportunity to address a rally in Udupi district .
Observers said he seemed oblivious as he denounced the Congress government - in front of Congress supporters .
A sheepish Mr Acharya later said he was just paying a " courtesy visit " .
In a separate incident the BJP suffered another embarrassment when a top leader called for the repeal of a law that had already been scrapped .
Restless Police at the rally on Sunday in the coastal district of Udupi , 390 km ( 243 miles ) from Bangalore , said the senior BJP leader beat a speedy retreat when he realised his mistake .
Mr Acharya had been on his way to meet a fellow BJP activist when he noticed the rally .
The Times of India said the Congress supporters extended the courtesy expected to be afforded to a minister and offered him a seat .
It said when he rose to speak Mr Acharya was still unaware of his surroundings and began by praising the achievements of the BJP government in Karnataka .
Witnesses said the Congress supporters seemed to be giving him a fair hearing until they became restless at his criticism of the Congress - led federal government .
One of the Congress workers also took exception to the bicycles being given out by the BJP as part of its election campaign .
Observers said a visibly embarrassed Mr Acharya then cut short his speech .
VS Ugrappa , a Congress leader , said Mr Acharya fled when he realised he was addressing Congress workers and not his own party men .
Mr Ugrappa said the BJP was damaging the communal atmosphere in the coastal districts of Mangalore , Udupi and Karwar .
The districts were rocked by a series of attacks on churches last October and an attack by hardline Hindu activists on women for drinking at a pub in Mangalore .
Meanwhile in Assam , top BJP leader Uma Bharati promised to do away with the Illegal Migrants ( Determination by Tribunals ) law only to be told it had been scrapped .
The BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta says Ms Bharati promised to go on a road march to demand its removal until journalists informed her it was shelved in July 2005 .

Chrome has been updated even more since this post was written .
To look at just how awesome Chrome for Linux now is , check out this post .
The current testing builds of Google ’s Open - Source Chromium browser ( I.e Google Chrome ) hit a very welcome update today .
Chromium now sports clickable tabs , new ‘ tab ’ button , the ‘ speed dial ’ page , a basic bookmarks bar , incognito browsing mode , better font rendering , ‘ find ’ bar and feels far more stable .
Tab Bar
The tab bar has been fully over - hauled from the last few builds , and now is pretty much as functional as it should be .
You can click , close and open new tabs with your mouse !
Oh progress !
Tab text / site titles now fits inside the tab instead of spilling over , and favicons are shown .
You can also order the tabs by dragging them around .
Speed Dial
The Speed Dial - esque page has now been implemented , giving you quick access to your favourite sites .
New Tab , New Window , Incognito Mode
All the menu commands for ‘ new tab ’ , ‘ new window ’ and ‘ go incognito ’ now work .
Search And Find
The ‘ ctrl+f ’ command opens up a search field in the same place as the Windows version .
Both the ‘ up ’ and ‘ down ’ arrows work .
In the Windows version the ‘ search box ’ is in a smaller , rounded bar .
Bookmarks
A basic ‘ bookmarks ’ bar has been included though it lacks favicons , the ability to order bookmarks or drag them on to the bar .
It currently only shows whatever pages you ‘ star ’ .
This update shows just how quickly work is progressing on the Chromium build – the expected release date of June really does seem feasible after playing around with the latest iteration !
Sure there are bugs and stability issues , features yet to implement and the small issue of GTK integration .
Aside from those hurdles , it ’s holding up very well and crashes were less frequent .
Documentary examining claims that CS Lewis 's Narnia Chronicles contain a hidden meaning .
CS Lewis wrote the Narnia Chronicles over 50 years ago , yet they are more popular today than ever .
When they were first published , many critics thought them little more than childish scribblings , replete with random characters and unexplained events .
Even Lewis 's good friend JRR Tolkien thought them confused and misconceived .
Other scholars were sure there was something more , something hidden beneath the stories .
Although many tried , none could find this secret key of Narnia - until now .
Dr Michael Ward , a young academic and expert in all things Lewisian , claims he has found the answer at last : he has discovered the Narnia Code .
Using dramatisations of Lewis 's early life and career , the programme travels the world , from the Mid-West of modern America to the battlefields of the First World War , meeting experts , testing evidence and uncovering surprising questions and ideas that still challenge readers today .
Jose Canseco An MMA Star ?
Total Pro Sports –
There ’s lots of people out there that would love to crawl into a ring with Jose Canseco , Mark Mcguire and Jason Giambi for starters , but it looks like the pleasure will go to 7 feet tall kickboxer , Hong Man Choi .
Canseco claims to be taking MMA seriously but that statement does n’t hold much merit coming from a 44 year old juice pig .
Seeing as how steroid enforcement is pretty much a joke in Japan , maybe we ’ll see the most juiced up Canseco ever , but odds are he ’s going to get knocked the f*** out .
You know what they say , snitches get stitches , or in this case , snitches get beat up by a monstrous Chinese dudes .
The Japanese - based DREAM organization today announced an open - weight tournament that features , among others , UFC veteran Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou , K - 1 star Bob Sapp and former Major League Baseball player Jose Canseco .
Aside from the Canseco freak show , there should be a few notable fights in Mark Hunt vs. Gegard Mousasi , and Ikuhisa “ Minowaman ” Minowa vs. Bob Sapp .
Although this open weight tourney wo n’t boast the best in MMA skills , it should feed your need for big guys fighting little guys .
Lets take a look at the other matches in the eight - man tournament at DREAM.9 .
Gesias “ JZ ” Cavalvante vs. Tatsuya Kawajiri
Ronaldo “ Jacare ” Souza vs. Jason “ Mayhem ” Miller ( for vacant middleweight title )
Norifumi “ Kid ” Yamamoto vs. Joe Warren *
Bibiano Fernandes vs. Masakazu Imanari*
Yoshiro Maeda vs. Hiroyuki Takaya *

Maybe it ’s your senile old grandmother who does n’t think anything of it .
Maybe it ’s a co-worker who does it at lunch .
Maybe you do it yourself .
No no , I ’m not talking about masturbating .
( At least I hope I ’m not . )
I ’m referring to the practice of concealed condiment collection — i.e. “ stealing ” ketchup and sugar packets and all those other little individually packaged seasonings you might find at a variety of restaurants .
This is n’t a new concept by any means .
Historical documents dating back to the 1500s talk about routine executions being carried out on the streets of London when a person would try to hide a thimble of jam under their wig while departing the local tea house .
Nowadays many people do n’t even consider it a crime to stuff a few extra packets of jelly in one ’s purse at the local IHOP .
At the very least , plenty of folks agree that ’s it a victimless crime .
After all , you ’re stealing tiny amounts of secondary ingredients from business owners and large multinational corporate minions , most of whom have swimming pools filled with unwanted condiment packets .
Of course , for every person who thinks absconding with restaurant condiments is on the up - and - up , there ’s another who considers it outright theft .
The latter group typically argues that condiments that are distributed for free by restaurants are meant to be used at the restaurant , similarly to how most all - you - can - eat buffets do n’t allow you to remove food from the restaurant .
On the other hand , the average condiment collector will use a variety of reasons for justifying his or her habit :
They ’re practically worthless .
I ’m only taking a few .
I ’m not hurting anyone by doing it .
If restaurants did n’t want people taking condiments , they should n’t make them available .
It ’s just freaking ketchup !
Personally , I ’m somewhere in between the two arguments , but I can already tell you what the anti-collector ’s response would be to some of these excuses for legitimizing covert condiment confiscation .
They ’re practically worthless or I ’m only taking a few .
Restaurant condiments are n’t as cheap as you think .
Bulk ketchup , for example , runs around 3 cents a packet .
Even if a giant chain negotiates that down to a penny each , it ’s still 1 % of the price of those Dollar Menu fries .

What if your boss told you that he or she was taking 1 % of your pay and eating it ?
You ’d be pretty upset !
Each time one of these condiment packets is taken from a restaurant , that ’s money out of the pockets of everyone .
And since executives and managers set pay rates for lower employees , you can probably guess who ’s going to be impacted the most .

Or even better — bring your own !

It ’s just freaking ketchup !
Sure , it starts with ketchup .
Then it might escalate to bigger things like toilet paper rolls from the restaurant bathroom , or cars from the parking lot .
I ’m pretty sure I read a government document stating that most terrorists got their start stealing barbeque sauce from McDonald’s .
Another common argument you ’ll hear from condiment collectors : it saves them money .
Well , so does stealing groceries from the supermarket ; but you ’re not going to walk out of Wal - Mart with a 24 - ounce bottle of mustard tucked under your coat , are you ?
If anything , you ’d save a lot more money by not dining out in these restaurants in the first place .
But since both sides of the condiment coin have their points , I think the best way to settle this argument is with a compromise .
Perhaps if condiment collectors agreed to reduce their activities to only certain items and in very limited quantities , the condiment crusaders would n’t mind it as much .
As for what condiments are okay to collect and which ones are n’t , I would propose the following lists as guidance :
Condiments That Might Be Okay to “ Collect ”
Condiments you ca n’t recreate at home or buy in the store ( e.g. Taco Bell ’s sauce ) .

A reasonable number of necessary condiments when you ’re doing take - out ( e.g. not 42 packets of honey when you only bought a hamburger ) .

Duck and soy sauce .
I ’m pretty sure both flow abundantly through the rivers of Asia .

One bonus condiment of your choice each time the employees are jerks or idiots .
Condiments You Should n’t Be Stealing From Restaurants
Standard condiments like ketchup and mustard .
Just go buy your own at the store .

Yeah , that ’s hijacking .
If we all work together to keep restaurant condiment costs low , we can help ensure that future generations will have access to marvels such as Wendy ’s 99 Cent Super Value Menu .
But if rampant condiment theft continues unchecked , we ’ll become reliant on foreign sources of ketchup which will cause prices to skyrocket , and soon you ’ll be wishing you could dip your fries in crude oil instead .
How do you follow one of the most acclaimed cult shows of recent years ?
A programme that is not only considered the best teen drama ever made but is also still mourned on sites across the internet , taught as a seminar subject at universities and fervently discussed at academic and sci- fi conferences alike .
That 's the problem that has been occupying Joss Whedon since Buffy the Vampire Slayer finished in 2003 .
Post - Buffy , Whedon has bought us Serenity , the movie sequel to his short - lived space opera Firefly , which ran for 14 episodes in 2002 , and internet sensation Dr Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog , which saw How I Met Your Mother star Neil Patrick Harris ham it up as a super - villain in love .
Now the man who gave vampires souls and teenage girls wit has returned to the small screen with Dollhouse , a sci - fi drama about a mysterious agency whose employees have their personalities wiped between assignments , allowing them to be imprinted with a new persona , based on that of a existing person , for each job .
Focusing on former Buffy bad girl Eliza Dushku's Echo , Dollhouse begins as a fairly straightforward procedural , even down to having a different story each week .
However , this being Whedon , things are n't quite as straightforward as they seem .
For a start , there 's the fact that the employees , or dolls , are n't simply working to solve crimes but can also be hired out as anything from romantic partners for love - starved businessmen to , as in the first episode , negotiators in a complicated kidnapping case .
If that sounds like a premise that is not merely ridiculous but also somewhat uncomfortable ( brainwashed young women being used as playthings by wealthy men , anyone ? ) rest assured that Whedon is a couple of steps ahead of you .
As Entertainment Weekly 's television critic Ken Tucker noted , Whedon 's dramas have always been notable for their sly subtext ( thus Buffy 's vampires were a commentary on the agony of teenage romance and the perils of high school while Firefly 's band of outlaws formed a very 21st - century family – heated , frequently pointless arguments and all ) .

So it is that if Dollhouse 's premise seems sexist it 's precisely because Whedon intends it to seem so .
This is Charlie 's Angels by way of Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind and the Bourne films .
" What I wanted to do was talk about the idea of sex and what we expect of each other , " Whedon told Salon.com 's Heather Havrilesky when Dollhouse first aired in the US .
" [ It 's about ] power , love , how these things are all connected .
We 're positing the idea of , if people were in a position to give up their lives then how many of them would ? "
It is precisely that question of free will , or rather of Echo 's lack of it , which has so exercised critics in America .
While the show has received some raves , notably from Havrilesky who said that Whedon was " combining intelligent layers of mystery with sly dialogue and a steady flow of action " , there were just as many negative reviews , most notably that of The Washington Post 's highly respected Tom Shales , who called the new show " a pretentious and risible jumble " .
While Shales 's view is overly harsh , it is certainly true that watching Dollhouse can be a frustrating experience , and one which is made more confusing by the sense that there are two very different stories battling to get out .
The initial five episodes are stand - alone , relatively straightforward , procedurals with a slightly kitsch feel and little or no attempt to either understand Echo 's predicament or delve deeper into why she has chosen to sign her life away – the opening episodes , in particular , with their broad plots and blunted dialogue , seem to serve more as a showcase for Dushku 's acting ability than as a example of Whedon at his subtle best .
But then , around episode six , something entirely different happens .
The show finds its feet , we are treated to the beginnings of a complex mythology , ciphers become well - rounded characters and you find yourself genuinely caring about the people trapped in the mysterious Dollhouse and wondering whether they can escape from their increasingly disturbing predicament .
In a recent interview with the Chicago Tribune Whedon admitted that Dollhouse has undergone a number of growing pains .
" Fox [ the network who commissioned the show for the US ] said , ' do the stand - alone episodes so that people can understand it , so that people can get into the mythology , ' which I get , " he said .
" But because the process got a little twisted some of the stand - alone episodes did n't end up being as textured as I thought they could be . "
And even though the new episodes are as involving and addictive as Whedon 's best work , it is also clear that there are still problems .
For a start
Fox remains a network notoriously uncomfortable about taking a gamble on cult shows with low ratings , as their recent cancellation of The Sarah Connor Chronicles illustrated .
And , while Dollhouse has done better than the Terminator reboot , it is also true that the ratings have n't been exactly set the world aflame .
The most recent episode drew a disappointing 2.9 million viewers , and it's arguable that , as Dollhouse becomes more nuanced , allowing Whedon 's strengths of characterisation and dialogue to come to the fore , so casual viewers searching for an undemanding hour of Friday - night television will become less interested .
Whedon , who remains philosophical about the realities of working in network television , has been here before .
In contrast to some show - runners he is a notoriously slow starter ­– neither Buffy nor vampire drama Angel really hit their stride until their second seasons , while Firefly was just reaching its peak when was it was abruptly cancelled , 11 episodes into its run .
" I got to fly under the radar for eight years on networks so magical that they no longer exist , " he admitted recently to the Chicago Tribune .
" As soon as I came onto the radar and started playing in the grown - up world with Firefly and Dollhouse I started being treated the way every show - runner is treated .
I did think , ' I 've had a track record , so they 'll get it ' .
But there 's no such thing as a track record .
You toil and you toil and you argue and argue and you tear your hair out and go nuts and eventually you either retire , go mad or become powerful enough to make your own show . "
As to whether Dollhouse itself will survive , Whedon insists that the network remains supportive and understands what he is trying to achieve .
" They 're waiting to see what happens , " he said recently at industry event , Paley Fest .
" Fox has said that ] the numbers are solid , the demographic is wonderful and the DVR [ digital video recorder ] ratings have been great , so right now I 've gone from a sort of place of , ' you do n't even care , nobody loves me to ' to a place of God , I can't believe I 'm saying this ... hope .
" We might actually get the chance to do what we 're dying to do , which is tell more of these stories with these crazy people .
Ultimately it 's about what happens in the next few weeks .
I 'm proud of the episodes we have coming up , we 're going to go out with a bang ... and hopefully we 'll get to come back for season two . "
' Dollhouse ' starts on Sci-Fi on 19 May
JOSS WHEDON'S SEMINAL MOMENTS
Buffy The Vampire Slayer : ' Surprise ' and ' Innocence '
The season - two episodes where the show really came into its own as Buffy finally slept with Angel , only to discover that loving a vampire has a terrible price .
Probably the best metaphor for the over - the - top nature of teenage romance ever .
Buffy The Vampire Slayer : ' Once More With Feeling '
The musical episode .
When Whedon announced that the seventh episode of Buffy 's sixth season would be an all - singing , all - dancing extravaganza , even devoted fans worried .
They should n't have .
" Once More With Feeling " takes everything great about the show – the mythology , the humour and the detailed characterisation – and then ramps it up to 11 .
Angel
The LA - set spin - off to Buffy was initially dismissed as the original 's poor cousin but gradually developed into a darkly entertaining show in its own right .
Among the standout episodes were season three 's terrifying " Forgiving " , in which Angel faces off against former friend Wesley in a bid to track down the vampire 's lost son .
Firefly
With Buffy and Angel entering their final seasons , Whedon headed off to try something new at Fox .
The result was this witty space - opera , which Whedon pitched as " nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things " .
Prematurely cancelled midway through its first season , the show was rebooted as a successful movie , " Serenity " .
Dr Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog
Just when you thought that nothing Whedon would ever do could top " Once More With Feeling " , along comes this 43 - minute musical film about a super - villain in love .
Originally aired on the internet during the writers ' strike , " Dr Horrible " became a sensation , and went on to win seven Streamy awards ( given for web television ) including the audience choice for best web series .
Whedon appears on Veronica Mars
From the moment this cult show about a teenage detective aired Whedon heaped praise on it .
His reward was a second - season cameo playing an overbearing car - rental employee alongside a contestant from " America 's Next Top Model " .
To his credit Whedon kept a straight face throughout .
The knitted replica of the village of Mersham , near Ashford , was created by the 40 - strong Afternoon Club .
The model , which was made over a 23 - year period , includes all facets of village life , including sport .
Pictures and cardboard templates of the properties and objects were used by the club to help them immortalise Mersham in wool .
The village was created complete with flowers in the gardens and cars on the roads to capture a slice of community life .
Afternoon Club member , 80 - year - old Margaret Goldup said the village had given so much pleasure to the people who had made it .
The knitted village will be sold off piece by piece in May with all proceeds going towards the local hall .

Mozilla on Monday announced the first alpha release of its Fennec mobile browser for the Windows Mobile 6 operating system ( OS ) .
This alpha is available only on the HTC Touch Pro from Sprint .
Versions for other smartphones will be unveiled later .
While Microsoft continues to upgrade the sixth version of its mobile OS , it is expected to release a new edition , Windows Mobile 7 , next year .
What 's It All About ?
Mozilla first tested Fennec on Maemo , a software platform developed by Nokia with various open source projects , including Debian and Gnome .
Having ironed out some of the problems on that platform , the vendor then moved to Windows Mobile , according to Brad Lassey , lead developer on the Fennec project .
Fennec 's developers rebuilt its user interface controls so they are now entirely based on cascading style sheets ( CSS ) .
This will let Mozilla more easily adjust its UI for various screen sizes and resolutions in the future , Lassey said .
The UI 's look and feel are still a work in progress .
Fennec will run on both Windows Mobile 6 and 6.1 , Lassey told LinuxInsider .
Still a Long and Winding Road
This release of the Fennec alpha for Windows Mobile 6 supports add - ons that let users personalize the browser .
These include a Twitter bar that lets users post comments to Twitter from their device 's address bar and AutoAuth , which automatically submits HTTP authentication dialogs when the user sets the browser to save login information .
Several problems still need to be resolved -- which , after all , is why this alpha was released .
One is panning :
There is a " noticeable delay " between the user first touching the page and the page moving , Lassey said .
Mozilla developers are working on optimizations for drawing that take advantage of graphics processors .
They are also looking at enhancements to the networking layer to optimize the browser for high - latency networks .
The HTC Touch Pro
This alpha release has been optimized for the HTC Touch Pro offered by Sprint .
That 's because the device can run full debug builds of Fennec , Lassey said .
Mozilla will add support for other devices but has not yet decided which ones .
HTC , a Taiwanese device manufacturer founded in 1997 , got its start making phones for the Windows Mobile platform .
In 2008 , figures from research firm IDC showed it had roughly 5 percent of the global market , coming in third after Nokia and Motorola .
Another notable HTC phone is the G1 , offered by T - Mobile , which uses the Android software platform .
The Only Game in Town ?
Windows Mobile 6 has seen two significant updates during its lifecycle .
In April of 2008 , Microsoft released Windows Mobile 6.1 ; Windows Mobile 6.5 is expected soon .
However , the modifications these updates offer have been quite subtle from the user 's point of view .
" There have been no substantial enhancements to the UI and the menu system , " Ryan Reith , senior research analyst at IDC , told LinuxInsider .
" Windows Mobile still has the six - layer menu system like the PC , where to find one thing you have to click through several layers of windows , " Reith said .
That system may see changes with Windows Mobile 7 , expected next year .
7th Time 's the Charm ?
The complexity of the Windows Mobile UI has led OEMs to put their own overlays on top of it to make search easier , Reith said .
However , many manufacturers and developers are waiting to see what Microsoft will do with version 7 of Windows Mobile .
" Version 6.5 was not too fascinating , to be honest , " Reith said .
" Everybody 's waiting to see if they come up with a game changer in version 7 . "
Regardless of which mobile OSes Fennec finally grows into , creating a browser that efficiently navigates the Web from a handheld device with a relatively tiny screen will be no small challenge .
" There are many browsers available for smartphones , " Ken Dulaney , distinguished analyst and vice president at Gartner , told LinuxInsider .
" They all have issues because of inconsistent support for plug-ins and issues with size reduction . "

Despite getting laid off from his banking job on Christmas Eve , Armando Avila has retained his optimism .
The long - time loan officer believes his job skills and experience will be much in demand as steeply falling prices fuel a big upturn in the number of homes sold in California 's Central Valley , where he and his wife live .
"
It 's going to be a good time to be a loan officer , " he said .
Christmas week was quite a time for the Avila family .
First , Armando was laid off on Wednesday - and a Merry Christmas to you .
Then , he and wife , Elizabeth , closed on the house on Friday .
The property is in Madera , a mid-sized city near Fresno , where the housing market has been on a rollercoaster ride .
But the plummeting prices gave Armando and Elizabeth , an administrative assistant with a contracting company , a great buying opportunity .
The house was a bank repossession of more than 1,800 square feet with four bedrooms , two baths and two living rooms on a nearly quarter - acre lot .
They paid just $ 155,000 for a house that last sold for $ 364,000 .
That 's not unusual in Madera .
Prices are half what they were at the top of the market and have dropped 30 % through the first three quarters of the year , according to Zillow.com
" It 's really a good time to buy here , " said Armando .
" You 're able to get a good house in the good side of town for an affordable price .
" A big component of their bargain buy was that they were able to get a great rate on their mortgage - just 5.625 % on a 30 - year fixed rate .
That pegged their monthly payment to just over $ 700 .
" We 're only paying $ 38 more a month than out current rent , " Armando said .
In the rat race of life , one thing is certain : there 's no place like home .
Now , a study published this week in the journal Molecular Ecology finds the same is as true for rats as for humans .
Although inner city rodents appear to roam freely , most form distinct neighborhoods where they spend the majority of their lives .
Like any major city , Baltimore , Md. , has many lively neighborhoods - - each with its own personality .
But scientists from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health say humans are n't the only Baltimoreans loyal to their ' hoods .
Rats typically stay close to home , rarely venturing more than a city block away .
In the face of danger , however , some rodents can travel as far as seven miles to repopulate abandoned areas .
An understanding of how rats in urban areas are connected provides information about which populations may spread disease , according to Sam Scheiner , program director in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's Division of Environmental Biology , which funded the research through the joint NSF - National Institutes of Health Ecology of Infectious Diseases program .
Baltimore 's port was a once major delivery point for grain , likely how Norway rats were first introduced to the city .
Norway rats , also called wharf rats , sewer rats or brown rats , can weigh nearly two pounds and transmit a variety of diseases to humans .
Despite expensive eradication efforts , the number of rats in Baltimore has remained unchanged over the past 50 years , says scientist Greg Glass of Johns Hopkins , who co-authored the Molecular Ecology paper with other researchers from Johns Hopkins and the Yale University School of Medicine .
To understand why , researchers trapped nearly 300 rats from 11 residential areas of Baltimore and conducted genetic studies to see how the rats were related .
The scientists found that East Baltimore rats are separated from their unrelated West - side counterparts by a large waterway known as Jones Falls .
Within these hemispheres , rat families form smaller communities of about 11 city blocks .
Each community is further divided into neighborhoods that span little more than the length of an average alley .
To a city rat , that alley is home sweet home .
The findings suggest that while rats rarely migrate , neighborhood eradication efforts may backfire by encouraging the rodents to repopulate other areas and further spread disease .
When you smell a rat , the researchers say , the best solution may be to tackle the problem on a much larger scale -- perhaps by targeting entire families at once .
Rat race won .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week , while those filing continuing claims hit an all - time high for the ninth straight week , according to a government report released Thursday .
In the week ended March 21 , a total of 652,000 people filed initial jobless claims , up 8,000 from the previous week 's revised figure of 644,000 , the Labor Department reported .
Economists had expected new claims to rise to 650,000 , according to a survey by Briefing.com .
The number of people continuing to file for jobless benefits rose 122,000 to 5,560,000 people in the week ended March 11 - the latest week for which data was available .
It was the highest number since the government began keeping records in 1967 .
Continuing claims have hit record highs as more unemployed Americans struggle to find work .
But the 4 - week moving average of initial claims , which economists say gives a more accurate indication of unemployment trends , came down for the first time in 10 weeks .
The 4 - week moving average for weekly filings , which smoothes out volatile peaks and troughs , was 649,000 , down 1,000 from the previous week 's revised average .
Still , the unemployment rate stands at 8.1 % - the highest level in 25 years - and many economists expect it to exceed 10 % later this year .
" The trend in claims is still upwards , though the rate of increase might be slowing , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics , in a research note .
Thursday 's jobs data come amid a recent bout of better - than - expected economic reports on housing , manufacturing and other critical areas .
These early sings of improvement have helped boost stock prices in recent sessions , but many economists remain skeptical about the prospects for a long - term economic recovery .
" There is no sign of recovery here , " Shepherdson said .
" And claims are usually one of the very first numbers to turn . "

Alternate Versions
In the original 1999 theatrical version , the end credits played over a black background , while the songs " Woody 's Roundup " and " You 've Got a Friend In Me " played out in full .
This version was used for the original 2000 DVD release , and the 2005 release .
Approximately one month after the original theatrical release , the original version of the end credits were replaced with the " outtakes " version .
This version of the end credits was used for the 2010/2011/2015 Blu-ray / DVD / Blu-ray 3D / Digital HD release .
A reformatted version , with the outtakes at the top of the screen instead of on the side , had been used for the original 2000 VHS and DVD release .
The outtakes itself had also been included as a special feature on the 2000 DVD release , the 2005 release and the 2010/2011/2015 Blu-ray / DVD / Blu-ray 3D / Digital HD release .
For the later TV airings , due to the split - screen credits , they show the outtakes and credits separately .
The 2019 UHD release uses the " outtakes " version of the credits , but the clip of Prospector chatting with the Barbies in his box has been removed .
It was also cut from the versions available digitally .

A January 27 New York Times story , “ The Epidemic That Wasn’t , ” brought the news that researchers following children prenatally exposed to cocaine have found “ the long - term effects of such exposure on children ’s brain development and behavior appear relatively small ” and are “ less severe than those of alcohol and are comparable to those of tobacco . ”
Though the Times makes it sound like breaking news , the fact is many reputable people disbelieved the whole “ crack baby ” phenomenon from the beginning : Even Dr. Ira Chasnoff , whose 1985 study spurred much of the early coverage , was lamenting as long ago as 1992 that medical research was being misused : “ It ’s interesting , it sells newspapers and it perpetuates the us - vs . - them idea . ”
Did it ever .
The despicable role played by the press corps is why the Times story feels not just too late but too little .
The paper reports “ there were widespread fears that prenatal exposure to [ crack cocaine ] would produce a generation of severely damaged children , ” and goes on to cite inflammatory headlines as if they were merely reports onthose fears , rather than the means of their creation .
The truth is there would be no “ crack baby ” storyline if not for the zeal with which many in the press corps seized upon limited , qualified medical research as an excuse to at least entertain the idea of writing off huge numbers of overwhelmingly black and poor children .
( Though the research pertained to cocaine in all forms , the story was always about crack , was n’t it ? )
It was n’t a medical researcher who wrote , “ The inner - city crack epidemic is now giving birth to the newest horror : a bio-underclass , a generation of physically damaged cocaine babies whose biological inferiority is stamped at birth ” ; it was the Washington Post ‘s Charles Krauthammer ( Washington Post , 7/30/89 ) .
Krauthammer had American Enterprise Institute media darling Douglas Besharov to thank for the term “ bio-underclass ” , and Besharov was n’t shy about spelling out the wished - for social repercussions : “ This is not stuff that Head Start can fix … .
Whether it is 5 percent or 15 percent of the black community , it is there . ”
Being violently wrong does n’t appear to have dimmed Besharov ’s media star ; nor should we hold our breath for any apologies from Krauthammer for telling readers , “ The dead babies may be the lucky ones . ”
The saddest part : Early on , researchers recognized that the social stigma attached to being identified as a “ crack baby ” could far outweigh any biological impact .
The Times piece underscores that , with a source who says , “ Society ’s expectations of the children and reaction to the mothers are completely guided not by the toxicity but by the social meaning ” of the drug .
But it seems as though journalists are no more likely now than they were then to examine what it is about their own practices that would drive them to perpetuate such a “ social meaning ” when it was not supported by science and when its potential effects were so devastating .
ON WEDNESDAY April 22nd , Britain 's finance minister announced that from April 2010 a new 50 % rate of income tax will be levied on high earners .
This will be among the highest top rate of income tax in the world 's richest countries , with only Sweden taking more .
But taxation is rarely simple .
At $ 218,055 , the income level at which Britain 's new rate kicks in is considerably higher than in Sweden or Belgium .
Switzerland and America may seem softer on their high earners , but local income taxes could bump up the top rate in those countries to over 40 % .
This chart was updated on Friday April 24th with new data supplied by KPMG .

MANY of his church 's " 10 - Point Vision " are blatantly SOCIALIST in nature .
Particularly the two titled : " LIBERATION " , and " ECONOMIC PARITY " .
How many other countries about to be converted to communisim were given these same words ?
Uh , does " ALL " ring a bell ?
If that does n't convince you , how about the words : " COMMITMENT TO AFRICA " ?
Does the LACK of commitment to the United States of America surprise you ?
If you 've EVER listened to a speech by the " Honorable " Lewis Farakkhan , you 'll see where this " commitment " comes from .
He declares that the " Evil Government " of the United States must be brought down .
And I personally heard him declare that " No RELIGION " can exist in this country , and that ONLY in AFRICA can " TRUE RELIGION " EXIST !
Do you have any idea of what Farakkhan considers as " True Religion " ?
Then you honestly know NOTHING about this man .
So , we have Obama , a devoted member of a church that vows allegiance to a continent in shambles ... due to Muslim rebels ( ethnic cleansing ) killing of men , women , children and their dogs .
And this same church praises Lewis Farakkhan , who vows to bring down the U.S. government .
Hmmmmmmm .
Why is America stupid enough ?
... it all comes down to one simple answer .
He is a " black " candidate , and they will vote for him REGARDLESS of what he truly believes , and what the consequences may be to this country .
The next edition of Microsoft 's Office software will include an online version which does n't need to be installed on computers .
It 's a clear rival to other cloud services , such as Google Docs .
There are n't many official details available on the online version yet , but it appears the system will work on several browsers : not just Internet Explorer but also Firefox , Safari and the iPhone browser .
Users who want to do more than simply edit a simple document at once will likely have to install Silverlight , Microsoft 's take on Adobe 's Flash .
This will allow users to upload and collaborate on multiple documents at once .
( Source : theregister.co.uk )
There have been suggestions a web version of Office would include advertising , but this is n't yet confirmed .
The web edition will follow shortly after the release of the full desktop edition of Office 2010 , due out in the first half of next year .
Microsoft claims
Office 2010 will be much more compatible with rival document editing programs and that the firm will publish extensive documentation to allow other firms to produce technology which works with the system .
Technical Secrets Unleashed
However , not everyone is happy with Microsoft 's decision on the matter .
The Redmond - based company is doing this through an ' open format ' for documents known as OOXML .
Though that 's received official recognition as a document standard , critics say it 's unnecessary and Microsoft should have stuck to the independently created ODF system .
As you 'd expect from a product with such a wide customer base , Microsoft is n't adding in any major technical requirements for Office 10 .
It will be available for Windows XP as well as Vista and Windows 7 .
$ 7.7 Billion Spent on Research
The firm says it has put $ 7.7 billion into research and development to improve Office 2010 -- twice its investment in Windows .
But the problem at this stage is that there is very little that can be added in the way of core features .
While the product can always be tweaked and polished , Office already does everything that most users will ever need ; it 's the high price that 's likely to put people off .

No matter how you dress it up , the question on the table is whether the Obama administration should continue to cover–up evidence of the criminal offence of torture , committed by US personnel .
It is a truly remarkable notion that evidence of crimes should be suppressed because it might provoke anger around the world .
Try telling the victim of child abuse that it would be better if we all hushed the facts up , and let the paedophile go free , because news of what happened might spark outrage among the readers of the Sun – who , in turn , might go on a vigilante raid against some innocent paediatrician .
Yet this is basically the argument advanced by Michael Tomasky today .
Tomasky is probably correct when he suggests that the photographs of prisoners being abused by American soldiers will inflame passions .
It is possible that this might even put entirely innocent Americans in danger .
I carry an American passport , and I might be the victim .
I certainly hope none of this happens .
But can these fears really justify the continued cover -up ?
I got off a plane this morning from Washington DC where – sadly – President Obama continues to suppress the evidence of the torture committed against British resident Binyam Mohamed .
Binyam is suffering badly these days , the bitter consequences of the years of torture he endured in American custody , in Pakistan , in Morocco , in the dark prison in Kabul , and in Guantánamo Bay .
So far , the United States has not only refused to apologise , but will not even admit what American personnel did to him .
Bizarrely ( and , as the high court said , the approach of a totalitarian state rather than a democracy ) , the US wo n't even admit where Binyam was for at least two of the seven years he was held without trial .
Binyam does not want revenge ; he is not even calling for people to be locked up for what they did to him .
But he does want the truth to come out , so that others can be spared his fate next time our politicians respond to a terrible crime like September 11 .
We cannot , as he says , expect to learn from history if we do n't know what that history is .
Crimes have been committed in the recent past against Binyam and others .
Unfortunately , another crime is currently being committed when politicians suppress evidence of torture .
As the judges noted in Binyam 's case , section 52 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 makes it an offence to assist in concealing a crime such as torture .
We might all have more sympathy for those keen to sweep all this under the carpet – to " look forward rather than backwards " as the sloganeering suggests – if the American and British officials concerned would put their hands up , admit that they did wrong , and apologise .
Sad to say , this has not happened .
Without truth , there is unlikely to be any reconciliation .
A 27 - year old woman was rushed to the hospital after a kinky encounter with her partner resulted in injuries that I would rather not contemplate .
Sufficed to say , dildos and saber saws do n't mix .
Amazingly enough , these DIYers fitted the sex toy right over the blade .
Yup ... it was still attached .
And no , this did n't happen in Germany .
It happened in Maryland where the woman was medevaced to Prince George 's County Hospital .
The good news is that the woman has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home from her injuries .
Let that be a lesson to you —HGTV is a good place to pick up ideas for the bedroom , but not for the bedroom .
You know what I 'm saying ?

I thought we'd try something new before class today , " says Nathan , the Evangelism 101 teaching assistant .
" A little cheer . "
My roommate Eric turns to me .
" God is good .
Bet you ten bucks . "
Before I can ask what he means , Nathan sets down his microphone and shouts through cupped hands , " God is good ! "
" All the time ! " responds the class in unison .
Eric pumps his fist .
" Awesome ! " says Nathan .
" You guys must remember this from your youth groups .
Now , let 's see if you remember the second part : and all the time ... "
The class shouts back : " God is good ! "
Nathan waves his arms with brio , conducting the class like John Philip Sousa leading a parade march .
" God is good ... "
" All the time ! "
" And all the time ... "
" God is good ! "
I 've been back from spring break for two days now , and I 'm starting to settle back into my classes .
As you might guess from a lecture that begins with a cheer , Evangelism 101 is somewhat of a gut .
Our professor , Pastor Andy Hillman , conducts the class like a large , for - credit session of Sunday school , with test questions like :
God wants to be your ____ .
a ) Slave
b) Best friend *
c ) Priest
The ultimate goal of the universe is to show ____ .
a ) the love of God
b ) the glory of God
c ) the power of God
d ) all of the above *
The upside of an easy class like Evangelism 101 is simple : I 'm not failing .
In fact , in most of my courses , I 'm improving much more quickly than I expected to .
Nobody 's going to be throwing any Rhodes scholarships my way after this semester , but most of my grades are up in the B - plus range .
Despite it being my worst class grade - wise , I 'm still liking my Old Testament class better than any of the others .
In addition to the lessons about Deuteronomy and Judges , it 's fun to flesh out the oversimplified nuggets of Old Testament lore that make it into secular pop culture .
For example : I 've heard a million ESPN commentators refer to a lopsided matchup as a " David and Goliath situation , " but I 'd never read the Bible 's account of the actual battle .
I did n't know that Goliath was not only huge about nine feet tall , with a 125 - pound cloak of armor he was also " uncircumcised , " according to 1 Samuel 17:26 .
This bit of information gives me a leg up on my ESPN - watching secular friends .
A juvenile leg , but a leg nonetheless .
I 'm finding that my favorite courses , like Old Testament and Theology , have something in common : they 're surveys , classes in which the professor 's goal is simply to introduce a body of new information .
The information always has a literalist slant , of course , but on the whole , the classes are fairly straightforward .
You 'd find the same thing at a hundred other Christian colleges and Bible study groups .
There 's another type of class , though the agenda - driven class .
In these courses , professors are n't teaching new knowledge so much as teaching students how to think about the world around them .
A week or two before spring break , I started sitting in on GNED II , a mandatory second - semester extension of my GNED course .
I 'm only at Liberty for one semester , so I 'll never get to take GNED II for a grade , but people on my hall kept talking about it , and I wanted to get the flavor .
The GNED II class I 've been going to , like my GNED I class , is taught by Dr. Parks .
In it , Liberty students are taught to view sociopolitical topics like homosexuality , abortion , and euthanasia through an ultraconservative Christian lens .
And unlike its first - semester counterpart , GNED II pulls no punches .
Its workbook contains fill - in - the blank sections like :
And :
In today 's GNED II class , Dr. Parks announces that we will be talking about gender roles in the evangelical world .
Dr. Parks spends the first ten minutes of class laying out the two main positions evangelical Christians take on gender issues .
The first position , egalitarianism , means exactly what you 'd expect it to mean men and women are equal , both in the church and in the home .
Women can be pastors of a church , they can teach Sunday school , and husbands and wives share equal authority in marriage .
The second position , called complementarianism , means , in Dr. Parks 's words , that " God created man and woman with different roles that complement each other . "
Complementarians believe that only men can be pastors , that only men can teach Sunday school or other Christian education classes ( unless it 's an all - female class ) .
Complementarians also maintain that the husband should be the head of the household .
They quote Ephesians 5:24 , " As the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything ( NIV ) . "
" You can obviously tell where I am on this , " Dr. Parks says .
" I am definitely a complementarian , without apology .
I think the egalitarian view is greatly skewed . "
Dr. Parks clicks a few buttons on his laptop to start a PowerPoint slideshow .
The text is accompanied by photos of white , midthirties couples clutching each other , loving gazes plastered on their faces .
As the presentation plays , we fill in the blanks in our workbooks :
Dr. Parks realizes that to a nonevangelical , the complementarian view of gender roles can sound misogynistic , but he assures us that it 's not .
Women can still hold high - power jobs under the complementarian model , he says , and they should still get equal pay for equal work .
But when push comes to shove , a woman 's priority should be her family .
" For a woman , " Dr. Parks says , " if the career is most important , and the family gets left out , that 's a problem . "
At first , I could n't believe Liberty actually had a course that teaches students how to condemn homosexuals and combat feminism .
GNED II is the class a liberal secularist would invent if he were trying to satirize a Liberty education .
It 's as if Brown offered a course called Secular Hedonism 101 : How to Smoke Pot , Cross - dress , and Lose Your Morals .
But unlike that course , GNED II actually exists , so I 've had to figure out how to process it .
I keep thinking back to Marcus Ross , the creation studies professor who was written up in the New York Times for his doctoral research on 65 million - year - old reptiles .
Ross was able to compartmentalize his brain into two functional halves a religious half and a secular half - and for a while , I was too .
I could sit in History of Life class and hear Dr. Dekker talk about the flaws in Darwinism without going crazy , because I convinced myself that I was just filling an alternate space in my brain .
What 's the harm in that ?
GNED II is different , though .
I can't convince myself that those lessons about fornicators and homosexuals are innocuous .
For one , whereas I 'm not an expert in evolutionary biology , I do have enough experience with gay people to know that homosexuality is not a " compulsive lifestyle involving many sexual partners . "
( In fact , a lot of my gay friends at Brown spend a lot of time complaining about how little sex they 're having . )
But aside from the patently offensive content , my biggest issue with GNED II is the way it bundles political and social issues with religious issues , and what that means for a guy who 's trying to give Christianity a fair shake .
Over spring break , I finally finished Left Behind , the apocalyptic novel I started a month or so ago .
And per my expectations ( spoiler alert ! ) the secular journalist Buck Williams has a religious conversion .
I 'll spare you the details it involves a Romanian politician who turns out to be the Antichrist but suffice it to say that Buck deals with his skepticism , gets down on his knees , and accepts Christ as his savior .
That part did n't bother me so much .
The part that worried me was the lead - up to that conversion .
A few pages before Buck converts , his thought process is described in these terms :
" If this was true , all that Rayford Steele had postulated and Buck knew instinctively that if any of it was true , all of it was true why had it taken Buck a lifetime to come to it ? "
That middle clause " Buck knew instinctively that if any of it was true , all of it was true " is the same rationale Liberty professors use to prove that the earth is six thousand years old or that wives must submit to their husbands .
If the Bible is infallible , my professors all say , and if the parts about Jesus dying for our sins are true , then a host of other things must also be true , including the sinfulness of homosexuality , the pro-life platform , and the imminence of the rapture .
In Liberty 's eyes , the ultraconservative interpretation of scripture carries the same inerrancy as scripture itself , and if you do n't buy it all if you 're a liberal or moderate Christian you 're somehow less than faithful .
That sort of prix fixe theology , where Christianity comes loaded with a slate of political views , is a big part of the reason I 've been hesitant to accept Liberty 's evangelicalism this semester .
Somewhere down the road , I might be able to believe in Jesus as Lord , but I could never believe that homosexuality is a sinful lifestyle or tell my future wife to submit to me as her husband .
I suppose it's weird that I 'm more attached to my social and political views than my religious beliefs .
Is it really more reasonable to believe that the savior of the world was born of a virgin , lived a sinless life , died for our sins , and was resurrected three days later than to believe that the universe frowns on gay people ?
On a purely logical level , probably not .
But it is what it is , and it does me no good to pretend otherwise .
The mind , as we know , is a funny thing .

Interim Federal Communications Commission chair Michael Copps has just called for a fifth Internet non-discrimination principle that would be added to the existing four .
He told a Friday morning breakfast audience at the National Cable and Telecommunications Association 's Cable Show in Washington , DC that the time has ( almost ) come to beef up the FCC's Internet Policy Statement ( PDF ) .
After his commentary , Copps told press that the agency should wait to act on this matter until its next permanent chair arrives — he most likely being White House nominee Julius Genachowski .
No messing around
What is this fifth principle ?
After reading various Coppsian manifestos over the last three years , the concept seems to boil down to a formal warning that if ISPs block , throttle , hobble , molest , unfairly prioritize , too deeply packet inspect , or otherwise selectively interfere with protocols or devices on the Internet , the Commission will go into clobbering mode pretty darned quick .
" If everyone knew the FCC was on the job , " Copps darkly warned at an April 2008 Stanford University hearing on network management practices , " that we had forthrightly staked out our principles , that everyone knew we would deal with any and all complaints that came in , and that those who do discriminate will be punished , word would get out pretty fast that no one should be messing around with the openness of the ' Net . "
It looks like the agency 's temporary boss first floated this idea back in July of 2006 when he dissented from the FCC 's approval of Comcast and Time - Warner 's joint snarfdown of the remnants of Adelphia Communications .
" To keep our policies current , we need to go beyond the original four principles and commit industry and the FCC to a specific principle of enforceable non-discrimination , " Copps declared at the time , " one that allows for reasonable network management but makes clear that broadband network providers will not be allowed to shackle the promise of the Internet in its adolescence . "
Neutral manners
The FCC came up with its first four principles , ironically , after it had set up a relaxed regulatory regime for both cable and telephone company ISPs .
In June 2005 , the Supreme Court upheld the Commission 's controversial Brand X decision , which classified cable Internet as an " information service " — letting cable ISPs off the hook for various common carrier requirements .
Two months later , the FCC extended the same generosity to telcos .
At the same time , the agency declared that ISPs did have a duty to provide their services in a " neutral manner , " and it issued its first four precepts :
To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet , consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice .
To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet , consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice , subject to the needs of law enforcement .
To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet , consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network .
To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet , consumers are entitled to competition among network providers , application and service providers , and content providers .
The policy statement also asserted that the FCC has the authority to enforce these concepts based on the agency 's " ancillary jurisdiction to regulate interstate and foreign communications . "
But Copps has never thought the four principles were enough .
At Stanford he called for a " a clear , strong declaration that we will not tolerate unreasonable discrimination by network operators " — and added that it should apply to wireless services , too .
At the event , the Commissioner conceded that coming up with this fifth leg will not be easy .
" These are evolving technologies and sometimes the line between reasonable network management and outright discrimination can be less than crystal clear , " he added .
" But that ’s why we need a for - sure enforcement process , to sift through complaints , to make the judgment calls , and , over time , to compile some case law and precedent so things become clearer . "
Copps invoked the fifth yet again when the FCC sanctioned Comcast for protocol throttling in August 2008 .
One wonders which Jane Austen novel the agency 's senior Democrat was reading when he wrote his speech .
" A clearly - stated commitment of non-discrimination would make clear that the Commission is not having a one - night stand with net neutrality , but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life , " he opined .
" A fifth principle will provide the needed reminder to all — long after the details of this case become blurry history — that the Commission ’s policy of network openness is ongoing and its remedies are always available . "
Are these rules really rules ?
But before , while , or after the FCC adds principle five to the present list of regulatory vows , it has to defend the previous four in federal court .
Last we checked , Comcast is still suing the agency over its P2P Order .
The company has yet to submit a detailed brief against the action in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals .
But even before the Commission lowered the boom on the cable giant , Comcast veep David Cohen noted that when the FCC issued its Internet Policy Statement , then - Chair Kevin Martin issued a press comment stating that such texts " do not establish rules nor are they enforceable documents . "
That remark might show up more than once in the trial .
And when dissenting from the FCC's Order against Comcast , Commissioner Robert M. McDowell wondered out loud what legal authority these principles had when the agency never ran a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking before enacting them .
" Nothing regulating Internet network governance has been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations , " McDowell noted .
" In short , we have no rules to enforce .
This matter would have had a better chance on appeal if we had put the horse before the cart and conducted a rulemaking , issued rules , and then enforced them . "
So it could be a spell before that fifth principle gets cast in cement .
In the meantime , the first four might be in for some scrutiny , too .
America is devolving into a third - world nation .
And if we do not immediately halt our elite ’s rapacious looting of the public treasury we will be left with trillions in debts , which can never be repaid , and widespread human misery which we will be helpless to ameliorate .
Our anemic democracy will be replaced with a robust national police state .
The elite will withdraw into heavily guarded gated communities where they will have access to security , goods and services that cannot be afforded by the rest of us .
Tens of millions of people , brutally controlled , will live in perpetual poverty .
This is the inevitable result of unchecked corporate capitalism .
The stimulus and bailout plans are not about saving us .
They are about saving them .
We can resist , which means street protests , disruptions of the system and demonstrations , or become serfs .
We have been in a steady economic decline for decades .
The Canadian political philosopher John Ralston Saul detailed this decline in his 1992 book “ Voltaire ’s Bastards : The Dictatorship of Reason in the West . ” David Cay Johnston exposed the mirage and rot of American capitalism in “ Free Lunch : How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense ( and Stick You With the Bill ) , ” and David C. Korten , in “ When Corporations Rule the World ” and “ Agenda for a New Economy , ” laid out corporate malfeasance and abuse .
But our universities and mass media , entranced by power and naively believing that global capitalism was an unstoppable force of nature , rarely asked the right questions or gave a prominent voice to those who did .
Our elites hid their incompetence and loss of control behind an arrogant facade of specialized jargon and obscure economic theories .
The lies employed to camouflage the economic decline are legion .
President Ronald Reagan included 1.5 million U.S. Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine service personnel with the civilian work force to magically reduce the nation ’s unemployment rate by 2 percent .
President Bill Clinton decided that those who had given up looking for work , or those who wanted full - time jobs but could only find part - time employment , were no longer to be counted as unemployed .
This trick disappeared some 5 million unemployed from the official unemployment rolls .
If you work more than 21 hours a week — most low - wage workers at places like Wal - Mart average 28 hours a week — you are counted as employed , although your real wages put you below the poverty line .
Our actual unemployment rate , when you include those who have stopped looking for work and those who can only find part - time jobs , is not 8.5 percent but 15 percent .
A sixth of the country is now effectively unemployed .
And we are shedding jobs at a faster rate than in the months after the 1929 crash .
The consumer price index , used by the government to measure inflation , is meaningless .
To keep the official inflation figures low the government has been substituting basic products it once measured to check for inflation with ones that do not rise very much in price .
This sleight of hand has kept the cost - of - living increases tied to the CPI artificially low .
The New York Times ’ consumer reporter , W.P. Dunleavy , wrote that her groceries now cost $ 587 a month , up from $ 400 a year earlier .
This is a 40 percent increase .
California economist John Williams , who runs an organization called Shadow Statistics , contends that if Washington still used the CPI measurements applied back in the 1970s , inflation would be 10 percent .
The corporate state , and the political and intellectual class that served the corporate state , constructed a financial and political system based on illusions .
Corporations engaged in pyramid lending that created fictitious assets .
These fictitious assets became collateral for more bank lending .
The elite skimmed off hundreds of millions in bonuses , commissions and salaries from this fictitious wealth .
Politicians , who dutifully served corporate interests rather than those of citizens , were showered with campaign contributions and given lucrative jobs when they left office .
Universities , knowing it was not good business to challenge corporatism , muted any voices of conscience while they went begging for corporate donations and grants .
Deceptive loans and credit card debt fueled the binges of a consumer society and hid falling wages and the loss of manufacturing jobs .
The Obama administration , rather than chart a new course , is intent on re-inflating the bubble .
The trillions of dollars of government funds being spent to sustain these corrupt corporations could have renovated our economy .
We could have saved tens of millions of Americans from poverty .
The government could have , as consumer activist Ralph Nader has pointed out , started 10 new banks with $ 35 billion each and a 10 - to - 1 leverage to open credit markets .
Vast , unimaginable sums are being placed into these dirty corporate hands without oversight .
And they will use this money as they always have — to enrich themselves at our expense .
“ You are going to see the biggest waste , fraud and abuse in American history , ” Nader warned when I asked about the bailouts .
“ Not only is it wrongly directed , not only does it deal with the perpetrators instead of the people who were victimized , but they do n’t have a delivery system of any honesty and efficiency .
The Justice Department is overwhelmed .
It does n’t have a tenth of the prosecutors , the investigators , the auditors , the attorneys needed to deal with the previous corporate crime wave before the bailout started last September .
It is especially unable to deal with the rapacious ravaging of this new money by these corporate recipients .
You can see it already .
The corporations have n’t lent it .
They have used some of it for acquisitions or to preserve their bonuses or their dividends .
As long as they know they are not going to jail , and they do n’t see many newspaper reports about their colleagues going to jail , they do n’t care .
It is total impunity .
If they quit , they quit with a golden parachute .
Even [ General Motors CEO Rick ]
Wagoner is taking away $ 21 million . ”
There are a handful of former executives who have conceded that the bailouts are a waste .
American International Group Inc. ’s former chairman , Maurice R. Greenberg , told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday that the effort to prop up the firm with $ 170 billion has “ failed . ”
He said the company should be restructured .
AIG , he said , would have been better off filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection instead of seeking government help .
“ These are signs of hyper decay , ” Nader said from his office in Washington .
“ You spend this kind of money and do not know if it will work . ”
“ Bankrupt corporate capitalism is on its way to bankrupting the socialism that is trying to save it , ” Nader added .
“ That is the end stage .
If they no longer have socialism to save them then we are into feudalism .
We are into private police , gated communities and serfs with a 21st century nomenclature . ”
We will not be able to raise another 3 or 4 trillion dollars , especially with our commitments now totaling some $ 12 trillion , to fix the mess .
It was only a couple of months ago that our expenditures totaled $ 9 trillion .
And it was not long ago that such profligate government spending was unthinkable .
There was an $ 800 billion limit placed on the Federal Reserve a year ago .
The economic stimulus and the bailouts will not bring back our casino capitalism .
And as the meltdown shows no signs of abating , and the bailouts show no sign of working , the recklessness and desperation of our capitalist overlords have increased .
The cost , to the working and middle class , is becoming unsustainable .
The Fed reported in March that households lost $ 5.1 trillion , or 9 percent , of their wealth in the last three months of 2008 , the most ever in a single quarter in the 57 - year history of record keeping by the central bank .
For the full year , household wealth dropped $ 11.1 trillion , or about 18 percent .
These figures did not record the decline of investments in the stock market , which has probably erased trillions more in the country ’s collective net worth .
The bullet to our head , inevitable if we do not radically alter course , will be sudden .
We have been borrowing at the rate of more than $ 2 billion a day over the last 10 years , and at some point it has to stop .
The moment China , the oil - rich states and other international investors stop buying treasury bonds the dollar will become junk .
Inflation will rocket upward .
We will become Weimar Germany .
A furious and sustained backlash by a betrayed and angry populace , one unprepared intellectually and psychologically for collapse , will sweep aside the Democrats and most of the Republicans .
A cabal of proto - fascist misfits , from Christian demagogues to simpletons like Sarah Palin to loudmouth talk show hosts , who we naively dismiss as buffoons , will find a following with promises of revenge and moral renewal .
The elites , the ones with their Harvard Business School degrees and expensive vocabularies , will retreat into their sheltered enclaves of privilege and comfort .
We will be left bereft and abandoned outside the gates .
Radio host Savage seeks Clinton 's help over ban Free speech

In an unexpected twist , sharp - tongued , conservative talk show host Michael Savage , who in the past savaged Hillary Clinton as a " dangerous human being " and " fraudulent huckster , " has asked for help after being banned in Britain - from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Attorneys for the controversial San Francisco host of the syndicated " Savage Nation " radio show , say the ban is of a blatant human rights violation and formally asked Clinton on Thursday to demand that British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith " rescind the arbitrary and capricious decision " last week to " name and shame " 16 individuals , including Savage , who have been barred from entry into the country .
Smith made headlines - and raised eyebrows - when she included Savage on a list that also includes Islamic terrorists , Russian skinhead killers and neo -Nazis , saying that the individuals do n't represent the United Kingdom 's " values . "
" It 's ironic that the person Michael Savage is appealing to is someone who does not agree with him on 99 percent " of his political views , said attorney Richard Thompson , president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Law Center of Ann Arbor , Mich. , which is representing Savage .
" But I think this is a case of the U.S. government protecting a U.S. citizen , regardless of what he said , " especially since it involves a violation of international treaties signed by both the United States and Britain , Thompson said .
He said Clinton should act on Savage 's behalf because it 's the right thing to do - to make a statement about the importance of protecting " the rights of an American citizen , " who happens to be the third - most - popular talk show host in the United States " and has done nothing illegal . "
Savage is guilty of one thing alone , he said , " exercising his right to free speech . "
Savage - whose show reaches an estimated 8 million to 10 million listeners on nearly 400 stations nationwide , according to industry sources - told The Chronicle in an exclusive interview Thursday that " I 've been very harsh on Hillary and Bill ( Clinton ) over the years . "
" But precisely for this reason , she should take my case .
It would show that she can rise above partisan politics , " he said , " because Jacqui Smith is in violation of the European Union 's laws themselves . "
Savage acknowledged that this development is unexpected and said it underscores the oldest of political adages : " Politics makes strange bedfellows . "
Thompson 's letter to Clinton urges her to immediately " call upon the government of the United Kingdom " to undo the decision to put the outspoken right - wing host on a " least - wanted list . "
He argued to Clinton that the banning of Savage is both " arbitrary " and " suspicious " given that his show is not even broadcast in Britain and it has never been explained to Savage , who has had no contact with the British government .
Moreover , Thompson contends , the move by Smith is clearly illegal : Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights clearly protects the right to " freedom of expression . "
Article 10 states that " this right shall include the freedom to hold opinions ... and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . "
Thompson also said that Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , signed by both the United States and Britain , " protects the right to freedom of expression . "
A U.S. State Department official , speaking on background , did not appear to support Thompson 's contention .
" We recognize that countries have the right to determine who is eligible to enter , " said the official , who declined to speculate on whether Clinton would act on the matter .
And Robin Newmann , spokesman for the British Consulate in San Francisco , responded in an e-mail that " His exclusion from the U.K. is both lawful and justified . "
The British Home Office , in making the announcement last week banning the 16 individuals , said Savage 's radio show constituted " engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence . "
Newmann said last week that " the U.K. has been able to ban people who promote hatred , terrorist activities and serious violence since 2005 .
During this time , 101 people have been excluded for unacceptable behavior , including animal rights extremists , right - to - life , homophobe and far - right extremists , as well as those who advocate hatred and violence in support of their religious beliefs . "
Newmann added that in 2008 , Smith " introduced new measures that favored excluding people who have spread hatred . "
In releasing the list of 16 , Smith issued a statement : " I refuse to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life .
Therefore , I will not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views as I want them to know that they are not welcome here . "
But Savage said he does not intend to let the British home secretary have the last word .
He vowed Thursday that his representatives will appeal to the White House if necessary to seek redress - and said he intends to file a lawsuit against Smith herself later this week , charging her with defamation of character .
BICYCLE REPAIR
Bike Wash A portable repair stand makes bike washing easier
Sure a clean bicycle looks nice , plus its also easier to work on , smoother to ride , and will last longer .
Cleaning can also reveal faulty parts or frame defects before they become troublesome .
With this in mind , pro team mechanics clean their riders  bikes after each day of racing .
You dont need to wash your bicycle after every ride .
You can usually spruce it up with just a moist rag and some polish ( Lemon Pledge works great ) .
But several times a year , particularly after off - road or foul - weather rides , you should wash it thoroughly .
Here 's how many professional mechanics do this .
Please note that while it may seem like you can just blast your bike clean in seconds with a high - pressure hose , that ’s a terrible mistake you never want to make .
High - pressure water , especially sprayed from the side , will blast the grease and lubricants right out of the components , such as the hubs , bottom bracket and headset .
And it ’s a big job to get the water out and fresh grease back in .
That ’s why you always just trickle the water over the frame from the top when washing and rinsing .
Equipment
Round up the following :
a way to suspend or hold the bike upright ( a car rack works ; or use your repair stand , if you have one ) a hose or water source diesel fuel or your favorite degreaser 2 buckets ( one for greasy and another for soapy water ) brushes ( supermarkets usually have a good selection or you can buy those offered by Park Tool ) sponges rags lube polish or wax steel wool ( for rust removal on steel parts if applicable ) touch - up paint Notes
Mark the brushes to keep greasy ones separate so you dont get grease or grime on bar tape , etc .
Dont turn the bike upside down to clean it because fluids will run into the headset thinning the grease .
Diesel fuel is what race mechanics use to clean greasy parts because it contains a bit of lubricant , which ensures the parts are never completely stripped of lube .
While its possible to remove the chain for cleaning , most modern chains require replacement pins for reinstallation .
So it s usually best to clean it on the bike as shown .
Dont use Armor
All on tires .
It makes them slippery .
Cant find the right color touch - up paint ?
Try fingernail polish .
It comes in many colors .
Be sure to check out Robert Studdiford of TwoFish bicycle accessories ' " Revlon Dream " fingernail - polish paint job , which was inspired by my tip to touch - up with fingernail polish ; only he spent 200 hours applying it dot by dot to paint his bicycle !
Step 1 .
Stand the bike up or put it in your repair stand and remove the wheels .
Extract the rear quick - release skewer and tighten it in the rear dropouts letting the chain rest on it ( on many frames you can insert a long screwdriver through the dropouts instead ) .
The skewer or screwdriver lets you turn the crank without having the chain scrape the frame .
Step 2 .
Fill the buckets with water .
Put soap in one and soap and a small amount of diesel fuel in the other .
The bucket with soap is for cleaning the bike .
The one with fuel is for drivetrain parts .
Step 3 . Lightly spray degreaser on the chain , derailleurs , crankset and cassette cogs .
Let it soak in a bit to disolve the grime .
In general , dont spray degreaser , water , or lubricants directly at the hubs , headset , cassette body , pedals or bottom bracket .
Doing so will wash away grease from the bearings and cause wear .
Always squirt from the top rather than the side .
Step 4 .
While turning the crank , use a stiff brush dipped in the diesel fuel mixture to scrub the top and bottom of the chain as it passes over the QR skewer or screwdriver .
You can also try a sponge if you prefer to hold the chain .
It will probably take several revolutions of the chain to get it clean .
Just keep cranking and dipping and scrubbing until its clean .
Alternatively , some people like to use a chain cleaner tool , such as Park Tool’s .
This device snaps onto the chain and includes brushes .
You add solvent or lube and then simply pedal to scrub the chain clean .
Turn the crank and brush / wipe the chain
Brush the derailleurs and chainrings Step 5 .
Brush the derailleurs and chainrings with the fuel solution until they re clean .
You might also want to use a rag with a shoe - shine motion to get into the nooks and crannies and between the chainrings .
If you used a chain cleaner tool ( described above ) , you can just wipe everything clean with a rag .
Step 6 .
Drip water over the bike with the hose to wet it .
Then use a clean brush to remove any dirt and dried mud from the frame ( this will scratch the paint if you try to wipe it off with a rag when it 's dry ) .
Step 7 .
Use the soap solution and the non-greasy brushes and sponges to clean the rest of the bike .
A sponge works best on handlebar tape , cables and tubing .
The brushes are for hard - to - reach spots .
Be sure to clean the pedals and the underside of the seat .
If you have a frame pump , nows a good time to clean it , too , and check it to make sure its working well .
Use the soapy water to clean the bike
Step 8 .
Rest the rear wheel on the fuel bucket and brush the cassette cogs to clean them .
Another technique that works well is inserting a rag between the cogs and using a shoe - shine motion to clean off the grease and grime .
Park Tool also makes a GearClean tool with a brush on one end and a toothed plastic arm on the other .
You can use the arm to clean between cogs .
When you re working , avoid getting fuel / solvent into the cassette body bearings by only applying it from above , never from the side or back of the cassette .
Step 9 .
Clean both wheels over the soap bucket ( so you dont have to bend over to scrub ) .
Use the sponges and brushes on the rims , nipples , spokes , hubs , tires and cassette .
While you re cleaning the rims and nipples , look closely to see if there are any cracks in the rims by the nipples .
This is a fairly common failure on heavily used wheels and low spoke - count wheels too .
Step 10 .
Hold the hose over the top of the bike and let the water dribble over the parts and frame .
Do the same to the wheels .
Rinse all the soap and any remaining grit or grime off .
Step 11 .
Dry the bike with soft rags .
Use separate rags for the drivetrain and frame .
Rub the rim sidewalls clean where rubber deposits have formed from the brake shoes .
Acetone works well for this , but dont breathe it or let it touch your skin or rubber parts because itll melt them .
Step 12 .
You might want to wax the painted parts and any chrome parts .
Wax will protect the paint and prevent chrome from rusting .
Let the wax dry and then polish the parts with a clean rag .
Step 13 .
Reassemble the bike being sure to get the wheels tight and centered in the frame .
Step 14 .
Use a drip or spray lube to lubricate the brake and derailleur pivots and the chain .
Apply some on the cables and clipless pedal pivots , too .
If you notice any cracks or worn parts , repair and replace as necessary before riding .
Six years ago I jumped at an opportunity to join the international team that was identifying the sequence of DNA bases , or “ letters , ” in the genome of the common chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) .
As a biostatistician with a long - standing interest in human origins , I was eager to line up the human DNA sequence next to that of our closest living relative and take stock .
A humbling truth emerged : our DNA blueprints are nearly 99 percent identical to theirs .
That is , of the three billion letters that make up the human genome , only 15 million of them — less than 1 percent — have changed in the six million years or so since the human and chimp lineages diverged .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration 's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees .
President Obama says the commissions are OK , " provided that they are properly structured and administered . "
On the heels of Obama 's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan , the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president 's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes .
Obama said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years : the Military Commissions
Act put in place under the Bush administration in 2006 , but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court .
The president said military commissions " are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war , provided that they are properly structured and administered . "
But , he said , the 2006 act " failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees . "
He said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor .
Statements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment , such as waterboarding , will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions , Obama said , and hearsay evidence will be limited .
The revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify .
Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts .
" These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " Obama said .
He said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law .
Sen . John McCain , R - Arizona , applauded his former opponent .
" Today 's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security , " McCain said in a written statement .
But Obama 's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union .
The ACLU chided the military commission decision as " a striking blow to due process and the rule of law . "
" These military commissions are inherently illegitimate , unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust , " said Anthony D. Romero , the group 's executive director .
" Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide ' more due process ' is absurd ; there is no such thing as ' due process light . ' " he said .
" If the administration 's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements , there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system .
If they do n't , these tribunals have no place in our democracy . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States .
" First and foremost , the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States , " Gibbs told reporters .
Obama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office , the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120 - day review of the whole process .
The review deadline is next week .
Gibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil .
Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions .
Three Guantanamo detainees ' cases have gone through the commission so far .
The Bush administration established the military trial system after the U.S. military began capturing detainees in Afghanistan in late 2001 .
The next year , it opened the Guantanamo facility , saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system .
But legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated .
One lawyer representing a client at Guantanamo said closing the detention facility , which Obama is advocating , is a " meaningless gesture " if the military commissions continue .
" The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed , " said Army Maj .
Jon S. Jackson , a lawyer for Mustafa al - Hawsawi , one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , is the most high - profile of those defendants .

Californian utility PG&E caused a stir in the media recently with an announcement that they are seeking approval from state regulators for a power purchase agreement with Solaren Corp. to deliver 200 MW of power by 2016 for a 15 year period .
Californian utilities have been signing deals with a wide range of renewable energy providers in recent years in order to meet the state 's mandated clean energy targets - the unusual aspect of this announcement is that Solaren is proposing to generate the power using solar panels in earth orbit , then convert it to radio frequency energy for transmission to a receiving station in Fresno County where it will be fed into the grid .
PG&E's Next 100 blog has an interview with Solaren CEO Gary Spirnak , in which he claims that while this will be the world 's first SSP plant , and no system of this scale and exact configuration has been built before , the " underlying technology is very mature and is based on communications satellite technology " .
PG&E has promised to buy the power at an agreed - upon rate ( comparable to the rate specified in other agreements for renewable - energy purchases ) according to company spokesman Jonathan Marshall , however neither PG&E nor Solaren are saying what that rate is .
PG&E is not making an up - front investment in Solaren 's venture .
PG&E 's interest in this sort of ambitious project is prompted by California 's mandates to obtain 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010 and 33 percent by 2020 .
There is more energy to be collected - the sun is more intense in orbit than on the surface of the Earth
Space based systems can collect energy almost around the clock
Ground - based systems suffer from weather phenomena such as clouds , precipitation , and dust - space based system do not ( though the increasing amount of junk in orbit poses a similar hazard )
Real estate costs are minimal - the only land that need be acquired is the land for the receiving station .
Transmission line costs are greatly reduced compared to remote generation facilities if the ground station is located near existing transmission lines
If Solaren ( or other companies pursuing similar ambitions , such as Heliosat , Space Energy , Space Island Group , Powersat and the Welsom Space Consortium ) can collect solar energy in space and transmit it to earth they will have opened up a significant new energy resource .
The sun 's energy is almost continuously available to a satellite located in a geosynchronous orbit about the earth ( leading promoters of space based solar power schemes to dub it " baseload solar power " ) .
A 2007 study by the Pentagon ’s National Security Space Office which included representatives from DOE / NREL , DARPA , Boeing and Lockheed - Martin found that a one - kilometer - wide band of space in earth orbit receives enough solar energy in just one year ( approximately 212 terawatt - years ) nearly equal to “ the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today ” ( approximately 250 TW - yrs ) .
The Pentagon study suggested such a system could be tested as early as 2012 , with the likely first customer being the US military .
There are a number of key advantages that make space based solar power an interesting alternative to ground - based solar power :
The video below is from the National Space Society , showing what a space based solar plant might look like .
There are 2 primary challenges to making space based solar a reality .
The first is the technological challenge of making a scheme like this work - this is not been so much converting solar energy into radio frequencies ( which has been done before , though not on Solaren ’s scale ) - but in getting a supersized solar array into space and successfully commissioning it .
The second challenge is one of economics - can the cost involved in building a solar power plant in space ever be competitive with ground based concentrating solar thermal , regular solar PV or thin film solar power plants .
Plans for space based solar have traditionally included kilometre long structures of solar arrays connected to satellites , and launching thousands of tons of heavy metal into orbit is exorbitantly expensive .
Solaren 's Spirnak says he has a solution - “ We want to take the weight out of these systems .
We came up with this design concept to break these things into pieces instead of trying to construct many , many kilometers of structures in orbit , which would essentially be unbuildable .
” Instead , his station will consist of two to four components that will float free in space ( kept in alignment by software controls and small booster rockets rather than heavy wires , cables and struts ) .
According to Solaren ’s patent , an inflatable Mylar mirror a kilometer in diameter will collect and concentrate sunlight on a smaller mirror that will focus the rays on the solar array .
By adopting a concentrating solar power approach , a smaller and lighter array can be deployed , reducing the cost of lifting the components of the structure into orbit .
At this point there is little information about cost available for Solaren 's proposal , though Grist quotes Spirnak as saying the price tag for the 200 - megawatt solar power station for PG&E will be “ in the several billion dollar range ” and will require 4 or 5 rocket launches .
The concept of space based solar power was first proposed in 1941 by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in his book “ Reason , ” about a space station that collects solar energy and beams it to Earth .
Wikipedia 's article on the topic includes a good timeline of developments in the field , noting that Dr Peter Glaser was granted a US patent in 1973 for his " method of transmitting power over long distances ( eg , from an SPS to the Earth 's surface ) using microwaves from a very large ( up to one square kilometer ) antenna on the satellite to a much larger one on the ground , now known as a rectenna " .
Asimov continued to promote the idea throughout his life , with this talk ( part 1 part 2 ) on " Threats To Humanity " , delivered to The Humanist Institute In New York in 1989 , in which he described the threats of global warming and fossil fuel depletion , and recommended the solution as space based solar power whose delivery is managed by a federal world government / " stable world order " .
ANother peak oil observer who has regularly promoted the idea of space based solar power is JD at Peak Oil Debunked , who has looked at the idea of solar power plants based on the moon a number of times ( Lunar Solar Power More on Lunar Solar Power ) .
Another space based energy panacea , using helium 3 from the moon to fuel fusion reactors , has caused some cynics to mutter that this is just a scheme to funnel large amounts of funds to well connected aerospace companies .
I suspect that similar charges will be laid against spaced based solar power plans until the economics of them can be proven to match those of terrestrial renewable energy projects .
The authors of the Pentagon report mentioned earlier noted that space based solar “ has the potential to be a disruptive game changer on the battlefield ... [ enabling ] entirely new force structures and capabilities such as ultra long endurance airborne or terrestrial surveillance or combat systems ” - which implies that there might be more than one reason for wanting to deploy space based solar power - like the symbiosis between nuclear weapons development and the nuclear power industry , it may be that space based solar power provides a civilian friendly reason for building ' star wars " type platforms in space .
Cryptogon has some speculation along these lines , and goes on to wonder if this is another possible example of the introduction of technology developed in " black " military projects ( there is a section in my " Shockwave Rider " review that talks about the 5000 secret patents registered by the USPTO ) into the civilian sector ( echoing his speculation about the role of the new GM CEO appointed by the Obama administration ) .
Another skeptic commenting on the Solaren proposal at Peak Energy wondered cynically if this was a form of greenwashing by PG&E , saying " This is an opportunity for PG&E to get some free green publicity and " demonstrate " their interest in meeting their RPS requirements .
When the power does n't appear in 2016 , they can just throw up their hands and say " we tried , not our fault " .
" Most skeptics focus purely on the economics though , with the Motley Fool declaring Space - Based Solar ?
That 's Just Silly and Energy & Capital asking " Why would anyone be interested in space - based solar power when commercial utility scale solar technology on the ground today costs 0.3 % of its price ? " in The Solar Race Will Be Lost in Space

Sophie Tucker - named after the famous US entertainer - vanished as Jan and Dave Griffith sailed through stormy waters off Queensland last November .
But unknown to her grieving owners , the plucky dog survived a long swim across shark - infested waters to an island .
There she lived on a diet of baby goats until being found by visiting rangers .
The Griffiths were amazed to hear of the discovery and have now been reunited with their pet .

" She was a house dog and look what she 's done , she has swum over five nautical miles , she has managed to live off the land all on her own .
We wish she could talk , we truly do . "
Sailing holiday
The Griffiths had been on a sailing holiday off the north - east Queensland coast when Sophie Tucker - an Australian cattle dog - was lost overboard .
" We hit a rough patch and when we turned around the dog was gone , " Mrs Griffith said .
" We were able to back - track to look for her , but because it was a grey day , we just could n't find her and we searched for well over an hour .
" We thought that once she had hit the water she would have been gone because the wake from the boat was so big . "
Namesake - the original Sophie Tucker was a singer and comedian
But the hardy dog had swum five nautical miles to be washed up on the largely uninhabited St Bees Island .
There , Sophie Tucker survived on a diet of baby goats until rangers , who patrol the island , spotted her .
They eventually captured her , believing her to be a wild dog until they were contacted by the Griffiths .
" She was seen on St Bees looking pretty poor and then all of a sudden she started to look good and that was when they discovered she was eating baby goats , " Mrs Griffith said .
" She had become quite wild and vicious .
She would n't let anyone go near her or touch her .
She would n't take food from anyone . "
There was an emotional reunion when the Griffiths met the rangers ' boat bringing Sophie Tucker to the mainland .
" We called the dog and she started whimpering and banging the cage and when they let her out she just about flattened us , " Mrs Griffith told the AAP news agency .
Mrs Griffith added that Sophie Tucker had been quick to readjust to the comforts of home .

Christian - right leader Dobson admits defeat in ' culture wars ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday April 14 , 2009
Print This Email This Dr. James Dobson , a longtime leader of the Christian - right movement which played key roles in electing Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush , appears to have admitted defeat in the so - called culture wars .
" We are right now in the most discouraging period of that long conflict , " said Dobson , 72 , in a recent speech to Focus on the Family staff .
" Humanly speaking , we can say that we have lost all those battles . "
The comments became the subject of a Tuesday morning segment on CNN's American Morning , hosted by Anderson Cooper .
Joining Cooper were Tony Perkins , president of Family Research Council and Rev. Mel White , a gay man and founder of Soul Force .
Perkins began by noting that the excerpt of Dobson was incomplete .
" He said , ' God is in control and we are not about to give up , ' to which there was great applause at Focus on the Family when he made that comment , " said Perkins . " ... Clearly , you win elections , you win policy battles , and you lose them .
This is a long , long battle .
I think , as Christians we realize this is not a destination .
We 're on a journey . "
Rev .
White countered : " I think fundamentalism has lost the culture wars and a lot of Christians are simply bailing out of fundamentalist churches because they realize they were wrong about gay people , they were wrong about the rights of women and they were wrong about stem cell research .
... Now they 're coming around and saying , 'hey , let 's focus on what Jesus really believed and that 's caring for the poor , caring for the hungry and looking for the widows and orphans . "
Dobson 's remarks were first carried by UK paper The Telegraph .
" Recent surveys have suggested that the American religious landscape has shifted significantly , " the paper reported .
" A study by Trinity College in Connecticut found that 11 per cent fewer Americans identify themselves as Christian than 20 years ago .
Those stating no religious affiliation or declaring themselves agnostic has risen from 8.2 per cent in 1990 to 15 per cent in 2008 . "
" A growing legion of disenchanted grassroots believers does not blame liberal opponents for the decline in faith or the failures of the religious Right , " the report continued .
" Rather , they hold responsible Republicans - particularly Mr Bush - and groups like Focus on the Family that have worked with the party , for courting Christian voters only to betray promises of pursuing the conservative agenda once in office . "

An earlier version of this article incorrectly labeled Dobson a longtime leader of the " moral majority . "

Apparently there is an ingredient in tea that causes hysteria when given to cable news anchors .
How else to explain the coverage of the tax day tea parties on Wednesday , which was the day when we procrastinators finally mailed the check to the feds ?
The movement  if that ’s what it is  was spawned by a rant on Feb. 19 from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange during a live report by the CNBC reporter  if that ’s what he is  Rick Santelli , suggesting that it was time to organize a “ tea party ” to protest government spending on failed mortgages .
The cable news networks took it from there .
Fox News , after running more than 100 promos about its coverage of the event , which did a pretty effective job of marketing them at the same time , had wall - to - wall coverage on the anointed day and dispatched four of its leading hosts around the country to perform a kind of hybrid task , covering events that they also seemed to be leading .
And in the increasingly politicized environment between the covered and coverers , Susan Roesgen of CNN , covering a tax protest in Chicago , could not have been more contemptuous of the people she was interviewing , shaking her finger at them and shouting them down .
In a move that I ’m sure freaked out her bosses , she suggested that the protests were “ antigovernment , anti-CNN . ”
The federal government is squandering taxpayer money by building research infrastructure without providing enough funds to operate it and by not renewing funding to areas where it has built expertise , a panel of researchers argued this week .
" Infrastructure without associated operational funding is wasteful , " University of Alberta researcher Ryan McKay told colleagues at a national meeting of university professors in Ottawa on Thursday .
The other panelists who spoke about research funding at the Canadian Association of University Teachers ' national council meeting were W. Richard Peltier , a University of Toronto physics professor and Marjorie Griffin Cohen , a political science professor at Simon Fraser University .
McKay and Peltier praised the government for providing $ 750 million for scientific research funding through the Canadian Foundation of Innovation through to 2010 and $ 2 billion over two years for university infrastructure in the latest budget .
However , McKay expressed concerns that because the grants cover only a fraction of operating costs for a limited number of years , the facilities will not reach their potential , something he said he has seen happen at the University of Alberta .
" The Institute for Biomedical Design was literally half a floor of one building where the equipment was put in and it sat in plastic for months , if not more than a year … while people tried to get the operational grants , " he said .
McKay recounted that is own facility has seen a number of its government grants eliminated in the past few years .
" We 're basically holding on by our fingernails and we 're running out of fingernails , " he said , adding that the centre has been forced to hike the rates that researchers pay to use its equipment .
Universities requested infrastructure : Industry Canada
He suggested that infrastructure has been the government 's focus because it provides for easy photo - ops and visible , defined results .
Industry Canada said Friday that spent on research infrastructure because consultations with the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada provided a " compelling case " for such investments .
The department added that it has provided some programs , such as the Centres of Excellence in Commercialization and Research , with operating costs , and for others it has provided $ 325 million for indirect costs of research .
However , McKay said , funding from " indirect costs " is not trickling down to researchers .
He and his fellow panelists also criticized the government for not renewing funding to research areas that have been productive and successful , something Peltier spoke about at length .
" This cuts right to the heart of many of the projects which Canada has been actually leading in , " he said .
" We should n't cut the things we do best . "
As examples , Peltier pointed to :
The Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Science ( CFCAS ) , an agency that distributed government funding to groups such as the University of Toronto 's Centre for Climate Change Studies , where Peltier is director .
Genome Canada , which did not get $ 120 million that it had expected in the 2009 federal budget to help fund new international research projects , including those led by Canadian scientists .
Peltier said CFCAS , an autonomous foundation established in 2000 that bills itself as the " main funding body for university - based research on climate , atmospheric and related oceanic work in Canada , " has been supporting important research to improve understanding of the global warming process .
" This is an extremely important thing and yet , this foundation is about to be killed . "
Research teams take decades to build : Peltier
Peltier added that top research teams that take decades to build and just a short time to lose .
He suggested that the government 's current strategy of steering more research funding to areas it " is most comfortable with " was a contributing factor .
CFCAS executive director Dawn Conway confirmed Friday that the foundation gets nearly all its funding from the government , but it has not yet received a response to requests for renewal of its funding or extension of its mandate past March 2012 .
Industry Canada said a five - year agreement already in place should fund Genome Canada through to March 2013 , and earlier this week it announced $ 112 million for 12 genomics research projects in bioproducts or crops .
When the panel was asked when the government should stop funding a particular facility or area of science to make room for others , McKay said research projects should be funded until they are finished or have run their course .
Facilities should be shut down , he said , when they have " reached the end of that area of science . "
However , he said , the types of research that are n't getting their funding renewed right now do not fall into these categories .
" We 're talking about places that are No. 1 on the peer review committees , " he said .
" That entire stream of funding has been removed , not because it 's judged unworthy but because it 's judged not important .
And who gets to say whether it 's important or not ? "
Industry Canada said it takes advice on science technology and innovation from the Science , Technology and Innovation Council , a group of 18 " distinguished Canadians " from the business , university , college , research and government sectors .
The department said the council is currently advising the government on how it should focus it research resources in four priority areas identified in 2007 : environmental science and technologies ; natural resources and energy ; health and related life sciences and technologies ; and information and communications technologies .
How News Fits into Sparxoo ’s Emerging Trends
By Ethan Lyon , Senior Writer
Who would have thought a book entitled , “ I Can Has Cheezburger ” would have sold 100,000 print copies ?
A compilation of pictures of cats with German - accented commentary might have been fun to check out between getting to work and actually working , but why such a blog would have such cross- platform success is what we ’re going to talk about in this week ’s Top 5 .
We found interesting news items and discuss how they fit into our Emerging Trends .
1. Redefining Icon
Selling 100,000 copies of your book is no easy task .
But for Ben
Huh it was n’t so hard .
From the Indie success of his blog , “ I Can Has Cheezburger , ” a site that posts German - accented commentary in pictures of cats , a book deal was a natural step .
Susan Boyle , a middle - aged church patron , was unknown to many until she starred in a British TV talent show , “ Britain ’s Got Talent . ”
For most people that know her now , they probably did n’t tune into the TV show .
Instead , she was catapulted into 5 - minute stardom when that TV clip of her went digital .
With nearly 30 million views and counting , her YouTube clip and the cross- platform success of Ben Huh ’s cat commentary exemplifies the Redefining Icon trend by re-branding celebrity in the digital age .
2. Sensory Mashup
The Sensory Mashup trend is all about a fun , engaging experience .
That might be why Apple scored 80 % on customer satisfaction survey and PC scored a mere 58 % to 66 % .
Apple has created a chasse for developers to create very interactive applications and software for its users .
The iPhone uses its accelerometer and touch - screen technology to give users a Sensory Mashup experience that has non-users say , “ Oh is that an iPhone ? ”
Apple is waiting for PC ’s to catch - up , but at that point , the next generation of Sensory Mashup technology will be wowing the consumers .
3. Crisis=Opportunity
Chapter 11 is a tell - tale sign of crisis , but Chapter 11 is also synonymous for opportunity .
For General Growth , Chapter 11 a year ago was an acquisition opportunity .
As of last week , the tables turned and now General Growth is finding itself in the deep end of debt financing–unable to keep its head above water .
For real estate owners , the opportunity could not be louder and more ever - present … strike while the iron is hot .
General Growth will be selling its assets at very discounted rates , leaving prime opportunity for competitors to grab valuable property at bargain basement prices .
4. Private Eye
You might not have heard of Treehouse Foods Inc or Ralcorp Holdings Inc , but you might have purchased their products .
Both are private labels .
Treehouse and Ralcorp produce the generic , off / in - house brands are being favored by consumers , as penny - pinching forces them to look past the flashy label and understand brand name cream corn tastes enough like off brand cream corn–even if the difference is $ 0.15 .
5. Pay Forward
Generosity and conscience - minded business is what the Pay Forward trend is all about .
AT&T aligned its business with the good - cause , good - feet company , TOMS to promote global coverage and the far - reaching villages TOMS contributes to .
For every shoe sold , a shoe is given to a person without .
The cause - related marketing with AT&T extends the reach of TOMS message while aligning the mobile carriers brand with an impactful , Pay Foward company .

The Australian Government yesterday broke new records for web censorship by requiring the takedown not just of a page containing harmful content , nor even a page linking to harmful content , but a page linking to a link to allegedly harmful content .
The content that the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) originally deemed to be inappropriate was to be found on a US site – Abortion TV .
The site is political in nature , clearly coming down on the anti-abortion side of that debate – and the page in question features pictures of aborted foetuses .
Back in January of this year , ACMA wrote back to a complainant : " ACMA is satisfied that the internet content is hosted outside Australia , and that the content is prohibited or potential prohibited content .
" The Internet Industry Association ( IIA ) has a code of practice for Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) which , among other things , set out arrangements for dealing with such content .
In accordance with the code , ACMA has notified the above content to the makers of IIA approved filters , for their attention and appropriate action .
The code requires ISPs to make available to customers an IIA approved filter . "
Despite this , the link continued to be published by popular news site , Whirlpool .
In March , ACMA upped the ante , by sending to Whirlpool ’s ISP - Bulletproof Networks - an " interim link - deletion notice " , warning them that they were in breach of the law – and that failure to block access to the link in question could cost them $ 11,000 a day .
Bulletproof pulled the link .
This sequence of events was then reported on by Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc ( EFA ) , who describe themselves as " a non-profit national organisation representing Internet users concerned with on - line freedoms and rights " .
In a report that included the now infamous link , they wrote : " This demonstrates not only that the blacklist targets a wider range of material than child abuse ( where the Minister ’s rhetoric has been focused ) but also that the lines between art , obscenity and political speech are not as bright and clear as politicians would have us imagine ...
Viewing or possession [ of ]
RC content is not in itself illegal unless the content falls afoul of some other statute , such as those governing child - abuse material " .
They added : " Despite the Minster ’s ( ridiculous ) assertions that he means well and we should take it on faith that the filter will be effective and benign , this latest episode demonstrates how serious run-ins with the censors can be , that it does not only happen to purveyors of the ‘ filth ’ politicians rail against .
These sorts of incidents will multiply as mandatory filtering is introduced , more controversial content is prohibited , and mirroring , linking and circumvention become common . "
It was therefore drearily predictable that ACMA would descend on EFA like the proverbial ton of bricks – and lo , yesterday they did exactly that , serving their latest " link - deletion notice " on EFA .
This time , EFA pointed out the cost of this sort of action .
They said : " This system , which costs Australian taxpayers millions each year , is clearly unworkable " .
However , there are also clear political dangers .
As they further observed : " If a link to a prohibited page is not allowed , what about a link to a link ?
At what number of hops does hyperlink become acceptable ? "
It is also pretty pointless , as sites such as " Somebody think of the Children " , which look at censorship and moral panic in Australia , remain hosted in the US , where they are beyond the reach of Australia 's censors .
On this latest evidence , the Australian Government is now light years ahead of the rest of the Western world when it comes to political censorship .
Whether a less draconian regime will at some point emerge is now a hot topic for debate amongst Ozzie ISP ’s . ®
The executive director at AIG 's Financial Products unit hid his blog behind a firewall last night , after we linked to it yesterday .
Fortunately , we had already grabbed his latest entry .
Here it is :
For 15 years , I have helped tend to the portfolio of positions making up the whole of the business .
As a member of the support team , I am still , for as long as I am here , responsible for all of the practical technical things - computers , data , lights , air conditioning - that keep the place running .
The job is highly technical , spanning multiple disciplines ( hardware , software , an understanding of the business , familiarity with multiple classes of market data , facilities management , disaster recovery and business continuity , the list goes on ) and the business critical nature of the portfolio has meant that I have been , for the past 15 years , on call 24x7x365 , for any operational problem which could affect the business .
And for many years , the business was good .
The vast majority of the deals done were sound .
And the portfolio grew , and became more intricate , and encompassed more classes of products .
Contrary to what is being said - by people who do n't know anything about the business - about " unhedged positions " , the business worked on hedging .
This is not a hedge fund , which is a particular kind of investment company .
The entire portfolio had to be valued and hedged every night , and new axes ( hedging instructions ) generated and actioned .
For over 20 years , the nightly cycle was never skipped .
To do so would have lost track of the true value of the book , and that would have been a true disaster , because we would no longer be able to predict cashflows .
The entire machine worked on cashflows .
Fixed cashflows across variable foreign exchange rates would generate profits or losses , likewise , cashflows of fixed interest rates flowing against variable interest rates would generate profits and losses .
Although risky , it thrived on volatility .
But it has always required maintenance .
Unwinding thousands of intertwined , complex deals in a market where your counterparties know what you are trying to do , without losing even bigger amounts of money , takes specific knowledge of the transactions , and knowledge of the systems , the vast majority of which were developed in - house .
Business continuity plans , reporting to our regulators ( there 's another lie being told , that it is n't regulated - it was most certainly regulated ! ) , and paying the bills have to happen right to the close of the last book .
Whatever moron that started flogging people already on a death march , obviously does not care about the 1.6 trillion dollars in contracts still on the books , which can still blow up , making the world that much poorer .
Perhaps by blowing up the economy , bigger targets than the maintainers can be claimed .
I do n't know .
As it was , we managed to wind down nearly 40 % of the whole portfolio - another news item being ignored - derisking almost a trillion dollars worth of risk that the American taxpayer does n't have to pay for .
We hope to finish the job .
We 're professionals like that .
It 's amusing to hear people say we should be fired , or that the job is n't all that hard , or there 's 50 people willing to do any of our jobs .
To all of those folks , here 's a clue :
This is not a going concern , we have been working ourselves out of a job for the last 6 months , we will not have jobs when we are done , and any replacement will be doing it slower than we can , and is very likely to screw it up much worse than it already is .
Oh , and a replacement might not get paid at all , if the government changes its mind again .
The only reason I stayed was because I was told that I was a valued member of the team and I was promised a payment .
Nobody ever actually tried to renegotiate the terms .
It was never a secret , the ERP was disclosed many times .
Anybody telling you otherwise is lying .
Anybody - Geithner , Cuomo , Blumenthal , Dodd , all of them and also those guys in Congress - they all had that information back in October .
Cummings has been railing at Liddy about it since at least October .
Here 's something Cuomo wrote in October regarding the ERP .
This is after he reduced the DCP and SIP to zero for all of us .
" These actions are not intended to jeopardize the hard - earned compensation of the vast majority of AIG 's employees , including retention and severance arrangements , who are essential to rebuilding AIG and the economy of New York . "
In the financial industry , generally there is a nominal salary paid , and then a bonus .
The salary never changes - mine stayed the same for 15 years .
Worse , being an expat , I was paid in dollars - taxed at UK rates ( 40 % ) , and subject to FX rate fluctuations that have ranged from $ 1.60 to the pound in 1998 to $ 2.10 for a while in late 2007 .
It did not help us to save much money against the eventuality of losing the job and then being stuck in a foreign country with a toxic CV .
The bonus was what got us through the year , though , and through careful budgeting , we were able to stay afloat .
We did n't make all that much money , especially for London , and especially as an expatriate .
Our house in Fairfield Country cost us $ 2100 in mortgage payments in a month , which meant we could live off the salary .
The smaller house we have in London , as far out as we can live without being too far from my son's school , is around $ 10,000 a month , and utilities and taxes cost another $ 1800 a month .
My son's school is about $ 30,000 a year .
He cannot actually go to any others , he has to go there .
I cannot work for 1/5 of my previous compensation and remain in London .
In my case , my monthly paycheck does n't cover 2 weeks of rent in London , let alone anything else .
This is not at all a pleasant job , and going broke whilst also having our souls destroyed is , to be frank , not something I feel I can stomach indefinitely .
They could have , at any time , renegotiated the terms , the salary , anything to make it fairer .
They chose instead to throw us under the bus .
I sure hope the BlackRock guys can finish this job , and I know they get paid a lot more than I do .
I am , ultimately , just a support guy , albeit a highly compensated , highly qualified and highly professional one .
I am certainly not looking for sympathy , I already knew I was losing my job and I was preparing for my time .
I had made my peace with the events which had led up to the unwind .
Certainly one should not expect sympathy from the likes of Andrew Cuomo .
I just hope I can roll out of the way before he reverses the bus to back over me again .
More Californians are failing to make their mortgage payments than at any time in the last 20 years , but fewer of them are losing their homes , according to new figures .
The drop in foreclosures follows moratoriums adopted by major banks and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The increase in loan defaults , meanwhile , suggests that rising unemployment and the continuing recession are still claiming fresh victims .
But another factor in the soaring default rate could be that some struggling homeowners are purposely skipping their payments so that they can get their loans refinanced , industry experts say .
Lenders are so backlogged with requests to adjust loan terms that “ they focus on the borrowers who already are circling the drain and ignore the people who are keeping up with their payments , ” said Jeff Lazerson , president of Mortgage Grader , a Laguna Niguel loan broker .

Lynne Neagle , 73 , of Westminster may be a case in point .
Neagle said she and her husband had trouble paying their mortgage , but their loan servicer ignored their pleas to renegotiate terms -- until they quit paying , that is .
Suddenly , she said , they were presented with new ways to lower their payments and are currently negotiating new terms through the Hope Now program set up by the federal government and some of the country ’s largest mortgage lenders .
“ Before we stopped making our payments , nobody wanted to deal with us , ” Neagle said .
“ We stopped paying , and that really got their attention . ”

A default notice is the first step in the foreclosure process , and California homeowners received 135,431 of them in the three months ended March 31 , MDA DataQuick of San Diego said Wednesday .
That ’s an 80 % increase over the previous three - month period and a 19 % jump over the same period last year .
Meanwhile , the number of actual foreclosures , in which the home was repossessed by the lender , fell to 43,620 in the first quarter , a 6 % drop from the last three months of 2008 and a 7.6 % decline from the year - earlier quarter .
Foreclosures peaked in the third quarter of 2008 at 79,511 .
Much of the drop stems from a change in state law that made it more cumbersome for lenders to foreclose , DataQuick analysts said .
That also led to procedural delays for banks and other lenders , which in many cases were not prepared to handle the additional paperwork .

“ Some of these outlets were n’t staffed enough to process all these loans , and so they had this huge backlog that we ’re starting to see work its way through , ” said Andrew LePage , a DataQuick analyst .
“ There ’s also a chunk of it that could be the lender pushing the borrowers into default to get the modification rolling or the borrowers doing it themselves to qualify . ”
Nationally , foreclosure numbers also have fallen .
Data firm RealtyTrac of Irvine said Wednesday that the number of homes taken over by banks dropped to 190,543 in the first three months of the year , a 13 % decrease from the last three months of 2008 .
Defaults jumped 10 % over the same period , to 306,785 .
Late last year , the country ’s two biggest buyers of home loans -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- stopped foreclosures on many of the loans under their control .
Citigroup Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Bank of America Corp. , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. all followed suit , saying they wanted to give President Obama time to work out the details of his housing plan .

Those moratoriums have tapered off .
Fannie and Freddie announced at the beginning of April that they would begin foreclosing on homes again .
The various federal efforts now underway do offer some incentives for banks to help homeowners in default -- including a $ 1,000 payment to loan servicers for every successful loan modification .
But the incentives are even better for loans that are current -- $ 1,500 in those cases .
And the centerpiece of Obama ’s plan , the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Program , is aimed at people who are current on their loans .
But many troubled borrowers in California are not eligible for help under Obama ’s plan because they owe much more on their loans than their homes are worth .
To qualify for one of Obama ’s programs , a mortgage ’s balance must be no more than 105 % of the value of the home .

“ California loans are so far underwater that people wo n’t fit into that narrow window , ” said David Leibowitz , a bankruptcy and foreclosure attorney at Lakelaw in Chicago .
With the unemployment rate -- now 8.5 % nationally and 11.2 % in California -- expected to continue rising , economists believe more people will be struggling to make their mortgage payments , leading to a continued uptick in defaults .
But foreclosures wo n’t necessarily follow the same trend , experts say , because banks do n’t want to overtax a housing market already flooded with cut -rate properties repossessed by lenders .
“ If they can work something out with a borrower , they are going to try to work it out because they do n’t want to recognize these losses , ” said Steve Hable , a loan modification administrator who works for San Diego attorney and AM radio show host Jeff Isaac .
Isaac has been holding seminars encouraging people to hire attorneys like himself to help them through the loan modification process .
He said that when he meets with struggling borrowers , he finds that getting the bank ’s attention has been one of their biggest problems .
“ There is so much confusion out there , ” Isaac said .
“ And people end up making really bad decisions , like borrowing against their 401 ( k ) to make their house payments .
You do that and you are destined for real misery down the road . ”

The demand for modifications has become so pressing that Bank of America , which services more home loans than any other company , said last week that it had 6,400 employees working on mortgage restructurings .
Neagle and her husband were close to paying off their home loan in the early 1990s when they decided to refinance and take out some equity to help pay for their son to study aerospace engineering at Cal Poly Pomona .
He earned his bachelor ’s degree in 1999 , but the Neagles ended up with about $ 600,000 in debt and , as the housing market started to crash , a home that was worth only a little over $ 400,000 .
They tried to talk with their loan servicer , American Servicing Co. , which is part of Wells Fargo , about a modification but were rebuffed , said Neagle , who works for Wells Fargo as a collateral specialist in Irvine .

“ I guess it ’s good that it did n’t matter where I worked , ” she said .
“ It means they treat everyone the same . ”

An Israeli and a group of Palestinians last week set aside their differences in order to carry out an armed bank robbery , Palestinian police said .
The heist at a bank in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Tuesday ( local time ) was carried out by six armed gunmen who made off with some $ US30,000 ( $ 43,000 ) according to security officials .
Palestinian police Colonel Adnan al - Damiri says police arrested two Palestinians who confessed they carried out the robbery with three Palestinians living in Israel and an Israeli Jew .
The Israeli " was the mastermind of the operation and he also took part in it , " before fleeing back to Israel , Mr Damiri said .
He says such coordination between Arabs and Jews could signal a " dangerous " new trend of organised crime in the Palestinian territory .
Palestinian police have passed the results of the investigation on to Israeli security forces and requested they try to hunt down the remaining suspects .
Palestinian police are allowed to patrol limited areas of the West Bank , which Israel occupied in the 1967 Six Day war , but the Israeli military continues to operate freely in all parts of the territory .
Israel and the Palestinians formally relaunched US - backed peace talks in November 2007 , but have since made little visible progress .

People strolling past homes , stores and even strip joints across Canada will soon be captured and frozen in time by Google 's camera , to appear in high - resolution street - level images on the internet .
Cities where Google will be filming : Calgary .
Edmonton .
Halifax .
Montreal .
Ottawa .
Quebec City .
Saint John .
Saskatoon .
Toronto .
Vancouver .
Winnipeg .
Google will be driving around 11 Canadian cities across the country again " in coming weeks " to take images for the Canadian version of its Street View service , which it hopes to launch " very soon , " the company announced earlier this week .
The service , which is already available in cities in the U.S. , the U.K. , Spain , Australia , Japan and several other countries , provides close - up , 360 - degree views of city streets as they would be seen by someone driving along them .
The images are linked to the company 's Google Maps and Google Earth applications .
Google has collected such images of Canadian cities before , but this time it is letting residents know about it as part of an effort to address privacy concerns that were brought up by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada after the service first launched in the U.S. in 2007 , Google spokeswoman Tamara Micner said Thursday .
" We 've worked with all of the provincial privacy commissioners as well as the federal privacy commissioner to tell them what Street View is , how it works and to brief them on these privacy features that we 've added , " Micner added .
Those features include the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates to avoid identifying people or cars and an easy method to request to have images removed .
In 2007 , Google collected images in Vancouver , Calgary , Toronto , Ottawa , Montreal and Quebec City .
However , those Canadian images have not yet appeared online .
" We like to make sure that in every country where we launch a product that it complies with local laws and customs and norms , " Micner said .
Blurring not always enough : privacy watchdog
Elizabeth Denham , assistant privacy commissioner of Canada , confirmed that her office has been consulted by Google about Street View .
" I think that 's a very good thing , " she said .
She also confirmed that her office had asked the company to warn people before it began collecting imagery .
" And then citizens can have a chance to avoid having their images captured on camera , " she said .
Denham is pleased that Google has warned the public about its filming but thinks the warning should have been more focused in terms of specifically when it was happening and in which local areas , especially since some people might still be identifiable in the images .
" The risk is that their image is captured without their knowledge when they 're entering a sensitive location such as a women 's shelter or an abortion clinic , and that 's not information … that should be in the public domain . "
As for Google 's face and licence - plate blurring technology and procedures for requesting images to be removed , those are a " responsible and important first step , " Denham said .
However , her office has outstanding concerns about the effectiveness of the blurring technology , which is n't able to identify and automatically blur every face .
In such cases , it is up to the public to alert Google .
Denham is also concerned about the fact that Google is keeping the original , unblurred images and said her office is continuing to talk to the company about that .
Concerns not just over Google
She emphasized her concerns are not specific to Google but also pertain to other , similar services .
In fact , a street view service provided by another company already exists in Canada .
That service , which includes images of Vancouver , Whistler and Squamish , was launched by another company , Vancouver - based Canpages Inc. , earlier in March .
However , B.C. falls outside the jurisdiction of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada as the province 's provincial laws are very similar to federal laws and take precedence within B.C.
If the company expands its imagery to other provinces , as it has said it intends to , then Denham 's office would have jurisdiction , she confirmed .
However , so far , Canpages has not contacted the Privacy Commissioner of Canada .
Calgary 's Immersive Media , a company involved in creating many of the Google 's original street views in the U.S. , said it is currently working on a second - generation Street View tool that will include street level , full motion , 360 - degree video of Canadian cities , including the insides of many buildings .
President and CEO Myles McGovern said the company consulted with the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and gained a letter of approval before collecting images in several cities , including Ottawa , Quebec City , Montreal , Toronto and Vancouver .
The company plans to launch the service soon with a partner but not with Google .
Google Street View was first launched in the U.S. in May 2007 .
Four months later , Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart warned the service might not comply with federal privacy legislation , as it included images of identifiable people that had been collected without their consent .
Dilettanti : The Antic and the Antique in Eighteenth - Century England by Bruce Redford J. Paul Getty Museum / Getty Research Institute , 220 pp. , $ 49.95
Bruce Redford ’s Dilettanti is not itself a dilettantish work , for the book ’s succinctness and lightness of touch reflect skill of the highest order .
Still , there is an evident link between Redford ’s fine - tuned scholarship and the sense of sheer delight ( Italian diletto ) that gave its name to the Society of Dilettanti , devoted to the study of ancient Greek and Roman art , when it was formed in 1734 .
That link is distilled in the motto of this peculiarly English gentlemen ’s club , Seria Ludo ; the paradoxical Latin phrase meant that in their playfulness , ludo , they also addressed serious matters , seria .
1
True to their creed , the Dilettanti pursued both kinds of delight , serious as well as ludicrous , with maniacal dedication .
Redford ’s often amusing , handsomely illustrated account ( flanked last summer by a delectable exhibition at the Getty Villa in Malibu , curated by Redford and Claire L. Lyons ) traces the range of their activities through three generations , from the society ’s founding to its ignominious performance in the debate about the Elgin Marbles that took place in the spring of 1816 .
The first Dilettanti gathered together in a London tavern in the bleak December of 1734 , to relive their experiences of the Grand Tour — hence the society ’s Italianate name and its emphasis on the complementary pleasures of culture , especially the visual arts , and drink .
Drowning the miseries of English winter in wine - soaked memories of Italian sunshine , the founding Dilettanti dressed in exotic costumes , bantered about sex , and exchanged the refined opinions about art that they had acquired during their sojourns in Rome , Florence , Naples , and Venice .
Theirs was an era in which clubs and clubmen dominated the social scene : several Dilettanti also belonged to the ultra-serious Royal Society for Promoting Natural Knowledge or the Royal Academy of the Arts .
But their own gatherings usually bore a closer resemblance to those of less sober organizations , like the Kit - Cat Club ( named for the mutton pies baked by Christopher “ Kit ” Cat , keeper of the Cat and Fiddle tavern where the Kit - Cats met ) or the shadowy , notorious Hell - Fire Club .
2
Like the Kit-Cats , the Dilettanti would maintain a close relationship with the world of publishing , but whereas the Kit -Cats mixed aristocrats with working professionals and favored Whig politics , the Dilettanti membership leaned more heavily , at least at first , toward gentlemen of leisure — these were the people who could afford a Grand Tour in the first place .
Many of the founding Dilettanti were also accomplished rakes , their skills burnished by Venetian courtesans , all part of the Grand Tour ’s preparation for fathering Albion ’s next generation in the literal as well as the metaphorical sense .
They pursued their various delights in a London of periwigs , libertines , and Enlightenment , of new gathering places devoted to the consumption of exotic global novelties like coffee , tea , chocolate , and ice cream , of new …
Terese Jonsson calls for all white feminists ( herself included ) to step up to the plate on racism and white privilege
A couple of months ago , Annika Spalding challenged F - Word readers with the question ‘ Whose feminism is it ? ’
Disappointed with her experience of feeling like she “ stood out a bit ” and had been “ overlooked ” at a major feminist conference , she asked :
Is feminism reaching women who are living in poverty ?
Women who have come over to this country on a marriage visa and ca n’t speak any English ?
Is feminism reaching young teenage mums ?
Is feminism reaching women who did n’t attend university ?
Is feminism reaching women who choose not to work , regardless of whether or not they have children ?
Is feminism reaching women who do not have access to the internet ?
Is feminism reaching mums ?
Is feminism reaching women of colour ?
Really ?
Her words echoed those of many frustrated women before her , and led me to wonder , once again , when are we going to stop going around in these circles ?
When are the white , privileged , cis-gendered , university - educated , able - bodied women who too often insist on dominating feminist conversations going to actually start listening ?
And following on from that , when are we going to start changing ?
Annika addressed many different issues in her article , all important and inter-connected , but right here and now I want to focus on one strand in particular ; namely , the ongoing racism and unchecked white privilege in many feminist communities in the UK .
I should mention at this point that I am a white , middle - class feminist .
I ’m not saying I have all the answers or that I occupy any moral high - ground on this matter , but I am saying that if we are to build real feminist movements in the UK , if this recent “ upsurge in feminist activity ” oft - cited in Guardian lifestyle columns is going to mean anything to the women Annika wrote about in her article , white feminists have some serious shit to sort out .
But first , let ’s be clear that this is not a new discussion .
Here ’s a letter from black feminist Jan McKenley , printed in an issue of the women ’s liberation magazine Spare Rib in 1980 :
I ’m beginning to feel invisible again within the WLM [ Women ’s Liberation Movement ] , having to work myself up to making ‘ heavy ’ statements that will embarrass sisters in meetings – I can see the eyebrows going up already – “ Not racism – that old chestnut again – it ’s so boring . ”
Well , if it ’s boring for you , white sister … .
I ’ve got no monopoly on dealing with racism – it ’s your problem too .
This letter was published in the context of a changing women ’s liberation movement , marking a time when white feminists in the UK were being seriously challenged by Black women ( I use ‘ Black ’ here in the political sense it was often used by anti-racist activists at this time , as inclusive of all non-white people ) , calling them out on their racism and role in perpetuation of a white supremacist society .
Although , as is obvious from the letter above , this was not the first time Black feminists had tried to initiate these conversations , the rise of an autonomous black women ’s movement at this time made it harder for white women to ignore black women ’s voices .
Black women pointed out that white feminists in fact often contributed to other women ’s oppression by prioritising only their own needs in their activism , without considering how they may be at odds with the needs of women of colour .
Throughout the early ’ 80s , a multitude of intense discussions and arguments took place , leading to both irrevocable splits as well as successful coalitions between women of different ethnicities .
Reviewing the situation in 1985 , Kum - Kum Bhavnani , while acknowledging that some white women were starting to change their behaviour , expressed her anger :
at the lack of support we [ Black feminists ] received for our political work which did not explicitly include the seven demands of the Women ’s Movement , and … at the paralysing guilt of white women which serves to make us feel ‘ bad ’ for criticising them , rather than make them realise that their political work has to adopt an anti-imperialist and anti-racist perspective .
Fast forward 24 years ( almost a quarter of a century ! ) , and surely at the start of 2009 , we are beyond racism in feminism , right ?
Well no actually , far from it .
And what ’s even more depressing is how little the content of the debate has changed .
Yes sure , as mainstream society has changed in its attitude to racism , so has white feminism .
Most white feminists these days know how to adopt a superficial language of anti-racism .
But that is far from enough .
As Humaira Saeed questioned in Race Revolt , a zine which focuses on “ race , ethnicity and identity within queer , feminist and diy - punk communities ” :
I wonder why so many feminist events use the words ‘ diversity ’ and ‘ inclusion ’ without ever considering the implications of these words .
As though throwing them into the mission statement will make them real .
Feminist conferences , demos , Ladyfests , discussion groups , mailing lists … they all - too - often pay lip service to being inclusive .
But saying that you provide a welcoming and safe space for all women is not the same as making it so .
Like Annika noted , when filling in the monitoring form at the feminist conference , “ There was n’t even a box for me to tick ! ”
How is this progress ?
The lack of a box on a monitoring form may not seem like a big deal , but the problem is such ‘ oversights ’ reveal so much more .
They reveal a lack of a meaningful anti-racist perspective which takes the intersection of oppressions such as racism and sexism as it ’s starting point .
They expose white feminists ’ inability , or more correctly unwillingness , to put anyone other than ourselves at the centre of our organising .
I was called out on some silencing behaviour myself recently .
I had failed to address the white - centricity of an event that I had been part of organising .
The most infuriating realisation for me was that I already knew ‘ better ’ , but had still let the sense of security and safety afforded to me by my whiteness ( as well as a feeling of the inevitability of it ending up this way ) lull me into complacency , taking the least challenging route .
Based on my own experience , I do n’t think that most white feminists today deliberately set out to be racist .
But whichever way you look at it , white - dominated feminist spaces are littered with casual racism and marginalising tendencies .
Because actually challenging racism , on both a personal and community level , working in coalition , developing accountable and sustainable anti-racist feminist politics , is hard work , and it is challenging to the core .
And when it comes down to it , how many of us who were born white can truly say that we are ready to give up ( as far as this is possible in a racist society ) the privileges that whiteness gives us ?
I mean truly ready ?
Because we ’re basically talking about turning dominant contemporary UK feminism on its head .
We need to examine our goals and priorities , address our processes of organising , our relationships , our use and sharing of resources .
We need to unlearn what we know , and then learn again , differently .
So I ’m dedicating the rest of this article to thinking about some real basic suggestions for ways forward .
I want to be clear I did not come up with these ideas myself ; I owe everything I have learnt about anti-racist feminism from radical women of colour and Black feminists .
Writers and activists such as Chandra Mohanty , Amrit Wilson , the women of Southall Black Sisters , Hazel Carby , bell hooks , Angela Davis and many , many more , are the women who have inspired me with their visions of what truly democratic and non-oppressive feminist politics could look like .
Decolonise feminism ( because it is n’t yours to own )
There ’s a popular misconception , happily reinforced by the corporate media , that white women invented feminism , and remain the true leaders and visionaries in the project to liberate women .
For example , on the 80th anniversary of the Equal Franchise Act , Rachel Cooke , lamenting the backlash against feminist gains in The Observer , managed to quote only white women on the state and priorities of feminism today .
Even more disturbing , she ended her article with this anecdote :
Near my home is a shop that sells jewellery and rugs from Afghanistan .
In its window at the moment is a pale blue burqa .
It is displayed very cleverly on two crossed poles , so that it looks like some wonderful exotic bird .
The other night , stepping off the bus , I walked towards it , thinking how beautiful it was , the street light falling on it so softly , its tiny pleats collapsing so elegantly .
For a few moments , I could not take my eyes off it .
Then I remembered what it was , and I walked on , briskly .
After rendering non-white women completely invisible throughout her piece , she brings them forcefully into the limelight at the end , in the form of a burqa ( there ’s not even a real woman wearing it ! ) .
What is this meant to achieve , except to reinforce the patronising notion that white women ( supposedly so much more liberated than Muslim women of colour ) need to lead the good feminist fight to save our Muslim sisters , the ultimate ( voiceless ) victims of patriarchy ?
Need I mention the pseudo - feminist pronouncements of the George Bush / Tony Blair administrations about saving the oppressed Afghan women to justify invasion in 2001 , to prove the point that such faulty arguments are dangerous ?
Anxious Black Woman , a US - based blogger , addresses the heart of how we begin to decolonise feminism :
We do this by first decolonizing our minds and looking at women around the globe as our equals who are doing their own feminist theorising and practices from which we can both benefit if we shared equally in our knowledge on how best to address gender oppression – especially in its intersections with race , class , sexuality , nationality and imperialism .
She has also written a series of posts highlighting some of the rich history of early feminist pioneers of colour , including Claudia Jones , a Marxist - feminist and one of the founders of the Notting Hill Carnival .
Her work showcasing these feminist trailblazers , often completely erased from white - washed accounts of feminist history , along with her highlighting the feminist activism thriving in all corners of the world , completely debunks the myth that feminism belongs to white women .
As she puts it , “ I will not disavow the ‘ feminist ’ label because I did n’t get it coming through the back door ” ( although many other women of colour have disavowed that label , not because they ’re not interested in women ’s rights , but because of the bad name white feminists have given it ) .
It is only white ( middle - class , straight , able - bodied , cis-gendered … ) women who have the privilege to separate out gender as a single axis of oppression , to only look at an issue from the ‘ gender angle ’
If you find yourself using arguments such as “ white middle class women have always led feminism because they have the time / education / resources / focus that Black / working class / Third World women do n’t ” , then you are using a colonised and revisionist version of feminist history .
You only need to look back to the ’ 80s to find that , in the UK , some of the most progressive , creative and challenging feminist politics was coming out of women of colour led projects , the anti-imperialist feminist newspaper Outwrite being one .
Take off the single - issue blinkers
Talking of imperialism , there is no way of being an anti-racist feminist in modern Britain without understanding this country ’s complex and ongoing legacy of colonialism .
The erasure of Britain ’s violent imperial history from public consciousness , the arguments that we are all equal now and that racism is a thing of the past ( and the myth that colonialism was only ever a benevolent project to spread civilization and good manners in the first place ) are constantly perpetuated by the media , education system and government .
When white feminists accept this ahistorical view of a post- racial society ( where racism only happens as isolated incidents rather than as continued , institutionalised injustice and violence ) , we espouse a feminism which can only ever be relevant to white women .
It is only white ( middle - class , straight , able - bodied , cis-gendered … ) women who have the privilege to separate out gender as a single axis of oppression , to only look at an issue from the ‘ gender angle ’ .
So if you ’re serious about not wanting to exclude women of colour from your feminist analysis , forget about keeping your feminism ‘ pure ’ ; ( I think Latoya Peterson said it best in a guest post at Feministe , titled ‘ Ewwww , You got your other issues in my feminism ! ’ ) .
US feminist Jessica Hoffman wrote a powerful open letter to white feminists last year , in which she addressed exactly how a gender - only approach to feminist issues such as violence against women can be oppressive to communities of colour , as well as dismissive of the radical anti-violence work being done by organisations such as Incite !.
We need to be having these same conversations here .
A good starting point is to accept that all white people in Western society are racist to some extent – it has been ingrained in us since birth
In Britain in 2009 , when we talk about women ’s rights , we need to be talking about the anti-immigrant rhetoric and violence against asylum seekers committed by the British state , about militarist and cultural imperialism , about capitalism and the criminal justice system .
In the current climate of xenophobia and racism , a white feminism which does not engage with these issues , leaves itself vulnerable to being co-opted by neo-colonialist and racist agendas and will continue to fail non-white women , in being not only irrelevant , but actually harmful .
So if you are wondering why there are n’t any women of colour joining your feminist group , it probably is n’t because they ’re not interested in women ’s rights , but because what you have defined as your feminist issues do n’t have much relevance beyond your own white body .
When you talk or write about ‘ women ’ or how a particular issue affects women , ask yourself , which women are you talking about ?
How would it affect a woman who is not like you ?
Do you think that dealing with racism is a ‘ distraction ’ from dealing with sexism ?
Why ?
Listen to women of colour
This one seems pretty straight forward , right ?
It ’s pretty damn fundamental , but is it happening ?
Take Exhibit A , the feminist blogosphere .
As Renee at Womanist Musings explains it , in a post titled ‘ WOC and the table scraps of feminism ’ :
What I cannot fail to notice is that , despite the fact that women of colour definitely have something to say , our blogs are not counted as major voice in feminism online .
It is like we are some sort of “ special interest group ” who have completely divergent needs .
That ’s right I ’m saying it , white women are “ the women ” and we are just a side group looking for scraps .
This notion of women of colour being a ‘ special interest ’ rather than just ‘ women ’ or ‘ feminists ’ is one I have heard and read white feminists perpetuate .
An overwhelming number of white feminists seem to think that Black feminist theory is only for Black feminists , race - focused blogs only for non-white people , etc .
But by that same token would they argue that the blogs , groups and theory by white women is only for white women ?
So some questions to ask yourself : which groups or organisations are you involved with or support ?
How do you interact with women who are not white in your organising ?
How do you value their voices ?
If you read blogs , do you follow blogs written by people of colour ?
If you read feminist books , what ethnicity are the authors of the books you read ?
What ethnicity are your feminist role models ?
Why ?
And finally , ‘ listening ’ is not the same as putting up on a pedestal or hero - worshipping .
In the above post , Renee notes this tendency as well among some white feminists who do read her blog : the reluctance to comment and thereby expose oneself to the possibility of saying something ignorant .
Truly listening means engaging with , reflecting on , having a conversation , and – of course – potentially disagreeing with ; taking the risk of letting what you have heard change you .
Break down the silence
Silence is the reason why we are still in the same place we are today .
The quotes from Spare Rib show that conversations between white and black women about racism and whiteness in feminism have happened before .
But then white women fell back into the deafening silence which perpetuates white dominance .
Us white feminists need to learn how to challenge each other more ; to push ourselves to raise concerns about racism when we see it ( even if the person you ’re challenging is your friend ! )
The silence is also caused by the deep - seated fear and anxiety that most liberal white people seem to have in talking about racism in British society .
The fear of saying the wrong thing , of offending or being racist , not knowing what to say or how to treat non-white people respectfully .
It is the silence that is sometimes penetrated ( usually in moments of crisis ) , but then it returns , until next time .
It is the silence that we have to smash , and to keep smashing over and over .
The conversations , when we have them are useful , but it ’s not enough to have a workshop once a year , it has to be a constant and ongoing engagement .
And us white feminists should not be waiting for activists of colour to initiate the conversation .
A good starting point is to accept that all white people in Western society are racist to some extent – it has been ingrained in us since birth .
Let ’s not pretend we ’re all squeaky clean , but open up our minds and hearts to honest interrogation and the possibilities of change .
Yes , we probably will say something stupid and ignorant – there ’s a good chance I ’ve done so somewhere in this article – but unless we are willing to expose ourselves , there will be no progress .
Unlearning racism is a continuous journey , I do n’t think it really ever ends .
Questioning our own attitudes and behaviour , as well as those around us , has to become part of our everyday thought - process .
Learn how to criticise other white feminists
This is connected to silence , but I think it deserves its own heading because I am realising more and more that this is absolutely key if we are to transform exclusionary white feminism into something which has radical and liberatory potential .
I ’m not suggesting that we should forget about the achievements of these women .
I ’m saying , let ’s get real and not ignore the less flattering parts of feminist history .
Let ’s not make historical feminists out to be saints
When a feminist group is white - dominated , the white women have the power to silence criticism by sticking together and denying ( or more commonly , simply ignoring ) that anything problematic has happened .
Us white feminists need to learn how to challenge each other more ; to push ourselves to raise concerns about racism when we see it ( even if the person you ’re challenging is your friend ! ) .
When we organise together with other white women , we need to set up ways and time to talk constructively about race .
So when we write that mission statement with those buzz words ‘ inclusion ’ and ‘ diversity ’ , we need to think about what they actually mean , agree to continuously review how we are or are not achieving those aims .
Otherwise there is no point including those words in the first place .
Learn from history
I ’ve already written above about the importance of learning about the histories of activists of colour ( a great place to start for recent history is the book Other kinds of dreams ’ : Black Women ’s Organisations and the Politics of Transformation by Julia Sudbury ) .
But let ’s also learn more about the lesser known parts of the histories of white feminists .
There is a fascinating field of historical research into white British feminists ’ involvement in the Empire , which includes work by historians such as Antoinette Burton , who found in her research that British feminists at the turn of the century “ enlisted empire and its values so passionately and so articulately in their arguments for female emancipation ” that they must be “ counted among the shapers of imperial rhetoric and imperial ideologies ” .
I ’m not suggesting that we should forget about the achievements of these women .
I ’m saying , let ’s get real and not ignore the less flattering parts of feminist history .
Let ’s not make historical feminists out to be saints .
We also need to learn from what happened in the ’70s and ’ 80s .
I was n’t around then ( well not in feminist circles anyway ) , so I ’m calling out to the women who were , in the hope that you will make that history available to us younger feminists in an honest way .
The only way we can move forward in the conversation , is to learn from what ’s happened before and then build on that knowledge ( plus document our own discussions where possible , for future reference ) .
To finish , I want to clarify that my aim in writing this is not to argue that ‘ we ’ white women need to ‘ bring more women of colour into feminism ’ .
For one very obvious reason : they are already there .
Maybe not in the white feminism as we have defined it , but as social justice , anti-racist , anti-imperialist activists , as radical women of colour and Black feminists .
No , the reason I am writing this is because I want to see us white feminists make a serious commitment to transforming our politics and practices , so that we can connect up with the other women and men struggling against all forms of oppression .
So the question I want to ask my white sisters right now is this : what is feminism to you ?
Is it a lifestyle , a way for you to have an outlet about the sexism in your life , as it affects you ?
Or is it the ongoing fight to radically transform society , to end oppression against ALL women , and ultimately all people ?
Terese hopes to see lots of feminists at the demo against immigration detention outside Yarl ’s Wood on Saturday 21 March
Google , meet Gabble .
Gabble is a new site from Hewlett - Packard that lets people post videos online .
But unlike Google ’s YouTube service , which is geared to sharing with the masses , only people invited to your Gabble group can view your videos .
H.P. thinks that its orientation toward privacy will appeal to families uncomfortable making their home videos public and to businesses that want to use videos as a collaboration tool .
Of course , you can tweak the privacy settings on YouTube or Facebook to do much the same thing .
But H.P. says that defaulting to private videos makes life easier on the average person .
Make of that argument what you will .
Gabble came out of H.P. Labs , where the project was previously known as Conversa .
The online service remains in beta , and has only recently been opened up to the public at large .
Gabble is part of H.P. ’s strategy of trying out a variety of online , cloudlike services as it hunts for a hit .
“ If they go viral and take off quickly , then we will support them , ” said Shane Robison , H.P. ’s chief technology officer , during a recent interview .
“ If they do n’t , we ’ll take them down pretty quickly . ”
For example , H.P. fired up an online storage service called Upline in April 2008 and closed it down in February .
Meanwhile , it ’s still working on a vanity magazine publishing service called MagCloud .
Most of these services feed at least a pair of H.P. ’s businesses .
The video service , for example , could drive sales of networking and storage gear , while MagCloud primes H.P. ’s printing and storage businesses .
Another sign of the return of risk - takers to world financial markets : the revival of the so - called carry trade .
The carry strategy simply involves borrowing in countries with low interest rates to invest in countries with higher rates .
The investor hopes to profit from the difference between the loan rate and the rate earned in the target country .
Bloomberg News reports :
Stimulus plans and near - zero interest rates in developed economies are boosting investor confidence in emerging markets and commodity - rich nations with interest rates as much as 12.9 percentage points higher .
Using dollars , euros and yen to buy the currencies of Brazil , Hungary , Indonesia , South Africa , New Zealand and Australia earned 8 % from March 20 to April 10 , that trade ’s biggest three - week gain since at least 1999 , data compiled by Bloomberg show .
Goldman Sachs Group , Insight Investment Management and Fischer Francis Trees & Watts have begun recommending carry trades , which lost favor last year as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression drove investors to the relative safety of U.S. Treasuries .
Now efforts to end the first global recession since World War II are sending money into stocks , emerging markets and commodities .
A straightforward carry - trade transaction , Bloomberg notes , would be to borrow U.S. dollars at the three - month London interbank offered rate of 1.13 % and use the proceeds to buy Brazilian real and earn Brazil ’s three - month deposit rate of 10.51 % .
That would net an annualized 9.38 % -- as long as both currencies remain stable .
Chicago Department of Transportation / Streets for Cycling Plan 2020 Muller2 worked as a consultant to Sam Schwartz Engineering ( SSE ) for the CDOT Streets for Cycling Plan 2020 .
The Plan identifies a 600 - mile citywide bike network of existing and proposed bike routes that can be improved or constructed by 2020 .
M+M worked with SSE and Alta Planning to assemble a Facility Design Guide that will be used as a basis for selecting the appropriate bike route facilities and treatments to be used to implement the plan throughout the City .
M2 worked with SSE and CDOT to develop impressionistic renderings of the bike route classifications as they may appear on Chicago ’s streets and produced a series of presentation boards to be used for Public Outreach and Information .
A day after many pundits followed Bill Roggio freaking out about Pakistan 's status as a " failed state " because the Taliban were - gasp - only 60 miles from Islamabad , comes this from Reuters .
" Our leader has ordered that Taliban should immediately be called back from Buner , " Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan told Reuters .
He said there were only around 100 fighters in Buner .
Government and Taliban representatives went to Buner , along with Maulana Sufi Mohammad , a radical Muslim cleric who brokered the Swat deal , to tell the fighters to vacate the district .
Fazlullah 's aide Mehmood Khan said the militants were returning to Swat , and witnesses saw them leaving Buner in the early evening .
It was unclear whether the Taliban 's withdrawal was in response to a carrot or a stick , and worries abound over whether Pakistan lacks the capacity and intent to fight militancy .
Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani issued a statement aimed at dispelling those doubts and calming a mounting sense of crisis .
The army " will not allow the militants to dictate terms to the government or impose their way of life on the civil society of Pakistan , " the statement quoted Kayani as saying .
Kayani 's comments , issued after meeting with his commanders , reinforced expectations of an imminent offensive in Swat , analysts said .
100 Taliban .
Five hours travel away from Islamabad on Pakistani roads on a good day , i.e. one where you have a working truck that is n't being bombed and shelled by Pakistan 's huge military .
Some threat .
Want to bet me there 's 100 militiamen ready for the rightwing revolution somewhere within 5 hours of D.C. ?
By some lights , that puts America on the verge of being a hollow state .
Pepe Escobar got it exactly right in a recent piece for Asia Times :
Islamabad controls most of Pakistan - Sindh and Punjab provinces - with an iron fist .
Pakistani police and army control most of NWFP .
In " separatist " Balochistan there 's only 5 % of the total population .
For Washington to believe that a small , rural , Pashtun tribal agglomeration of bands of a maximum of 30 fighters , with no air force , no heavy artillery and no tanks , could take over a Pakistan with a 650,000 - strong well - trained army is an absolutely ridiculous notion .
And for Washington to believe - as Holbrooke implied - that a few Pashtun tribals and a few expat jihadis can take on Western civilization as a whole is also an absolutely ridiculous notion .
The Pakistani military also directly controls over 50 % of Pakistan 's economy and the civilian government is just a facade to keep US military aid coming .
The military has let the Taliban have those bits of Pakistan it is n't interested in running itself , that 's all .
If they were a serious threat to military supremacy they'd be crushed .
A potential deal where the Taliban get Sharia in return for keeping the populace off the military 's back ... that 's maybe a different story ...
But calling it a " failed state " if the military are back in charge , in a return to the status quo ante , deal or not ?
That 's just fearmongering for escalation even if the prospect of an overtly military - run Pakistan is n't a palatable one .
It 's linguistic slight - of - hand framing the issue the way interventionists want it framed .
" Failed States " , it is implicitly assumed , do n't have the sovereign right or ability to say no to American COIN ops .
More , describing a nation as a " Failed State " brings in a whole load of implicit assumptions about the moral right to meddle , to " protect non- failed states " .
And the one thing we can be sure about Bill Roggio is that he 's a reliable stenographer for the Pentagon 's spinners .
Still , none of this helps Obama 's atrocious strategy for the region one bit , especially given that the Pakistani military has no intention of decimating a Taliban movement that still provides it useful proxies against it 's real enemy , India .
But even by the logic of pro-escalation types like Roggio and David Kilcullen , surging in Afghanistan when they call Pakistan 's " imminent " collapse the real threat does n't make sense .
If an army larger than the entire US military can't stop the extremists on what they now say is the central front , what 's a piddling amount of troops in the country next door supposed to do ?
If that massive army simply refuses to stop the extremists , again what 's to be done by waving a far smaller " big stick " next door ?
Worse , a large military presence in the region , with that military using force and causing civilian casualties while the US tries to bend the Pakistani government to our will against its regional interests , is n't going to help stabilize Pakistan .
Quite the reverse .
It just does n't add up .
And it does n't add up because it has added fearmongering , designed to bolster waning domestic support for Bush 's mismanaged occupation now that Obama has gone with the neoliberal hawks and decided to double down .
It 's far more likely that the Taliban are n't a realistic existential threat to Afghanistan , Pakistan or even America .
Even in Afghanistan , only 8 % of the populace think they 've any chance of successfully re-seizing power and 84 % say there 's no Taliban problem in their area .
The Taliban are simply a thorny problem that can be contained by counter - terrorism and law enforcement , rather than massively lengthy and expensive COIN surges .

How about this , another post in one week , I had a little time today so I thought I would post this shot of a Wild Columbine shot just outside of my hometown of Madison .
This little wildflower was shot up in a “ holler ” as we call our canyons around here , just outside the city limits .
The hills and “ hollers ” that surround our community offer a suitable environment to host the numerous wildflowers that appear each spring , many can found growing into the town itself .
They actually make a beautiful addition to the more cultivated gardens that dot our city , some adapt very easily and others do n’t seem to fare as well .
Flowers such as the Columbine have flourished in many of the local gardens but others such as the Large Flowered Trillium have never been able to adapt , I guess this gives me a reason to get out and hike and shoot a few images each spring .
Thanks for stopping by and taking a look .
WASHINGTON  The Senate confirmed the nomination of Kathleen Sebelius as secretary of health and human services on Tuesday , allowing President Obama to fill the last vacancy in his cabinet with a seasoned politician who will take charge of the fight against swine flu .
The vote was 65 to 31 .
Among the nine Republicans who voted for Ms. Sebelius was Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , who announced on Tuesday that he was becoming a Democrat .
Besides directing federal efforts against swine flu , Ms. Sebelius will lead the administration ’s campaign for universal health insurance .
Republicans had delayed the vote because of concerns about Ms. Sebelius ’s support of abortion rights as governor of Kansas for the last six years .
Some Republicans also asserted that she and the administration intended to ration health care using the results of research comparing the cost and effectiveness of different treatments .
A seafaring band of scientists , engineers and yachtsmen with an obsession for Jules Verne and clean energy are building what they call the largest solar boat in the world , a $ 13 million catamaran they hope will take them around the world next year .
Construction is well underway on the 98 - foot - long vessel , which will feature 5,059 square feet of photovoltaic cells .
The project is being funded by Rivendell Holding AG , a Swiss firm that invests in renewable energy , simply to prove it can be done and the shipping industry can reduce its dependence on fossil fuel .
The team plans to circumnavigate the globe at the equator in 120 days at an average speed of 10 knots .
Should they succeed , Planet Solar will set a maritime milestone .
Solar electric pleasure boats have been tooling around lakes for awhile now , solar electric ferries are increasingly common and a solar electric catamaran called Sun 21 crossed the Atlantic in 29 days .
But so far no one 's made it around the world in a solar electric boat .
" Solar boats are a viable form of transportation for the future , " Delia Collardi , a spokeswoman for the project , told Wired.com .
" Our society is too dependent on fossil fuels , which are in limited supply and which are causing measurable negative effects on the earth 's atmosphere .
It 's now time to demonstrate the potential that renewable energies have to offer in the area of mobility . "
The project still has a long way to go - approximately 24,901.55 miles - but work on the solar cat 's hulls is almost complete .
Planet Solar is being built at the Knierim Yacht Club in Kiel , Germany .
The vessel , which is shaped something like an arrowhead , will be 98 feet long and 50 feet wide .
That climbs to 114 feet and 82 feet when the solar panels are fully unfurled .
There are n't many details on the drivetrain , and Collardi says the batteries " have not been defined . "
A press kit says the boat will weigh 60 tons and feature 470 square meters - 5,059 square feet - of photovoltaic cells that offer 22 percent efficiency .
Collardi says the vessel will have enough power to carry skipper Raphael Domjan , the 37 - year - old founder of Planet Solar , and navigator Gerard d'Aboville .
Both men are accomplished sailors and adventurers who , according to a press release , " want to be the Phileas Fogg " of the 21st Century .
Fogg , of course , was the adventurous main character Around the World in Eighty Days , Jules Verne 's novel about a man who travels by train , balloon , steamer and even elephants to circle the globe in record time and win a bet .
Verne 's great - grandson Jean Verne has signed on to the project , which organizers say represents " humanity 's hope for a better future . "
The route is still being worked out , but Planet Solar will set sail from Marseilles , France sometime next year and cross the Atlantic , then cut through the Panama Canal to cross the Pacific .
From there she 'll head south through the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean before crossing the Indian Ocean and Red Sea .
Then it 's through the Suez Canal and across the Mediterranean Sea and back home .
Ports of call are to be announced , but stops in New York , Shanghai , Singapore , Abu Dhabi and Monaco are among those being considered .
Supporters and well - wishers will be welcomed aboard , and Collardi says 50 people can fit inside the catamaran for short jaunts .
Immo Stroher , founder and president of Rivendell Holding , has dibs on Solar Planet at the end of the journey .

The world is agog with tales of the “ nouveau poor . ”
The well - to - do are tightening their belts :
Wealthy women are reappearing in the same designer dresses , shoppers are shyly pulling coupons from their pockets , and flying commercial is back in style .
But the rich and the middle class are not the only ones losing money .
Millions of poor people around the world have been plunged even further into deep poverty .
For them this means taking children out of school to help scavenge for food ; praying instead of seeing a doctor ; selling the last of the gold earrings so that the family can eat for a few more weeks .
For the poor , there is nothing “ nouveau ” about tumbling deeper into poverty .
The common perception about poverty is that we are slowly pulling people out of it .
The truth is otherwise :
Though the world pulls many millions out of poverty each year , it counteracts those gains by sending millions who were not poor into poverty .
We must understand this two - way highway if we genuinely aspire to end poverty .
A study we conducted at the World Bank , “ Moving Out of Poverty : Success from the Bottom Up , ” sought to survey this two - way highway , investigating who escapes poverty , who falls in , and why .
Among our diverse findings , two striking truths stood out .
The first is that poor people , contrary to their image in the developed world , are born capitalists in the Horatio Alger mold , more capitalist than the average New Yorker or Londoner .
They believe in the power of their own effort — they try and try , and even if they are foiled or cheated , they try again .
Though the poor are commonly believed to be fatalistic , our conversations with 60,000 poor people in 15 countries showed this to be patently untrue .
Department of Justice officials : NSA broke the law Agence France - Presse

This A key US spy agency overstepped legal limits in intercepting private e-mail messages and phone calls , Justice Department officials said Thursday , as top lawmakers in Congress said they would launch an investigation .
The National Security Agency ( NSA ) , an important intelligence - gathering arm of America 's vast espionage network , undertook the eavesdropping of US citizens ' electronic communications in a bid to thwart global terrorism .
But the agency exceeded the authority laid out by Congress , US officials said , adding the problems , which have since been corrected , were detected during " routine oversight " of the domestic eavesdropping program .
Senator Dianne Feinstein , who heads up the US Senate Intelligence Committee , said the charges were " serious " and warranted congressional investigation .
" These are serious allegations and we will make sure we get the facts , " the Democratic lawmaker said , vowing to hold hearings " within one month . "
And the top lawmaker in the US House of Representatives , Speaker Nancy Pelosi , said the revelations were " disturbing " and would be reviewed by the the appropriate committees in her chamber as well .

Bush administration must be held accountable , " she said .
Federal justice authorities however , said the problem already had been rectified .
" The Department of Justice ... took comprehensive steps to correct the situation and bring the program into compliance , " the Justice Department said in a statement .
It added the eavesdropping program had been temporarily suspended until the fixes were in place .
" The Justice Department takes its national security oversight responsibilities seriously , and works diligently to ensure that surveillance under established legal authorities complies with the nation 's laws , regulations and policies , including those designed to protect privacy interests and civil liberties , " the agency statement said .
Separately , the NSA said in a statement Thursday that its intelligence operations , " including programs for collection and analysis , are in strict accordance with US laws and regulations " as well as " all provisions " of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which governs espionage activities .
Due to the classified nature of the NSA 's work , details about the precise nature of the violation were not provided .
News reports citing official sources said the NSA overreach had been " inadvertent " and stemmed from ambiguities in new legislation regulating the US government 's wiretapping powers .
The New York Times wrote the legislation appeared to have created challenges in collecting intelligence on terrorism and spying suspects , particularly when trying to determine if the subject of a wiretap was overseas , and if the individual was in the United States .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) , which oversees the US intelligence community , said in a statement published by the New York Times that " when inadvertent mistakes are made , we take it very seriously and work immediately to correct them . "
The controversy is only the latest of many involving the warrantless wiretap program .
After the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks , former US president George W. Bush authorized the NSA to monitor international phone calls , e-mails and other electronic communications without court authorization when at least one party was suspected of supporting or engaging in terrorist activities .
The former US administration had asserted that it had the power to authorize domestic eavesdropping without court oversight .
But revelations in 2005 about the agency 's domestic espionage efforts sparked an outcry from civil liberties groups , as well as from some US lawmakers .
Congress last year approved legislation stating that the targets of the eavesdropping had to be " reasonably believed " to be outside the United States and stating that the NSA needed court approval to monitor the purely domestic communications of Americans who under suspicion .
But other violations have also come to light , the Times reported , including the agency 's efforts to wiretap a member of the US Congress without court approval , while on an overseas trip .
The US civil liberties community called on Congress to clamp down on NSA activities .
" It 's time to ... restore the checks and balances of our surveillance system .
Warrantless surveillance has no place in an America we can be proud of , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union .

Ron Asheton ' The Stooges ' Guitarist Dead 1948 - 2009
Ron Asheton 1948-2009
, guitarist and songwriter for the rock band The Stooges , was found dead in his Ann Arbor , Michigan home on Tuesday , January 6 , 2009 .
Police believe the 60 year old may have suffered a heart attack a few days ago .
Foul play has been ruled out and an autopsy and toxicology study are scheduled .
Officers were dispatched to Asheton 's home after his personal assistant had been unable to reach his client in the past few days .
According to Detective Bill Stanford , they found the deceased musician on a couch in the living room at around midnight .
Asheton , in 1967 , was a founding member of The Stooges , along with his drummer brother Scott Asheton , bassist Dave Alexander , and frontman Iggy Pop .
The group floundered in the 70's after their third album Raw Power flopped .
They reunited in 2003 and after a hiatus of 34 years , released an album of new material in 2007 titled The Weirdness .

" Profound economic emergency , " the president says .
Failure to pass his spending plan could " turn a crisis into a catastrophe " .
Any delay will mean " paralysis " and " disaster " .
It 's all out of the " shock doctrine " playbook : scare people to death and then demand that your agenda be enacted without delay .
Naomi Klein made waves two years ago with her book The Shock Doctrine , in which she claimed that conservative governments use crises to ram through free - market policies .
As she put it in an interview : " The Shock Doctrine is a political strategy that the Republican right has been perfecting over the past 35 years to use for various different kinds of shocks .
They could be wars , natural disasters , economic crises , anything that sends a society into a state of shock to push through what economists call ' economic shock therapy ' – rapid - fire , pro-corporate policies that they could n't get through if people were n't in a state of fear and panic . "
And that 's just what we 're seeing today – only in reverse .
Last year the US economy was hit with one shock after another : the Bear Stearns bail - out , the Indymac collapse , the implosion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the AIG nationalisation , the biggest stock market drop ever , the $ 700 bn Wall Street bail - out and more – all accompanied by a steady drumbeat of apocalyptic language from political leaders .
And what happened ?
Did the Republican administration summon up the spirit of Milton Friedman and cut government spending ?
Did it deregulate and privatise ?
No .
It did what governments actually do in a crisis – it seized new powers over the economy .
It dramatically expanded the regulatory powers of the Federal Reserve and injected a trillion dollars of inflationary credit into the banking system .
It partially nationalised the biggest banks .
It appropriated $ 700bn with which to intervene in the economy .
It made General Motors and Chrysler wards of the federal government .
It wrote a bail - out bill giving the secretary of the treasury extraordinary powers that could not be reviewed by courts or other government agencies .
Now the Obama administration is continuing this drive toward centralisation and government domination of the economy .
And its key players are explicitly referring to heir own version of the shock doctrine .
Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said the economic crisis facing the country is " an opportunity for us " .
After all , he said : " You never want a serious crisis to go to waste .
And this crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before " such as taking control of the financial , energy , information and healthcare industries .
That 's just the sort of thing Naomi Klein would have us believe that free - marketers like Milton Friedman think .
" Some people stockpile canned goods and water in preparation for major disasters , " Klein wrote .
" Friedmanites stockpile free - market ideas . "
But that is exactly what American left - liberals have been doing in anticipation of a Democratic administration coming to power at a time when the public might be frightened into accepting more government than it normally would .
For instance , the Centre for American Progress , run by John Podesta , who was President Bill Clinton 's chief of staff and President - elect Obama 's transition director , has just released Change for America : A Progressive Blueprint for the 44th President .
Paul Krugman , the Bush - bashing New York Times columnist , endorsed Emanuel 's enthusiasm : " Progressives hope that the Obama administration , like the New Deal , will respond to the current economic and financial crisis by creating institutions , especially a universal healthcare system , that will change the shape of American society for generations to come . "
Arianna Huffington had called Klein 's book " prophetic " .
As the Obama team began drawing up plans , she proved just how right she was , declaring : " A crisis is a terrible thing to waste .
And it might be this particular crisis that will make it possible for the Obama administration to do some really innovative , bold things on healthcare , on energy independence , on all the areas that have been neglected . "
None of this should surprise us .
It 's crazy to think that most governments will respond to a crisis by reducing their own powers and deregulating the economy , as Klein would have us believe .
Political leaders naturally respond to crisis by riding in as the man on the white horse and taking control .
As Rick Perlstein , liberal historian , wrote : " The Oval Office 's most effective inhabitants have always understood [ that a crisis is the best opportunity to make radical change ] .
Franklin D Roosevelt hurled down executive orders and legislative proposals like thunderbolts during his first hundred days , hardly slowing down for another four years before his window slammed shut ; Lyndon Johnson , aided by John F Kennedy 's martyrdom and the landslide of 1964 , legislated at such a breakneck pace his aides were in awe .
Both presidents understood that there are too many choke points – our minority - enabling constitutional system , our national tendency toward individualism and our concentration of vested interests – to make change possible any other way . "
Robert Higgs , the libertarian historian , is less enthusiastic .
In Crisis and Leviathan , he demonstrated that government growth in the US has not been slow and steady , year in and year out .
Rather , its scope and power tend to shoot up during wars and economic crises .
Occasionally , around the world , there have been instances where a crisis led to free - market reforms , such as the economic reforms in Britain and New Zealand in response to deteriorating economic conditions .
Generally , though , governments seek to expand their power , and they take advantage of crises to do so .
But they rarely spell their intentions out as clearly as Rahm Emanuel did .
After a last - minute scramble , the EU has been persuaded to kill the idea of forcing " 3 - strikes " copyright / internet legislation on European states .
The " 3 - strikes " rule says that you can have your Internet connection taken away after a copyright holder accuses you of infringement three times — but the rightsholder does n't need to show any evidence that you 've done anything wrong .
The entertainment industry has been lobbying around the world for the right to decide who gets to use the internet .
In New Zealand , they managed to get Bill 92A , a 3 - strikes rule , adopted by Parliament , but sustained , noisy activism from local geeks and artists forced the government to reverse its decision and go back to the drawing board on copyright .
In France , Sarkozy pushed hard for a 3 - strikes rule ( his wife is a pop- star who is demanding more sweeping powers for entertainers over the internet ) , but was defeated .
3 - strikes is a feature of the secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , which the US , Canada , Japan , the EU and other rich countries are conducting behind closed doors .
The entertainment industry slipped 3 - strikes into the EU through an amendment to the notorious " Telecoms Package , " a huge , complex piece of legislation .
To counter this , progressive MEPs wrote a set of " Citizens Rights " amendments that established that internet access was a fundamental right in Europe that cannot be taken away without judicial review and an actual finding of wrongdoing .
Activists went down to the wire this week , phoning and emailing their MEPs to ask them to vote to defend due process and citizens ' rights , and it paid off .
Yesterday , the citizens ' rights amendments passed 407/57 — and the EU banned Sarkozy from reintroducing his failed copyright proposal .
A formidable campaign from the citizens put the issues of freedoms on the Internet at the center of the debates of the Telecoms Package .
This is a victory by itself .
It started with the declaration of commissioner Viviane Reding considering access to Internet as a fundamental right1 .
The massive re-adoption of amendment 138/462 rather than the softer compromise negotiated by rapporteur Trautmann with the Council is an even stronger statement .
These two elements alone confirm that the French ' three strikes ' scheme , HADOPI , is dead already .
Amendment 138/46 adopted again .
Internet is a fundamental right in Europe .

Assembling your Whoopie Pies
A whoopie pie is a delicious baked good that also goes by the name gob , black - and - white as well as bob .
Whoopie pies consist of two circular shaped thin cakes with a creamy filling between them .
The end result of a whoopie pie somewhat resembles a giant Oreo cookie or an ice cream sandwich .
The origin of whoopie pies is largely up to debate .
Some people argue they are from New York similar to the egg cream , but the general consensus is they are either from New England or from the Pennsylvania 's Amish culture .
You can buy Whoopie pies at convenience stores all over North America , but let 's face it , the most delicious pies are the ones you make at home .
The other benefit to home made whoopie pies is that you can indulge and eat like 10 without looking like a glutton buying them from the store !* 2 cups all - purpose flour * 1/2 cup Dutch - process cocoa powder * 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda* 1 teaspoon salt * 1 cup well - shaken buttermilk * 1 teaspoon vanilla * 1 stick ( 1/2 cup ) unsalted butter , softened * 1 cup packed brown sugar * 1 large egg* 1 stick ( 1/2 cup ) unsalted butter , softened * 1 1/4 cups confectioners sugar * 2 cups marshmallow cream such as Marshmallow Fluff * 1 teaspoon vanillaTo make the cakes for your whoopie pies , first preheat your oven to 350 degrees .
In a bowl , whisk together the flower , baking soda , salt and cocoa until well mixed .
In another small bowl , mix together the vanilla and buttermilk .
Using an electric mixer at medium - high setting , beat together the butter and brown sugar until fluffy and pale .
Next add an egg and mix until it 's mixed in evenly .
Lower the speed on your electric mixer and alternate between adding in a bit of the flour mixture and a bit of buttermilk until it is all mixed .
On two large baking sheets , place 1 / 4 cup mounds of batter roughly two inches apart .
Place in the upper portion of your oven , then half way through cooking place on the middle shelf to help make your cakes puffy .
Cooking time is roughly 11 - 13 minutes .
In a bowl , beat together your confectioners sugar , butter , vanilla and marshmallow using an electric mixer on the medium setting .
You should mix until the filling is nice and smooth .
Take one cake , and spread a heaping tablespoon of filling on the flat side of the cake .
Take another cake and place the flat side on top of the filling .
That is it !
Enjoy indulging in these tasty treats .
I suppose this should be filed under other breaking news like " the sky is blue , " and " grass is green , " but I 'll say it anyway : Republicans continue to lie about the recent Pew Poll , using it to say things like
Yet no president in the past 40 years has done more to polarize America so much , so quickly .
- Karl Rove
But as reported by Greg Sargent at The Plum Line :
Many on the right have grabbed on to the Pew poll ’s finding that Obama ’s approval rating has a 61 - point partisan gap — 27 % of Republicans approve , while 88 % of Dems do .
Pew called the numbers “ the most polarized ” in decades but did n’t blame Obama .
Pew associate director Dimock , however , says this is a misreading of the poll .
Dimock says the divide is driven by long term trends and by the uncommonly enthusiastic reaction to Obama by members of his own party — by what he calls “ the way Democrats are reacting to Obama . ”
Interestingly , Dimock also said this phenomenon is partly caused by the recent tendency of Republicans to be less charitable towards new Presidents than Dems have been .
In contrast to the 27 % of GOPers approving of Obama now , more than a third of Dems ( 36 % ) approved of George W. Bush at a comparable time in 2001 .
Before that , only 26 % of Republicans approved of Bill Clinton at the same time in his presidency , while 41 % of Dems approved of both George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan at comparable times .
And as Chuck Todd explains :
He 's already being called " le premier martyr d'Hadopi . "
Who is he ?
He 's a 31 - year old Frenchman named J�r�me Bourreau - Guggenheim , and he works in the Internet innovation division of French TV broadcaster TF1 .
After sending a private note to his MP opposing the proposed " three strikes " law currently being debated in France , Bourreau - Guggenheim found himself hauled into his boss ' office .
He was shown a copy of his e-mail , and he was fired for " strategic differences " with his employer .
The case is all over French newspapers today .
Lib�ration reported the story , which began back on February 19th when Bourreau - Guggenheim decided to write his MP .
He did so from a private e-mail address and told Fran�oise de Panafieu ( a member of the majority UMP party ) what he thought of the " Cr�ation et Internet " bill .
The bill is sometimes referred to as " HADOPI , " after the French acronym for the new administrative authority that the bill would create ; HADOPI would be responsible for overseeing warnings and Internet disconnections for those who repeatedly infringe online copyrights .
The idea is so unpopular that 88 percent of the European Parliament this week voted to ban the practice unless overseen by a judge .
After Bourreau - Guggenheim expressed his opposition to the law , he thought no more about it until he was called into his boss ' office and shown ... an exact copy of his e-mail to Panafieu .
According to his boss , the e-mail had been provided by the Ministry of Culture , where Minister Christine Albanel is the French government 's key backer of the Cr�ation et Internet law ( and also a UMP member ) .
But why did the Ministry of Culture have Bourreau - Guggenheim 's e-mail ?
Because Panafieu 's office had passed the message from its constituent on to the Ministry , which then passed it to TF1 , which also supports the new bill .
Bourreau - Guggenheim could hardly believe it when , on April 16 , he was fired from his job for " divergence forte avec la strat�gie " ( strong disagreement with the strategy ) of TF1 .
When contacted by Le Point magazine , Albanel 's advisors said that they were " tr�s choqu�s et alarm�s " by what had happened , even blaming TF1 for an overreaction .
" On n'a jamais r�clam� la t�te de ce salari� .
La r�action de TF1 est tr�s exag�r�e ! " said the unnamed source .
" Cette d�cision est vraiment regrettable . "
( Rough translation : " We never asked for his job .
TF1 's reaction was way out of proportion !
The decision is truly regrettable . " )
Apparently , the Albanel people were just passing the e-mail along for informational purposes — though if that were true , one wonders why the identifying information was n't stripped out of the message .
" Truly regrettable " is certainly an understatement here , but it 's the same sentiment offered by Panafieu 's office , which says it merely passed the e-mail along to the Ministry of Culture because it was an " interesting argument . "
No one " meant " for this to happen — but happened it has , and it's another huge black eye for UMP , which could n't even get the bill passed on its first reading because it was outmaneuvered by the minority Socialists .
Cr�ation et Internet comes up for a second vote in the National Assembly next week and looks set to pass , though the European Parliament may have other ideas when it comes to implementation .
During really stressful periods , sometimes I just need to shut down .
This usually means : hiding in bed , usually with some combination of drinking extensively , cutting as a stress - reliever , sleeping a lot , taking painkillers , and listening to music ( usually for a couple of hours ) until I can reenter the world .
I 'm home alone a lot , so sometimes these can be kind of scary episodes .
I know what you 're " supposed " to do , during times like this , is make sure you 're around people so as to be safe .
Last year I had two or three close friends who would call to check in periodically , to make sure I was still alive and OK during a particularly bad time .
( This group is n't really available right now , which has made things kind of hard ) .
Right now I have a wonderful partner ( also a close friend ) , who is aware that I do this , and sympathetic -- i.e. aware of the issue , not freaked out by the cutting part of it , and has been through similar things -- and who would be really great to talk to during these moments .
( we 're long - distance , so this would mainly be a phone thing )
The problem being : I have no idea how to ask for this kind of support , and I feel like he wo n't extend it ( rightly so ) unless I ask for it .
What I want more than anything during these moments , is hear a friendly voice , to be distracted and be reminded that things are going to be OK .
If support is freely extended , it 's wonderful , but I feel like I can't ask for it .
What I definitely can't do , when I 'm feeling really fucked up , is initiate a phone call .
How do I broach this conversation ?
I do n't want this to be something that takes over my life -- I just want to be able to get in touch with someone , and feel like it 's OK to do this , when things get really bad .
I 've been in and out of therapy for this .
These are my thoughts :
1 ) It 's a rare therapist who wo n't immediately pathologize self - harm and assume you 're suicidal .
I 've spent hours trying to explain the difference ( and there * is* a very clear difference , at least for me ) , and am really tired of having this conversation .
The best they do is prescribe medication -- and I think the last thing I need , during these moments , is access to a bottle of pills .
2 ) My school does n't have ongoing resources for this sort of thing , so even if it were helpful , therapy in my area would be pretty much unaffordable )
So it 's just me , for now .
Which is OK .
But I 'd really like some feedback on how to create a better support system .
Thanks in advance for your advice , Metafilter .
I really appreciate it .

But these bonuses , outrageous as they are , are a symptom of a much larger problem .
And that 's the system and culture that made them possible -- a culture where people made enormous ....
Now , I know a lot of you are outraged about this -- rightfully so .
I 'm outraged , too .
It 's hard to understand that a company that 's relying on extraordinary assistance from taxpayers to keep its doors open would be paying anybody lavish bonuses .
It goes against our most basic sense of what 's fair and what 's right .
It offends our values .
Now , it is always good to get out of Washington for a little while , and come to places like Costa Mesa .
( Applause . )
The climate is a lot nicer and so is the conversation .
( Applause . )
So I am looking forward to taking your questions in a few minutes and talking to you about your concerns .
But before I do , I want to say a few words at the top .
And I 'm going to start out just by talking about these AIG bonuses you 've been hearing about .
All right .
Now , let me just say that , for those of you who have chairs , go ahead and sit down so folks behind you can see .
All right .
Make sure to sit down if you 've got a chair .
We 'll have time to shake hands afterwards .
Secretary of State Debra Bowen is here .
( Applause . )
State Comptroller John Chiang is here .
( Applause . )
Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell is here .
( Applause . )
And I 've got a couple of others .
We 've got the Mayor of Santa Ana , Miguel Pulido , who 's here .
( Applause . )
We 've got -- let 's see , who else ?
We have -- State Senator Jose Correa is here .
( Applause .
We have State Representative Jose Solorio here .
( Applause . )
We have the State Democratic Party Chair Art Torres is here .
( Applause . )
And a great friend and supporter , Steve Westly , is here .
Give everybody a round of applause .
( Applause . )
I hope I did not miss anybody .
THE PRESIDENT : No , no , no , we actually -- our office screwed up and I think did n't get the invitation to him on time , so he 's not here .
That was a screw - up on our part .
So I want to let him know we 're sorry about that , and I want everybody to give him a big round of applause , it 's his district .
( Applause . )
Give the Lieutenant Governor a big round of applause .
( Applause . )
We 've got the Secretary of Labor , Hilda Solis , who is here .
( Applause . )
Got an outstanding member of Congress , Representative Loretta Sanchez .
( Applause . )
Now , this is not Loretta 's district , this is actually Dana Rohrabacher 's district .
First of all , let me thank Jerome for the wonderful introduction .
Give him a big round of applause .
( Applause . )
We 've got a number of elected officials who are here , who I want to acknowledge .
We 've got the Lieutenant Governor , John Garamendi .
THE PRESIDENT : Thank you .
Thank you , everybody .
( Applause . )
Everybody have a seat -- we 're going to be here a while .
Well , thank you so much Orange County for the wonderful reception .
Thank you .
...sums of money , taking irresponsible risks that have now put the entire economy at risk .
So we 're going to do everything we can to deal with these specific bonuses .
And I know Washington is all in a tizzy and everybody is pointing fingers at each other and saying it's their fault , the Democrats ' fault , the Republicans ' fault .
Listen , I 'll take responsibility ; I 'm the President .
( Applause . )
We did n't grant these contracts , and we 've got a lot on our plate , but it is appropriate , when you 're in charge , to make sure that stuff does n't happen like this .
So we 're going to do everything we can to fix it .
So for everybody in Washington who 's busy scrambling , trying to figure out how to blame somebody else , just go ahead and talk to me , because it 's my job to make sure that we fix these messes , even if I do n't make them .
( Applause . )
But what 's just as important is that we make sure we do n't find ourselves in this situation again , where taxpayers are on the hook for losses in bad times , and all the wealth generated in good times goes to those who are at the very top of the income ladder .
That 's the kind of ethic we 've had for too long .
That 's the kind of approach that led us into this mess .
That is something we have to change if we 're truly going to turn our economy around and move this country forward .
So I 'm absolutely committed to ensuring that we have the tools we need to prevent the kinds of abuses that sent AIG spiraling .
And we 've got to make sure that we 've got regulations that do n't allow companies to take these huge risks that are so big that they can sort of hold us hostage .
We can't let them fail because it would bring the entire banking system down and hurt a lot of innocent people , but on the other hand , they act irresponsibly .
We have to make sure we do n't put ourselves in that position .
And I 'm also committed to ensuring that if we ever do have to intervene again to prevent a bankruptcy that could cause catastrophe for the whole financial system , that we have some of the tools that a bankruptcy judge has to help renegotiate contracts , to sell off insolvent parts of an institution , to protect the healthy parts , to protect depositors and creditors and other consumers .
We also want to do this because it serves the most important goal we have today , which is to rebuild our economy in a way that 's consistent with our values -- an economy -- ( applause ) -- and I want to describe to you the kind of economy that we want to build : an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility , not high - flying finance schemes -- ( applause ) ; an economy that 's built on a strong foundation , but not one that 's propelled by overheated housing markets and maxed - out credit cards .
In other words , we want to build an economy that offers prosperity for the long run .
You remember that ad that they used to have out there that said , " We earn money the old - fashioned way ; we earn it . "
Well , we need to get back to that philosophy , because that 's what all of you do .
You 're out there earning a living , and we 've got to reward people who are working hard , not the bubble - and - burst economy we 've experienced in recent years .
( Applause . )
We do n't need these house of cards , these Ponzi schemes , even when they 're legal , where a relatively few do spectacularly well while the middle class loses ground .
You know what I 'm talking about .
I do n't need to tell you these are challenging times .
I do n't need to tell you this because you 're living it every day .
One out of every 10 Californians is out of work right now .
You 've got one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation .
Budget cuts are threatening the jobs of thousands of teachers across this state .
( Applause . )
But here 's what I know -- here 's what I want you to know :
We are not only going to make it through this crisis , we are going to come out on the other side a stronger and more prosperous nation .
( Applause . )
I can't tell you how long it 's going to take or what obstacles we 'll face along the way , but I can promise you this -- there will be brighter days ahead , here in California and all across America .
( Applause . )
But that 's only going to happen if we pull together and focus on the big things -- focus on the long term .
We 've got to get past this petty bickering , the constant trivialization of politics , and focus on getting the job done .
And we 're already -- we 're seeing signs of progress .
Because of the Recovery Act that your two outstanding senators , Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer -- ( applause ) -- along with Congresswoman Sanchez -- along with Congresswoman Sanchez -- ( applause ) -- worked so hard to pass and that I signed into law the other week , a new hospital will be built at Camp Pendleton that will give our servicemen and women the care they deserve .
( Applause . )
Over in Inglewood , the police department is planning to expand its staff by 30 people .
( Applause . )
Orange County is hoping to add a new lane on SR - 91 -- ( applause ) -- creating about 2,000 jobs -- creating about 2,000 jobs and easing congestion in the process .
These are just a few of the 396,000 jobs we will create or save in California -- and the 3.5 million jobs we 'll create or save across America over the next two years .
( Applause . )
We are also taking unprecedented steps to unlock our frozen credit markets so families can get the loans they need to buy a home or a car , and businesses can pay for inventory or make payroll .
That 's why earlier this week , we took a sweeping step to free up loans for entrepreneurs , helping them start and grow the small businesses that employ half of our private - sector workers .
( Applause . )
That 's why we 're creating a fund that will help support up to $ 1 trillion in loans , including auto loans and college loans .
( Applause . )
That 's why we 've launched a housing plan that will help responsible homeowners save money by refinancing their mortgage loans .
( Applause . )
Now , none of this will make any difference , however , unless we strengthen our economy over the long term ; unless we put our economy on a firmer footing by rebuilding its foundation .
And that 's exactly the purpose of the budget I 'm submitting to Congress .
It 's a budget that makes hard choices about where to save and where to spend .
Because of the massive deficit we inherited and the costs of this financial crisis , we are going through our books line by line so that we can cut our deficit in half by the end of my first term and reduce it by $ 2 trillion over the next decade .
( Applause . )
Now , what we will not cut -- what we will not cut are investments that will lead to real growth and real prosperity ; investments that will make a difference in the lives of this generation and future generations .
Let me give you some examples .
Because of spiraling health care costs that are crushing our families , dragging down our entire economy , and represent one of the fastest - growing parts of our federal and state budgets , we 've made a historic commitment to health care reform in this budget -- reform that brings us closer to the day when health care is affordable and accessible for every single American .
( Applause . )
Because we know that countries that out - educate us today will out - compete us tomorrow , this budget invests in a complete and competitive education for every American -- in early childhood education programs that work ; in high standards and accountability in our schools ; in finally putting the dream of a college degree or technical training within reach for anyone who wants it .
( Applause . )
Because we know that enhancing America 's competitiveness will also require reducing our dependence on foreign oil and building a clean energy economy , this budget will spark the transformation we need to create green jobs and launch renewable energy companies right here in California .
It makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy .
It invests in technologies like wind power and solar power and fuel - efficient cars and trucks powered by batteries like the ones I 'll be seeing in Rosemead tomorrow , all of which will also help combat climate change -- because the weather is already nice in Orange County , we do n't want it to get warmer .
( Applause . )
So that 's what this budget does .
Now , here 's what it does not do .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Love you , Obama !
THE PRESIDENT : I love you back .
( Applause . )
Here 's what the budget does not do .
It does not raise the taxes of any family making less than $ 250,000 a year by a single dime .
( Applause . )
In fact , 95 percent of all working families will receive a tax cut as a result of our recovery plan .
Now , there are those who say these plans are too ambitious ; we should be trying to do less , not more .
Obama is trying to do too much , they say ; just focus on Wall Street , focus on the banks .
AUDIENCE : Nooo --
THE PRESIDENT : Well , I say our challenges are too large to ignore .
The cost of health care is too high to ignore .
The dependence on oil is too dangerous to ignore .
Our education deficit is too wide to ignore .
( Applause . )
To kick these problems down the road for another four years or eight years , that would be to continue the same irresponsibility that got us to this point .
I did n't run for President to pass on our problems to the next generation , or the next President .
I ran for President to solve these problems so that you 've got a better shot in life .
( Applause . )
AUDIENCE : Obama !
Obama !
Obama !
THE PRESIDENT : So I know folks in Washington and folks on Wall Street are saying , no , no , no , one problem at a time -- our problems .
( Laughter . )
I understand the thinking behind that -- and it's true , we 've got to solve this banking crisis .
There 's no doubt about it .
Not because I 'm that concerned about the bankers , but because I 'm concerned about you .
And we 've got to get liquidity and credit flowing again to small businesses , to people who want to buy a car or who want to refinance a home .
So I understand their thinking about solving that problem .
But , you know , I 've said before , when you 're President you 've got to walk and chew gum at the same time .
( Applause . )
It would be nice -- it would be nice if I could just pick and choose what problems to face and when to face them , and say , no , I 'm sorry , hold off on health care ; Afghanistan , let 's put that aside for a while .
You know , I would sleep a little easier .
But that 's not the way it works .
It does n't work that way for you .
It does n't work that way for you -- you do n't get to choose between paying your mortgage bills or your medical bills .
You do n't get to choose between paying your kids ' tuition and saving enough for retirement .
You do n't get to say , well , I 'm sorry , hold on a second , you know , I really got to take on some issues at home here so I do n't think I 'm going to go to work for a week .
It would be nice to do , but you do n't do that .
You need to take all these problems on .
And you need a government that 's going to help you on all these problems , that will do the same .
That 's what leadership is all about .
( Applause . )
And that 's what this debate on the budget is all about -- about whether we are willing to do what needs to be done not only to get our economy moving right now , but to put it on the road to lasting , shared prosperity .
It can be easy to lose sight of this .
It 's easy for pundits to get on TV and put their ratings ahead of their own sense of responsibility , and try to oversimplify what 's at stake .
It can be difficult to break free from the partisanship that 's held sway in Washington for so many years .
But that 's what we have to do .
That 's what this moment requires .
For all of you know deep down -- and what folks in Washington sometimes forget -- in the end , a budget is not merely numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs .
It 's about your lives ; it 's about your families ; it 's about your dreams for the future .
You did not send us to Washington to stand in the way of your aspirations .
You did n't send us there to say no to change -- you sent us there to get things done and bring about change , and that 's what I intend to do .
( Applause . )
But I can't do it without you .
I can't do it without you , the American people .
That 's why I 'm here today , because it will take all of us talking with one another and all of us working together to see our nation through this difficult time and bring about that brighter day .
So I hope you 're all ready to get to work .
( Applause . )
I want to thank you all for this opportunity to speak with you .
Here 's what we 're going to do .
We 're going to open it up to questions .
And I know there are a lot of folks back there , too .
( Applause . )
So I 'm going to try -- I 'm going to try not to completely discriminate to the folks who got here , here in front .
There are no rules to this -- except a couple .
( Laughter . )
First of all -- first of all , nobody has been preselected here , so , you know , I do n't mind if you want to take me to task .
If you think I 'm a bum and doing a bad job , you go ahead and ask your question .
The only thing I 'd ask is everybody raise their hands , number one -- not everybody now , I mean everybody who has a question .
( Laughter . )
Number two is that I 'm going to go girl , boy , girl , boy , so it 's fair .
( Laughter . )
Number three , I would ask that everybody try to keep their question relatively brief so that we can get as many questions in as possible .
Now , it does n't have to be a question , it can be a comment , as well , but , you know , we want to try to keep the speeches to a minimum .
And I will try to also answer questions as briefly as possible .
Okay ?
All right .
And I hope you do n't mind , I 'm going to take off my jacket .
If you guys are hot -- ( applause . )
Okay .
All right .
We 're going to call on this young lady right here .
And wait till you get a microphone so everybody can hear you .
Introduce yourself if you can .
Q Good afternoon , President Obama .
I have a very simple question .
Do you have intentions of , when the reelection comes , of running for President again ?
THE PRESIDENT : Oh , well , the -- first of all -- first of all , let me say this : I 've been in office -- I 've been in office for two months now .
The last thing I 'm thinking about is reelection .
But I will tell you this -- I mean -- and this is a serious answer to your question :
If I could get done what I think needs to get done in four years , even if it meant that I was only President for four years , I would rather be a good President taking on the tough issues for four years than a mediocre President for eight years .
( Applause . )
So I will -- and I will also say this -- I will also say this , that my obligation is to make sure that we 've improved our economy , that we 've gotten serious on health care , made significant progress on energy , made education more affordable , and improved the excellence of our educational system K - 12 , that we have started controlling our deficits .
So there 's some very specific standards by which I think you should hold me accountable and measure my success .
And if I do n't deliver on those things four years from now , then I think you will be answering the question of whether I run for re-election or not , because ultimately I 'm answerable to you -- I 'm your employee .
Okay ?
All right , the gentleman in the black shirt right here .
Q Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT : Yes , sir .
Q My question concerns those states who have refused to take certain portions of the stimulus money .
Is there any way to reallocate that money to those states who are willing recipients -- ( laughter and applause ) -- such as California ?
( Applause . )
THE PRESIDENT : Well , look , we had a vigorous debate on the stimulus , on the Recovery Act , and let me just say a couple of things about the Recovery Act .
Number one , there was almost uniform consensus among both conservative and liberal economists that when you have the economy on such a free - fall , that you need a big stimulus to try to make sure that goods and services are still being purchased , and that the decline in demand , as consumers pull back , is being filled .
If you do n't , then the recession gets even worse .
There 's almost uniform consensus on it .
So that 's point number one .
Point number two : The Recovery Act that we put forward contained some provisions in it that I do n't think anybody should be able to argue with -- that we 're providing extended unemployment insurance to people who have lost their jobs ; that we are allowing -- if you 've lost your job , right now you can get COBRA , but you can't afford COBRA -- so subsidizing health insurance for people who have lost their jobs ; investing in our roads and our bridges and our infrastructure , so that we are more competitive over the long term .
Now , there are some people -- there have been just a handful of states , two or three , who have said , we do n't want to take some of the unemployment insurance because what we said was that a portion of this unemployment insurance -- you have to make it more available to people who are temporary workers or part - time workers because the labor force has changed and there are a lot of people , particularly women , who , you know , they may have children , they may be working part - time , but when they lose that job it 's tough for them .
So we 've got to modify how we think about unemployment insurance .
And they said , well , we do n't want to change how we do things .
I think that 's a mistake .
And I think that the folks in those states should let them know that it 's a mistake .
And I 'm still hopeful that they may end up changing their minds .
But I will keep in mind what you just said , which is there 's at least one guy in California who 's willing to take the money .
( Applause . )
Can I make one last point ?
I hope you do n't mind , can I make one last point about this stimulus package ?
I want to make a larger point about the deficit and the national debt -- because the main argument that you 're hearing right now in opposition to some of our economic plans , including our budget , is you 've got all this money going out , you 're creating huge deficits and debt , and that 's irresponsible .
Well , first of all , most of these critics presided over a doubling of the national debt .
We are inheriting a $ 1.3 trillion deficit .
So they do n't have the standing to make this criticism , I think , given how irresponsible they 've been .
That 's point number one .
Having said that , even somebody who caused the problem is n't wrong when they say it is a problem that we 've got this big debt and these big deficits .
So what we 've tried to do is to say let 's , right now , just focus on getting the economy back on track , reducing unemployment , creating jobs , making sure our school systems still have teachers , cops are still on the streets , firefighters are still in the station house .
Let 's do what we need to do to get through this difficult time .
Let 's make some investments in health care , energy , education that will lay the foundation for long - term economic growth .
But let 's also start making some tough choices about the deficit as soon as we get out of this recovery .
So , for example , we can't keep on providing the insurance companies huge subsidies under Medicare for a program called Medicare Advantage that does n't make our seniors any healthier than the regular Medicare plan .
( Applause . )
We need to go ahead and use that money for other things .
We can't keep on giving these huge procurement contracts to defense industries that end up being 50 , 60 , 100 percent over budget -- very good for contractors , not so good for taxpayers .
So we 've got to institute reforms and we 've already identified potentially pulling $ 40 billion out annually in savings on procurement .
( Applause . )
Those are the kinds of things -- those are the kinds of steps that we need to take .
And we are going to go through this budget line by line .
And some of these choices may be difficult .
I wo n't lie to you , we can't keep on just printing money and saying we 'll let our children worry about it .
But we have to do it in a way that right now focuses on just getting people back on their feet , getting the economy running again .
And then we 're going to have to make some difficult choices -- especially over some of these longer - term entitlements like Social Security and Medicare .
All right , this young lady right here .
Hold on a second , we 've got a mic right here , right in front .
Q Hello , Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT : Hello .
Q I'm a community bank SBA lender and have proudly been one for 20 years .
We 're very , very excited about the stimulus package and we are going to do everything we can to get the money out there , including financing the construction projects that you 're talking about .
However , as a lender and as a bank , we have a problem that I feel needs to be addressed .
When we make loans that are less than the normal quality , even with the SBA guarantee , the regulators tend to criticize us .
And when they criticize us , they make us set aside reserves as if the loan is going to be bad , and that eats into our capital .
That 's part of the problem that banks are having right now and why they needed the TARP money .
Not all banks are bad banks , as you know , and as a community bank that 's been around for 85 years , we have n't even taken TARP money .
We want to make SBA loans , but we do n't want to get our hands slapped by the regulators when we try to help these people .
And last year is going to be a less than stellar tax return for everybody that 's had a problem , that is going to come to the SBA for help .
Will you be able to speak with the regulators and set some kind of new bar so that we wo n't be criticized and we can actually go out and loan this money that we want to ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , you make -- you make a terrific point .
This is a excellent point .
( Applause . )
Let me say a couple of things on this .
First of all , just so everybody caught the issue here , there are a lot of community banks , smaller banks , local banks that did not act irresponsibly ; they were n't involved in , you know , buying some of these weird financial instruments that did n't work ; they 're not paying out the $ 100 - million bonuses .
You do n't look like you got a $ 5 - million bonus .
( Laughter . )
You wish , right ?
Yes , they 're working with local businesses , small businesses , small contractors .
They take in deposits ; they do what banks are supposed to do .
They 're still having some problems --- local community banks -- and they 're having some problems in two areas .
Number one is , a lot of these community banks give Small Business Administration loans , SBA loans , that are guaranteed by the federal government , but the problem is , is that historically what they 've done is they get the loans and then they sell them on what 's called the secondary market .
They sell them to other parties who invest in these loans .
The problem is all these secondary markets have all frozen up right now , because everybody is so nervous about all these losses that have been happening on Wall Street .
So we just announced this week a program that will allow the Treasury Department to buy these loans directly from the community banks , so if you 've got $ 5 million worth of loans , SBA loans , already on the books , you can sell them to Treasury .
That will then mean that you 'll have $ 5 million that you can now put back to work providing loans without worrying about your capital -- your capital ratios .
So that 's -- so we 'll -- you should find out -- this is on our website , the White House website ; it will tell you about this program .
Now , you 're right , though -- we still have a problem that a lot of small businesses are seeing their credit lines restricted .
And part of that has to do with the issue you 're talking about , which is regulators may be saying to banks , look , we 're worried about all these losses , so pull back on what you consider riskier loans .
Well , if you 've got a credit line to a small business , and they 're seeing some of their business dry up right now , then you might be saying to yourself , maybe I can't continue that credit line .
We do n't have direct authority -- the White House does not have direct authority over these regulators .
These regulators are supposed to be somewhat independent from politics .
But , you know , we have had conversations to note that during a difficult period like this , we want to make sure that the bottom line is ultimately that liquidity and lending is going out the door .
And I think that we 're going to be having broader conversations with the community banks to figure out how can we take even further steps to help them be in a position to help the small businesses and individuals who depend so much on banks like yours .
Okay ?
All right , this young man right here , this young man right here .
He 's been -- okay .
( Laughter . )
See , I 'll admit that part of the reason -- ( laughter ) -- I should -- I 'm getting old and it's hard to see back there .
( Laughter . )
Go ahead .
Q I 'd like to ask you what are you planning to do on immigration , the broken system that we have ?
And when do you plan on doing this ?
( Applause . )
THE PRESIDENT : I just met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus today , which Congresswoman Sanchez is a member of -- ( applause ) -- to talk about this issue directly .
As many of you know , during the campaign I was asked repeatedly about this , and I reiterated my belief that we have to have comprehensive immigration reform .
Now , I know this is an emotional issue , I know it 's a controversial issue , I know that the people get real riled up politically about this , but -- but ultimately , here 's what I believe :
We are a nation of immigrants , number one .
Number two , we do have to have control of our borders .
Number three , that people who have been here for a long time and put down roots here have to have some mechanism over time to get out of the shadows , because if they stay in the shadows , in the underground economy , then they are oftentimes pitted against American workers .
Since they can't join a union , they can't complain about minimum wages , et cetera , they end up being abused , and that depresses the wages of everybody , all Americans .
( Applause . )
So I do n't think that we can do this piecemeal .
I think what we have to do is to come together and say , we 're going to strengthen our borders -- and I 'm going to be going to Mexico , I 'm going to be working with President Calderón in Mexico to figure out how do we get control over the border that 's become more violent because of the drug trade .
We have to combine that with cracking down on employers who are exploiting undocumented workers .
( Applause . )
We have to make sure that there 's a verification system to find out whether somebody is legally able to work here or not .
But we have to make sure that that verification system does not discriminate just because you 've got a Hispanic last name or your last name is Obama .
( Laughter . )
You 've got to -- and then you 've got to say to the undocumented workers , you have to say , look , you 've broken the law ; you did n't come here the way you were supposed to .
So this is not going to be a free ride .
It 's not going to be some instant amnesty .
What 's going to happen is you are going to pay a significant fine .
You are going to learn English .
( Applause . )
You are going to -- you are going to go to the back of the line so that you do n't get ahead of somebody who was in Mexico City applying legally .
( Applause . )
But after you 've done these things over a certain period of time you can earn your citizenship , so that it 's not -- it 's not something that is guaranteed or automatic .
You 've got to earn it .
But over time you give people an opportunity .
Now , it only works though if you do all the pieces .
I think the American people , they appreciate and believe in immigration .
But they can't have a situation where you just have half a million people pouring over the border without any kind of mechanism to control it .
So we 've got to deal with that at the same time as we deal in a humane fashion with folks who are putting down roots here , have become our neighbors , have become our friends , they may have children who are U.S. citizens .
( Applause . )
That 's the kind of comprehensive approach that we have to take .
All right .
Okay .
( Applause . )
All right , I promised to go back there .
I promised to go back there , but I can't see anybody , so -- but it 's a girl 's turn , it 's a lady 's turn .
There 's a whole bunch of folks just kind of waving .
One young woman from the back , just go ahead -- somebody with a mic go find somebody .
There you go .
Q Thank you .
Hi. I 'm a teacher in Santa Ana .
( Applause . )
Thank you .
And I got my RIF notice on Saturday and --
THE PRESIDENT : I 'm sorry , you got what notice ?
Q My RIF notice , which is I 'm going to be -- the intention to be laid off .
THE PRESIDENT : A pink slip ?
Q Yes , a pink slip .
That 's why it went pink .
My question is -- oh , I 'm so nervous , okay .
Thank you for coming .
THE PRESIDENT : You 're doing great .
Q I just love you .
Okay .
Our class sizes are between 36 and 44 .
This is normal .
I 've been in the district for over 25 years .
I have seen what our kids can do when someone cares .
The Teacher of the Year also received a pink slip .
We 're talking about quality teachers being laid off because of something -- I do n't know what .
Tomorrow we have a meeting .
My real question is , you have put money towards retention .
How are we going to make sure that money comes to our districts that need it the most , the urban districts ?
( Applause . )
THE PRESIDENT : Well , look , most of -- almost all of the money -- almost all of the money that 's going to states under the Recovery Act for education is designed to retain teachers .
Almost -- the lion 's share of it .
I mean , there 's some money for school construction as well , and there 's some money for innovation because we can't just put more money into the schools without also reforming the schools and making them better .
But a huge -- right now the biggest chunk is for teacher retention .
It generally flows in the same way the Title I monies flow , so that there should be a formula that the states are working with in terms of how it 's allocated to various districts .
I do n't know the exact figures here in California or what would happen in terms of this school district .
Your school superintendent is here , though -- there he is right here --
AUDIENCE : Boo !
THE PRESIDENT : Wait , wait , wait , wait .
Hold on a second .
Hold on .
Hey , hold on a second .
It 's not his fault that the state has run out of money .
So he is going to -- he is -- he was in a meeting with Arne Duncan , our Secretary of Education , and I stopped by in the meeting -- and these were the school superintendents for all -- all across the country , to come together and work on how do we both deal with the immediate short - term crisis , but also how do we think about long - term reforms ?
You 're right that class size is something that we 've got to deal with .
You can't have a 5th grade class with 40 kids .
There 's no teacher who can deal with 40 kids all at the same time , especially if many of them are at different levels in terms of reading and math skills and so forth .
So we 've got to do something about that .
But what 's also true , though , is we 've got to provide better teacher training .
There are teachers who may not know their subject matter as well as they should .
They 've got to be given more time to -- for professional development .
We 've got to have more flexibility , I believe , in terms of how we reward teachers .
I think that it is important for us to make sure that we have assessments that everybody can agree -- because ultimately we 've got to know that our kids are meeting high standards .
Now , it ca n't just be a single high - stakes standardized test -- but we do need to have strong , powerful measures of performance , because schools are like anything else .
We can't afford our kids to be mediocre at a time when they 're competing against kids in China and kids in India who are actually in school about a month longer than our kids .
So there 's a whole bunch of reforms that we 're going to have to do .
And the last point that I always make -- so I 'll make this again -- is we 've got to do our jobs as parents .
You can't put all the burden on a teacher .
( Applause . )
You can't put all the burden on a teacher .
If you 're not making sure your child does their homework , if you 're not reading to them , instilling a sense of excellence and a thirst for knowledge in them , then they 're not going to do very well , no matter how good your teacher is .
Okay , so that 's very important .
One last point I want to make about education :
This budget that we are now arguing about -- and you 're going to be hearing a bunch of arguments about , oh , you know , Obama , he 's a spendthrift , et cetera , et cetera , -- we reduce non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of gross domestic product , but what we insist on is that we make some investments in education .
And I have n't -- and one of the things that we have n't talked about is higher education .
I 've said we 've got to increase student loans , student grants , the Pell Grant program .
That 's got to be a priority .
( Applause . )
That 's our future , and I 'm going to fight for it .
I do n't care how long it takes , we 're going to make it more affordable to go to college , because that 's what everybody needs .
( Applause . )
All right , we need a gentleman .
Gentleman in the tie right here .
Since he wore a tie today , I appreciate that .
( Laughter . )
Q It 's awful hot .
THE PRESIDENT : It 's hot .
I want to take mine off , too , but I --
Q I'm President of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California , the umbrella organization for construction unions .
I would like to thank you for your leadership on the stimulus package , and particularly for trying to get construction workers back to work .
But during the last eight years , the administration chose not to enforce the Davis - Bacon requirements , chose not to enforce wage and hour conditions , and many thousands of workers were denied the wages that they were legally entitled to .
What can your administration do to make sure that people get the wages that they 're entitled to in this terrible economic downturn ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , look , I have already said that we are going to promote Davis - Bacon .
We think it is important that unions have the opportunity to organize themselves .
( Applause . )
Now , you know , sometimes , you know , the business press says , oh , that 's anti-business .
And whenever I hear that I 'm always reminded of what Henry Ford said when he first started building the Model T -- and he was paying his workers really well .
And somebody asked him , they said , why are you paying your workers so well ?
He said , well , if I do n't pay them well , they wo n't be able to buy a car .
Think about that .
Part of the problem that we 've had with our economy over the last decade at least is that -- well , there are a number of problems .
Number one , it turns out that a huge amount of the growth that was claimed was in the financial services industry .
And now we find out that a bunch of that stuff was just a paper growth that was n't real and vanished as soon as somebody pulled the curtain .
Another part of the problem with our economy and the way it was growing was that wages and incomes for ordinary working families were flat for the entire decade .
Now , I do n't need to tell you this because you 've experienced it in your own lives .
You 're -- just barely kept up with inflation while people at the very top -- and look , I 'll be honest with you , because I 'm now in that category -- we were seeing all the benefits .
So when I say that we should make it easier for unions to organize and observe Davis - Bacon , all I 'm trying to do is to restore some balance to our economy so that middle - class families who are working hard -- ( applause ) -- they 're not on welfare , they 're going to their jobs every day , they 're doing the right thing by their kids -- they should be able to save , buy a home , go on a vacation once in a while .
You know , they should be able to save for retirement , send their kids to college .
That 's not too much to ask for ; that 's the American Dream .
And the only way we get there is if we have bottom - up economic growth instead of top - down economic growth .
( Applause . )
And that 's why -- that 's why the debate about this budget is so important .
Let 's talk tax policy for a second , because , again , some on the other side have said , oh , Obama , he 's a tax - and - spend Democrat -- tax and spend .
Well , it turns out , yes .
You know , what I 've said is we should return to the tax rates that we had under Bill Clinton , which means -- which means this : which means that for people who are making more than $ 250,000 a year , they would pay instead of 36 percent , they 'd pay 39 percent .
Like , a 3 percent increase on their tax rate .
Now , these folks can afford it .
They were rich -- they were rich back in the '90s .
It 's not like suddenly they 're going to have to go to the poor house .
But what that does is it allows us to pay for health care reform for a lot of people who are out there working every day but are just one illness away from bankruptcy .
Now , that 's -- I do n't think that 's unreasonable .
I do n't think that 's socialism .
I think that 's part of understanding that we 're all in this together and that if the middle class is working well , if working people are doing well , then everybody does well .
( Applause . )
Then they can buy products and services , and businesses will succeed .
That 's the philosophy that we are pursuing in this budget ; that 's why I need your support .
( Applause . )
I 'm going to take two more questions , two more questions .
Back here , because everybody -- these folks have been in the lights , so they 're really hot .
So we got to -- we got to make sure that -- anybody got a mic back here ?
No ?
No mics over here ?
These folks can't just be props back here , just sitting here .
( Laughter . )
You got to give them a little love .
All right , it 's a lady 's turn .
And we have so many nice ladies here .
I feel -- eeny , meeny , miney -- I 'm going to call on this young lady in the green right here .
Go ahead , yes .
Q Good afternoon , Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT : Yes .
Q Thank you for taking my question .
It 's amazing .
THE PRESIDENT : Of course .
Q Since American taxpayers have had to bail out a lot of large banks -- Citibank , et cetera -- and they do n't feel they 've gotten any benefit for themselves , do you support caps on interest rates that the same companies we have bailed out with our money can charge regular consumers on credit cards ?
Because it 's up to 30 and 40 percent .
( Applause . )
THE PRESIDENT : It 's a great question .
It 's a great question .
It 's a great question .
This was a really good question .
First of all -- first of all , I generally support a credit card bill of rights , even -- setting aside the whole issue of TARP and who 's been getting TARP and who has n't been getting TARP .
The truth of the matter is that the banking industry has used credit cards and pushed credit cards on consumers in ways that have been very damaging .
There 's a woman named Elizabeth Warren who 's a professor at Harvard who did a great deal of study around this .
And she made a simple point .
You know , if you bought a toaster , and the toaster blew up in your face , there would be a law , a consumer safety law , that would protect you from buying that toaster .
But if you get a credit card that blows up in your face , that starts off at zero - percent interest , and once they kind of suck in the -- buying a bunch of stuff and suddenly it 's 29 percent ; and if you 're late two days , suddenly , you know , you just paid another $ 30 , and all kinds of fine print that a lot of folks did n't understand -- well , somehow that 's okay .
So just putting aside the issue of TARP , I think generally having some consumer safety , some consumer protection around credit cards , is important .
Now , all of us -- I think a lot of people have learned their lesson with credit cards .
And credit cards can be an important convenience .
But generally speaking , if you 're just running up your credit card and you do n't think that there 's a bill to be paid , you 've got problems .
So all of us , I think , have to be more thoughtful about how we use them , and ultimately we 've got to take responsibility if we are going on shopping sprees that we can't afford .
On the other hand , it 's also important that we have consumer safety laws , and that 's something that I want to promote and get done as President of the United States .
Now , let me talk about the larger issue of banks just for a second .
Because a lot of people , I know , just are so frustrated -- and I am so frustrated with this banking situation , I just want to just briefly explain to you sort of what 's happened .
These banks purchased a lot of what are securitized mortgage instruments .
They took a lot of these subprime loans and they bundled them up , so they were n't just holding a mortgage , they were holding a whole bundle of mortgages that were made into a security , a stock .
And they were sliced up , and so you could buy different pieces of these mortgages .
And unfortunately what ended up happening was a bunch of these mortgages -- and this was certainly true in California , it was true all across the country -- a bunch of these mortgages were based on people who never had the income to buy the house , nobody tried to verify whether or not they could actually afford it .
It was based on these complicated mathematical formulas .
And then what happened -- and this is where AIG and some other companies come in -- what happened was since the banks knew that there might be some risk around having these financial instruments , they bought these things called credit default swaps that were supposed to be guarantees or insurance on these instruments -- on these securities , these mortgage - backed securities .
The problem was , companies like AIG , they 'd sell , like , 50 policies without having the money to cover the possibility that they would all go belly - up .
So they were way over - leveraged , overextended , just as the banks were way over - leveraged and overextended .
And in some cases they'd take a dollar worth of assets and they 'd loan or use $ 30 off that one dollar just to make bigger and bigger bets and take bigger and bigger risks out in the financial system .
And these started getting into trillions of dollars .
And as long as nobody was checking to see if anybody was going to be able to pay back these mortgages , and as long as housing prices were appreciating and this housing bubble was continuing , everybody was making a lot of money .
So nobody wanted to check and there was no serious regulation to say , hold on , stop a minute , you guys are getting way overextended ; you 're putting the entire financial system at risk .
So when the economy started slowing down , and in some markets like Miami and here in California , the housing market starts really weakening , and suddenly some of these subprime loans start defaulting , this whole house of cards just began to collapse .
Now , a lot of people say , well , why not just let the banks fail ?
Right ?
See , somebody is clapping .
Why not just , you know -- they were making all these bad bets ; why do n't we just let them fail , let them go bankrupt ?
What 's the problem ?
Well , here 's the problem .
If you 've just got one small bank -- I mean , unfortunately -- let 's take the community bank -- what 's the name of your community bank ?
Fullerton Community Bank .
All right , now , let 's just say this .
If Fullerton Community Bank fails , heaven forbid , we 've got something called the FDIC , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , that would take it over , it would guarantee all the deposits so you do n't have to worry about your deposits ; they 're not at risk .
And it would be able to kind of sort things out and then resell the bank fairly quickly , and it does n't threaten the whole system as a whole .
When you 've got big banks , Citicorp or Bank of America or , you know , Wells Fargo , that controls 70 percent of the banking system , and all of them are weakening , you can't afford to have all those banks all at once start going under .
Even though the deposits might be guaranteed , you 've got the entire economy resting on that credit .
We 've got to get that credit lending , because they can take down businesses large and small alike if we do n't make sure that they are still providing loans .
And so we had to step in .
And it was the right thing to do -- even though it 's infuriating , even though it makes you angry , because you 're thinking , I was responsible , and these folks are irresponsible , and somehow I 'm paying for them -- it was the right thing to do to step in .
The same is true with AIG .
It was the right thing to do to step in .
Here 's the problem .
It 's almost like they 've got -- they got a bomb strapped to them and they 've got their hand on the trigger .
You do n't want them to blow up , but you got to kind of talk them -- ease that finger off the trigger .
We 've got to , over the next several months , come up with a plan that separates out the bad assets , the loans that should n't have been made , these credit default swaps , et cetera .
We got to separate out some of those from the good assets , because there are a lot of very healthy banks , the vast majority of banks are healthy .
We 've got to figure out how to raise their capital -- the point that you were making earlier so that they can start lending again .
This is a very complicated , difficult task .
It 's not easy .
We 're talking about a huge system that 's not just national , but international .
And so we 're not going to unwind this all in a day , but what I do have confidence in is that with the plans that we 're putting forward , slowly you 're starting to see the system stabilize , you 're starting to see more loan activity taking place , some of the security markets are coming back .
And if we continue to provide some guarantees and help depositors and help strengthen some of the banks that are weakened , then my expectation is , is that we 're going to be able to work our way out of this problem , and we are going to be able to get back to a point where banks are lending , businesses are investing , jobs are being created , and the economy gets back on its feet .
And when that happens , we should get a bunch of the money that has been lent to these banks back .
Now , we 're not going to get all of it .
I just -- you know , we 're not going to get 100 percent of it back in some cases .
In some cases we may get 100 percent back ; in some cases we might even make a profit .
I do n't want to pretend that this is going to be cheap .
But the point is that instead of looking backwards , the main thing we 've got to do is look forwards and say , how do we make sure that we get out of this mess , but also prevent this mess from ever happening again .
And that requires the kind of financial regulation that 's going to be so important for our long - term future .
( Applause . )
All right , I 've got -- it 's a guy 's turn .
It 's a man 's -- it 's a man 's turn , and he 's got the last -- this gentleman , because he 's big and I do n't want him to be mad at me .
Q Good afternoon , Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT : Good afternoon .
Q Thank you for taking the time to listen to me .
Last October I lost my job after 13 years .
I was laid off .
Now when I look for a job , people tell me that I have a felony from 20 years ago -- I can't get no work .
I have a family to support .
What do I do ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , first of all , I know how hard it is for you right now being out of work -- because I can tell you 've got pride , you 've been working , you 've been supporting your family .
And one of the things that 's been happening in this most recent recession is men have actually been losing jobs faster than women .
And that is a very difficult thing .
I mean , I know that I take great pride in , you know , taking care of my family .
And it 's hard when you lose your job .
The fact that you 've been working steadily for 13 years post - felony seems to me a message that you made amends for your past mistakes and that you are rehabilitated and that you 've proven yourself in the job market .
( Applause . )
So in that sense -- in that sense I think you 're actually better off than a lot of folks who make mistakes and then never get that first job that allows them to rehabilitate themselves .
They 've got no employment history , they 're just an ex-felon .
They go in and nobody gives them the time of day , and oftentimes they end up getting back into trouble .
Now , we 're trying to set up some programs to help ex-felons make that transition .
But frankly , based on what you 're telling me , your problem is a problem that has nothing -- or less to do with your felony than the fact that the job market is really tough right now .
And that 's why all I can tell you is we are working as hard as we can to invest in construction and infrastructure ; to invest in things like clean energy , building solar panels and wind panels -- ( applause ) -- wind turbines and other things that point to a new manufacturing base and a new energy future .
We 're trying to create the jobs of the future and we 're trying to get this economy moving again -- fix the banking system so that you start seeing more economic activity .
I have confidence that you will find a job .
I have confidence in you .
( Applause . )
But in the meantime -- in the meantime the most that I can do is to make sure that you 've got unemployment insurance that you can rely on , that you 've got COBRA that you can rely on , that your family is able to get some support during these difficult times , and then to try to get these jobs created as quickly as possible .
What kind of work did you do ?
Q ( Inaudible . )
THE PRESIDENT : You worked in what ?
Q I worked in the auto industry for Toyota .
THE PRESIDENT : In the auto industry .
Well , let 's talk about the auto industry for a second .
Now , first of all , you worked for Toyota , which is obviously one of the best companies , and so you -- when Toyota is having problems and laying off , that tells you how tough the problems are in the auto industry right now .
We are going to have to work to move in the direction of fuel - efficient cars and trucks .
I would have expected you to say that you were working for an American car company , because they 're having much bigger problems .
But whether it 's Toyota or GM or Chrysler or Ford or any company right now , the future is going to be in fuel - efficient cars .
It 's going to be in these plug - in hybrids .
( Applause . )
It 's going to be in developing the battery technology that allows electric cars to run for 150 miles for every gallon of gas .
And what we need to do is to invest in research and development around this clean - energy auto technology .
And one of the things that we 've committed to doing in our budget is to spend $ 15 billion every single year in new technologies that maintain cutting - edge auto technologies that will ensure that good , efficient , clean cars are made right here in the United States of America .
And hopefully we 're going to put you back to work in the process .
Q Thank you .
THE PRESIDENT : So all right , everybody .
Thank you .

これは、電子回路で芸術を行うことを志して製作した作品です。
数千個のL,C,R等の受動部品を空中配線で縦横無尽に組み合わせ、立体的な回路を作りました。ピカピカと鮮やかな光を放ち、うろうろとランダムウォークします。障害物に当たると（ある特定の回路がショートして）それを検知し、後退・旋回をして、方向転換します。使った能動部品はトランジスタのみで、ICは使っていません。大きさは一片が約15cmの立方体です。こういう構造のものは全体の78％が破壊されてもその機能を維持できると言われています。
