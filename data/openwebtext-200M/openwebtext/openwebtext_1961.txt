CyberNet Exclusive Look
We ’ve decided to break away from our normal CyberNotes today to take an exclusive look at the features in Opera 9.5 ( codename Kestrel ) .
Opera has done a remarkable job of keeping the specs and features of Opera 9.5 under wraps .
The Opera Desktop
Team wrote a post last week that detailed some of the under - the - hood work that has been going on in 9.5 , but as expected , they steered clear of mentioning the most notable features .
After all , they want to save the excitement for the big Alpha release tomorrow !
Luckily I was able to test drive Opera 9.5 a little bit early , and it ’s only fair that I share my findings with you ( and we have Opera ’s permission of course ) .
I ’ve put together a 5 - minute video review that details four of what I believe to be Kestrel ’s most notable features .
So you can start out by watching the video , or you can read through the article as I cover each feature there as well .
– Video Introduction –
I thought it would be best if I start with a video of Opera 9.5 ’s new features .
All of these are covered in detail below , but this will give you a really good idea of what you can expect tomorrow when Opera 9.5 Alpha is released .
– Rendering Engine–
It ’s been over a year since Opera ’s rendering engine has seen any significant improvements , and this time around there are some significant improvements .
Kestrel is now running the same rendering engine that powers the Wii Internet Channel browser as well as Opera Mini 4 Beta , and there are some astonishing differences … probably due to the thousands of bugs they ’ve fixed .
I ’ve been told to expect to see the rendering speed get better as further builds get released , but I have a hard time believing that they can get better than what I ’ve seen .
I decided to do a rather unofficial speed test to see how fast the different browsers rank in terms of loading our site ( with an empty cache ) .
I did three tests for each browser and averaged out the time it took for each to completely load our site .
Here are the results with the slowest browsers first :
Internet Explorer 7 : 18 seconds
Firefox 2 : 15 seconds
Opera 9.23 : 12 seconds
Firefox 3 Nightly : 11 seconds
Opera 9.5 Alpha : 8 seconds
Aside from speed improvements , the site compatibility has also gotten much better .
They ’ve fixed problems with various Google sites , some issues with the default WordPress template , and corrected a few things with some of the JavaScript libraries .
Opera 9.5 can now handle many more sites … with ease !
Here are some of the other updates in Kestrel related to the rendering engine :
A lot more CSS3 support , including complete Selectors
Support for JavaScript 1.5 Getters and Setters
AJAX compatibility has been improved
New JavaScript engine that is faster and more efficient
Improved HTML table layout algorithm
– Open With … ( in the video ) —
Despite all of the hurdles Opera has overcome with their new rendering engine , there are still some sites that probably wo n’t work as they should .
Opera is n’t going to deny that it happens , and they are actually going to do what they can to help the situation .
You can now right - click on any site and choose to open it in another browser that is installed on your computer !
I ’ve also been told that the “ open with ” command will work with some files as well , but complete support has n’t been added yet .
I would like to see this feature extended to things like images so that I can right - click on an image and have it open in Paint .
NET without needing to save it first .
– Restore Windows ( in the video ) —
Opera has a little trash can on the Tab Bar that is normally used to restore tabs you ’ve recently closed ( which can also be done with Ctrl+ Z ) .
Kestrel has introduced a new feature that will let you restore entire windows that you have closed , which includes all of the tabs contained within that window .
I do n’t open multiple windows very often , but I know this feature will come in handy .
– Sync Bookmarks ( in the video ) —
This is one of those things that I had said Opera needs to work on the most .
By this point , most Firefox users have grown accustomed to keeping their bookmarks synchronized with an online service .
Now Opera users will have the same pleasure !
All you need is a free My Opera account , and you ’ll be able to privately synchronize your bookmarks , Speed Dial sites , and Personal Bar with their server .
You ’ll then be able to access that data whether you ’re at work , home , or anywhere !
To setup synchronization just select the “ Synchronize with My Opera ” option from the File Menu .
– Full History Search ( in the video ) —
The search capabilities in Opera 9.23 vs. Opera 9.5 are like night and day .
They have now introduced full history search that looks back over all of the pages you ’ve visited .
I ’m not talking about just scanning the URL and title of the page either …it looks at all the text contained within each site !
There are two ways that you can take advantage of this feature , and the most common one will be straight from the address bar .
As you can see in the screenshot above , I was typing in “ thumb ” into the address bar , and the resulting page that was returned is our homepage .
That ’s because I had recently visited CyberNet where “ Thumbnails ” was one of the words used , but it was n’t in the title or the URL , it was just in the body of the article .
If you ’re looking for a more detailed way to search your entire history , just type opera: historysearch into the address bar .
The result will be a Google - like search page where you can type the keyword (s ) that you are looking for .
It will then return the results that matched just like in this screenshot :
– What You Do n’t See–
It ’s very obvious that there has been a lot of under - the - hood work in Opera 9.5 , and you ’ll be able to see that as soon as you start using it .
There has particularly been a lot of fixing up for the built - in Mail Client .
Now it has a new indexing and storage backend that does n’t use as much memory and runs faster .
IMAP also works much better , and the browser is n’t supposed to freeze anymore when checking for new mail or feeds .
Of course Opera still starts almost instantaneously , which is one of its best qualities .
And memory usage has ( somehow ) gotten better .
I ’ve never seen Opera 9.2 climb over the 250MB marker , and that was when I would have 50 to 100 tabs open at the same time ( hey , I go through a lot of news in a days time ) .
Now it seems to run at about 80 % of the memory usage that it used to , and for most people it will hover between 25MB and 70MB .
– And There ’s More ! –
I ’ve covered most of the big stuff above , but that ’s not everything !
Here ’s a list of some other things that have been improved in Opera 9.5 :
The Status Bar is enabled by default …yay !
The “ Save your password ” dialog box does not stop the page from loading behind it .
That way you can verify that the username and password you entered works before actually saving it .
What a great feature !
Content blocking is better
A “ drag to scroll ” feature has been added that will let you scroll by “ grabbing ” the page , much like in a PDF reader .
You can enable it by typing opera:config#UserPrefs|ScrollIsPan into the address bar .
into the address bar .
It supposedly looks better on a Mac , and conforms to the Apple Human
Interface Guidelines .
Unfortunately I do n’t have a Mac to try that out on .
– Making it Better–
There are some things that I believe Opera can do to make the final product even better , but one of the most important is inline spell checking .
This is often the first complaint I hear from existing Firefox users who try Opera , and I think it is an extremely useful feature .
– Overview –
There ’s no doubt in my mind that Opera 9.5 is going to be a truly amazing browser once it is released , and it will likely raise the bar for other browsers .
However , the build being released tomorrow is an Alpha , and it will have issues at first .
There might be sites that do n’t work properly with it , and if you decide to try this out , make sure to install it in a separate location from your stable Opera installation .

How to hide beer in office ?
by Dhiram Shah
Whats better than a refrigerator mod to get some beers in the office .
No beer still , check after the jump .

Sen. Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) stunned Senate colleagues with his decision to reconsider .
Craig reversal angers GOP colleagues
Just when Republicans thought things could not get much worse for their scandal - stained party , Idaho Sen .
Larry Craig leaked word Tuesday night that he is reconsidering his abrupt plan to resign from the Senate in the wake of his arrest in a police sex sting operation .
Top Republican strategists were neither delighted nor amused by the senator 's decision to rethink retirement after pleading guilty to disorderly conduct following his arrest in a Minnesota airport men's bathroom .

GOP Senate sources said Tuesday night that Craig 's staff was trying to tamp down the story because Craig still intends to resign but wants to retain the option of fighting the charges with a newly assembled , high - powered legal team .
On Saturday , Craig said he would resign at the end of this month .
A senior GOP Senate strategist said Republican leaders want him gone now and will press for him to keep his promise to resign .
The strategist warned Craig is " losing any goodwill built up among his colleagues , " adding , " He is simply a fish out of water , floundering right now to get his last gasp of political air . "
" It simply defies reality , " said a Senate GOP aide .
" You can't make this up even if you are heavily medicated .
The American people heard from Larry Craig that he would resign , and using the word ' intent ' as a back door does n't work with them . "
But Tuesday night , spokesman Dan Whiting said Craig might not resign if he is cleared of the charges before Sept. 30 .
Legal experts said it is doubtful Craig will be cleared because he pleaded guilty to the charge .
The unexpected announcement caught fellow GOP senators – and members of Craig 's own crisis management team – mostly by surprise and threatened to draw negative attention to the party at a time when it is preparing for big fights over the budget and the Iraq war .
" I think the episode is over , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) said during a press conference earlier in the day .
" We will have a new senator from Idaho at some point in the next month or so , and we are going to move on . "
McConnell was n't the only one left in the dark about Craig 's apparent new strategy .
Craig has hired a team of lawyers and crisis experts to push ahead with a strategy aimed at repairing the three - term senator 's reputation .
Washington attorney Stanley Brand said Tuesday that the Senate Ethics Committee would receive a letter arguing that it should drop any plans to pursue an investigation into Craig 's arrest in a men's room at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
" I do n't think the Senate ought to be policing misdemeanor offenses that do n't have anything to do with their office , " Brand said .
" They would be very busy . "
Senate Republican leaders called for an ethics investigation last Tuesday into Craig 's June 11 arrest and Aug. 8 guilty plea .
But Craig has since announced his resignation , making a probe moot , Brand said .
" I am taking it as part of the good - faith exchange of his having resigned and sparing everybody the difficult questions I am raising , " Brand said .
But now the resignation might be moot , too .
The GOP Senate strategist said senators are frustrated they will now spend another day or more deflecting questions about Craig and his bathroom behavior .
McConnell got a taste of what 's to come at a press conference he held Tuesday .
Why , he was asked , did the GOP leadership seek an ethics investigation of Craig while giving a pass to Sen.
David Vitter ( R - La. ) after he acknowledged in July that his phone number was among those on the
client list of an alleged prostitution ring ?
" No charges have been made , " McConnell said of Vitter .
" And it appears whatever might have occurred , occurred before this individual came to the Senate , therefore raising serious questions as to whether the Senate has jurisdiction over it .
" The situation last week was , there was something admitted to ; the legal case was , in effect , over , " McConnell continued .
" The only question was what the attitude was going to be in the Senate regarding
the admission that was made .
It is clearly distinguishable . "
McConnell was pressed again :
Were the responses different because the Craig incident involved alleged homosexual activity ?
" This had to do with the admission of responsibility as opposed to charges or suggestions , " McConnell said .
He rejected suggestions that the Craig and Vitter incidents , coupled with the FBI raid of the home of Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) in late July as part of a federal corruption probe , have contributed to Congress ' sub - basement approval ratings or soiled the Republican Party brand .
" The overwhelming majority of members of Congress , both Republican and Democrat , are honorable people , " McConnell said .
But the honorable thing for Craig to do , the strategist said , is simply disappear .
The Klingon programmer
I found this text at http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/klingon.htm , in fact , that page contains even more humor .
Top 20 things likely to be overheard if you had a Klingon Programmer :
While the news focus has been on the lowest ice extent since satellite monitoring began in 1979 for the Arctic , the Southern Hemisphere ( Antarctica ) has quietly set a new record for most ice extent since 1979 .
This can be seen on this graphic from this University of Illinois site The Cryosphere Today , which updated snow and ice extent for both hemispheres daily .
The Southern Hemispheric areal coverage is the highest in the satellite record , just beating out 1995 , 2001 , 2005 and 2006 .
Since 1979 , the trend has been up for the total Antarctic ice extent .
While the Antarctic Peninsula area has warmed in recent years and ice near it diminished during the Southern Hemisphere summer , the interior of Antarctica has been colder and ice elsewhere has been more extensive and longer lasting , which explains the increase in total extent .
This dichotomy was shown in this World Climate Report blog posted recently with a similar tale told in this paper by Ohio State Researcher David Bromwich , who agreed “ It ’s hard to see a global warming signal from the mainland of Antarctica right now .
Indeed , according the NASA GISS data , the South Pole winter ( June / July / August ) has cooled about 1 degree F since 1957 and the coldest year was 2004 .
This winter has been an especially harsh one in the Southern Hemisphere with cold and snow records set in Australia , South America and Africa .
We will have recap on this hard winter shortly .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German scientist has come up with a solution for snoring -- a computerized pillow that shifts the head ’s sleeping position until the noise stops .
Daryoush Bazargani , professor of computer science at the University of Rostock and the pillow ’s inventor , was displaying a prototype of his pillow at a health conference in Germany on Wednesday .
“ The pillow is attached to a computer , which is the size of a book , rests on a bedside table , and analyses snoring noises , ” Bazargani told Reuters .
“ The computer then reduces or enlarges air compartments within the pillow to facilitate nasal airflow to minimize snoring as the user shifts during sleep , ” he said .
The ergonomic pillow can also be used for neck massages .
Bazargani said several U.S. firms were interested in manufacturing the pillow .
“ I invented it because I snore , ” he said .
“ I tried all sorts of products , but nothing worked .
I hope people who use it will sleep more peacefully . ”
KOULIKORO , Mali —
When Suleiman Diarra Banani ’s brother said that the poisonous black seeds dropping from the seemingly worthless weed that had grown around his family farm for decades could be used to run a generator , or even a car , Mr. Banani did not believe him .
When he suggested that they intersperse the plant , until now used as a natural fence between rows of their regular crops — edible millet , peanuts , corn and beans — he thought his older brother , Dadjo , was crazy .
“ I thought it was a plant for old ladies to make soap , ” he said .
But now that a plant called jatropha is being hailed by scientists and policy makers as a potentially ideal source of biofuel , a plant that can grow in marginal soil or beside food crops , that does not require a lot of fertilizer and yields many times as much biofuel per acre planted as corn and many other potential biofuels .
By planting a row of jatropha for every seven rows of regular crops , Mr. Banani could double his income on the field in the first year and lose none of his usual yield from his field .
Poor farmers living on a wide band of land on both sides of the equator are planting it on millions of acres , hoping to turn their rockiest , most unproductive fields into a biofuel boom .
They are spurred on by big oil companies like BP and the British biofuel giant D1 Oils , which are investing millions of dollars in jatropha cultivation .
Countries like India , China , the Philippines and Malaysia are starting huge plantations , betting that jatropha will help them to become more energy independent and even export biofuel .
It is too soon to say whether jatropha will be viable as a commercial biofuel , scientists say , and farmers in India are already expressing frustration that after being encouraged to plant huge swaths of the bush they have found no buyers for the seeds .
A sad news came from Hungary , a country which seemed to be a very secure place in terms of peer to peer networks and filesharing .
Hungarian police raided and confiscated over 100 servers , including scene top sites , private bittorrent trackers and warez forums .
Affected sites include the biggest and most popular hungarian tracker bitHumen ( 30 000 registered users ) , release site nCore ( which is already up though ) , trackers Bitlove , Independent , Moobs , Revolution and many other private FTP sites which had a connection with the scene .
The raid took place on November 9 between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. in Budapest , Hungary .
The sources write about 80 individuals from both police and special anti p2p organizations involved .
The confiscated servers were hosted by various internet server providers ( GTS - Datanet , Deninet , CFM , Giganet ) , so this was a highly organized and prepared raid .
BitHumen temporary site informs its members that there were no IP addresses stored at the server , so they do n’t have to worry about possible consequences from their membership .
The seizure of so many servers which were connected mostly by 100 Mbit lines caused an interesting effect in the Hungarian peering center ( BIX ) : the overall country traffic went from 60 Gbit/s to 35 - 40 Gbits after the raid .
This is another serious attack on the filesharers in last few days – the raid of British music tracker Oink was just a beginning , followed by Demonoid ’s downtime and now this issue .
It looks that noone is safe anymore …

「 セル内の改行を削除して、スペース区切りのデータに一括修正するには？」――そんな質問をよく耳にする。エクセルに詳しい人なら、「置換機能を使って『改行』を『スペース』に置換する」というテクニックを知っているかもしれない。実は、「検索と置換」の入力欄では、「Ctrl」キーを押しながら「J」キーを押すことで、検索や置換の対象として「改行」を指定できる。入力欄には何も表示されないが、これで「改行」を意味する
“ 何か ” が指定されるのだ 。
このテクニックは、日 経PC21でも何度か紹介している。しかしながら、エクセルのヘルプに、「 Ctrl」 ＋「J」に関する記述はない。それに、「 Ctrl」 ＋「J」を押したとき、入力欄に何も表示されないのは不親切だ。そもそも、検索や置換に「改行」が指定できるのなら、セル内で改行するときと同じ「 Alt」＋「Enter」で指定できるようにするのが本筋だろう。
とすれば、こ の 「 Ctrl 」 ＋ 「 J」というキー操作は、エクセルの “ 公式 ” な機能ではないのかもしれない。ではなぜ、「 Ctrl 」 ＋「 J 」 が 「改行」の指定に使えるのか。
キー操作で文書を操作する 「 制御コード」という仕組み
コンピューターが開発された当初、キーボードから入力した文字を画面に表示するために、いくつかの基本的なルールが定められた。例えば、10進数の「65」に相当するコードがあったら、画面に「A」という文字を表示する、といった決まりごとだ。いわゆる「文字コード」[注1]の仕組みで、これには、画面などを制御するための特別なコードも含まれていた。「09」というコードがあったら決まった文字数だけカーソルを移動する（タブ）、10」というコードがあったらカーソルを次行に移動する（改行）、という具合だ。画面を制御するための特別なコードは「制御コード」と呼ばれる。制御コードは、データとしては通常の文字と同様に扱われる。だが画面に表示されることはなく、所定の操作を行う。
[ 注1 ] 文字コー ド
「 ASCII 」 （American Standard Code for Information Interchange ）というコード体系が、英数字の標準の文字コードとして用いられている
昔のコンピューターでは、こうした制御コードを入力するとき、「Ctrl」キーを押しながら特定のキーを押すことになっていた[ 注2]。例えば「 Ctrl 」 ＋「 H」でバックスペース 、「 Ctrl 」 ＋ 「 I 」でタブに相当する制御コードが入力された。
[ 注2 ] 「 Ctrl」 キ ー
「 Ctrl」はそもそ も 「 Control 」 の略。画面などを 「制御（コントロール）する」というのが、キーの名前の由来だ
そして、 「改行」に相当する制御コードの入力に割り当てられたのが、「 Ctrl」 ＋「J」というキーだった。なぜ「J」かと言えば、「改行」を表す制御コードが、10進数の「10」に相当するコードだったため。アルファベットの「A」から順番に数えてみよう。ちょうど10番目の文字が、ほかでもない「J」なのである。
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Two U.S. soldiers have been charged with the premeditated murders of three Iraqis killed in three separate incidents between April and June of this year , according to a U.S. military statement .
In addition to the murder charges , the two enlisted men are accused of trying to cover up the crimes , committed in Iskandariya , about 25 miles south of Baghdad , by planting weapons next to the Iraqis ' bodies , the military said .
The soldiers are identified as Staff Sgt. Michael A. Hensley , of Candler , North Carolina , and Spc. Jorge G Sandoval , Jr. , of Laredo , Texas .
Hensley was charged with three counts of premeditated murder , three counts of obstruction of justice and three counts of " wrongfully placing a weapon " next to a body .
Hensley was arrested Thursday and taken to Kuwait to be held before the trial .
Sandoval faces one count of premeditated murder and one count of wrongfully placing a weapon next to a body .
He was arrested Tuesday at his home in Texas and was also taken to Kuwait , the military said .
Both are assigned to the U.S. Army 's 1st Battalion , 501 Infantry Regiment , 4th Brigade ( Airborne ) , 25th Infantry Division , based at Fort Richardson , Alaska .
The military statement said the investigation into the killings began when fellow soldiers reported wrongdoing to military authorities .
Also , U.S. - led coalition forces killed about 26 people they described as " secret cell terrorists " and captured another 17 during raids in Baghdad 's Sadr City Saturday morning , the U.S. military said -- an operation that brought an angry response from Iraq 's prime minister .
The U.S. military said the raids , conducted in the pre-dawn hours in the densely populated Shiite slum , targeted terrorists tied to " Iranian terror networks , " which the military said are responsible for helping the flow of lethal aid into Iraq .
An Iraqi Interior Ministry official said local officials reported just seven people killed and that all of them were civilians .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said the attacks were carried out without the proper approval .
" The government will demand an explanation from the multinational forces about what happened in Sadr City earlier today , " said al - Maliki , who deplored what he characterized as attacks on civilians under the guise of " fighting terrorists and militias . "
The government " absolutely rejects any military operation by the multinational forces all over the provinces and cities of Iraq without a previous permission or coordination with the commandership of the Iraqi forces , " he said .
He also said that the government also " prohibits any Iraqi special forces to comply or implement any military operations without the permission and approval of the Iraqi leadership in the military . "
Those who disobey such directives will face charges , he said .
In other raids on Saturday , coalition forces detained 16 people described as " suspected terrorists " during operations targeting al Qaeda in Iraq leaders in Nineveh and Anbar provinces , the U.S. military said .
The military also announced Saturday that an insurgent killed in fighting Friday near the Anbar province city of Falluja has been identified as a high - level al Qaeda leader .
An Egyptian , who is believed to have fought for al Qaeda in Afghanistan five years ago before moving into Iraq , was killed during fighting east of Falluja Friday , the military said .
The military said the man worked directly for the military emir of al Qaeda in Iraq , and is associated with other al Qaeda in Iraq senior leaders .
One U.S. soldier was killed and three others were wounded in Baghdad on Friday by a powerful homemade bomb , the military said in a statement on Saturday , bringing the June toll to 100 .
The period of April through June , which corresponds with the buildup of U.S. troops known as the " surge , " has been the deadliest three - month stretch for U.S. troops since the Iraqi war began , with 104 American troops killed in April and 126 killed in May .
Since the war began in 2003 , 3570 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq .
Seven civilian employees of the Defense Department have also been killed .
Also on Saturday :
At least 15 civilians and police recruits were killed in Muqdadiya , Iraq , on Saturday when a suicide bomber detonated in the Diyala province town , the Iraqi Interior Ministry said .
Twelve people were wounded in the bombing that hit an outdoor market , near a police station .
A mass grave with 35 to 40 bodies in it was found on Friday south of the Anbar city of Falluja , the U.S. military said Saturday .
The remains were bound and had gunshot wounds , the military said .
The military also said that the report earlier this week of 20 men beheaded in Iraq 's Salman Pak area appears to be " completely false and fabricated by unknown sources . "
The area is southeast of Baghdad , in one of the so - called Baghdad belts where U.S. and Iraqi troops have launched operations against insurgents .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States on Thursday said it plans to reward Afghan provinces that combat the opium trade with more development aid in a new anti-drug strategy but analysts doubted it will make much difference anytime soon .

U.S. officials unveiled the plan as part of a new carrot - and - stick approach of giving greater financial incentives to provincial governors to fight the opium trade while stepping up efforts to eradicate poppy crops and stem the flow of drugs .
They said they plan to spend $ 25 million to $ 50 million to reward provinces that make significant progress against drugs , up from about $ 21 million budgeted in the current fiscal year and $ 6 million the previous year .
They also plan to better coordinate counter - narcotics and counter - insurgency work in Afghanistan , which is the source of about 90 percent of the world ’s opium and is grappling with a revived Taliban insurgency .
“ We want to make sure there are greater rewards for success and greater consequences for failure , ” Ambassador Thomas Schweich , the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement , told reporters .
U.S. officials said the insurgency and the opium trade are increasingly intertwined in the country , which in the past 18 months has seen its bloodiest fighting since U.S. - led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban movement in 2001 .
While praising elements of the new counter - narcotics plan , analysts said the magnitude of the drug problem in Afghanistan and the depth of corruption made it unlikely that it would make much headway .
‘ TOO UNSTABLE , TOO POOR ’
“ There are some positive ideas ... which may help to boost the effort but it ’s very hard for me to see in the near term that these are efforts are going to make a serious dent , ” said Alex Thier of the United States Institute of Peace think tank .
“ It probably plays out very badly and that ’s simply because Afghanistan is too unstable , too poor and its officials are too corrupt , ” analyst Anthony Cordesman of the CSIS think tank in Washington said of the overall approach .
The $ 25 million to $ 50 million for economic development in provinces that tamp down the drug trade is only a part of the substantial U.S. budget for counternarcotics in Afghanistan .
According to figures provided by the State Department , Congress initially set aside $ 449.9 million for Afghanistan counter - narcotics work in the current fiscal year , which ends on September 30 , and then approved another $ 388.2 million .
U.S. officials also plan to provide more troops to accompany Afghan forces that eradicate poppy crops and go after drug traffickers .
They also will have a stepped - up public education campaign about the evils of growing poppy .
In a joint statement , the top Democrat and Republican on the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomed the new emphasis on financial incentives but said the strategy needed to do more to go after major traffickers .
“ What the plan lacks is the recognition that Afghanistan is approaching a crisis point , and that immediate action is required to eliminate the threat of drug kingpins and cartels allied with terrorists so we can reverse the country ’s steady slide into a potential failed narco - state , ” Committee Chairman Rep .
Tom Lantos , a California Democrat , and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , a Florida Republican , said in the statement .
Executive vice president and general manager of Electronic Arts International Gerhard Florin has made a call for a single open gaming platform , complaining that competing brands of consoles currently create unnecessary difficulties for developers and consumers .
"
We want an open , standard platform which is much easier than having five which are not compatible , " said Florin in an online BBC article .
" We 're platform - agnostic and we definitely do n't want to have one platform which is a walled garden .
" Florin suggested that Web - based games and set - top boxes would continue to grow in importance for the industry , but that the continued use of dedicated consoles could last " up to 15 years " .
Predicting the future ubiquity of set - top boxes in particular , Florin suggested that , in the future , " You do n't need an Xbox 360 , PS3 or Wii - the consumer wo n't even realize the platform it is being played on . "
Officials at the Bank of America confirmed it is notifying 60,000 of its customers following theft of personal account information and social security numbers by a criminal gang .
48,000 account holders at Wachovia have also been told their details have been breached .
" We are trying to communicate with our customers as promptly as possible , " said Bank of America spokeswoman Alex Liftman to AP .
" So far , we have no evidence that any of our customer information has been used for account fraud or identity theft . "
New Jersey Police said it was currently in the first stages of an investigation that uncovered the data theft from nearly 700,000 account holders .
It is alleged account information was illegally sold by bank employees to a man identified as Orazio Lembo , whom police said was illegally posing as a collection agency .
Account details and balances on 670,000 accounts were found on 13 computers seized from Lembo by police earlier this week .
He has been charged with multiple counts of illegally disclosing data from a database and one count of racketeering .
If convicted he could spend up to 130 years in jail .
Other banks which had data stolen from them were Commerce Bancorp , and PNC Financial Services Group .
Several former employees of these companies have been arrested in connection with the heist along with former employees at Bank of America and Wachovia .
These employees are alleged to have received $ 10 for each account matched with a social security number .
Lembo would then sell this data onto collection agencies for $ 150 .
Police said the scam had been in operation for four years .
Hackensack Police Chief Charles Zisa , who is leading the investigation , said the second phase of investigation would target more than 40 companies that solicited this account information .
Police believe the final figure of breached accounts could top the one million mark .
In February , Bank of America said computer tapes containing U.S. federal government customer information were lost during a shipment to a backup data center .

A team led by the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Milan has discovered some unexpected forms of liquid crystals of ultrashort DNA molecules immersed in water , providing a new scenario for a key step in the emergence of life on Earth .
CU - Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark said the team found that surprisingly short segments of DNA , life 's molecular carrier of genetic information , could assemble into several distinct liquid crystal phases that " self - orient " parallel to one another and stack into columns when placed in a water solution .
Life is widely believed to have emerged as segments of DNA - or RNA - like molecules in a prebiotic " soup " solution of ancient organic molecules .
A paper on the subject was published in the Nov. 23 issue of Science .
The paper was authored by Clark , Michi Nakata and Christopher Jones from CU - Boulder , Giuliano Zanchetta and Tommaso Bellini of the University of Milan , Brandon Chapman and Ronald Pindak of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Julie Cross of Argonne National Laboratory .
Nakata died in September 2006 .
Since the formation of molecular chains as uniform as DNA by random chemistry is essentially impossible , Clark said , scientists have been seeking effective ways for simple molecules to spontaneously self - select , " chain - up " and self - replicate .
The new study shows that in a mixture of tiny fragments of DNA , those molecules capable of forming liquid crystals selectively condense into droplets in which conditions are favorable for them to be chemically linked into longer molecules with enhanced liquid crystal - forming tendencies , he said .
" We found that even tiny fragments of double helix DNA can spontaneously self - assemble into columns that contain many molecules , " Clark said .
" Our vision is that from the collection of ancient molecules , short RNA pieces or some structurally related precursor emerged as the molecular fragments most capable of condensing into liquid crystal droplets , selectively developing into long molecules . "
Liquid crystals -- organic materials related to soap that exhibit both solid and liquid properties -- are commonly used for information displays in computers , flat - panel televisions , cell phones , calculators and watches .
Most liquid crystal phase molecules are rod-shaped and have the ability to spontaneously form large domains of a common orientation , which makes them particularly sensitive to stimuli like changes in temperature or applied voltage .
RNA and DNA are chain - like polymers with side groups known as nucleotides , or bases , that selectively adhere only to specific bases on a second chain .
Matching , or complementary base sequences enable the chains to pair up and form the widely recognized double helix structure .
Genetic information is encoded in sequences of thousands to millions of bases along the chains , which can be microns to millimeters in length .
Such DNA polynucleotides had previously been shown to organize into liquid crystal phases in which the chains spontaneously oriented parallel to each other , he said .
Researchers understand the liquid crystal organization to be a result of DNA 's elongated molecular shape , making parallel alignment easier , much like spaghetti thrown in a box and shaken would be prone to line up in parallel , Clark said .
The CU - Boulder and University of Milan team began a series of experiments to see how short the DNA segments could be and still show liquid crystal ordering , said Clark .
The team found that even a DNA segment as short as six bases , when paired with a complementary segment that together measured just two nanometers long and two nanometers in diameter , could still assemble itself into the liquid crystal phases , in spite of having almost no elongation in shape .
Structural analysis of the liquid crystal phases showed that they appeared because such short DNA duplex pairs were able to stick together " end - to - end , " forming rod-shaped aggregates that could then behave like much longer segments of DNA .
The sticking was a result of small , oily patches found on the ends of the short DNA segments that help them adhere to each other in a reversible way -- much like magnetic buttons -- as they expelled water in between them , Clark said .
A key characterization technique employed was X - ray microbeam diffraction combined with in - situ optical microscopy , carried out with researchers from Argonne and Brookhaven National Laboratories .
The team using a machine called the Argonne Advanced Photon Source synchrotron that enabled probing of the " nano DNA " molecular organization in single liquid crystal orientation domains only a few microns in size .
The experiments provided direct evidence for the columnar stacking of the nano DNA pieces in a fluid liquid crystal phase .
" The key observation with respect to early life is that this aggregation of nano DNA strands is possible only if they form duplexes , " Clark said .
" In a sample of chains in which the bases do n't match and the chains can't form helical duplexes , we did not observe liquid crystal ordering . "
Subsequent tests by the team involved mixed solutions of complementary and noncomplementary DNA segments , said Clark .
The results indicated that essentially all of the complementary DNA bits condensed out in the form of liquid crystal droplets , physically separating them from the noncomplementary DNA segments .
" We found this to be a remarkable result , " Clark said .
" It means that small molecules with the ability to pair up the right way can seek each other out and collect together into drops that are internally self - organized to facilitate the growth of larger pairable molecules .
" In essence , the liquid crystal phase condensation selects the appropriate molecular components , and with the right chemistry would evolve larger molecules tuned to stabilize the liquid crystal phase .
If this is correct , the linear polymer shape of DNA itself is a vestige of formation by liquid crystal order . "

Robin Chavalier
IN RECENT years , it has rarely paid to be pessimistic about America 's economy .
Time and again , worried analysts ( including The Economist ) have given warning of trouble as debt - laden and spendthrift consumers are forced to rein in their spending .
So far , that trouble has been avoided .
The housing market peaked early in 2006 .
Since then home - building has plunged , dragging overall growth down slightly .
But the economy has remained far from recession .
Consumers barely blinked : their spending has risen at an annual rate of 3 % in real terms since the beginning of 2006 , about the same pace as at the peak of the housing boom in 2004 and 2005 .
At the same time , rapid growth in emerging markets coupled with a tumbling dollar has provided the American economy with a new bulwark , one that strengthened even as financial markets seized up over the summer .
Exports soared at an annual rate of 16 % in the third quarter .
Thanks partly to strong export growth , revised GDP figures due on November 29th are likely to show that America 's output grew at an annual rate of around 5 % between July and September .
Never mind recession : that is well above the economy 's sustainable pace of growth .
But the good news may be about to come to an end .
The housing downturn has entered a second , more dangerous , phase : one in which the construction rout deepens , price declines accelerate and the wealth effect of falling prices begins to change consumers ' behaviour .
The pain will be intensified by a sharp credit crunch , the scale of which is only just becoming clear .
And , in the short term , it will be exacerbated by a spike in oil prices — up by 25 % since August — that is extreme , even by the standards of recent years .
The result is likely to be America 's first consumer - led downturn in close to two decades .
Home is where the rot starts
The biggest source of gloom is housing .
Despite almost two years of plunging construction , the collapse of the property bubble is far from finished — and its impact on broader consumer behaviour has barely begun .
So far , the housing recession has been a builders ' bust .
Housing starts are down by 47 % from their peak and residential building now accounts for 4.4 % of GDP , down from a record of 6.3 % in 2005 .
That is a big drop , but not yet unusually long or deep by historical standards .
Nouriel Roubini and Christian Menegatti , of Roubini Global Economics , point out that the seven other housing recessions since 1960 lasted an average of 32 months and saw housing starts fall by 51 % .
Judging by the large number of unsold homes and the pace at which buyers are cancelling contracts ( around 50 % according to some homebuilders ) , it is clear that builders have further to cut back .
Richard Berner , of Morgan Stanley , expects a further 25 % decline , taking the pace of housing starts in 2008 to below 1 m , the slowest since records began in 1959 .
A builders ' bust will not , by itself , drag the economy into recession .
Most post - war construction busts have been followed by recession , but only because they were triggered by tighter monetary policy to head off inflation .
The housing busts were a symptom of a forthcoming recession rather than the cause .
This time , the source of trouble lies with the bursting of the housing bubble itself .
Since 1997 , house prices have more than doubled in real terms .
That increase has coloured America 's economy in ways that go far beyond the construction boom .
In particular , rising house prices provide consumers with the collateral they need for a huge increase in borrowing .
Up to their necks
Relative to their incomes , consumers have been taking on more debt for decades , as America 's increasingly sophisticated financial system allows more people more access to credit .
But the pace of indebtedness has accelerated dramatically .
The ratio of household debt to disposable income is now above 130 % .
Earlier this decade it was 100 % ; in the early 1990s it was 80 % ( see chart 1 ) .
That credit expansion was made possible by rising house prices .
Now they are falling , credit conditions are tightening .
Both shifts are just beginning .
According to the S&P / Case - Shiller index , arguably America 's most accurate national measure , house prices have fallen by around 5 % in nominal terms since their peak , or 8 % once inflation is taken into account .
That is a tiny drop compared with the past decade 's rise ( see chart 2 ) .
Nor , judging by the pipeline of unsold homes , is it enough of a drop to bring demand in line with supply .
Unlike shares , whose prices change quickly , house prices are often “ sticky ” as homeowners are loth to acknowledge their houses are now worth less .
But the coming months are likely to see a sharp jump in the supply of homes for sale under distressed conditions .
More than 2 m subprime borrowers face markedly higher mortgage payments over the next 18 months as their interest rates are adjusted to new levels .
Many will be forced into foreclosure .
This constellation will drive house prices down .
Most Wall Street seers expect a drop of around 10 % in nominal terms over the next year or so , but price declines of 15 % or even 20 % are no longer regarded as outlandish .
Economists differ on how , and by how much , falling house prices will affect consumers ' spending .
But empirical studies suggest that changes in house prices have a bigger effect on consumer spending in countries , like America , where credit markets are deepest .
The most recent research implies that changes in Americans ' housing wealth affects their spending more than similar changes in their financial wealth , although the effect takes longer to emerge .
A $ 100 fall in financial wealth is traditionally associated with a $ 3 - 5 decline in spending .
An equivalent fall in housing wealth , it seems , eventually reduces spending by between $ 4 and $ 9 .
Given that America 's stock of residential housing is worth some $ 21 trillion ( or almost one - third of all household assets ) , a 10 % drop in house prices would make a discernible dent in consumption growth .
If the spending response were at the top of economists ' estimates , for instance , consumer spending would slow by almost two percentage points .
The economists ' studies , however , suggest that effect will be gradual : falling house prices will be an ongoing drag on consumer spending , rather than a sudden brake .
So far , this brake has been eased by strong gains in financial wealth .
Thanks to higher stock prices , American households ' overall assets have still been rising smartly .
If the stockmarket loses momentum along with the economy , the wealth effect on consumer spending could appear quite quickly .
A wholesale credit crunch would make matters much worse .
No one is yet sure how tight credit will get .
It depends on how big the losses from the subprime - related mess turn out to be ; who holds those losses ; how far banks are forced to take troubled assets , such as those in structured investment vehicles , onto their balance sheets ; by how much they cut back lending in response ; and how far the Federal Reserve reduces short - term interest rates to compensate .
Three months after the summer 's financial turmoil first hit , the omens do not look good .
Entire markets for securitised assets are shrivelling : the asset - backed commercial - paper market has shrunk for 13 weeks in a row and is now 30 % smaller than in August .
Estimates of the eventual losses from the subprime - related debt mess continue to rise .
Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Fed , recently put the losses from bad mortgage loans at $ 150 billion , up sharply from the $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion he expected early in the summer .
And even that may be too low , given that some $ 1.3 trillion - worth of subprime loans alone were originated between 2004 and 2006 .
Deutsche Bank now estimates overall subprime - related losses at up to $ 400 billion , of which $ 130 billion will belong to banks .
Write - downs of that scale will eat into even the best - stuffed capital cushions .
By some measures , banks are already hunkering down .
According to the Fed 's most recent survey of loan officers , a quarter of banks tightened their standards on consumer loans ( other than credit cards ) in October , up from only 10 % in July .
Four out of ten banks demanded higher standards on prime mortgages , up from 15 % in July .
The pace at which banks are tightening their mortgage - lending standards rivals that of the early 1990s , when the banking sector as a whole was much weaker and less well capitalised ( see chart 3 ) .
But since tighter mortgage standards are themselves a response to the housing bust , they may overstate the extent of an economy - wide credit crunch .
Shocked by oil
Many Americans , however , will find credit harder to come by .
And just as they do so , the third blow will come : that of higher fuel costs .
Although it has fallen back this week , the benchmark price of crude oil is still above $ 90 per barrel , almost 25 % higher than in August .
This surge has not been fully reflected in American petrol prices , largely because refineries had unusually fat margins earlier in the year .
Average petrol prices are up 33 cents per gallon ( or 12 % ) since mid-August .
Unless crude prices fall dramatically , much dearer petrol lies ahead .
If oil stays near to $ 100 per barrel , some analysts are talking about $ 4 per gallon by next summer .
Higher fuel costs are the equivalent of a tax on consumers , reducing the amount of money they can spend on other things .
Jan Hatzius , of Goldman Sachs , reckons that a rise in petrol prices of one cent reduces consumers ' overall disposable income by about $ 1.2 billion , and tends to drag consumer spending down by $ 600 m .
Over the next few months , he reckons , higher fuel costs could reduce consumer spending by 1.2 % at an annual rate .
Overall , this drag will be smaller than the combination of tighter credit and falling house prices , but its impact will be concentrated over a shorter period .
A final cause for concern is the labour market .
Low unemployment and solid wage growth have been a big reason for consumers ' resilience thus far ( see chart 4 ) .
With unemployment at 4.7 % and 166,000 new jobs in October , that strength looks intact .
But careful inspection suggests that October 's numbers mask a wider slowing .
The pace of net job creation has fallen from a monthly average of 189,000 in 2006 to 118,000 in the past three months .
Details from the household - based employment survey , which may be more accurate when the economy is slowing , are even darker .
It shows very little net job growth in 2007 , and an unemployment rate that is already up by three tenths of a point from its nadir .
Add this all up and it is small wonder that consumers are feeling gloomy .
Most gauges of consumer confidence have been plunging of late .
The University of Michigan 's index is at its lowest level in 15 years , leaving aside the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
The latest evidence suggests spending is already weakening : core retail sales were flat in October .
Consumer spending , at around 70 % of GDP , is by far the biggest determinant of the economy 's fate .
But it is not the only one .
The odds of a downturn also depend on whether other engines reinforce — or counteract — consumers ' weakness .
One wild card will be firms ' investment .
Corporate spending is historically volatile , often helping to tip an economy into a formal downturn .
In America 's last recession , in 2001 , plunging investment was the source of trouble , as firms worked off the investment excesses of the late 1990s .
Today , corporate America is in much stronger shape .
Overall , balance sheets are healthy and profits strong .
But as Martin Barnes , of Bank Credit Analyst , points out , domestic non-financial firms , the ones that do most capital spending , have been doing rather less well , with profits down by 9 % , compared with a year earlier , in the first half of 2007 .
Corporate investment may not drag the economy down , but nor is it likely to offer a boost .
That role belongs elsewhere — to foreign trade .
America 's exports have been booming while import growth has slowed sharply .
That has narrowed America 's trade deficit and boosted output .
Exports will not continue to grow at the torrid rates seen in recent months , but with the dollar showing scant signs of a turnaround and with emerging economies , in particular , looking remarkably resilient ( see article ) , exports will remain an important prop .
At 12 % of GDP , they are now easily able to offset the drag from weaker construction .
Recession or not ?
Put all this together and do you get a recession ?
Many analysts expect a sharply slower economy , but not an outright recession — using the popular definition of two consecutive quarters of falling GDP .
Wall Street 's seers have shaved their projections for GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 to around 1.5 % .
Most of them expect a couple more similarly weak quarters thereafter .
A few long - standing bears , such as Mr Roubini , are convinced recession is inevitable .
But most forecasters reckon the odds remain below 50 % .
Yet history cautions against taking too much comfort from this .
It is true that pessimists tend to predict recessions more often than they occur , but it is equally true that mainstream forecasters usually fail to predict those that happen .
In both 1990 and 2001 , Wall Street 's seers were predicting modest growth when the economy , it turned out , was already contracting .
History also shows that America 's economy can swing quickly from strong growth to contraction .
During the first three months of 1990 the economy was growing at 4.7 % , but it was in recession by July .
Adjust Wall Street 's forecasts for their inherent conservatism and an outright recession seems all too plausible .
The bigger point is that even if the economy technically avoids a recession , it will feel like one to most Americans — because it will be led by consumers .
That will be a big change .
Consumer spending has not fallen in a single quarter since 1991 ; it has not fallen on an annual basis since 1980 .
Consumers barely noticed America 's last recession — when low interest rates and high house prices kept them spending solidly ( see chart 5 ) .
Just how voters and politicians react to a consumer downturn in an election year is worryingly uncertain .
What 's more , the squeeze on consumers will last longer than many expect because it involves the unwinding of an asset - price bubble and attendant financial excesses .
Just as corporate spending stayed weak for years after the 2001 recession , so consumer spending will be crimped for more than a few months .
There seems little reason to expect , as many analysts seem to , that the housing bust will be history by the second half of 2008 .
Finally , policymakers ' responses may be more muted .
In 2001 , the economy was cushioned by a large fiscal boost , thanks to tax cuts and bigger spending , as well as much lower interest rates .
A big tax cut now seems extremely unlikely .
At the same time , the weak dollar and global economic strength that softened the downturn will also complicate the central bankers ' ability to respond .
Based on underlying inflation expectations , real interest rates are still above 2 % .
Central bankers often push short - term real rates to zero , or even below , in a downturn , suggesting there is plenty of room to cut , particularly since the housing glut means lower interest rates may pack less punch .
But high oil prices and a falling dollar may preclude such an aggressive response , as Mr Bernanke worries about rising inflation expectations .
Recession or not , America faces a tricky road ahead .

Enter your search terms Submit search form Bill 's Excellent Blog INTRODUCTION TO THE PALEOLITHIC DIET by Dr. Ben Balzer , family physician
There are races of people who are all slim , who are stronger and faster than us .
They all have straight teeth and perfect eyesight .
Arthritis , diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , stroke , depression , schizophrenia and cancer are absolute rarities for them .
These people are the last 84 tribes of hunter - gatherers in the world .
They share a secret that is over 2 million years old .
Their secret is their diet - a diet that has changed little from that of the first humans 2 million years ago , and their predecessors up to 7 million years ago .
Theirs is the diet that man evolved on , the diet that is coded for in our genes .
It has some major differences to the diet of " civilization " .
You are in for a few big surprises .
The diet is usually referred to as the " Paleolithic Diet " referring to the Paleolithic or Stone Age era .
It is also referred to as the " Stone Age Diet " , " Cave Man Diet " or the " Hunter - Gatherer Diet " .
More romantic souls like to think of it as the diet that was eaten in the " Garden of Eden " and they are correct in thinking so .
The basic principles of the Paleolithic Diet are so simple that most high school students can understand them .
Within 15 minutes from now you will grasp the major elements .
At the technical level , Paleolithic Diet Theory has a depth and breadth that is unmatched by all other dietary theories .
Paleolithic Diet
Theory presents a fully integrated , holistic , comprehensive dietary theory combining the best features of all other dietary theories , eliminating the worst features and simplifying it all .
All major dietary components are covered - ( i.e. vitamins , fats , protein , fats , carbohydrates , antioxidants and phytosterols etc ) .
This is for the simple reason that it is the only diet that is coded for in our genes - it contains only those foods that were " on the table " during our long evolution , and discards those which were not .
Have you ever wondered why almost everybody feels the need to take vitamin supplementsat times , or why so many people feel the need to " detoxify " their system ?
There are very real reasons for this that you will soon understand .
Now , come with me , I ’d like to share the secret with you ...
Basics of the Paleolthic Diet For millions of years , humans and their relatives have eaten meat , fish , fowl and the leaves , roots and fruits of many plants .
One big obstacle to getting more calories from the environment is the fact that many plants are inedible .
Grains , beans and potatoes are full of energy but all are inedible in the raw state as they contain many toxins .
There is no doubt about that - please do n’t try to eat them raw , they can make you very sick .
Around 10,000 years ago , an enormous breakthrough was made - a breakthrough that was to change the course of history , and our diet , forever .
This breakthrough was the discovery that cooking these foods made them edible - the heat destroyed enough toxins to render them edible .
Grains include wheat , corn , barley , rice , sorghum , millet and oats .
Grain based foods also include products such as flour , bread , noodles and pasta .
These foods entered the menu of New Stone Age ( Neolithic ) man , and Paleolithic diet buffs often refer to them as Neolithic foods .
The cooking of grains , beans and potatoes had an enormous effect on our food intake - perhaps doubling the number of calories that we could obtain from the plant foods in our environment .
Other advantages were soon obvious with these foods : · they could store for long periods ( refrigeration of course being unavailable in those days ) · they were dense in calories - ie a small weight contains a lot of calories , enabling easy transport · the food was also the seed of the plant - later allowing ready farming of the species
These advantages made it much easier to store and transport food .
We could more easily store food for winter , and for nomads and travelers to carry supplies .
Food storage also enabled surpluses to be stored , and this in turn made it possible to free some people from food gathering to become specialists in other activities , such as builders , warriors and rulers .
This in turn set us on the course to modern day civilization .
Despite these advantages , our genes were never developed with grains , beans and potatoes and were not in tune with them , and still are not .
Man soon improved further on these advances - by farming plants and animals .
Instead of being able to eat only a fraction of the animal and plant life in an area , farming allows us to fill a particular area with a large number of edible plants and animals .
This in turn increases the number of calories that we can obtain from an area by some 10 to 100 fold or more .
Then followed the harnessing of dairy products , which allow man to obtain far more calories from the animal over its lifetime than if it were simply slaughtered for meat .
Dairy products are interesting as they combine a variety of components - some of which our genes were ready for and some not .
Whist cows milk is ideal for calves , there are several very important differences between it and human milk .
For example , the brain of a calf is only a tiny fraction of its body weight whereas humans have very big brains .
Not surprisingly , cows milk is low in critical nutrients for brain development , particularly omeg 3 fats .
Paleolithic
Diet buffs refer to the new foods as Neolithic foods and the old as Paleolithic Diet foods .
In simple terms we see Neolithic as bad and Paleolithic as good .
Since then , some other substances have entered the diet - particularly salt and sugar , and more recently a litany of chemicals including firstly caffeine then all other additives , colourings , preservatives , pesticides etc.
Grains , Beans and Potatoes ( GBP ) share the following important characteristics : ·
They are all toxic when raw - there is no doubt about this - it is a fact that no competent source would dispute - they can be extremely dangerous and it is important never to eat them raw or undercooked .
These toxins include enzyme blockers , lectins and other types .
I will talk about them in detail later as they are very important .
· Cooking destroys most but not all of the toxins .
Insufficient cooking can lead to sickness such as acute gastroenteritis .
·
They are all rich sources of carbohydrate , and once cooked this is often rapidly digestible - giving a high glycemic index ( sugar spike ) .
·
They are extremely poor sources of vitamins ( particularly vitamins A , B - group , folic acid and C ) , minerals , antioxidants and phytosterols .
Therefore diets high in grains beans and potatoes ( GBP ) : · Contain toxins in small amounts ·
Have a high glycemic index ( ie have a similar effect to raw sugar on blood glucose levels ) ·
Are low in many vitamins , minerals , antioxidants and phytosterols - ie they are the original " empty calories " ·
Have problems caused by the GBP displacing other foods
As grains , beans and potatoes form such a large proportion of the modern diet , you can now understand why it is so common for people to feel they need supplements or that they need to detoxify ( ie that they have toxins in their system ) - indeed both feelings are absolutely correct .
Unfortunately , we do n’t necessarily realize which supplements we need , and ironically when people go on detoxification diets they unfortunately often consume even more Neolithic foods ( eg soy beans ) and therefore more toxins than usual ( perhaps they sometimes benefit from a change in toxins ) .
More detail on these issues follows in subsequent pages .
The essentials of the Paleolithic Diet are : Eat none of the following : · Grains - including bread , pasta , noodles · Beans - including string beans , kidney beans , lentils , peanuts , snow - peas and peas · Potatoes · Dairy products · Sugar · Salt Eat the following : · Meat , chicken and fish · Eggs · Fruit · Vegetables ( especially root vegetables , but definitely not including potatoes or sweet potatoes ) · Nuts , eg. walnuts , brazil nuts , macadamia , almond .
Do not eat peanuts ( a bean ) or cashews ( a family of their own ) · Berries - strawberries , blueberries , raspberries etc .
Try to increase your intake of : · Root vegetables - carrots , turnips , parsnips , rutabagas , Swedes · Organ meats - liver and kidneys ( I accept that many people find these unpalatable and wo n’t eat them )
Expect some minor tuning problems - do n’t worry , you can deal with them : · It will take some time for your body to adjust to the changes after all these years .
There is a huge surge in your vitamin intake .
There is a huge decrease in your toxin intake .
· Start with breakfast for few days , as this is the easiest place to start as most people eat it at home , and it tends to be the least Paleolithic meal of the standard 3 .
For weight loss you will eventually need to reduce your carbohydrate intake , but ignore this initially as most people have high carb intakes and this can continue for the first few days that you are on this diet .
If you reduce too quickly then you may fell unwell .
Then move on to lunch or dinner for a few days and then to all 3 meals .
If you work , you will often find it easier to take your lunch to work .
· Keep reading more about the diet - and read it again .
Remember , there are many dietary myths that will need to be unlearned .
Particularly , please read the section on fats several times .
Knowledge on fats has exploded over the last decade and there is a realization in mainstream nutrition that omega 3 fats are critical to good health .
It is very important to ensure that you have an adequate intake of these .
The low fat diet craze of the 90’s was well intentioned but many people " threw out the baby with the bath - water " - most people reduced omega 3 fat intake as well as other fats , and sometimes even increased omega 6 fats .
There is now a realization that the low fat diet theory of the 90’s does n’t often work ( it has about a 6 % success rate like most other diets ) and that the vast majority of the Western population need to increase their omega 3 intake and decrease their omega 6 intake .
Even if you do n’t end up on a Paleolithic Diet , you will benefit from a better appreciation of fats .
Technical Aspects : 12,000 years ago the ice planet Earth thawed out as the last Ice Age came to an end .
The great glaciers melted , carving enormous plains across the continents and the planet became green again .
The seas rose some 400 feet ( 120 metres ) ( incidentally unfortunately drowning most of our archeological heritage ) .
The plains flourished and savannah , prairie and forest sprang up .
Grazing animals spread onto the plains , followed by hunting animals and amongst these last were the greatest hunters of all - humans .
Humans , being omnivores , have the ability to eat both plant and animal foods .
That is a major advantage as the number of creatures that can live in a particular habitat depends entirely on how much energy they can obtain .
To make a crude example - imagine you are breeding monkeys on 100 acres of land and the only edible plant there is bananas .
If you double the number of banana plants , then you can double the number of monkeys on the land .
You might instead introduce apple trees and have the same effect .
The number of monkeys would depend entirely on how many calories they could obtain from the environment .
The carrying capacity of the habitat for a species depends on how many calories the species can obtain .
Humans are no different .
They have a major advantage in being able to eat both plant and animals foods thereby harvesting enormous amounts of calories from the environment .
Humans learnt to cook grains , beans and potatoes and increased further the number of plant food calories they can obtain from the environment - probably doubling it in most habitats , and even more on grasslands .
The reason why grains , beans and potatoes store so well is simply because of the toxins that they contain .
The enzyme blockers put them into a deep freeze , stopping them from sprouting .
The lectins and other toxins are natural pesticides and can attack bacteria , insects , worms , rodents and other pests ( and humans too of course ) .
ANTINUTRIENTS - YOUR KEY TO BAD HEALTH
You probably already know a lot about nutrients - macronutrients ( fats , protein and carbohydrates and micronutrients ( vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , phytosterols etc ) .
Now it 's time to meet the rest of the family .......
We all know that foods contain a variety of nutrients .
There is less awareness that many foods contain small amounts of potentially harmful substances .
These are toxins , as they have toxic effects .
They are normally called " antinutrients " by the scientific community as toxins sounds too alarmist .
Antinutrients are very real and for over 100 years research has been done on them - but it is generally only appreciated by a small group of specialized scientists .
Antinutrients have an incredible range of biological effects .
As you have probably already guessed , the vast majority and highest levels of antinutrients are in Neolithic foods like grains , beans and potatoes .
The Paleolithic diet has incredibly low levels of antinutrients compared to the usual modern diet .
I believe that this is the number one advantage of the diet .
Textbooks on antinutrients read like books on what not to eat - Neolithic foods are the most prominent .
Professor Irvin Liener published one of the most famous of these books in 1980 .
In the first chapter he points out that when we started cooking inedible plants , new toxins entered the diet for the first time .
Ironically , he was n’t trying to promote Paleolithic diets - his aim was to help agricultural scientists more safely feed the world on grains , beans and potatoes .
It ’s a technical subject , and I ’ll do my best to make it clear to you .
Consider our friend , the apple .
When an animal eats an apple , it profits by getting a meal .
It swallows the seeds and then deposits them in a pile of dung .
With some luck a new apple tree might grow , and so the apple tree has also profited from the arrangement .
In nature as in finance , it is good business when both parties make profit happily .
Consider what would happen if the animal were greedy and decided to eat the few extra calories contained within the apple seeds - then there would be no new apple tree to continue on the good work .
So , to stop this from happening , the apple seeds contain toxins that have multiple effects : * firstly , they taste bad - discouraging the animal from chewing them * secondly some toxins are enzyme blockers that bind up predators digestive enzymes - these also act as " preservatives " freezing the apple seed enzymes until sprouting -
Upon sprouting of the seed , many of these enzyme blockers disappear .
* thirdly , they contain lectins - these are toxic proteins which have numerous effects .
They act as natural pesticides and are also toxic to a range of other species including bacteria , insects , worms , rodents and other predators including humans .
Of course , the apple has other defenses - to start with it is high above the ground well out of reach of casual predators , and it also has the skin and flesh of the apple to be penetrated first .
Above all though is the need to stop the seed from being eaten , so that new apple trees may grow .
Now , please consider the humble grain .
Once again as a seed its duty is mission critical - it must perpetuate the life cycle of the plant .
It is however much closer to the ground , on the tip of a grass stalk .
It is within easy reach of any predator strolling by .
It contains a good source of energy , like a booster rocket for the new plant as it grows .
The grain is full of energy and in a vulnerable position .
It was " expensive " for the plant to produce .
It is an attractive meal .
Its shell offers little protection .
Therefore , it has been loaded with toxic proteins to discourage predators - grains are full of enzyme blockers and lectins .
You may be surprised to learn that uncooked flour is very toxic - please do n't try eating it as you become very sick .
And yes , I do n't recommend al dente pasta ( if one must eat pasta at all ) .
Beans too are full of enzyme blockers and lectins .
Potatoes contain enzyme blockers , lectins and another family of toxins called glycoalkaloids .
Glycoalkaloids ( GA ) unlike lectins and enzyme blockers are n't destroyed by cooking , even deep - frying .
GA are particularly high in green or injured potatoes , which must never be eaten even if trimmed heavily and well - cooked .
Many people have told me that they eat small amounts of raw potato - this is a dangerous habit and it should be discouraged very strongly .
These toxins in foods are commonly referred to as antinutrients .
Let 's learn some more about them : Enzyme Blockers :
These enzyme blockers are abundant in all seeds including grains and beans , and also in potatoes , serving to hold them in suspended animation and also acting as pesticides .
Most commonly they block the enzymes that digest protein ( proteases ) , and are called " protease inhibitors " .
They can affect the stomach protease enzyme " pepsin " , and the small intestine protease enzymes " trypsin " and " chymotrypsin " .
These small intestine enzymes are made by the pancreas ( it does a lot of other important things besides making insulin ) .
Some enzyme blockers affect the enzymes that digest starch ( amylase ) and are called " amylase inhibitors " .
When GBP are cooked , most of the enzyme blockers are destroyed , but some are not .
In human volunteers and in animal experiments high levels of protease inhibitors lead to increased secretion of digestive enzymes by the pancreas .
This is because the body can sense that the enzymes have been knocked out and orders to pancreas to make more .
Even if the effect of GBP based foods is only a small increase in pancreatic enzyme secretion , over many years it all adds up to a lot of extra work .
They are effective poisons - rats cannot gain weight if they have substantial amounts of enzyme blockers in the diet .
As far as their preservative action is concerned , I need only to remind you that the potted grains in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs were still viable and sprouted after thousands of years locked away .
Grain eating birds have evolved digestive enzymes that are resistant to grain protease inhibitors .
Lectins ( Haemagglutins ) ................
Meet Hannibal Lectins are natural proteins that have a large variety of roles .
They are amongst the most fascinating and stimulating of all biological compounds , and I have no doubt that they play a major role in many " unexplained " diseases .
I think of them as " Hannibal Lectins " as they remind of the devious criminal mastermind in the shock horror movie " Silence of the Lambs . '
Lectins are like master code - breakers .
The cells of our bodies are studded with receptors which are like code pads to ensure stimulation only under the correct circumstances .
Lectins have the ability to crack these codes and stimulate the receptors causing a variety of responses - covering basically the full repertoire of the cell and even tricking the cell into doing things it normally cannot do .
They also have a knack for bypassing our defenses and " getting behind the lines " , and then they can travel all over the body causing harm .
They can , for example : -- strip protective mucus off tissues , -- damage the cells lining the small intestine - disrupting the microscopic fingers called villi and microvilli , -- get swallowed whole by the small intestine cells ( " pinocytosis " ) -- bind to cells including blood cells causing a clot to form ( hence they were initially called " haemagglutins " ) -- make a cell act as if it has been stimulated by a hormone - -- stimulate a cell to secrete a hormone -- promote cell division at the wrong time -- cause gowth or shrinkage of lymphatic tissue ( " outposts " of white blood cells ) -- cause enlargement of the pancreas -- cause cells to present codes ( HLA 's ) that they normally should not use -- cause cell death ( apoptosis ) Lectins break down the surface of the small intestine , stripping it of mucus and causing the cells to become irregular and leaky .
Some lectins make cells act as if they have been stimulated by insulin .
Others cause the pancreas to release insulin .
Others cause immune cells to divide in the wrong way , causing growth of some white blood cells and breaking down the control of the immune system .
Others cause cells to present the wrong codes ( HLA 's ) on their surface , tricking the immune system into thinking that intruders have been found and activating the immune system inappropriately - thus leading to " autoimmune disease " where the body 's tissues are attacked by its own immune system .
Autoimmune diseases are incredibly common and increase every year that a person gets older .
A disordered immune system also has a much harder job recognizing and attacking the real intruders - invading germs and cancer cells ( you may have heard that scientists think that most people generate many cancer cells in a life time but that the immune system cleans most of them up ) .
It is not known whether lectins can cause cancer - this is one of the most important questions in medicine today .
They certainly affect colon cells in the test tube .
I feel that they are likely candidates as they can stimulate abnormal cell growth and they also cause disorder in the immune system .
Lectins have many other roles besides defending seeds .
For example in beans , lectins act like a glue to enable nitrogen - fixing bacteria to bind to the roots of the plant .
Many important lectin families are found in animal tissues , but as we are carnivores , we have evolved to be able to deal with these - just as birds that live on grains have evolved to be resistant to grain lectins .
It is ironic that the lectins were discovered more than 100 years ago and yet so many questions remain unanswered - the same was true of the immune system until the 1980’s .
I hope that there is more research done into lectins as they hold a whole world of disease mechanisms of which most of the medical community is blissfully unaware .
Exorphins : Exorphins are food chemicals that have morphine - like activity .
They are found in dairy products and wheat .
Our body has its own natural morphine like substances that are called endorphins .
Endorphins work by stimulating a type of nerve cell surface receptor called endorphin receptors .
Endorphins are very important in controlling pain and addictive behaviour .
Exorphins also act on endorphin receptors and may stimulate them or block them .
It is logical that exorphins may therefore affect chronic pain and also affect addictive behaviour .
Bill 's Excellent Blog
He lives in the rich quarter but shops in the poor , driving to the outskirts to buy vegetables and meat in the dirty , narrow alleys of a bazaar where flies and barefoot children race through scents of ginger and coriander .
Is this Mahmoud Mussa ’s fate ?
He does n’t know .
All he ’s sure of is that he sold one of his homes in Iraq for $ 25,000 ; the money ran out and he sent his wife to Baghdad to sell the other one .
That cash is disappearing , too , and now , after 14 months as a refugee in a Cairo suburb , Mussa has little left to sell or barter , and he ’s afraid he ’ll slip out of his affluent neighborhood and end up in a place with broken walls and tattered awnings .
He and his family escaped war , but sometimes there are worse things , like watching everything you worked for in one country being siphoned away in another .
He was a success in Iraq , a mechanical engineer with a couple of cars and a housekeeper .
But now he ’s just a restless man with a temporary residency card looking to fill empty hours in a nation that in many ways is poorer than the one he left .
And they ’re not so friendly now , the Egyptians .
Walk through Mussa ’s suburb , known as 6th of October City , and you hear it : in bakeries , on street corners , in schoolyards , whispered euphemisms of patience turned sour .
Advertisement
“ Our relations are worsening with the Egyptians .
They fight you psychologically , ” Mussa said .
“ If you try to start a business , they all stand against you .
They ’re poor and hungry people , and they saw us coming out of Iraq with cars and money and they were scared -- they feared we would compete with them . ”
Decades ago , hundreds of thousands of Egyptians migrated to Iraq to work as farmers , laborers and technicians ; now the flow has switched and there ’s uneasiness over how to navigate the reversal of fortunes .
Egyptians and Iraqis call each other Arab brothers , yet they are preoccupied with each other ’s idiosyncrasies , each hinting at a moral superiority that blames the other for un - devout lifestyles and lascivious souls .
“ I ca n’t figure out their religion , ” Moh Nuri Hamza , a Shiite Muslim refugee from southern Iraq , said of the Egyptians .
“ Their women wear head scarves , yet they wear tight , tight jeans below .
I never let my sisters - in - law leave the house .
I do n’t want them corrupted . ”
About 100,000 Iraqi refugees live in Egypt , many of them in October City , which sits beyond the Giza pyramids in air blanched with limestone dust and snapping flags advertising new desert subdivisions .
The government of President Hosni Mubarak has reportedly limited the number of Iraqis his country would accept , and so Egypt , which has been generous in the past to those fleeing strife , is not contending with the humanitarian crises that have spread across Syria , which has 1.2 million Iraqi refugees , and Jordan , which has as many as 750,000 .

But a strained undercurrent drifts through October City , from Mussa ’s bazaar to pastel apartment buildings trimmed with wooden shutters .
It ’s not loud , it does n’t shake the air .
It ’s bridled words spoken between clenched lips .
The Iraqis have pushed up rents .
The Iraqis have inflated the price of food .
Many say that only a few Egyptians have grown inhospitable , that Iraqis have been and are welcome here , but then someone like Mohamed Mokhtar , a shopkeeper , brushes aside his genial nature .
“ If I were the person in charge , ” he said , “ I would deport them back to Iraq . ”
Iraqis have their own hard opinions .
Not far from Mokhtar ’s shop , past a boy peeling garlic and another tinkering with a motorcycle , Ahmad Badri said he was naive to the Egyptian skill in fleecing foreigners , even ones fleeing war , when he arrived from Baghdad 18 months ago and opened an Internet cafe .
Advertisement
“ The landlord charged me rent of 600 Egyptian pounds [ about $ 107 ] a month .
I found out later it should have been 400 , ” Badri said .
“ The next day the Egyptian shopkeepers around me came and said , ‘ Now you ’ve raised the rent on all of us . ’
They criticized me in a friendly way at first , but today things are tense .
It ’s starting to deteriorate and I ’m starting to hate them all .
They ’re first - class vampires .
“ My 6 - year - old daughter is talking like an Egyptian .
I ’m sending her to a special language school so she wo n’t develop that annoying accent . ”
Badri is nearly out of money .
He ’s seen many like him forced to return penniless to Iraq .
They had arrived in October City with money and jewelry hidden , but over weeks and months they sold what was precious and found themselves balanced on a kind of descending scale , starting in high - end neighborhoods and gradually tumbling toward smaller rooms and rougher streets .
A thick - boned man with black stubble , whose meandering voice sought no hurry in the afternoon heat , Badri fell silent , pointing to the air as if bumping into an old friend .
It was music from the Iraqi singer Hussam Rassam coming from a radio ; it troubled Badri as much as it made him nostalgic .
Advertisement
“ How did we lose our country ? ” Rassam sang .
“ Five people dead on every corner .
The cop and the thief wear the same uniform . ”
The Iraqis in October City have their own shops and bakeries , and an ice cream stand , Al Saquma , named after the one everybody went to in Baghdad .
These are the tricks and rhythms learned :
The hummus here is different ; watch out for the scams ; put your kids in private schools ; and make sure you know your way to the Ministry of Investment , where for $ 500 you can apply to open a business , which gives you automatic yearlong residency .
If you do n’t open the business , go back next year and apply for a different one .
“ There ’s an ongoing inflation targeted against Iraqis , ” said Nabeel Shawi , a poet and photographer who wears suspenders and big sunglasses .
“ When I arrived last year , a four - bedroom house rented for 1,200 Egyptian pounds [ about $ 214 ] a month , but that same house today wo n’t go for less than 3,000 pounds [ $ 535 ] .
Education is also very expensive .
My son ’s college tuition is $ 2,000 a year , and it might go to $ 3,000 .
And all this while my money ’s about to vanish .
It ’s the duty of the United Nations to care for us . ”
Mahmoud Amer , an Egyptian grocer , is unsympathetic .
Advertisement
“ As Arabs , we should stand by the Iraqis , but they have to respect the rules of our country , ” he said .
“ When they open a business here and hire Egyptians , they mistreat them .
They always perceive themselves as masters and perceive Egyptians as their servants .
. . .
Frankly speaking , I myself do n’t like them . ”
The fact that Fatima Garibawy punched her daughter ’s Egyptian nanny suggests the feeling is mutual .
Garibawy lives in downtown Cairo in a sixth - floor apartment overlooking a presidential palace .
There are no pictures on her walls ; her sparse furniture is borrowed .
Her husband is dead .
He was killed in Iraq , but she wo n’t talk about it ; words have not been assigned to that memory .
She was a newspaper editor and active in Iraqi politics when she was chased from her country by threats and the images of slain friends .
She arrived in Egypt with money and ideas .
The first was to open a real estate business .
“ It lasted a week and we closed it , ” said Garibawy , her dark hair pulled back in a bandanna , her makeup doing its best against the city heat .
“ Egyptians claiming to be officials came asking for bribes .
‘ Where is your license ? ’
That kind of thing .
They interrogated us .
But I never paid bribes .
. . .
My next plan was to open a gym , but I was conned out of 30,000 Egyptian pounds .
I signed a fabricated contract and was given a bogus receipt .
They said they ’d have me thrown out of Egypt if I told anybody . ”
Advertisement
Her nanny orchestrated the ruse , she said .
Garibawy said she had trusted the woman and her family for months , paying them well to watch her daughter when she visited Iraq last year on the hope that she could resume life in Baghdad .
She even lived in the nanny ’s home for a while , believing she had found a refuge in a city of strangers .
“ When they stole that money from me I just lost my mind and punched her in the face , ” Garibawy said .
“ I ’m out of cash .
I ’m losing my identity .
I hide my Iraqiness because if I speak with an accent the Egyptians will exploit me .
I think to them Iraqis are the chicken who lays the golden egg . ”
Maybe , she said , she will go back to Iraq , cross borders with her 18 - month - old daughter , find a teaching job at a university .
She looked up from a high - backed chair , an ornate , baroque thing that seemed out of place amid the bare walls .
“ You do n’t know how many times a day I cry . ”
There ’s a bakery in October City that sells Iraqi bread , three to a pack .
It ’s run by a ninth - grader in a green head scarf and a 20 - year - old man , whose bare legs are streaked with flour and whose forehead is matted with black hair and sweat .
Advertisement
They want to go back to Baghdad , but they can’t , so they ’ve created this place , strung with colored lights , to remind them of things they do n’t want to forget .
It ’s like that across October .
The Iraqis here just call it that , October .
A few miles from the bakery , rust plumes the walls and garbage blows in the street .
The scent of slaughtered sheep mixes with spices and blood .
The bazaar on the corner seems as rickety as a village built with Popsicle sticks , but it bustles ; the bargains in this poor quarter are best late in the day .
Mahmoud Mussa shops with his family here to save money .
His wife , Hanan , wears a black hijab and is discriminating about quality and price .
Her lipstick is pink .
Mussa smiles .
He has found a way to be jovial , this father of four forced to sell two houses , his money trickling away .
He has a mustache and broad shoulders ; his eyes do n’t wander , they lock .
He is a Sunni Muslim .
That used to be OK in Iraq , but now it ’s not ; now , he said , nothing in Iraq is OK , that ’s why he ’s got to find more money , to keep from slipping back .
Advertisement
His younger son , who is taller , and follows his father ’s words as if each one had a price , is neatly dressed ; he seems to have wandered into the bazaar by accident .
“ We went to the French , Swiss and Spanish embassies to get help for our children , but we got no replies , ” Mussa says .
“ We have to keep our children out of Iraq .
We are Sunni .
We are threatened if we go back .
. . .
The militias came to our house before we escaped and tried to kidnap my son . ”
“ If we run out of money , we ’ll have to go back , ” Hanan says .
She and her husband have no connections here , no way to wheedle the system to make it work for a family of refugees .
Without money all things are impossible .
The son listens , trying to make himself small amid stalls of vegetables and poor Egyptians .

Noha El Hennawy of The Times ’ Cairo Bureau contributed to this report .
Blair , who last month stepped down as prime minister , was Labour 's opposition leader at the time and the conference 's star guest speaker .
Shortly before flying to Australia , Keating rang Blair inviting him to stay at his official Sydney residence , Kirribilli House , and offering advice about Murdoch .
" He said he had a few things to teach him about how to deal with Rupert , " Campbell wrote in a diary entry dated July 8 , 1995 .
" He said Murdoch is a hard bastard and you need a strategy for dealing with him . "
When Blair and Campbell met Keating eight days later , the prime minister passed on his tips .
" Keating was everything I expected - charming , tough , funny , totally at ease on the surface though probably a real furnace when he got going , " Campbell wrote .
" On Murdoch , he told TB : ' He 's a big bad bastard , and the only way you can deal with him is to make sure he thinks you can be a big bad bastard too .
You can do deals with him , without ever saying a deal is done .
But the only thing he cares about is his business and the only language he respects is strength ' . "
At an evening barbecue , Campbell noted how Keating " chatted up Murdoch for a while " and later confided the media boss liked Blair and believed he could become prime minister .
" He told TB , RM was clearly warming to him , which was good up to a point .
' They overestimate the importance of their support for you , but if you can get it , have it .
If you are Labour you need all the help you can get to win elections ' . "
Keating 's other advice to Blair was to never raise income taxes if he became prime minister , saying such a move spelt " death " for any Labour government .
There was also discussion about Keating 's future , with his then media adviser , Greg Turnbull , telling Campbell if Keating won the 1996 federal election he would quit a year later .
" PK said when he was out of office he planned to have an answering machine with the message : ' You have reached the office of ex-prime minister Paul Keating .
Now f--- off and leave me alone ' , " Campbell wrote .
As prime minister , Blair hosted an intimate dinner party for Murdoch and his sons , James and Lachlan , at his official 10 Downing Street residence in January 2002 .
Campbell , who was also a guest , said while " Lachlan seemed a bit shy " James attacked his father 's conservative views on the Middle East peace process and accused him of " talking f--- ing nonsense " .
" He [ Rupert Murdoch ] finally said to James that he did n't think he should talk like that in the prime minister 's house and James got very apologetic with TB , who said not to worry , I hear far worse all the time . "

Jose Altuve drew a bases - loaded walk to force in the go - ahead run in the ninth inning for Houston after a two - out error by shortstop Jorge Polanco , and the Astros beat Minnesota 4 - 1 Tuesday to open their AL playoff series and stretch the Twins ' all - time record postseason losing streak to 17 games .
Manager Dusty Baker 's Astros became the first team in major league history to win a game after reaching the postseason with a losing record .
Michael Brantley tacked on a two - run single in the ninth after Sergio Romo issued a full - count walk to the 5 - foot - 6 Altuve , the 2017 AL MVP who had a quiet season at the plate .
Burglars smashed the front window of the Apple Inc. 's Saddle Creek retail store in Memphis , Tenn .
Tuesday morning , making off with $ 25,000 worth of goods in less than a minute flat .
The break - in was the third at an Apple retail store and fourth at an Apple facility this month , underscoring a brewing problem for the Cupertino - based company as it prepares to stock its retail outlets with millions of dollars in additional merchandise ahead of the holiday shopping season .
ifoAppleStore reports that crooks smashed their way into the Saddle Creek Apple store at 4:22 a.m.
Tuesday morning and within 60 seconds had stolen $ 25,000 worth of merchandise , including 10 iPhones , one iMac and six MacBook laptops .
Police said the break - in triggered an alarm and an officer arrived less than a minute later , but the suspects had already fled .
Some fixtures and two digital cameras were reportedly damaged in the burglars ' haste .
An investigation is currently underway to determine whether the crime is related to several other break - ins at a nearby chain of Patton Comptuers & Electronics stores earlier this summer .
Those burglaries prompted the retail chain to post videos of the crimes .
The front page of Sunday ’s New York Times contained an interesting article reviewing research linking the death penalty to homicide trends .
Adam Liptak attempts to provide a balanced account of the debate , noting first one set of findings :
According to roughly a dozen recent studies , executions save lives .
For each inmate put to death , the studies say , 3 to 18 murders are prevented .
And then my own research :
The death penalty “ is applied so rarely that the number of homicides it can plausibly have caused or deterred cannot reliably be disentangled from the large year - to - year changes in the homicide rate caused by other factors , ” John J. Donohue III , a law professor at Yale with a doctorate in economics , and Justin Wolfers , an economist at the University of Pennsylvania , wrote in the Stanford Law Review in 2005 .
“ The existing evidence for deterrence , ” they concluded , “ is surprisingly fragile . ”
Surely a dozen studies is itself evidence of robustness .
Why then is then is it that we find these results are fragile ?
Two words : Publication bias ( also known as the file drawer problem ) .
Our research revealed that alternative approaches to testing the execution - homicide link can yield a huge array of possible results ( positive and negative ) .
But if only strong pro-deterrent results are reported ( and the others remain in the file drawer ) , this could look misleadingly like there is a pro-deterrent consensus .
It turns out that there are some rather simple tests for publication bias .
Our friends in medicine provide a useful intuition .
Imagine that there are many separate drug trials being considered – some with large samples , some with small samples .
If all results are being reported , then smaller samples should , on average , yield similar estimates to larger samples , albeit with a bit more noise ( in both directions ) .
So the standard error of an estimate should be uncorrelated with the coefficient .
But if researchers only report statistically significant estimates , then they will only report results with t- statistics > 2 , yielding a strong correlation between standard errors and coefficient estimates .
You can probably guess what we find .
Looking across the key estimate from the most - cited studies we find :
But perhaps more telling , is the same assessment on the various estimates reported as “ robustness checks ” within each of these studies :
Remember :
The data should look like a sideways “ V ” .
Yet there is only one paper that does not suggest a statistically significant correlation between the standard error and the reported coefficient ( Katz , Levitt and Shustorovich ) , and incidentally , that is the only paper without a strong pro-deterrent finding .
Given that it appears that few of the insignificant estimates were reported , it probably is n’t that surprising that running a few more regressions reveals many of the unreported insignificant ( and even opposite - signed ) results .
Still need convincing ?
Download my death penalty data , and run your own regressions .
You will find all sorts of different results .

WEST HARTFORD , Conn .
--
The enormity of the house Arnold Chase is building on Avon Mountain is n't fully apparent from the outside , where only 17,000 square feet of it lies in plain view .
It 's the two - level , 33,500 - square - foot basement complex , complete with a 103 - seat movie theater , ticket booth , concession stand , game room and music annex , that will make it New England 's largest occupied single - family home .
At nearly 50,900 square feet , the Chase home will be slightly larger than billionaire Bill Gates ' home in Washington , about 4,000 square feet smaller than the White House and 20 times larger than the average - size home in America .
The average U.S. home measures about 2,500 square feet -- up from 1,995 square feet in 1988 -- according to the National Association of Home Builders .
But while houses are getting bigger , rarely are they built as big as the new Chase house .
" What you 're talking about is mega homes , " said Gopal Ahluwalia , the home builders association 's vice president for research .
" There are few homes larger than 50,000 square feet . "
The brick and stucco colonial can be seen easily from the road .
But the Hartford - based businessman , who plans to vacate a comparatively tiny 8,900 - square - foot home when he moves , does n't want too many people to know about it .
He refused an interview and had a freelance photographer seeking permission to photograph the house for The Associated Press cited for trespassing .
Besides the two - tiered movie theater , soda fountain and men's and women 's bathrooms , the Chase home will include a 400 - square foot " observatory , " five bedrooms , eight full bathrooms and five half bathrooms , according to documents filed with the West Hartford planning office .
The game room , in the " upper " basement , will take up nearly 4,900 square feet -- nearly twice as big as the average - size house .
" It 's the same thing as why people buy a $ 150,000 car when the same function can be performed by a $ 25,000 car , " Ahluwalia said .
" I can afford it .
I can have it .
I want to have the biggest house in the world .
Things like that . "
Some question the morality of building a private home that large .
" Do you actually need to have that amount of space to live a good life ? " said Susan A. Eisenhandler , a sociology professor at the University of Connecticut .
" There are homeless people .
There are impoverished people .
There are serious social concerns , and we 're not addressing that . "
The only single - family residential structures in New England larger than Chase 's are two mansions in Newport , which are now museums and no longer occupied .
The largest private home ever built in the United States is the Biltmore House in Asheville , N.C. , comprising more than 174,000 square feet .
Also on the national list are the 109,000 - square - foot Oheka Castle in Huntington , N.Y. , and Donald Trump 's 80,000 - square - foot Maison de l'Amitie in Palm Beach , Fla .
The Chase house was designed by Allan Greenberg 's architectural firm in New York , which has worked on notable projects at the White House , State Department and the Holocaust Memorial in New York .
The firm declined to comment .

I defy you to watch this and not be moved .
And as he does so often , Keith Olbermann zeros in on exactly what should be meant by the phrase " supporting the troops . "
To speak of supporting the troops and not understand that the only true way to enact that support is to make sure that kind of homecoming is what each of them and their families have earned is to reduce that support to a saying on a bumper sticker , to making it a meaningless brand name .
Supporting the troops is supporting 1st Lt. Thomas Bourne , and supporting Amy Bourne and supporting Walker Bourne and supporting Preston Bourne .
Supporting them is not making those two little boys have to cry again .
It is not thumping a chest and waving a flag and threatening a dissenter .
It is not what the Army Reserve is doing to Thomas Bourne and thousands more like him : sending him after his two weeks ' leave is up ... back to Iraq .
“ The requirement is among the measures we take to ensure the validity and security of bookings made on our points - of - sale , ” Ms. Deines said .
Some airlines do the same thing , and restrict purchases on their foreign Web sites to customers in those countries , said Keith Melnick , executive vice president of corporate development at Kayak.com and a former revenue manager at American Airlines .
“ In airline speak , ” he wrote in an e-mail message , “ the airlines differentiate their pricing based on the point - of - sale ( P.O.S. ) .
However , it is generally not a good idea to start searching the site in these other countries since the ones that do differentiate pricing by P.O.S. do n’t want you to do this and will prevent you from purchasing by requiring a local credit card . ”
When this is the case , there are few work - arounds .
If you are visiting friends in a foreign country , see if they can make a reservation for you .
Likewise if you ’re traveling on business abroad , perhaps your company ’s foreign office can arrange your travel .
You also might try contacting a travel agent in the area you ’re planning to visit and ask them to make the purchase for you .
The savings may outweigh any fees charged by the agent for processing the transaction .
While country - domain hopping may uncover deals for rental cars and domestic flights in those countries , it does n’t seem to work as well for hotel chains .
“ The large chains like Marriott have implemented a single image inventory to ensure rate parity across all channels , ” said Ram Badrinathan , a Mumbai - based senior analyst at PhoCusWright , a travel consulting and research company .
Bargain hunters should also watch out for hidden fees .
Car rental agencies may charge foreign customers more for liability coverage .
Web sites often assume that you are a resident of that country when you book online , so the additional cost may not appear until you pick up the car .
Also , the foreign spinoffs of airline travel sites may require that the trip originate from that country , making round - trip searches of little use to American travelers .
Still , those sites may be useful if you ’re planning to travel within that country .
A recent search on Kayak.com for the lowest airfare between Paris and Nice found a $ 171 fare on Air France .
The same search on Kayak . fr turned up a 100 - euro ticket on easyJet .
Those sites might also come in handy for finding a cheap side trip .
A recent glance at Travelocity .
co.uk highlighted four - star hotel offers in Rome starting at 48 euros a night and vacation packages in Krakow , Poland .
Meanwhile , Travelocity.com was advertising deals in Florida , New York and Mexico .
So while searching the foreign version of a travel Web site might not always lead to the lowest price , it might just lead you to a destination you never would have thought to visit .
Last week in Denver , the Rubinius guys had a coding sprint ; read about it in Brian Ford ’s Rubinius sprint retrospective and Wilson Bilkovich ’s Implementing define_method .
We at Sun supported it by covering the travel costs ( well , we will as soon as I get the paperwork , guys ) and by sending Charles Nutter along for a day .
Looks like they got some good stuff done .
Rubinius is an attempt to build the next - gen Ruby implementation .
Which is happening in parallel with the “ official ” Ruby 1.9 work in Japan and the JRuby project .
[ Update : Pat Eyler interviews the sprinters . ]
Basically , we ’re supporting all of them .
Along with giving Rubinius a hand , we employ half the JRuby committers , we ’ve donated a server to Matz ’s gang , and ( I hope to be able to announce soon ) we ’re going to be giving the Japanese side some other support .
Why are we doing this ?
Because , in my view , Ruby is n’t finished .
It ’s a great substrate for Rails , it ’s immensely useful for building all sorts of things , but it ’s not fast enough .
I agree with Avi Bryant ’s argument that a language is n’t finished until it ’s fast enough to extend itself .
Frankly , none of the language enhancements proposed for Ruby 2.0 make my heart go pitter - patter .
But give me a Ruby with performance as good as a really good Smalltalk VM , and the space of things for which you need statically - typed languages shrinks to a really uninteresting size .
Except for , nobody including me is smart enough to predict which of the Ruby . next implementations is going to have that performance mojo .
So , it seems like the only reasonable thing is to bet on all of ’em .
One thing that makes this easy is that all the teams get along with each other ; a natural outgrowth of Ruby culture , and something from which we can all learn .

A performing arts center has been built on the site .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) AP WASHINGTON 
The Senate voted Thursday to kill a $ 1 million grant for a museum on the site of the 1969 Woodstock concert , a rare rebuke of a legislative pet project and a blow to the presidential candidate who backed it , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Clinton and her New York colleague , Sen. Charles Schumer , had the funding inserted into the $ 604 billion education and health spending bill .
The Woodstock project 's main backer , Alan Gerry , is a registered Republican who recently became a major contributor to the Schumer - led Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
Nine days after the " earmark " was placed in the bill in June , Gerry and his wife contributed the maximum of $ 9,200 to Clinton 's primary and general election campaign funds .
The Gerry family contributed an additional $ 20,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , USA TODAY reported Wednesday .
Two Republican senators , Oklahoma 's Tom Coburn and Arizona 's Jon Kyl , offered an amendment Thursday seeking to redirect the money to a maternal health care program .
In a time of mounting deficits , they argued , senators should n't be steering money to a museum that has wealthy private supporters .
" How can we , with a straight face , argue to ( the public ) that we 're not wasting their hard - earned money , " Kyl said .
Republicans did n't expect to win the vote , Coburn spokesman John Hart said , but when Schumer tried to table the amendment , five Democrats joined every Republican present in voting against him .
The motion lost , 52 - 42 , and Democrats agreed to nix the Woodstock museum funding under a rule that required no further votes .
" The ridiculousness of this earmark was such that you even had Democrats who … had to vote with Republicans , " Senate Republican spokesman Ryan Loskarn said .
It was only the third time in dozens of attempts since 2005 that Coburn has convinced the Senate to kill an earmark , his spokesman said .
Among the Democrats voting against the earmark was Jim Webb of Virginia , who was recovering from shrapnel wounds he incurred in Vietnam while the Woodstock concert was unfolding in August 1969 .
He declined to comment .
Clinton was at a campaign event while Schumer defended the spending .
He said it would help create jobs in upstate New York 's Sullivan County , which he portrayed as economically depressed .
" I am proud of the earmarks I 've put in this bill , " he said .
Coburn and Kyl said that the county 's 4.1 % unemployment rate was lower than the national average .
After the vote , Schumer 's office did not respond to a request for comment .
Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said the senator will continue " to promote economic development and tourism in New York state . "
Gerry , who according to Forbes magazine is worth $ 1.3 billion , bought the Woodstock concert site a decade ago with plans to turn it into a tourist center .
He said he contributed $ 85 million to the project through a family foundation that owns the land and facilities .
A performing arts center opened last year , and the two - story museum is under construction .
Gerry contributed more than $ 200,000 to politicians in New York state since 1999 , mostly Republicans .
The state contributed $ 15 million to the concert hall , known as the Bethel Center for the Performing Arts .
The health spending bill passed the appropriations committee June 21 with the Woodstock earmark .
Five days later , Gerry , his wife , and two of their children made a $ 20,000 contribution to the Democrats ' senate campaign committee .
Four days after that , they made the contributions to Clinton .
The Gerrys have given $ 150,000 to the Schumer - led committee since 2005 .
Coburn argues there is an unseemly correlation between campaign contributions and earmarks , but he did not raise the issue on the Senate floor .
Spokesmen for Schumer and Clinton said the donations were unrelated to the earmark .

More than 2,000 Iraqis were questioned in all 18 provinces
The survey for the BBC , ABC News and NHK of more than 2,000 people across Iraq also suggests that nearly 60 % see attacks on US - led forces as justified .
This rises to 93 % among Sunni Muslims compared with 50 % for Shia .
The findings come as the top US commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , prepares to address Congress .
He and US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker are due to testify about the effects of the surge and the current situation in Iraq .
The poll suggests that the overall mood in Iraq is as negative as it has been since the US - led invasion in 2003 , says BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs .
The poll was conducted by D3 Systems and KA Research in more than 450 neighbourhoods across all 18 provinces of Iraq in August , and has a margin of error of + or - 2.5 % .
It was commissioned jointly by the BBC , ABC and Japan 's NHK .
Divided nation
It is the fourth such poll in which BBC News has been involved , with previous ones conducted in February 2004 , November 2005 and February 2007 .
It was commissioned with the specific purpose of assessing the effects of the surge as well as tracking longer term trends in Iraq .
Between 67 % and 70 % of the Iraqis polled believe the surge has hampered conditions for political dialogue , reconstruction and economic development , according to the August 2007 findings .
More Iraqis want coalition forces to leave immediately
Only 29 % think things will get better in the next year , compared to 64 % two years ago .
The number of people wanting coalition forces to leave immediately rose since February 's poll but more than half - 53 % - still said they should stay until security improved .
The survey reveals two great divides , our correspondent notes .
First , there is the one between relative optimism registered in November 2005 and the gloom of this year 's two polls .
In between , there was the deadly bombing of the Shia mosque in Samarra , which unleashed a bitter and deadly sectarianism .
The other great divide is the one now revealed between the Sunni and Shia communities .
While 88 % of Sunnis say things are going badly in their lives , 54 % of Shia think they are going well .
' Good for Baghdad '
Iraq analyst Dr Toby Dodge pointed to the fact that so many Iraqis saw no improvement to their safety since the US deployed an extra 30,000 troops this year , bringing their number up to nearly 170,000 .

" I think that 's a damning critique and an indication of the pessimism and the violence on the ground , " he told the BBC's Radio Five Live .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki insisted on Monday that the surge had had a positive effect in the capital , Baghdad , at least .
Violence had dropped 75 % , he told the Iraqi parliament , without giving figures .
At the same time , he warned that Iraqi forces were not ready to take over security from the US military which had , he said , " helped ... in a great way in fighting terrorism " .

If you 've never heard of synbio , you will hear plenty in the next decade .
Synthetic biology now occupies roughly the same space on the public 's radar that computing might have done in the 1960s or genetic modification in the 1970s - it 's largely unheard of by anyone except the scientific community and its geeky observers .
But as the pace of breakthrough in this area quickens , the sense of being on the edge of an extraordinary technological revolution is giving even the scientists involved vertigo .
Part of the reason why synbio has had so little attention in the British media is that most of the running is being made in America .
There , a few key players are jockeying for position in a race that promises to make them wealthy in the way that computers did Bill Gates .
With the arrival in the UK this week of one of those players , Craig Venter , for a string of public talks , the huge implications of synbio might finally begin to impinge on public consciousness here .
We did n't much like genetic modification ( GM ) by the time it reached trials in the UK in the 1990s , but that could come to look like a storm in a teacup compared to synbio .
While GM was about adding or knocking out the odd gene , synbio is about using nature as a giant Meccano set , building entirely new organisms from bits of DNA called BioBricks in what 's known as the bottom - up approach .
Alternatively , there 's Venter 's method of stripping out DNA to find the simplest life form and then using that - like a car chassis - to add bits to achieve a bespoke design : this is the breakthrough he says he is on the point of achieving .
In this brave new world , they talk of a future in which synthetic biologists will work much like graphic designers , building new organisms on their laptops and emailing them off to the gene foundry for construction .
The best guess is that we are a year or two away from the first commercial application becoming clear , but already huge money is being ploughed in .
Venter and his colleagues are plastering every step of their research with sweepingly broad patent applications ; it 's a gold rush .
By 2015 it 's estimated that a fifth of the chemical industry ( worth $ 1.8 trillion ) could be dependent on synbio .
But if that is to happen , the public have to be kept on side and persuaded that the risks with synbio - and it is a frightening science - are worth taking .
What leading synthetic biologists do n't want is a public backlash and heavy - handed government interference .
They talk of self - regulation - last week the J Craig Venter Institute in Maryland put out another set of proposals - while pushing their research so far ahead of the public debate that by the time we 've all cottoned on to what they 're up to , it will be too late to do much about it .
So beware of how we are being sold this scientific revolution with pledges to help Africa 's poor and ease global warming .
The poster child for synbio is the production of a cheap anti-malarial drug .
There is a worldwide shortage of natural artemisinin , the most effective anti-malarial extracted from the wormwood tree , but synthetic biologists are on the verge of finding a way to insert the gene responsible for artemisinin into a strain of yeast which could then " manufacture " it in cheap , vast quantities .
Further from development but equally plausible are bacteria that could mop up oil spills or extract heavy metal contamination from soil .
The most tantalising possibilities might offer help with climate change : bacteria that could break down cellulose to produce ethanol , and even bacteria that could soak up carbon dioxide .
Fuel from vast slurry pits of bacteria ( they could always lob in a gene to make the smell palatable ) : the future is an industrialisation of nature .
Some of these promises will be much like the " golden rice " that was used to promote GM , with claims that it would alleviate chronic vitamin A deficiency across Asia , but which has yet to materialise .
However , no one doubts that there will be dramatic and benign applications of synbio .
The problem is that no one can predict what their price tag might be .
How synbio could go wrong keeps even dedicated synthetic biologists awake at night ; one , Drew Endy , at the Massachussets Institute of Technology , has said : " I expect this technology will be misapplied ... and it would be irresponsible to have a conversation about the technology without acknowledging that fact . "
Sir Martin Rees , president of the Royal Society , talks of bioterror or " bioerror " - a mistake - that could lead to a million casualties in a single event by 2020 .
The most frightening aspect of synbio lies in two dimensions of the science .
First , after the upfront research costs , synbio has the potential to be a highly accessible technology much like electronics .
Unlike nuclear technology , for example , it wo n't require expensive resources or unusual expertise .
In a decade , thousands of laboratories and science graduates are likely to be able to practise synbio , making the task of regulating its use extremely difficult .
Second , creating fantastic bacteria in a contained laboratory is one thing , but what happens when they get out and cross with their wild cousins , mutating into organisms we had never foreseen ?
The whole point of this science is the development of large - scale use outside a lab , but can we predict what consequences releasing these new organisms could have ?
The answer is a resounding no .
We know about less than 1 % of existing bacteria , and have very little understanding of how they mutate .
But what we do know is that bacteria survive almost anything - if some malevolent bacteria developed , they would be hard to kill off .
This is scary stuff , but no one is seriously suggesting we can stop here .
Even the most nervous synthetic biologists recognise that if they do n't keep ploughing ahead , others without their scruples will : we need responsible scientists to alert us to the possibilities of this science .
Besides , the promise of huge riches will keep driving development - Venter claims that if he pulls off his organism , it could be worth billions or even trillions of dollars in licensing deals .
Imagine if the engineers of 18th - century Britain could have foreseen the consequences of industrialisation .
If they had been warned that it would bring untold wealth and comfort to millions , but would also disrupt human communities , lead to a terrible escalation of war and huge environmental degradation , how then would they have weighed the massive and momentous consequences ?
And how are we going to ?
In a couple of decades we could have a nature to organise entirely as we like - the scientist Freeman Dyson suggested black - leaved forests for more efficient use of sunlight in an article on synbio in a recent New York Review of Books .
We could be busy creating our own biodiversity to replace the one we will have lost .
We might have a " new , improved nature " which is more efficient in meeting our needs and ensuring the survival of future generations : is that a threat or a promise of salvation ?
And who are we going to trust to make that judgment call ?

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Mike Mette has been a Chicago police officer for almost four years .
But now , as a result of a fistfight one night in Dubuque , Iowa , he is a convicted felon .
Mike Mette , a Chicago police officer , says he acted in self - defense when he punched Jake Gotthard , a student at the University of Dubuque .
Mette has been sentenced to almost five years in prison after Dubuque County Judge Monica Ackley found him guilty of assault causing serious injury .
Mette says he 's been wronged .
" I was arrested for self - defense ... I was defending myself , " he said .
Mette 's saga started in October 2005 after a night of drinking in Dubuque , where he was visiting his brother Mark .
After the bars closed , Mette and his crew made their way to an after - hours party thrown by Jake Gotthard , a student at the University of Dubuque .
According to court documents , Mette and his friends entered the house party , but decided to leave without paying the required $ 5 entry fee when they saw the room was mostly empty .
Gotthard became angry , and with the help of his roommate , began chasing Mette down the street .
Gotthard claims someone in Mette 's group had stolen his cell phone and he wanted it back .
Exactly what happened to the cell phone is still unclear .
The altercation continued a block and a half down the street and eventually ended up in front of the house of Mette 's brother .
Fight could land cop in prison »
" That 's when Mr. Gotthard hit me .
He hit me with two fists like this , straight into the chest , " Mette said .
" He was yelling about his cell phone , telling me if he did n't get his cell phone back he was going to beat the crap out of me .
He hit me several more times and then I pushed him away from me .
It was n't until after the third time is when he came back at me again and that is when I struck him . "
When police arrived , they found Gotthard lying on the ground with bruises and lacerations on his face , cheek , nose , chin and forehead .
Mette , who had blood on his shirt and whose knuckle was bruised and cut , was arrested and charged with a felony .
" [ Gotthard ] had bruises on the side of his neck , his arms , his elbow , his shoulders , on his back , that were simply not consistent with Mr. Mette 's version that he only struck him once , " said Assistant County Attorney Tim Gallagher .
Dubuque doctors testified the injuries were consistent with someone who had been stomped and kicked .
But a doctor testifying for Mette 's defense rejected the Dubuque findings .
He said all those injuries could have come from Mette 's single punch and the impact from falling on the sidewalk .
Gallagher said the decision to prosecute Mette was a tough one .
" It 's never an easy situation when someone is sentenced to prison , particularly when it's a police officer that we have to rely on , " he said .
" But we can't allow individuals to be given certain privileges because of their occupation . "
The case spawned a battle between newspaper columnists in Chicago and Dubuque .
" Mette played baseball in college .
But what 's happening to him is n't about Iowa baseball mythology .
It does n't smell of corn .
It stinks of the pig barn , " wrote Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass .
He chalks the judge 's decision up to small town politics .
In a reply , a columnist for the Dubuque Telegraph Herald wrote that Kass is a " legendary muckraker " who is " training his scorn " on Ackley , the judge .
Mette is currently on unpaid leave from the Chicago Police Department and is appealing his case .
He will begin serving his five - year sentence in November .

Could extraterrestrial life be made of corkscrew - shaped particles of interstellar dust ?
Intriguing new evidence of life - like structures that form from inorganic substances in space are revealed today in the New Journal of Physics .
The findings hint at the possibility that life beyond earth may not necessarily use carbon - based molecules as its building blocks .
They also point to a possible new explanation for the origin of life on earth .
Life on earth is organic .
It is composed of organic molecules , which are simply the compounds of carbon , excluding carbonates and carbon dioxide .
The idea that particles of inorganic dust may take on a life of their own is nothing short of alien , going beyond the silicon - based life forms favoured by some science fiction stories .
Now , an international team has discovered that under the right conditions , particles of inorganic dust can become organised into helical structures .
These structures can then interact with each other in ways that are usually associated with organic compounds and life itself .
V.N. Tsytovich of the General Physics Institute , Russian Academy of Science , in Moscow , working with colleagues there and at the Max - Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany and the University of Sydney , Australia , has studied the behaviour of complex mixtures of inorganic materials in a plasma .
Plasma is essentially the fourth state of matter beyond solid , liquid and gas , in which electrons are torn from atoms leaving behind a miasma of charged particles .
Until now , physicists assumed that there could be little organisation in such a cloud of particles .
However , Tsytovich and his colleagues demonstrated , using a computer model of molecular dynamics , that particles in a plasma can undergo self - organization as electronic charges become separated and the plasma becomes polarized .
This effect results in microscopic strands of solid particles that twist into corkscrew shapes , or helical structures .
These helical strands are themselves electronically charged and are attracted to each other .
Quite bizarrely , not only do these helical strands interact in a counterintuitive way in which like can attract like , but they also undergo changes that are normally associated with biological molecules , such as DNA and proteins , say the researchers .
They can , for instance , divide , or bifurcate , to form two copies of the original structure .
These new structures can also interact to induce changes in their neighbours and they can even evolve into yet more structures as less stable ones break down , leaving behind only the fittest structures in the plasma .
So , could helical clusters formed from interstellar dust be somehow alive ?
" These complex , self - organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary properties to qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter , " says Tsytovich , " they are autonomous , they reproduce and they evolve " .
He adds that the plasma conditions needed to form these helical structures are common in outer space .
However , plasmas can also form under more down to earth conditions such as the point of a lightning strike .
The researchers hint that perhaps an inorganic form of life emerged on the primordial earth , which then acted as the template for the more familiar organic molecules we know today .

Bush Plans War on Iran
By Marjorie Cohn
The Sunday Times of London is reporting that the Pentagon has plans for three days of massive air strikes against 1,200 targets in Iran .
Last week , Alexis Debat , director of terrorism and national security at the Nixon Center , told a meeting of The National Interest , a conservative foreign policy journal , that the military did not intend to carry out “ pinprick strikes ” against Iranian nuclear facilities .
He said , “ They ’re about taking out the entire Iranian military . ”
Bush has already set the wheels in motion .
With Rovian timing , Alberto Gonzales ’ resignation was sandwiched between two Bush screeds – one aimed at ensuring Congress scares up $ 50 billion more for the occupation of Iraq , the other designed to scare us into supporting war on Iran .
As Gonzales rides off into the sunset , the significant questions are who will take his place and how that choice will facilitate Bush ’s occupation of Iraq and attack on Iran .
One name that ’s been floated for Bush ’s third attorney general is Joe Lieberman , the “ independent ” senator from Connecticut .
Lieberman , who advocates the use of military force against Iran , was the only person Bush quoted in his August 28 speech to the American Legion .
Bush called Iran “ the world ’s leading state sponsor of terrorism ” and pledged to “ confront Tehran ’s murderous activities . ”
Gonzales greased the Bush / Cheney wheels for torturing in violation of the Geneva Conventions , illegally spying on Americans , and purging disloyal Bushies .
Similarly , Lieberman would ensure the Justice Department mounts a vigorous defense of a war of aggression against Iran .
And Bush would get a two - fer : Connecticut ’s Republican governor would appoint a Republican to fill Lieberman ’s seat , returning control of the Senate to the GOP .
A Republican - controlled Senate would direct the agenda , thereby furthering the Bush / Cheney plan .
Lieberman is closely affiliated with American Israeli Public Affairs Committee .
“ AIPAC leverages its power by an alliance with the Christian Right , which has adopted a bizarre ideology of ‘ Christian Zionism , ' ” according to University of Michigan professor Juan Cole .
“ It holds that the sooner the Palestinians are ethnically cleansed , the sooner Christ will come back .
Without millions of these Christian Zionist allies , ” Cole added , “ AIPAC would be much less influential and effective . ”
During the 2004 election , a 100 % “ AIPAC voting record ” was Lieberman ’s litmus test for an acceptable presidential candidate .
As the House of Representatives was on the verge of passing a resolution that would ’ve required Bush to consult Congress before attacking Iran , the AIPAC lobby stopped it in its tracks .
Bush ’s WMD - hyping against Iran is dÃ©ja vu in the run-up to Operation Iraqi Disaster , where he played loose and fast with the truth about Iraq ’s alleged WMDs .
His statement that a nuclear Iran could put the region “ under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust ” conjures up his images of a “ mushroom cloud ” in the hype - up to Iraq .
How inconvenient for Bush that the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) just found Iran ’s uranium enrichment program is operating well below capacity and is nowhere near producing significant amounts of nuclear fuel .
The IAEA report says Iran “ has been providing the agency with access to declared nuclear materials , and has provided the required nuclear material accountancy reports in connection with declared nuclear material and facilities . ”
Iran and IAEA agreed on a plan with a step - by - step timetable of cooperation to settle unresolved issues .
The agreement said there were “ no other remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran ’s past nuclear program and activities , ” and characterized the accord as “ a significant step forward . ”
“ This is the first time Iran is ready to discuss all the outstanding issues which triggered the crisis in confidence , ” said IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei .
“ I ’m clear at this stage you need to give Iran a chance to prove its stated goodwill .
Sanctions alone , I know for sure , are not going to lead to a durable solution ”
In 2003 , when Dr. ElBaradei reported there was no evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program , the White House was not pleased .
And as Saddam Hussein became more cooperative with the weapons inspector , Bush became “ infuriated , ” according to Bob Woodward .
Bush ’s vow , “ We will confront this danger before it is too late , ” is the Iran incarnation of his illegal preemptive war doctrine , which he inaugurated in Iraq .
In a clear signal he is seeking regime change in Iran , Bush called for “ an Iran whose government is accountable to its people , instead of leaders who promote terror and pursue the technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons . ”
Barnett Rubin reported on Global Affairs blog that one of the leading neo-conservative institutions has “ instructions ” from Dick Cheney ’s office to “ roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day ; it will be coordinated with the American Enterprise Institute , the Wall Street Journal , the Weekly Standard , Commentary , Fox , and the usual suspects .
It will be heavy sustained assault on the airwaves , designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained .
Evidently they do n’t think they ’ll ever get majority support for this – they want something like 35 - 40 percent support , which in their book is ‘ plenty . ' ”
Bush / Cheney created the White House Iraq Group ( WHIG ) to lead a propaganda campaign to bolster public support for war with Iraq .
The White House decided to wait until after Labor Day of 2002 to kick off WHIG ’s mission .
Chief of staff Andrew Card explained , “ From a marketing point of view , you do n’t introduce new products in August . ”
Five years later , they ’re marketing a new and even more dangerous product – war with Iran .
British military historian Corelli Barnett says “ an attack on Iran would effectively launch World War III . ”
Our military spending has reached $ 1 billion every 2 - 1 / 2 days and we are borrowing $ 2 - 1/2 billion per day .
Bush is mortgaging our children ’s future security and wealth .
We have lost more than 3,700 soldiers in Iraq and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died .
We have already seen how easily Congress caves in to AIPAC .
It ’s up to the people .
As Noam Chomsky said , “ The most effective barrier to a White House decision to launch a war [ on Iran ] is the kind of organized popular opposition that frightened the political - military leadership enough in 1968 that they were reluctant to send more troops to Vietnam . ”

SoundExchange , the music industry 's digital - royalty collection agency , has been on a roll .
A federal appeals court recently rejected a plea from webcasters to postpone the deadline for a new royalty scheme that sets the stage for SoundExchange to begin levying billions of dollars from internet radio stations in the coming decades .
It already collects a tidy sum from satellite radio and now it has set its sights on U.S. terrestrial radio stations , which currently pay no broadcast performance royalties .
If it wins there , its power could grow exponentially .
This reflects a well - known law of any bureaucracy :
Once authority is created , it works inevitably to expand its sphere of influence , grabbing for more power and bigger budgets .
With each success , its appetite only grows .
Knowing well the dangers , legislators sought to restrict SoundExchange 's ability to spend the money it collects on behalf of artists and labels .
Section 114( g ) ( 3 ) of the Copyright
Act explicitly limits how the nonprofit can spend the money it collects , approving just three carefully circumscribed activities :
" ( A ) the administration of the collection , distribution , and calculation of the royalties ; " ( B ) the settlement of disputes relating to the collection and calculation of the royalties ; and
" ( C ) the licensing and enforcement of rights with respect to the making of ephemeral recordings and performances subject to licensing under section 112 and this section , including those incurred in participating in negotiations or arbitration proceedings under section 112 and this section , except that all costs incurred relating to the section 112 ephemeral recordings right may only be deducted from the royalties received pursuant to section 112 . "
So it came as quite a surprise when a source familiar with SoundExchange told me on condition of anonymity that the group is engaged in lobbying and public relations activities , in apparent violation of the law cited above .
A little fact - checking showed that SoundExchange registered the MusicFirstCoalition.org domain on May 9 , 2007 ; that it is a member of the organization ; and that SoundExchange supports musicFIRST financially , although it has not disclosed the extent of its spending .
( When asked about it , SoundExchange spokesperson Richard Ades called that information " proprietary . " )
Here 's what 's not proprietary :
The musicFIRST Coalition ( Fairness In Radio Starting Today ) is a public relations group that launched on June 14 , 2007 with the sole mission of implementing a sound recording performance royalty on terrestrial radio stations .
It is comprised of labels , managers and artists , including Hall & Oates , Jay - Z , Celine Dion and various artists ' and labels ' organizations , including the RIAA .
SoundExchange is listed as a sponsor on the homepage of the organization 's web site .
Asked about the legality of the lobbying expenditures , SoundExchange Executive Director John Simson dodged the question .
" Clearly the Broadcasters ( CQ ) will do or say anything so as not to pay artists for their work , " he wrote in an e-mail .
" We welcome a full and open debate before Congress on ending the unfair free ride given over - the - air radio and the granting to artists the long overdue right to be paid for their recordings when they are played . "
Michael Huppe , general counsel for SoundExchange , was more helpful on the legal question .
He said the funding was a legitimate use of its members ' money .
" Funding provided by SoundExchange to musicFIRST is authorized by copyright owners and performers who have chosen to become members of SoundExchange .
These contributions come only from our members and not from non-member royalties , and were unanimously approved by the SoundExchange board , " Huppe replied when asked about its support of musicFIRST .
In the end , however , SoundExchange could not point to a specific statute that allows them to contribute to musicFIRST .
Jessica Litman , a law professor at the University of Michigan , could not point to any legal grounds for SoundExchange 's move , saying , " I 'm not aware of any statute that authorizes the contribution . "
Shoshana Zisk , a music attorney in San Francisco , said , " Upon reading Copyright Act Section 114 ( g ) ( 3 ) , it would appear that funding a lobbying or PR organization ( such as musicFIRST ) is a violation of this provision . "
Whether or not SoundExchange 's lobbying efforts prove to be illegal , its presence as an advocate in this debate undercuts its role as neutral administrator of royalty fees set and approved by the Copyright Royalty Board .
Artists and labels well deserve compensation for radio performance broadcasts .
The United States is one of the few countries that exempts radio from these fees ( music authors and publishers alone get paid ) , a tribute to the power and political muscle of the industry .
That power is now fading , in part due to the rise of the internet , and so radio giants like Clear Channel seem vulnerable for the first time in decades .
Yet SoundExchange 's interest in the outcome is as clear as the interest of the artists and labels it represents .
If new fees are approved for terrestrial radio and SoundExchange is appointed to administer those fees , it will instantly become a much bigger player in the music industry .
Given that it already has expertise in collecting similar fees for satellite and internet play , SoundExchange stands a good chance of winning this appointment .
With more power would come greater status and bigger paychecks for its officers and directors .
Even if the agency were only acting in the interests of artists and labels , it would appear to have a direct stake in the fight .
And that creates the appearance of a conflict of interest , whether or not there is in fact a conflict .
That 's why Congress intended to keep SoundExchange out of the lobbying business .
In keeping with the spirit of the law , SoundExchange should immediately sever its ties to musicFirst and any other lobbying group it funds or assists , and fulfill its role as a neutral administrator of fees .
You knew that they would show up eventually , but who knew they would be in the form of lollipops ?
Hello Kitty condoms :
These are a quite disturbing development for reasons that should be obvious to anyone , but since Hello Kitty fanatics do n’t usually follow the rules when it comes to the obvious , I will expound on this a bit .
1 . The last place I want to see Hello Kitty when I look down is there .
In fact , just the thought of something like that occurring is sending shivers down my spine …
2 . While putting anything on related to Hello Kitty goes against my better judgement , putting on something that ’s Hello Kitty there goes well beyond any Hello Kitty Hell I can even imagine .
3 . I really ca n’t think of anything that would be quite as unmanly as having your significant other compliment how cute “ it ” looks with a Hello Kitty condom wrapped around it ( which is the likely reaction of a Hello Kitty fanatic ) .
4 . When a guy puts a condom on , he pretty much has a single thought on his mind .
This does not include putting on different Hello Kitty condoms as if it were a fashion show .
5 . Having to stop multiple times in the middle of doing it because the Hello Kitty fanatic wants to see “ how cute it is ” again and again pretty much would take the joy and pleasure out of the evening .
6 . Being sent to the couch in the Hello Kitty sleeping bag because I was n’t enthusiastic enough about this newest Hello Kitty item would pretty much top off the way I would expect the evening to end .
As you can see , the existence of Hello Kitty condoms is pretty much a nightmare for any guy that has a relationship with a Hello Kitty fanatic and something that definitely is going to cause the fires in Hello Kitty Hell to reach new levels …
Sent in by betty who deserves punishment far worse than even I can imagine , for even thinking that showing my wife the existence of these could in any way be a good idea …
Update : More Hello Kitty condoms :

Do n't Make Me Go Back , Mommy : A Child 's Book about Satanic Ritual Abuse
Mommy looks worn and maybe a bit long of tooth .
Her hair is flaccid and shoulder - length .
We 'll come back to this .
Mommy looks worn and maybe a bit long of tooth .
Her hair is flaccid and shoulder - length .
We 'll come back to this .
I have highlighted the uneaten chicken .
Per 1980s etiquette , I feel the need to mention that children in Africa are starving ...
Mommy seems to have recovered from the other evening .
Her hair is shiny , longer , and she 's much prettier than she was .
And do I spy a facelift ?
The people who run the daycare are an insidious - looking bunch .
Patriotic , though .
Check out the one with the bun in the oven .
That bun is for Satan .
[ It was widely believed at the time that women in satanic cults were having babies for sacrifice to Satan . ]
Allison 's got a pretty unhappy drawing there .
Could those be bunny ears ?
Carnations may also be evil .
Bam !
Here are the bunnies .
Red eyes , probably for Satan , too .
Also , as a good rule of thumb , do n't let Bernadette Peters watch your children .
Finally , that " magic juice " probably either has drugs or semen in it , according to theories at the time .
And we 're performing satanic rituals .
There are two pentagrams on the table / altar , as well as , confusingly , a cross .
Personally , I like the teeny hangman 's noose .
During the hysteria , various children reported stories of hundreds of infants being ritually murdered ; none were ever found .

Oop , we 're back in the classroom .
The girl in the purple outfit does not seem to have enjoyed the field trip .
Also note the stuffed bunny .
Did your child react to it ?
Seek professional help .

I wonder if the daycare has a " dark hair only " hiring policy .
And Allison got married .
No child has ever played that game before , so Mommy should be worried , but she 's looking kind of blase .
Pretty , though .
I love the look on this kid 's face .
The movie star thing is from a rhyme popular among school - aged children in the 1980s .
Something along the lines of , " I know what you are / You 're a naked movie star ! "
This was taken by the psychological community as proof of abuse of children , and any child confessing to knowing or having heard of " naked movie star " was considered as having been abused .

Wanna take a guess as to what ' bad shots ' means ?
Poor dog .
Apparently , these are all signs that your child has been abused .
I like the forlorn piece of bunny fluff at the bottom .
I have no idea what 's on Allison 's ankle .
Apparently , she 's been taught some pretty severe lessons in autonomy at the daycare .
I have no idea where any of this stuff comes from .
Tell you what , though , Mommy looks amazing !
The longer this horror goes on , the better she looks .
Let 's have a flashback :
Pre-Mommy Post - Mommy
Pre-Mommy Post - Mommy
Time to involve the authorities ...
If there 's one thing I 've learned about SRA , it 's great for your hair and skin .
Or she could be terrified about being in a courtroom after being interrogated by the police ...
Police and therapists who " interviewed " children often used coercive techniques .
In one documented case ,
a child was told that he was n't as smart as other children , after denying anything happened .
Bunnies = bad
Horses = good
Bunnies = badHorses = good
We 're going treat you differently , though .
We 're going treat you differently , though .
I think those are rabbit tracks ...
Is Daddy more satanic than we knew ?
I think those are rabbit tracks ...
Is Daddy more satanic than we knew ?
Allison did n't even learn to stay in the lines at daycare ... worthless .
And she is alone with another dark - haired woman !
Have these parents learned nothing ?
Oh , but we can see that she 's married .
It 's probably okay then .
What in the fuck is that black thing ?
Bunnies = bad
Crab / Spider thing = good ?
Also , the therapist is having Allison play with anatomically correct dolls to learn where she was touched .
Investigators were surprised at how much the children knew about anatomy .
Why might that be ?
Could n't you just actually talk to your child ?
You 're standing right there , Mommy .
Could n ' tjust actually talk to your child ?
You 're standing right there , Mommy .
Lookin ' good , though .
And candy , and Christmas presents , and toys , and ....
But not brave .
Mommy has to go now .
Listen to the cassette .

Grandpa 's got a bit of a leer going on there .
Kittens = good

3 . " To understand ritual abuse , you must thing in opposites , i.e. , good is bad , wrong is right , etc .
4 . " Be sensitive in talking about God , and do not force the child to participate in taking communion , which the child may associate with blood .
Keep in mind that the abusers have sometimes worn clerical robes during the abuse .
8 . " Some especially frightening experience for the child are : Halloween , the child 's sixth birthday , nighttime , bathrooms , certain foods that remind the child of particular rituals .
isWe open our scene at dinner : But enough about that - on to the ... Lots of stuff to look at in this picture :
We appear to have moved on because now we 're in the country somewhere !
Yay !
Therapy time !
Or is it ?
The last two pages are ten pieces of advice to the parents .
They 're not very interesting visually and difficult to read , so I 'm actually going to transcribe the best ones :
This book is amazing , then .
What about Catholic children ?
Can we tell them it 's The Body instead ?
Um , okay .
Not sure where this comes from either .
I 'm tired now .
If you want to see the actual book , I now have a copy ... Best Book Ever .
Why did this brilliant MIT student jump to his death ?
Thursday , May 21 , 1998 By JOSEPH MALLIA
Alone in a 15th - floor classroom , MIT sophomore Philip C. Gale drew a physics formula on a blackboard showing what happens when a body falls from a great height .
Then he slammed a chair through the classroom window and jumped more than 200 feet to his death , as horrified students watched from a plaza below .
But the blackboard message - and a mysterious tape recording - gave no clues to why the brilliant 19 - year - old chose such a dramatic ending two months ago to a life full of promise .
``Because of the public nature of Philip 's act , this has been an acute time of introspection , '' MIT Associate Dean Robert Randolph said .
As evidence emerged that Gale was suffering from depression , students and staff wondered aloud about why the high - pressure school 's psychological safety net did n't save him .
And friends raised questions about whether his upbringing in a controversial religion - the Church of Scientology - played a part in his suicide .
Gale had quit the church .
Even so , he chose to kill himself on March 13 , the church 's most important annual holiday marking the birthday of the late Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard .
Accepted at MIT at age 15 , Gale excelled even on a campus that is a magnet for the world 's technological elite .
Fluent in 20 computer programming languages , he took a break from MIT , and before his 17th birthday earned stock options worth perhaps $ 1 million - and a $ 70,000 annual salary - writing software at the Los Angeles - based Internet company EarthLink Network Inc .
The 7:27 p.m. Friday suicide was a shock to students passing the busy Green Building plaza or in the East Campus dorm , who saw the breaking glass , the chair falling and Philip Gale plummeting to the concrete below .
``A dozen or so people were there , some crying , some running to get help , some running to attempt medical aid , '' said sophomore Matthew S. Munsey , 19 , who sang Bach in the MIT Choir with Gale .
The suicide provoked intense debate on campus , and on the Internet newsgroup alt.religion .
scientology , about whether it was linked to Gale 's Scientology upbringing .
And Munsey soon created a Web page titled ``Who is Philip Gale ? '' raising questions about a link between Scientology and the suicide .
According to Gale 's friends , depression - or what he called ``boredom '' or a ``void '' - had long been masked by his irreverent sense of humor .
The tall , skinny overachiever with close - cropped , bright red hair began to see his computer and music classwork as ``inane . ''
He spent hours banging on a drum set and playing computer games .
Gale was still coming to terms with the sudden death of his father two years ago - at age 47 - of a heart attack , said Lauren McLeod , 22 , a college friend who is now a reporter for the Concord Journal .
`` He was having a really hard time dealing with it , and with how his family reacted to it .
He had drifted apart from his family since his father 's death , '' McLeod said .
And Gale had recently paid one visit to a therapist .
`` He was talking about how he'd seen a psychologist that week , and thought the guy was a complete dip - - - -, '' roommate Jason Politi said at Gale 's memorial service .
He rarely talked about quitting the Church of Scientology , where his mother , Marie Gale , remained a prominent church official , the friends said .
Scientology 's critics , however , soon pointed a condemning finger at the mother , a leader in the church 's highly visible campaign against psychiatry and the antidepressive drug Prozac .
``Within 12 hours of the memorial service , an elaborate conversation had emerged on the Internet , raising questions about Marie Gale 's work against psychiatry , '' Dean Randolph said .
`` In the Internet conversation the question came up , `Could a mother who hated psychiatry help a son like Philip who needed help ?
And how fit was she to be a mother ? ' '' the dean said .
Randolph said the criticism of Marie Gale was misguided .
A student newspaper , The Thistle , published an obituary describing the distress Philip Gale may have been facing alone .
`` He found himself caught between two worlds and terribly alone in the center , '' the obituary said .
Gale was going through an ``existential depression , '' Brian Ladner , a friend and former EarthLink co-worker , said in a telephone interview from California .
``Leaving Scientology was a traumatic experience .
He was brought up thinking it was the only way , '' Ladner said .
While family and lifelong friends remained in the church , Gale set out on his own .
`` He saw through Scientology , or saw past it .
And he did n't understand why others did n't see past it , '' Ladner said .
`` But even though he left Scientology , who knows whether it left him ? '' the friend asked .
Philip
Gale spent his early childhood in Clearwater , Fla. , the church 's Mecca .
At age 8 he went away to Scientology 's top boarding school for children , the Delphian Academy in Oregon , where he graduated at 14 .
Marie Gale first brought Philip and his younger sister , Elizabeth , into the public eye when she defended Scientology in a 1991 St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times series of articles about the church .
The articles contained allegations that in the Church of Scientology , children - considered ``adults in small bodies '' - are emotionally and physically neglected , while families are destroyed when one member leaves and church policy forces the others to ``disconnect '' from the defector .
Church officials denied the accusations .
``Considering my parents and grandmother , my children are fourth - generation Scientologists , '' Marie Gale told the Florida newspaper .
``I attribute much of the success and happiness in my life '' to Scientology , she said .
Neither of her children were forced into Scientology , but both studied its methods deeply , she said .
By age 12 Philip was being trained with the church 's E- meter - a device like a lie detector that shows emotional reactions - to help him in school , Marie Gale said .
The Gale family was highly regarded in the church , having donated at least $ 100,000 .
Marie Gale was also one of Scientology 's top students , reaching the highest level - ``Operating Thetan VIII '' - on its ``Bridge to Total Freedom . ''
Then in 1993 while working in Utah as a spokeswoman for Scientology 's anti-psychiatry group , Citizens ' Commission for Human Rights , she had a heated public exchange with psychiatrists in the pages of The Salt Lake Tribune daily newspaper on the subject of anti-depressant drugs .
Marie Gale proposed ``a national war on anti-depressant medications , particularly Prozac , '' Dr. Noel C. Gardner , president of the Utah Psychiatric Association , wrote in an Oct. 10 , 1993 opinion piece .
``Ms. Gale 's letter belies a serious lack of understanding of the nature of major depressive disorders , '' Dr. Gardner wrote .
`` The lifetime risk of successfully completing suicide in individuals with recurrent depression is 15 percent , '' the psychiatrist wrote .
Marie Gale declined Herald requests for an interview .
At an MIT chapel memorial service for Philip Gale on March 20 , his mother spoke to the mourners .
` ` I'm Mom , '' Marie Gale said , weeping .
`` He had the ability to take something and just walk it out .
I think that 's what he did . . .
He outlogic - ed himself , '' she said .
After the memorial , Philip 's mother borrowed an MIT Media Lab computer to write an Internet message accusing the Boston Herald - along with Scientology 's Internet critics - of pushing her son toward suicide .
She said her son had been upset by a February interview with a Herald reporter who was preparing a series of articles on Scientology .
The articles , published March 1 - 5 , contained allegations that the church enriched itself using fraud and deceit .
In a brief telephone interview with the Herald , Philip Gale made it clear he was no longer a practicing church member and in fact disliked Scientology .
Gale spoke in a breezy , offhand tone .
Though he did not sound angry , his comments were laced with profanities .
``My father is dead , but my mom is a Scientologist .
Everyone thinks it 's a really quirky religion , but they 're normal parents .
They 're normal people , '' the youth said .
He summed up his view of Scientology : ``I think in general it's not the best practice .
It did n't help me at all . ''
And he described himself as ``an atheist , or agnostic . ''
He was asked specifically about two topics related to Scientology 's recruitment activities in Massachusetts : its learn - to - read techniques , known as ``Study Technology ' ' ; and its detoxification method , called the ``Purification Rundown , '' which requires exercise , long saunas and huge doses of niacin .
``Study Tech ?
My personal opinion of Study Tech is that it's a worthless formulation , a very mechanical thing , '' Philip Gale said .
And about the Purification Rundown , he said : `` In my opinion it 's all ridiculous .
You run , you go in a sauna , it 's all very pseudoscientific . ''
For months , Gale had been despondent , and recently had talked of suicide , friends said .
`` He mentioned it a couple of weeks ago .
He had considered it and dismissed it , '' his fraternity brother Eruc Hu told the Crimson newspaper at Harvard University .
`` He was just bored with life and I guess just depressed that he was destined to be bored for the rest of his life , '' Hu said .
Scientologists are taught that if they abandon the church they will soon kill themselves or have a serious illness or accident , said Flo Conway , a New York - based researcher and author on the mental effects of training and rituals in new religious groups .
`` There is a tremendous amount of suggestion that if you leave Scientology , you will commit suicide , '' said Conway , who considers Scientology a destructive religious group .
Former Scientologists had the highest rates of persistent fear , sleeplessness , suicidal and self - destructive tendencies , violent outbursts , hallucinations and delusions , compared to ex-members of other religious groups - including the Hare Krishna movement and the Unification Church - Conway and her colleague Jim Siegelman found in a University of Oregon study .
``Somebody raised from birth to age 14 in Scientology would be deeply imprinted , deeply affected .
Their technology throttles the brain and the central nervous system , '' Conway said .
After a Cambridge police investigation and an autopsy , Gale 's death was ruled a suicide .
In his off - campus Central Square apartment , a friend said , he left a brief note saying , in essence : `` Do n't grieve . ''
Nor did Gale leave clues to his state of mind on a cassette tape recorder left running in the classroom he jumped from - a newly bought digital recorder with a $ 1,000 - plus price tag still attached , a police source said .
`` You can hear him walking around the room .
You can hear the window being smashed , but no voice , '' said the source .
The blackboard diagram Gale drew was pure mathematics , ``a mass - velocity formulation explaining what happens when a mass goes out a window , '' Dean Randolph said .
While Gale 's suicide was unexpected , his method was n't .
`` It was typical Phil .
It 's so like him to have planned a show , '' said an ex-girlfriend , Wellesley College student Christine Hrul , 22 .
`` He was so careful with things in his life , so methodical , '' she said .
Gale was n't even 17 when he left EarthLink with options to buy at under $ 10 tens of thousands of shares .
Those shares shot up to 53 5/8 by March 13 , not long after the Internet company announced a partnership with Sprint Corp .
`` If he was n't a millionaire then he was well into it , '' his former co-worker Brian Ladner said .
But Gale , who often dressed in green khaki pants and a ``grungy '' shirt , did n't care about money except to buy computer equipment and drums , the friend said .
Now , months later , an impromptu memorial still marks the spot where Philip Gale fell .
On a lightpost , friends arrayed an unopened packet of Camel cigarettes , a stuffed animal , flowers , a candle , a wooden hammer , and a eulogy : `` As misunderstood as he seemed in life , so he remains in the afterlife . ''

BEIJING , Nov 21 ( Reuters ) - Thousands of people in northeastern China have protested on the streets and surrounded government offices demanding help recovering money from a get - rich - quick scheme to raise ants to make an aphrodisiac tonic .
Hundreds of anti-riot troops and police in Shenyang , capital of Liaoning province , were deployed to stop protesters reaching the provincial government and Communist Party headquarters , residents said on Wednesday .
The irate investors from across Liaoning , a rustbelt province striving to attract investment , have demonstrated in Shenyang since Monday and sporadic clashes with police have broken out , they said .
Several thousand protesters gathered near the provincial government offices on Wednesday , a resident told Reuters by telephone .
The investors -- many of them laid - off workers or farmers -- put their savings into Shenyang 's Yilishen Group for a scheme in which they raised ants to provide ingredients for a health tonic promising an aphrodisiac boost .
For every 10,000 yuan ( $ 1,350 ) they paid the company as " deposit " , investors were promised a dividend of 3,250 yuan .
The tonic was promoted on television by Zhao Benshan , the country 's best - known comic who specialises in playing innocent bumpkins with a northeastern twang .
But since October , the group has twice delayed payment of dividends , fuelling investor fears that it was on the brink of bankruptcy or that the government might have frozen its funds .
" We strongly demand the government offer a way out for Yilishen ! " read a banner held by protesters as they marched along a Shenyang street .
A photo of the banner was posted on Internet and blog sites .
China has seen rising protests from farmers and disgruntled workers as inequality and corruption stoke popular resentment
The unusual origin of this latest uproar was a reminder that even as China 's economy booms , there are pitfalls that can spark discontent from citizens eager for a share of wealth .
Chinese media have said the scheme collected more than 10 billion yuan from hundreds of thousands of Liaoning residents .
USELESS RUSE ?
Some local reports have said the ants were a useless ruse for an illegal scam , but the group has survived several probes in the past eight years and investors had previously received their dividends on time , protesters said .
As they looked for reassurance , panicked investors have turned their ire on the government .
" If Yilishen goes bankrupt , the government will be the chief culprit , " said a message that appeared briefly on domestic Chinese Web sites before it was removed .
" The government will be drinking our blood . "
A Shenyang resident told Reuters that about 1,000 people had collected in front of the company 's head office on Wednesday .
Repeated calls to the office by Reuters went unanswered .
Investors said the group 's good relations with the government and its commercials on state television had convinced them Yilishen was legitimate .
" It has been out there for eight years and the government has given the company and the manager so many honours .
We thought there must n't be any problem , " investor Li Dechun told Reuters .
He said he had poured more than 200,000 yuan into the scheme .
A spokesman for the Liaoning provincial government said officials had been talking to the protesters , and the company 's failure to pay dividends was not due to any government action .
" Most of the investors are from the lower class of society .
Some have threatened to take more radical actions , such as blocking trains at the railway station , " a local resident surnamed Cong told Reuters .
Online discussions about the protests and the ant scheme were quickly removed from Web sites , as were recent news reports about Yilishen .
The Group 's Web site was also shut , announcing " service unavailable " .

Gaming is increasingly popular among China 's youth
Since its launch eight days ago , the game , " Incorruptible Fighter " , is reported to have been downloaded more than 100,000 times .
The game was devised by a regional government in east China to highlight the problems of corrupt officialdom .
China has been hit recently by a number of high - profile cases of corruption .
The former head of the country 's food and drug watchdog was executed last month after being convicted of taking bribes .
Last week , the Communist Party 's former leader in Shanghai was expelled from the party , and may now face charges , after he was linked to a pensions fund scandal that has also implicated other senior officials .
President Hu Jintao has vowed to take action against officials found guilty of corruption , which has become rampant since market reforms opened the economy in the 1980s .
' Sense of achievement '
" Incorruptible Fighter " allows players to get ahead by killing and torturing corrupt officials , while assisting the upstanding ones .
Along the way , they are led through a series of moral challenges before entering a corruption - free paradise .
Government officials should be the ones getting anti-corruption education , not local youngsters
Wang Xiongjun
Peking University
The characters in the game are based on well - known figures from Chinese history .
" We want game players to have fun but also learn about fighting corruption , folklore and history , " Qiu Yi , an official in charge of the project , told the China Daily newspaper .
The paper also quoted one gamer called Sun as saying : " I feel a great sense of achievement when I punish lots of evil officials . "
The game appeared to have become a victim of its own success .
A note on the site on Thursday said it had crashed due to overwhelming demand .
" The game is currently under hardware and software updating as the online players have exceeded the limit of the server and the programme , " the notice read .
But some are questioning the game 's target audience .
" Government officials should be the ones getting anti-corruption education , not local youngsters , " Wang Xiongjun of Peking University told the China Daily .

It is a pleasure to be back on a familiar platform .
Familiarity in this case , however , is a disadvantage since I may be in danger of repeating what I might have articulated on previous occasions !
Many years back the British philosopher Gilbert Ryle had drawn attention to the dangers of expressions that are ' couched in syntactical form improper to the facts recorded ' .
This observation is relevant to our subject today since the theme of the conference begs definition and delineation .
Unanimity of perception , of course , would have been ideal ; since that is lacking , the two operative terms - ' emerging ' and ' security concerns ' - need to be spelt out .
Centrality has been the curse of West Asia .
It is hardly necessary to remind this audience that external security concerns pertaining to the region have been around for over a century .
Writing in 1917 , Marriott , a British Scholar , defined the Eastern Question as ' the problem of filling up the vacuum created by the gradual disappearance of the Turkish Empire from Europe ' .
In May 1917 , Britain and France used the Sykes - Picot Agreement to acquire ' the right of priority in enterprises and local loans ' in designated Arab areas of the Ottoman Empire and to deny any facilities to a third Power in the Arabian Peninsula and the Red Sea .
In a parallel move , the secret Balfour Declaration of November 1917 carried the commitment for the ' establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people ' .
A decade earlier on August 31 , 1907 , the Anglo - Russian Entente was signed , dividing Iran into three zones only one of which was under Iranian control .
' The Iranians ' , in Professor Nikkie Keddie 's words , ' were neither consulted on the agreement nor informed of the terms ' .
That exercise , of division and occupation , was repeated during World War II .

US , Israel refuse to cooperate with inquest into Syria strike
Our investigative team is low on funds -- this story was paid for by reader donations .
Just over 900 readers needed to close the gap !
UN nuclear watchdog has no evidence Syria had nuclear facility
The International Atomic Energy Agency - the United Nations nuclear watchdog - has not been able to conduct an investigation into the events surrounding the Sept. 6 Israeli bombing of a Syrian military installation because neither the Bush administration nor Israel are cooperating .
A diplomatic source close to the Vienna based IAEA told Raw Story that both the United States and Israel have been approached by the organization requesting supporting evidence of a nuclear reactor which media sources have cited , based on anonymous sources in both governments , as the reason for the Israeli strike .
The source also explained that the satellite footage , which the IAEA obtained through commercial channels for lack of any credible evidence ,  does not show a nuclear reactor in the early construction phase .
Another source , close to the IAEA , who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic , told RAW STORY last week that based on satellite imagery , evidence that " it was nuclear related is shaky " and pointed out that even basic security for such a facility - such as " security fences " - is missing .
Some IAEA experts have privately opined that the facility - located between the cities of Hama and Dayr az - Zawr in the Northeastern part of Syria - may have been " no more than a workshop for the pumice mining industry along the banks of the Euphrates . "
Both individuals independently confirmed that the IAEA cannot conduct a formal investigation without the cooperation of either Israel or the United States , although both confirmed that the Syrian government is cooperating .
An IAEA spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Little is known about the attack
Little has been publicly revealed about the attack , which neither the US nor Israel has discussed .
Israel did confirm in October that the bombing had taken place .
According to a report in the Guardian on Sept. 16 , " Was Israeli raid a dry run for an attack on Iran ? " the Israeli air raid was substantial and was code - named Operation Orchard .
" Far from being a minor incursion , the Israeli overflight of Syrian airspace through its ally , Turkey , was a far more major affair involving as many as eight aircraft , including Israel 's most ultra-modern F - 15s and F - 16s equipped with Maverick missiles and 500 lb bombs , " the paper alleged .
" Flying among the Israeli fighters at great height was an ELINT - an electronic intelligence gathering aircraft . "
Although the mystery surrounding exactly what Israel hit in Syria continues , US intelligence sources have told RAW STORY it was not a nuclear armaments site .
In late September , Vincent Cannistraro - Director of Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan and Chief of Operations at the Central Intelligence Agency 's Counterterrorism Center under President George H. W. Bush - told Raw Story that what the Israelis hit was " absolutely not a nuclear weapons facility . "
According to another intelligence official , US intelligence " found no radiation signatures after the bombing , so there was no uranium or plutonium present . "
" We do n't have any independent intelligence that it was a nuclear facility - only the assertions by the Israelis and some ambiguous satellite photography from them that shows a building , which the Syrians admitted was a military facility , " the source added .
The diplomat close to the IAEA also confirmed the lack of radiation signatures , but explained that a reactor still under construction would not yet be fully loaded with the necessary materials and would not therefore give off any radiation .
The diplomat , however , again pointed to the satellite images , which do not show a nuclear reactor under construction in any case , explaining certain geometric configurations are necessary for such a facility , including certain height indicators as well as the lack of security such as armed guards .
Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , said he does n't believe claims that the site contained nuclear weapons .
" I 've heard so many versions of this story that I despair of ever knowing the real story , " Wilkerson said in response to an email query .
" However , I do not believe that the real story , if it is ever known , will have anything at all to do with nuclear weapons .
In short , I believe that [ former Bush UN ambassador John ] Bolton , [ Bush Deputy National Security Advisor Elliot ]
Abrams , et al. are lying again . "
Media reports diverge
Some intelligence officials have voiced strong criticism about alleged leaks to the press , which they say have distorted actual US and Israeli intelligence surrounding the strike .
One US intelligence official identified the Office of the Vice President and those close to Vice President Dick Cheney by name .
" The allegations that North Korea was helping to build a nuclear reactor have not been substantiated by US intelligence , " said this intelligence official , adding , " but that has n't stopped Dick Cheney and his minions at the NSC , Elliot Abrams and Steve Hadley , from leaking the information , which appears to be misleading in the extreme . "
Claims of a Syrian nuclear weapons program have gone from the strange to the bizarre .
In mid-September , the Sunday Times reported that the Israelis had been planning the operation since the spring of this year , after learning that Syria was attempting to buy a nuclear device from North Korea , and that at the time of the airstrike on Sept.
6 , the Israelis had managed to blow apart a " Syrian nuclear cache . "
Former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told the Times that he was worried about " North Korea and Iran outsourcing their nuclear programmes . "
In late September , the Times reported again that Israeli commandos had descended on the facility and obtained samples of nuclear materials .
Yet on Sept. 17 , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made what appeared to be a bizarre statement , considering the level of nuclear hysteria surrounding the Syrian incident .
" We want to make peace with everyone , " Olmert said .
" If the conditions allow for it , we are ready to make peace with Syria without preset conditions and without ultimatums . "
An October report on the ABC News website alleged that Mossad - Israeli intelligence - had either directly infiltrated the nuclear facility or turned a Syrian agent , and were thus able to acquire detailed photographs of the building , although no samples of nuclear materials were mentioned .
Also in October , the New York Times reported that a " partially constructed " nuclear reactor had been hit , although details " remain unclear , " and the veracity of the intelligence , which was based entirely on satellite imagery , was also uncertain .
There was no mention of spies infiltrating the facility or commandos obtaining samples of nuclear materials .
By Nov. 2 , the " partially constructed " nuclear reactor had morphed into a " suspected nuclear site " bombed by the United States , not Israel , with tactical nuclear weapons .
This was reported by Arabic news agency , Al Jazeera , and then picked up by the Jerusalem Post .
Some have pointed to Syria 's chemical weapons program as the likely target , and alleged attempts by Syria to weaponize a chemical warhead as the likely reason for the air raid .
Yet the secrecy and ever - changing stories from all three governments continue to obscure what actually occurred on September 6 .
Coupled with the lack of cooperation from the US and Israel with the IAEA , there is little chance the mystery will soon be unraveled .
What is known , however , is that no type of nuclear reactor or nuclear facility was hit , despite the many anonymous leaks to the press .

In life , there are some situations that beg for an apology , but there is no easy way to do it .
For example , suppose you are a senior citizen attending a funeral for a friend of the family .
You lean over the open casket and your false teeth plop out and clamp on the nose of the deceased .
You panic .
You do n’t think many people saw it happen , so you pluck the teeth off the stiff ’s nose and shove them back in your mouth as discreetly as possible .
Unbeknownst to you , someone caught the whole thing on video and it becomes a worldwide sensation on Youtube before the deceased is in the ground .
My point is there ’s no way to apologize for that situation .
For one thing , the guy who most needs the apology is dead .
And his widow probably is n’t in the mood for it .
I was thinking about this apology problem in respect to Iraq .
Whatever you think about the reasons for invading , everyone seems to agree that we botched the occupation , and the results have been a disaster for the Iraqi civilian population .
I feel like I owe them an apology for letting my idiot government screw them so thoroughly .
Your first reaction might be to explain all the rationalizations , and how war is messy , and it was really Saddam ’s fault , and blah , blah , blah .
But apologies do n’t work that way .
I could be wrong , but I think the Iraqi people who were minding their own business would like to hear an apology .
But how ?
My idiot government wo n’t apologize on my behalf .
And if I fire them and get a new idiot government , they wo n’t do it either , until fifty years are past .
That seems too late .
So here ’s my public apology to the Iraqi civilians who did nothing to deserve their current situation : I ’m sorry I trusted my idiot government to handle things correctly .
I should have been watching more closely .
To be honest , I never once thought to even ask if there was a post - war plan .
That was clearly a mistake on my part .
For that , I am sorry .
We ’re putting a lot of lives and money into making things right in Iraq , and that ’s appropriate .
But in addition , and for whatever small comfort it provides , I ’m genuinely sorry for my part in allowing things to get this bad .
On this occasion , the parents were a seemingly educated Californian couple , and I suspect they had learned parenting the way Manuel in Fawlty Towers had learned English - from a book .
The father sat like he was on Mount Rushmore , grim - faced but silent and ineffectual .
The mother maintained a tone of reasoned sympathy throughout the 45 - minute ordeal of wading through the menu for food that would not terrify her children and cajoling them to put some of it , any of it , into their mouths - an outcome fervently wished for by everyone , since it might halt the whines .
" I know you 're a little cranky , sweetheart , but you like grilled cheese , " she cooed .
" And if you eat a little more , then maybe the uptight English woman at the next table will stop gritting her teeth and sighing . "
Or that 's probably what she wanted to say .
Let me clarify : I consider myself a liberal parent .
I listen to my children , I value what they say , and try to explain pretty well everything .
And I too have an annoying habit of softening every reprimand with " darling " , " sweetheart " or " honey " .
But I firmly believe there is a limit to how much you can expect the world at large to put up with from your kids .
When ours get cranky in a restaurant , we explain and coo and cajole , but beyond a certain point we take them outside , away from other diners , and ask them politely to shut the hell up .
We came back from California to find the papers full of feral kid stories .
Well , parliament is n't sitting , and the mayoral election has n't hit its stride yet , so feral adults were harder to find , I suppose .
For many middle - class liberals , reading about teenage gang warfare and crime rates among the under - 10s gives both a feeling of helplessness and a comforting sense of distance .
We can shake our heads and click our tongues , and congratulate ourselves on what a good job we 're doing as parents .
But there are plenty of , admittedly less extreme , indicators that children from affluent backgrounds are being over - indulged and - yes , let 's use a really unfashionable word - spoilt .
An item on Woman 's Hour lamented the problem of teenagers being sleep - deprived because their rooms are chock full of tempting technological stimuli .
Why would you want to sleep when you could be online , being groomed by some 58 - year - old purporting to be a Danish schoolboy ?
However , the suggestion that perhaps the TV , the computer and Nintendo should be removed from the teenage bedroom was met by a gasp of disbelief .
When did we become so tyrannised by our young ?
In this paper I read that 424,000 pupils had stopped taking school meals since the Jamie Oliver - inspired healthy - eating drive took hold .
That means 424,000 sets of parents allowing children to buy a fat - filled takeaway .
Only yesterday we learned that only 2.5 % of children take enough exercise each week .
I hate to come over all Nancy Reagan , but if we really want to be good parents we have to relearn the word " no " .
Of course it can be " no , honey " , or " no , I 'm sorry " , and it must always , always be " no , and here 's the reason ... "
But we have to be bloody , bold and resolute about this .
It may be more than one small step from " Can I have a computer in my room ? " to " Can I have a gun ? " ; but if we do n't insist on good nutrition and plenty of sleep and unselfish behaviour , if we do n't seriously get firm , we too are neglecting our children .
Honey .

Exploring Leopard with DTrace
How to use DTrace for debugging and exploration
by Greg Miller
Introduction
Software is abstract and non-tactile by its very nature .
It can be difficult to see what it is doing and why it may be misbehaving .
To get a better view of software , we often use tools like gdb , leaks , lsof , and sc_usage , just to name a few .
We even still use " caveman debugging " techniques like recompiling the code with additional print statements .
A few years back , Sun Microsystems developed DTrace : a new and innovative way to trace running software on live systems .
DTrace enables developers and administrators to " see " what their code , and others ' code , is doing in a flexible and dynamic way .
With the release of Leopard , Apple has brought DTrace to Mac OS X .
This article will begin with a crash course in DTrace .
If you 're already a seasoned DTrace veteran , feel free to skip that section .
We will then move on to some examples of how to use DTrace by exploring our Leopard systems and discovering what makes them purr .
A crash course in DTrace
DTrace is a software tracing facility that can dynamically instrument code by modifying a program after it gets loaded into memory .
DTrace can be used on production systems with optimized binaries , without ever having to restart the application - let alone , recompile it !
Moreover , DTrace is not limited to tracing user - space applications like most other tracing tools , such as ktrace , strace , and truss .
Parts of the system , such as the kernel itself , that were previously off - limits to runtime inspection are now fair game .
And , since DTrace instruments code dynamically at runtime , it has zero overhead when not in use .
That said , DTrace will not , and should not , replace all of your other tools .
You 'll still want to use Shark , Sampler , ObjectAlloc , leaks , Instruments , etc. where they make sense .
And let 's not forget about good ol ' fashion thinking .
DTrace is not magic ; it 's just another tool ( albeit a powerful tool ) in your toolbox .
DTrace is often used to help answer questions about software , such as " Is function foo ever being called , and if so , by whom ? " , and " How much time is my code spending in the pwrite system call ? " .
However , you must know what to ask .
If you are tracing your own software , you probably have a good understanding of how it 's supposed to work , so coming up with the right questions might not be too difficult .
However , if you 're using DTrace to explore someone else 's software , it may be more difficult to ask the right questions .
But never fear ; we 'll see later that there are some very common questions that are generally good jumping off points .
As in life , the answer to one question often begets another .
Follow your nose !
Using DTrace is very much like surfing the web : your questions about the system are hyperlinks that when clicked will take you to another page full of new links / questions .
You interact with DTrace by writing small programs in the D programming language .
These D programs can be saved in text files and run like shell scripts , or they can stretched out right on the command line for quick , ad - hoc use ( or if you simply want to impress your friends ) .
An example D script that totals all the system calls made for each process on the system is shown in Listing 1 .
Listing 1 : syscalls_per_proc.d
Totals up all the system calls made for each process
syscall : : : entry { @[ execname ] = count ( ) ; }
When run for about 5 seconds on my laptop I got the following output :
$ sudo dtrace -s syscalls_per_proc.d dtrace : script ' syscalls_per_proc.d ' matched 427 probes ^C Quicksilver 1 Finder 2 Pages 2 DirectoryServic 3 fseventsd 3 mds 6 ntpd 21 WindowServer 22 mDNSResponder 24 dtrace 38 Terminal 85
We could have also specified the D script on the command line as follows :
$ sudo dtrace -n ' syscall : : : entry { @[execname ] = count ( ) }'
Key Concepts and the D Programming Language
The D programming language has syntax very similar to C's and should be very easy for C programmers to use .
The D program structure , however , is more akin to AWK's and is made up of one or more clauses of the following form .
probe descriptions / predicate / { action statements }
One of the key concepts in DTrace is that of a probe , which identifies a point ( or points ) of interest in the kernel or in a user process .
Probes are identified by their probe description , which is either a unique integer ID , or more commonly , a 4 - tuple written as provider : module : function : name .
Fields in a probe description may use shell - style globbing , and omitted fields are assumed to match everything .
For example , the probe description syscall : : read : entry identifies the beginning of the read system call by naming the syscall provider , any module , the read function , and the probename entry .
The probe description syscall : :* read : entry , however , identifies both the read and pread system calls .
You can see a list of many ( but not all ! ) of the probes on your system by running dtrace -l .
$ sudo dtrace -l | wc -l 40808
Each probe may be associated with an optional block of action statements that will be evaluated when the probe fires .
A probe may also have an optional predicate that must evaluate to true before the probe 's action statements will be called .
For example , the following will use the built - in variable execname and print the name of each process that calls read .
syscall : : read : entry { printf ( " %s
" , execname ) ; }
And the following will only print the names of processes that are reading from their standard input ( file descriptor 0 ) :
syscall : : read : entry / arg0 == 0/ { printf ( " %s
" , execname ) ; }
It is not always insightful to see a separate line of output each time a probe fires .
Instead , we may be interested in looking at the data in aggregate form .
For example , we could find the total number of bytes allocated by malloc by setting a probe at the entry to malloc , printing out the size argument ( arg0 ) , then post - processing the data to sum it up .
That would work .
But DTrace makes this much easier by using aggregating functions and data structures called aggregates .
In this way , I could see that Safari mallocs about 2.4MB on my machine when loading my website 's homepage .
$ sudo dtrace -n ' pid147 : : malloc:entry { @total = sum( arg0 ) }'
dtrace : description ' pid147::malloc:entry ' matched 2 probes
^C
2414468
Here 's how that DTrace script ( i.e. , the argument to - n ) breaks down :
The full " probe description " is pid147 :: malloc:entry , which uses the pid provider to set a probe at the entry of the malloc function in process ID 147 ( Safari )
We do not specify a predicate , so the action statements are always executed when the probe fires
The only action statement in this example is the use of the aggregating function sum , which totals the argument passed to malloc , and stores the result in the aggregate data structure named @total
Nothing is displayed until we hit ctrl-c ; at which point @total is displayed
A large part of writing useful D scripts is knowing what built - in variables and functions are available .
The following are a few of the more useful built - in D variables :
arg0 , ... , arg9 - The first 10 arguments to the function matching the probe
execname -
The name of the currently executing process
pid -
The process ID of the currently executing process
ppid -
The parent process ID of the currently executing process
probefunc -
The function name of the current probe description
And here are some of the more frequently used data recording functions :
trace ( ) - Evaluates its argument and outputs the result
printf ( ) - Like trace ( ) , but takes a C - style format string
stack ( ) -
Records a kernel stack trace
ustack ( ) - Records a user stack trace
DTrace Architecture
Users generally interact with DTrace through the dtrace ( 1 ) command , which is a generic front - end to the DTrace facility ( an alternative front - end is Instruments , which we will not cover in this article ) .
D programs get compiled in user - space and sent to the DTrace virtual machine in the kernel for execution .
In other words , the D scripts you write are sent into the kernel and run inside the kernel 's address space .
They do not run in the dtrace process , nor do they run in the target process you are trying to instrument .
This is important , and it is the reason we need DTrace functions like copyin and copyinstr , which are functions that copy data from user space into the kernel 's address space .
DTrace providers live in the kernel and can be thought of as plugins to the in - kernel DTrace framework .
They are responsible for creating probes by instrumenting various parts of the system .
The probes made available by a given provider can be listed using the dtrace command .
For example , the command dtrace - l -n proc : : : will list all the probes available from the proc provider .
The following are some of the providers available on Leopard and what they instrument .
syscall - System calls in the kernel
fbt ( Function Boundary Tracing ) - Functions in the kernel
proc -
Functions related to the process life cycle
mach_trap - Mach traps in the kernel
pid - C functions ( or individual instructions ) in user space
objc - Objective - C objects in user space
Figure 1 shows the relationship between some of the different components of DTrace .
Figure 1 . DTrace architecture
Exploring Leopard
Let us now look at a few examples of using DTrace to explore our Leopard system .
Note that in order to minimize line wrapping we use / dev/ stdin as the argument to dtrace -s , we type our D scripts right into the standard input , then close standard input by typing ctrl-d ( ^D ) .
Tracing Objective - C messages
Tracing system calls and other low - level functions can be fun and insightful , but it may also be too low - level for some situations .
Many of the great application frameworks on OS X are written in Objective - C , and it would be nice to trace them at that level .
Apple apparently agreed , and they equipped DTrace with a provider for tracing Objective - C messages .
The objc provider is very much like the pid provider , in that the provider name must include the process ID of the target process .
The objc provider exposes Objective - C class names as probe modules , and selector names as probe functions .
For example , the probe description objc123 : NSView : - is Flipped : entry would match the entry to the isFlipped instance method on the NSView class in process 123 .
Let 's try this out by watching what Safari does when it loads www.unixjunkie.net:
$ sudo dtrace -q -s / dev/stdin objc3447 ::: entry { printf ( " %s %s
" , probemod , probefunc ) ; } ^D dtrace : script '/ dev/ stdin ' matched 66888 probes ( ... TONS of output omitted ... )
NSConcreteNotification - recycle NSObject - retainCount NSCFString - release NSObject - release NSGarbageCollector +defaultCollector NSLock - lock NSThread +currentThread NSObject - hash NSCFArray - countByEnumeratingWithState:objects : count : NSLock - unlock (... ) ^C
That 's cool , but it 's a TON of information .
With a tool as powerful as DTrace , you can quickly find yourself with more data than you can grok .
In this case , we could lessen the output by sharpening our probe description to match only what we 're really interested in .
For example , if we were only interested in methods dealing with URL handling , we could use the probe description objc3447 : NSURL *:: entry .
This quickly cuts the 66,000 + probes down to a manageable 500 .
Another way to conquer this mountain of information is with an aggregating function .
For example , let 's say we 're now interested in how long these Objective - C messages take to complete .
We could figure this out using the following D script .
Listing 2 : objc_msg_times.d
This is a D script to quantize the running time of Objective - C messages .
We use the timestamp built - in D variable to record the entry time to the Objective - C method in a thread - local variable .
Upon the method 's return , we quantize the difference between the current timestamp and the start time .
$ target is a special D variable that evaluates to the PID of the process under inspection .
objc$target : :: entry { self -> start = timestamp ; } objc$target ::: return / self -> start / { @ = quantize ( timestamp - self -> start ) ; self -> start = 0 ; } $ sudo dtrace -s objc_msg_times.d -p 3447 dtrace : script ' objc_msg_times.d ' matched 136042 probes ^C value -------------
Distribution --------- count 1024 | 0 2048 |@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ 526082 4096 |@@@@@@@@@ 188440 8192 |@@@@ 84940 16384 |@ 22815 32768 | 6999 65536 | 464 131072 | 82 262144 | 33 524288 | 26 value
-------------
Distribution --------- count 1048576 | 13 2097152 | 9 4194304 | 3 8388608 | 5 16777216 | 0
This script introduces a couple new things : thread - local variables and the quantize function .
D allows you to save variables in thread - local storage by using the self -> syntax .
These variables will be available in other clauses that fire on the same thread .
We also use the built - in quantize aggregating function to build a power - of - two frequency distribution of the Objective - C messaging times ; this can be an incredibly powerful way to interpret the data collected by DTrace .
We see here that most of the Objective - C messages completed within 2048 - 4096 nanoseconds .
File activity
It can be enlightening to see which files are accessed on a system .
For example , you may see that Foo.app is frequently writing to some file , or maybe that Bar.app is calling stat ( 2 ) on a log file every 10 ms .
This information can help you debug your own programs , or perhaps better understand the system in general .
Below we use a small D script to print out the name of each file as it's opened .
$ sudo dtrace -s / dev / stdin syscall : : open * : entry { printf ( " %s %s " , execname , copyinstr ( arg0 ) ) ; } ^D dtrace : script '/ dev/stdin ' matched 3 probes CPU ID FUNCTION : NAME 0 17584 open:entry Finder /.vol/234881026/562669 0 17584 open:entry Finder /.vol/234881026/562669 1 17584 open:entry iChatAgent / Users/jgm/Library / Caches/... 0 17584 open:entry iChatAgent / Users/jgm/Library / Caches /... 1 17584 open:entry iChat / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks /... ^C
This script sets a probe at the entry to all system calls having names beginning with " open " .
DTrace tells us that our probe description matched three probes .
They are : open , open_extended , and open_nocancel .
Our action statement prints out the name of the process ( execname ) that caused the probe to fire , and the first argument ( arg0 ) to the function that matched the probe .
Notice that we need to use the copyinstr function here rather than just printing arg0 directly .
This is because D scripts execute in the kernel 's address space , but the pathname argument to open is stored in user space .
We could also modify our D script so that it shows us which files are accessed most often , as follows .
$ sudo dtrace -s / dev / stdin syscall : : open * : entry { @[ copyinstr ( arg0 ) ] = count ( ) ; } ^D dtrace : script '/ dev/stdin ' matched 3 probes ^C / Library / Managed Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist 1 /Library / Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist 1 /Users/jgm/Library/Caches/com.apple.iChat/Pictures/... 1 . 2 /.vol/234881026/562669 2 /Users/jgm/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist

I am a little surprised to see Finder opening files in the /.vol directory .
Volfs is a separate file system that is used to support the Carbon File Manager atop the BSD file system .
It was used on earlier versions of Mac OS X , but it was removed in Leopard .
$ sw_vers - productVersion 10.5 $ df -k Filesystem 1024 - blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on /dev/disk0s2 81732372 38929756 42546616 48 % / devfs 112 112 0 100 % / dev fdesc 1 1 0 100 % / dev map - hosts 0 0 0 100 % / net map auto_home 0 0 0 100 % / home $ ls - al /.vol total 0 drwxr - xr-x@ 2 root wheel 68 Jul 30 22:08 ./ drwxrwxr -t 31 root admin 1122 Sep 16 10:22 ../
I do not have a volfs file system , but apparently , accessing volfs paths still works .
$ ls -l /.vol /234881026/562669 total 3512 ( ... output snipped for brevity ... ) -rw-r--r-- 1 jgm staff 0 Sep 17 11:50 I_am_on_your_desktop.txt
Apparently , /.vol /234881026/562669 refers to my Desktop .
We can see which functions are using these paths by looking at the user stack trace when they are opened .
$ sudo dtrace -s / dev/stdin syscall : : open*:entry / copyinstr ( arg0 ) == " /.vol/234881026/562669 " / { ustack ( ) ; } ^D dtrace : script '/ dev/stdin ' matched 3 probes CPU ID FUNCTION : NAME 1 17584 open: entry libSystem.B.dylib`open$UNIX2003+0xa CarbonCore`PBOpenIteratorSync+0x203 CarbonCore`FSOpenIterator+0x1d DesktopServicesPriv`THFSPlusIterator:: First( THFSPlusRef&)+0x6f DesktopServicesPriv`THFSPlusIterator:: Next( THFSPlusRef&) +0x26 DesktopServicesPriv`THFSPlusSynchronizer ::...+0xb5 DesktopServicesPriv`TNode:: SynchronizeChildren ( bool ) +0x44 DesktopServicesPriv`TNode:: ReconcileChildren ( bool , bool ) +0x63 DesktopServicesPriv`TNode :: HandleSync( bool , bool , bool , bool ) +0x1b1 DesktopServicesPriv`TNodeSyncTask ::... +0xda DesktopServicesPriv`TNodeSyncTask ::... +0x11f DesktopServicesPriv`TNodeSyncTask:: SyncTaskProc(void*) +0x98 CarbonCore`PrivateMPEntryPoint+0x38 libSystem.B.dylib`_pthread_start+0x141 libSystem.B.dylib`thread_start+0x22 ^C
Looking at this stack , we can see that it is indeed the Carbon File Manager APIs that are using these volfs paths .
Just as we expected .
So , even though volfs no longer exists as a file system in Leopard , its main functionality still exists in the kernel to support the Carbon File Manager .
Thanks DTrace !
Hard linking directories
One addition in Leopard that has the potential to send shivers up spines , is the addition of directory hard linking .
This functionality was added to enable Time Machine to backup large directory structures of unchanged data without wasting space .
The canonical argument against hard linked directories is that they can cause cycles in the directory tree .
However , Apple avoided this problem by placing some restrictions on directory hard linking .
The only problem I currently see with directory hard links is that I can't get them to work .
$ mkdir Dir1 $ ln Dir1 Dir2 ln : Dir1 :
Is a directory $ sudo ln Dir1 Dir2 ln : Dir1 : Is a directory
Perhaps we can use DTrace to figure out what 's going on .
Let 's start like we normally do by looking at all the system calls made by ln .
We will use dtrace 's -c option to run and trace the command in question .
As we 've already seen , the PID of the command is made available to our D script through the $ target macro variable .
$ sudo dtrace -s / dev/stdin -c " ln Dir1 Dir2 " syscall : :: entry / pid == $ target / {} ^D dtrace : script '/ dev/ stdin ' matched 427 probes ln : Dir1 :
Is a directory dtrace : pid 4389 has exited CPU ID FUNCTION : NAME 1 17950 stat: entry 1 18368 write_nocancel:entry 1 18368 write_nocancel:entry 1 18368 write_nocancel:entry 1 18368 write_nocancel:entry 1 17576 exit:entry
This is interesting because we do n't see any calls to link , which is the system call ultimately responsible for creating the hard link .
Let 's see if we can get a better view of what ln is doing , by using the D script in listing 3 .
Listing 3 : ln.d
Uses the pid provider to trace all function calls in libSystem .
To help limit the output , we only look at user stacks with a depth less than 6 .
pid$target:libSystem*::entry , pid$target: libSystem*:: return /ustackdepth < 6 / {}
And we will run it like this :
$ sudo dtrace - F -s ln.d -c " ln Dir1 Dir2 " dtrace : script ' ln.d ' matched 8679 probes ln : Dir1 :
Is a directory dtrace : pid 6171 has exited CPU FUNCTION 1 <- __cxa_atexit 1 -> rindex 1 <- rindex 1 -> getopt$ UNIX2003 1 <- getopt$UNIX2003 1 -> stat 1 -> _sysenter_trap 1 -> __error 1 <- __error 1 -> warn 1 <- __error 1 <- vwarnc 1 <- fprintf 1 <- warn 1 -> exit 1 -> __cxa_finalize 1 <- __cxa_finalize 1 -> _cleanup 1 <- _fwalk 1 <- _cleanup 1 <- exit 1 -> _exit 1 -> _sysenter_trap
This script traces the function calls in libSystem , and it uses the - F ( flow indent ) option to visually indicate when functions are entered and return .
This output shows that stat is called , followed by functions to print the error message .
This indicates that ln itself is detecting that the first path is a directory and is giving us the error without ever calling link .
To get past this stumbling block , we will write our own simple C program that calls link directly .
Listing 4 : hlink.c
Given two file name arguments , creates a hard link from the first to the second .
#include < unistd.h > # include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { if ( argc != 3 ) return 1 ; int ret = link ( argv [ 1 ] , argv [ 2 ] ) ; if ( ret != 0 ) perror ( " link " ) ; return ret ; } $ gcc -o hlink hlink . c - Wall $ ./ hlink Dir1 Dir2 link : Operation not permitted $ sudo ./ hlink Dir1 Dir2 link : Operation not permitted
OK , it still did n't work , but at least we know that link is definitely being called .
We could use DTrace 's fbt provider to dig further down in the kernel and perhaps see why we 're getting this new error , but let 's not forget what we learned above :
DTrace does not replace all of our other tools .
It takes time to write D scripts , so maybe spending a few more seconds just thinking about the problem is a better solution .
In our case we know that hard links do indeed work because Time Machine uses them .
So , perhaps the problem is that we 're trying to create the hard link in the same directory as the original .
Let 's try creating the hard link to a directory with a different parent .
$ mkdir NewDir $ ./ hlink Dir1 NewDir / Dir2 $ ls - lid Dir1 NewDir / Dir2 1140587 drwxr-xr-x 2 jgm staff 68 Sep 17 18:08 Dir1 / 1140587 drwxr-xr-x 2 jgm staff 68 Sep 17 18:08 NewDir / Dir2 /
Cool !
It worked !
Dir2 is a hard link to Dir1 and I do n't even feel dirty ( nor did I need to be root ) .
We can verify that the hard link worked by looking at the directories ' inode numbers ( the first column in our ls output ) .
Conclusion
As we 've seen here , DTrace is a very powerful and flexible tool , but it is just that - a tool .
And it 's best used in the hands of a skilled craftsman .
The OpenSolaris DTrace community provides a collection of useful D scripts , under the name DTraceToolkit .
Thankfully , the code - smiths at Apple have ported many of these scripts to Leopard .
You can get a list of the more than 40 available DTrace scripts by running man -k dtrace .
There are also examples of their use in /usr / share / examples / DTTk .
One of the more useful D scripts is called dtruss , which most users will embrace as a replacement for ktrace .
Some of the DTrace examples in this article could have been replaced by simpler dtruss invocations , but then what fun is that ?!
We wanted to play with DTrace .
We 've just barely scratched the surface of the tip of the DTrace iceberg .
We did n't get to touch on the more exotic topics like DTrace 's " destructive " actions , the fasttrap provider , instrumenting individual instructions , or accessing external variables using the scoping operator .
The technology behind DTrace is impressive , and it is open source so you can see what is happening behind the scenes .
Perhaps Apple will provide some DTrace documentation soon , but in the meantime you can find a lot of documentation on Sun 's website at http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace, on the OpenSolaris website at http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/os/community/dtrace/, or better yet , just Google it !

Sometimes it seems that the only way to make sense of the Bush administration is to imagine that it ’s a vast experiment concocted by mad political scientists who want to see what happens if a nation systematically ignores everything we ’ve learned over the past few centuries about how to make a modern government work .
Thus , the administration has abandoned the principle of a professional , nonpolitical civil service , stuffing agencies from FEMA to the Justice Department with unqualified cronies .
Tax farming — giving individuals the right to collect taxes , in return for a share of the take — went out with the French Revolution ; now the tax farmers are back .
And so are mercenaries , whom Machiavelli described as “ useless and dangerous ” more than four centuries ago .
As far as I can tell , America has never fought a war in which mercenaries made up a large part of the armed force .
But in Iraq , they are so central to the effort that , as Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institution points out in a new report , “ the private military industry has suffered more losses in Iraq than the rest of the coalition of allied nations combined . ”
1. Benjamin Franklin – mtDNA Haplogroup V
In addition to being one of the Founding Fathers of the United States , Franklin was a politician , printer , scientist , inventor , diplomat , and author .
DNA testing has elucidated the origins of Benjamin Franklin ’s mitochondrial DNA through his mother Abiah Lee Folger , who had six sisters .
One of those sisters , Doras Folger , passed on her mtDNA to her 9th - great granddaughter , Charlene Chambers King .
Sequencing of Ms. King ’s mtDNA revealed that she belonged to mtDNA Haplogroup V with the following mutations : T16298C , 315.1C , 309.1C , A263G , and T72C .
Haplogroup V ( known as “ Velda ” by Sykes ) is believed to have originated in Europe about 12,000 years ago , possibly in Iberia .
About 4 % of Europeans contain Haplogroup V mtDNa .
So far , no known source of Benjamin Franklin ’s Y - DNA or autosomal DNA has been discovered ( although some believe that his tooth might provide the answer ) .
2. Thomas Jefferson – Y - DNA Haplogroup K2
Thomas Jefferson was one of the principal authors of the Declaration of Independence , a Framer of the Constitution , and the third President of the United States .
Unfortunately , much like Benjamin Franklin , Jefferson does not have any male descendants who possess his Y - DNA .
Instead , the DNA of five descendants of Jefferson ’s paternal uncle , Field Jefferson , has been tested and retested .
The results show that Jefferson ’s Y - DNA belongs to Haplgroup K2 , a relatively rare haplogroup for Europeans and most common in the middle east .
A recent study has shown that there are other males with the surname Jefferson in England who belong to Haplogroup K2 , including some who are a perfect 17/17 match with Field ( and presumably Thomas ) Jefferson .
Jefferson ’s DNA was studied in part because it is believed that he fathered children with at least one of his female slaves .
Much more information can be found here .
3. Alexander Hamilton – Y - DNA Haplogroup I1a
Alexander was one of this country ’s most important political theorists .
He served as the Secretary of the Treasury , and was one of the authors of the Federalist Papers , some of the most influential documents in American history .
The Hamilton Surname DNA Project presents the results of Y - DNA testing of four males who are directly descended from John C.A. Hamilton , the grandson of Alexander Hamilton .
All four individuals match at 37 of 37 markers , with the exception of one individual who has a value of 15 for DYS19/394 .
Due to the relationship of the four individuals , it is impossible to know whether or not Hamilton had a 14 or a 15 at that location .
The results suggest that Alexander Hamilton belonged to Y - DNA Haplogroup I1a .
I1a ( known as “ Wodan ” by Sykes ) is most frequent in Scandinavia , reaching almost 35 % in parts of Norway , Sweden , and Denmark .
4. John Adams and John Quincy Adams – Y - DNA Haplogroup R1b1
John Adams was America ’s first Vice President and second President .
He was also a diplomat and a driving force for American independence .
John ’s son , John Quincy Adams , was the sixth President of the United States .
Although no direct descendant of John and John Quincy has been tested , the Adams Surname Y - DNA Project has results from five individuals who are related to John ’s great - great grandfather Henry Adams , born in 1583 in England .
The results suggest that John and John Quincy belonged to the R1b1 Haplogroup .
R1b , the parent of R1b1 , is the most common Y - DNA Haplogroup in Europe , and is believed to have originated with the first modern humans to enter Europe 35,000 to 40,000 years ago .
5. Abraham Lincoln – Y - DNA Haplogroup R1b1
Although Lincoln , the 16th President of the United States , might not have helped “ create ” America , he played a huge role in shaping the country .
His ancestry has been traced back to Samuel Lincoln ( 1620 - 1690 ) , an immigrant from Hingham , England .
( Note , however , that some researchers ( pdf ) believe that Abraham Lincoln might have been the illegitimate son of Abraham Enloe , and thus these DNA results would not apply .
It is hoped that the cloak Lincoln was wearing the night he was shot might provide DNA samples for future analysis ) .
Two descendants of Samuel Lincoln have submitted their Y - DNA for analysis .
Although the allele values have not been revealed , the data shows that the two anonymous individuals match at 36 of 37 markers .
One is listed as belonging to Haplogroup R1b1 , and the other is R1b2 .
R1b2 is an older name for the subhaplogroup defined by the M37 snp , now called R1b1c1 ( see the ISOGG Y - DNA tree here , and a pdf of more information here ) .
These results suggest that Lincoln belonged to the R1b1 Haplogroup , and perhaps was of the R1b1c1 subhaplogroup .
R1b is the most common European haplogroup ; R1b1c probably originated in Central Asia / South Central Siberia .
What is your appeal ?
I think people are tired of what they 're getting from their government .
They do n't believe it 's working .
They 're angry .
They believe they 're being lied to when it comes to the economy .
They believe they 've been lied into going to war .
And they 're tired of it all , and they want change .
Even though people poke fun at me — say that I do n't look like the one to bring about change — I think I offer a different program than they 've heard about for a long time .
What do you mean you do n't look like someone who would bring change ?
They talk about age , and say , why would you appeal to young people ?
I think it 's because the idea of freedom and self - reliance is a very new and young idea .
We 've experimented with it in this country .
I 'd like to continue that process rather than reversing back to tyrannical - type government where government tells us how to live , runs the economy , polices the world , runs an empire around the world .
You believe you are tapping into anger and frustration ?
Not only are there a lot of young people out there ; there are a lot of other people who had given up a long time ago and had dropped out and sense this as an opportunity to get back in .
Some are Republicans who left two , four , six , or eight years ago , never being satisfied .
There are some who come up and say , " I 'm 60 , 65 , and I 've never been involved — this is the first time . "
The Democrats are , I think , rightfully not very happy with their choices because they 're not offering a foreign policy much different than George Bush , and people can see through this .
Can you characterize a typical Ron Paul supporter ?
No .
The characteristic is they 're not typical , and we 're proud of it .
We talk about it all the time — freedom brings diversity .
It brings people together .
Big government divides us , and we become competitive , and we fight over the spoils .
That 's why you have lobbyists up here fighting .
It was fine when everybody thought there was endless wealth in this country .
But today people , down deep in their heart , they know there 's something wrong .
And they see symbolically one of the best measurements of a country that is losing its wealth is when their currency goes down in value .
And I 've been talking about currency values since the very first time I ran for office .
It 's the monetary issue that has motivated me .
And it 's just all coming together now .
The welfare spending at home , the militarism , the empire building is bringing us to bankruptcy .
And we have a lot more inflation than they 'll admit .
Here we have currency going down — that in itself is inflation .
The figures they fudge with — the CPI [ consumer price index ] — that is not inflation .
That is a pseudo measure of inflation .
The dollar is important .
The money supply is important .
But not government reports on the CPI .
Polls have said that Americans feel less hopeful than they can ever remember .
Do you sense that loss of optimism ?
I think so .
I 'm always amazed that people walk away from our rallies more hopeful than ever before .
" You give me hope , " they say .
" You remove my apathy " — all kinds of signs like that .
I 've been wondering about that since I dwell on the problems , though I offer solutions , I spend a lot more time complaining about the problems .
Someone said to me maybe it's because it 's the first time they had somebody tell the truth about what the problems are instead of denying and instead of saying , " Oh , yeah , everything is fine :
No inflation , war 's going to end next week , losing 4,000 men does n't mean all that much . "
They want the truth .
But then I always conclude with an upbeat note that we got into this mess by not following the laws of the land , which is the Constitution , and we could merely go back to that and solve most of our problems .
We do n't have to give up our freedoms .
They applaud loudly when I say this idea that we 're obligated to sacrifice our liberties to be safe from terrorists — say the opposite is true .
The freer you are , the safer you 're going to be .
They like that .
While recognizing the effects of 9/11 , why do you think many Americans have been apathetic about the freedom issue , particularly when it comes to protecting what was once their personal information ?
I think a lot of people , the ones who gave up on it , just sort of dropped out .
So there are more of those than we ever realized .
I think now that they 're realizing that they have to worry about something because they know we 're becoming a poorer country , and they 're looking for answers , and they 're less apathetic .
I think when you 're very free , you 're very prosperous .
And when people concentrate on material wealth that comes from freedom , they forget about the principles .
And now we 're becoming less wealthy , and we 're trying to make the people think about how prosperity comes about .
Young people especially are very principled , and they 're idealistic , and they do not hesitate to applaud when I say , " I want you to take care of yourselves .
You can do what you want with your own body , and you can do what you want with your own money .
You can get out of Social Security if I had my way .
You have to assume the responsibility for yourself .
If you do n't do well or you mess up , you can't come crawling to the government . "
They do n't have anything :
They just take it from someone else .
They like this approach to self - reliance .
But people point out , " Yeah , people always vote for what they can get out of the government . "
So I think there 's a contest going on by the people who would be quite willing to be self - reliant versus the people who still argue that the world owes them a living .
Do you have a pollster ?
Not really .
We do a little bit of polling in New Hampshire .
We did n't hire a permanent pollster .
Somebody did some work up in New Hampshire to get a baseline because it's a pretty good state for us .
It 's a state that we 'll be working hard in .
What do you have to do to stay in the race ?
Do you see yourself going through February 5 and into the March primaries ?
I think if the curve continues , the money 's going to keep coming in .
We just take one day at a time and see how we do , and every day is better than the last .
We do n't have a goal that says we have to be first or second or even third in two or three states .
We have to do well — if you 're last in the first five primaries , you better reassess things .
But I just do n't think that 's going to happen .
Just as we surprised people on how many Meetup groups we have , how many volunteers we get , how much money we raise , how well we do in post - debate polls — why should n't we expect a surprise in the primaries ?
If you 're polling in New Hampshire , you must see an opportunity with that state 's large group of independent voters .
How do you appeal to them ?
If we motivate them , we 'll get their votes because who else is going to motivate them on the other side ?
They 're tired of the war .
The Democrats — they all backtrack .
They 've all joined Bush 's foreign policy .
I do n't know how anyone can tell the difference between what they 're saying and what Bush is saying .
They all say , " We 'll be better managers . "
I do n't want to manage the war .
I want the war to end .
That 's what the people are sick and tired of .
No real choices .
You 've at times been compared to Barack Obama for motivating supporters , to Howard Dean for your online effort , and to Ralph Nader , because of your potential as a third - party candidate .
Do you see yourself in any of those modes ?
A little bit of each , I guess .
I 've been in a third party .
Of course , Howard Dean did use the Internet , though I do n't think anywhere near to what 's happening now .
Obama — I think the longer that goes on , what really is he saying ?
I think he got some credit for newness , but he 's a young person and comes across as a fresh face .
I think my ideas are actually younger in spirit .
He 's talking about the same old clichés — government programs , perpetuating the war , do n't take anything off the table in dealing with Iran , ca n't let them have a nuclear weapon or we 'll bomb them .
How has the deteriorating situation in Pakistan affected your campaign message ?
It fell right in my lap .
It 's exactly what I said .
Ten billion dollars we paid into this guy 's coffers to keep a military dictator who overthrew an elected government .
And we 're supposed to die for spreading democracy ?
We 're going broke .
And now we 've created chaos in that country .
We had Bhutto come back in there .
Everybody over there knows our CIA is trying to run things .
That 's why he 's so unpopular .
As long as we 're going to interfere , there will be a motivation for people to get rid of our puppet government and turn against us as well .
That 's where the radicalism comes from .
It 's a response to a foreign policy that is seriously flawed .
Would you consider a third - party run ?
I have no intention of doing that .
I 've done it before , the laws are biased against us , it costs a lot of money , and even though we 've raised a lot , you really need a lot more .
It does n't interest me at all .
I 've refiled for my congressional seat .
That 's Plan B .
Who has helped you put your campaign strategy together , particularly your online strategy ?
There has n't been any .
The strategy was to present a platform , something I believe in .
People ask me , " Well , who prepped you for your debates ?
What do you when you go in to Jay Leno — do you have someone prep you ? "
I figure I 've been reading about this , studying it , trying to understand it , explain it , and vote a certain way for 30 years .
There 's no strategy other than trying to get the information out , and the Internet provided the vehicle .
I knew there was something strange going on because when I finally yielded to the many requests to run and said , yes , I would do it — then it got leaked on the Internet , and we did n't even have an office .
And then , we had literally thousands of calls from people —
" Why do n't you answer our E - mails ?
Why do n't you do this ? "
We did n't even have an office set up .
The Internet does the work .
Then they get excited .
They form the groups .
We 've never organized a Meetup group , yet there 's 1,100 of them .
Not that we 're connected to them ; we make good use of them .
We say we 're coming to town , and they 'll get the people out .
And then , when we want to raise some money , we 'll send periodic E - mails out .
But yesterday , it was all their doing .
We had no idea whether they 'd raise $ 1,000 or a million .
To get $ 4.3 million was pretty amazing .
When you ran as a third - party Libertarian presidential candidate in 1988 , you said you hoped that what you were doing would expose a new generation to the movement 's ideas .
Are the stakes higher now ?
Oh , I think so .
The seeds we planted back in the ' 80s have come to fulfill some of those plans because quite a few who work in the campaign , on the staff , even some people here , worked for the campaign in 1988 .
I met them when they were in college , and they became fascinated and interested .
I'm a strong believer that ideas have consequences and nothing happens by accident .
If there had not been some groundwork laid for Austrian free - market economies , sound money , and this foreign policy , which has been going on , it was n't there in the 1970s when I came here .
But many organizations have popped up that have taught this .
There have been documentaries made , books written , more professors than ever before .
So I 've just tapped into something that has been going on .
The intellectual revolution has been going on for a generation .
It 's just that when they asked me first to do this , I did n't think the time was right .
I was n't sure how the young people would respond .
I figure they 'd only ask me about student loans and nothing else , and they have n't .
If they would , I 'd just tell them , " No , that 's not part of it .
Talk about what it would be like if we did n't have government : Tuition would be a lot cheaper , you could have a job , and I would n't tax you .
You could take care of yourself .
. . . "
If you do n't get the nomination , what is your best outcome ?
What will you have done in this process ?
Only time will tell because I never knew from the very beginning if anything would come of it .
So all I know is there may be more people thinking about this .
Why are Republicans having such a difficult time ?
I think they 've lost their way from their traditional beliefs of being conservatives .
They are big spenders .
They pass entitlement programs , create new departments .
They pass more regulations .
They have prompted a monetary crisis because of their irresponsibility .
And they have n't lived up to their foreign policy that they 've generally followed in the past — less intervention than the Democrats overseas .
. . .
Do you feel like a Republican ?
I think I feel more like a Republican than they should .
They 're not conservatives , they 're neoconservatives , and neoconservatives are big - government people .
Why they get called conservatives or Republicans is beyond me .
Some people feel loyal to the party , and people hate to break with this loyalty .
But when I talk to people and they say , " You can be against the war and still be conservative ? "
I say , " Certainly . "
The conservative position is to not start wars and to obey the Constitution .
Ronald Reagan not too long ago ran against the Department of Education and the Department of Energy , and he did quite well , and there 's this whole idea that all of a sudden that I 'm strange to the Republican Party ? . . .
Where should decisions about legalizing abortion lie ?
If you do n't protect life , you can't protect liberty .
And we now are at a stage where we allow the national government through the Supreme Court to permit the killing of an unborn baby anytime before birth .
How do you protect somebody 's right to go out and drink alcohol and smoke marijuana if you can't even protect life ?
As a physician , it 's a legal entity .
I could be sued if I hurt a fetus .
I 've been strongly pro-life , but I do n't support nationalization of any of these problems .
I voted against the marriage amendment .
I want this to be held under our traditional form of republican government and let the states deal with it .
. . .
Do you need to court conservative evangelicals ?
NBC : Airport screeners tipped off to security checks David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Department of Homeland Security has been investigating for weeks whether airport screeners were tipped off in advance about upcoming security checks .
Now NBC
News is reporting that those tipoffs may have come from high officials in the department .
Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D - MS ) , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , recently revealed an email sent by a senior official at the Transportation Security Administration giving screeners all over the country very specific details about what sorts of suspicious clues the undercover testers would expect them to notice -- such as ID 's with photos that did not match the people using them and boarding passes with altered dates .
Thompson has sent letters to Assistant Secretary Edmund S. Hawley and Inspector General Richard L. Skinner at the Department of Homeland Security , asking for a complete explanation of the episode .
The email is attached to both letters , which can be read at this link .
Security expert David Heyman told NBC that despite the tipoffs the screeners still did poorly , and " that 's got to be very discouraging . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on November 2 , 2007 .

Switzerland makes it very difficult for foreigners to become Swiss
The report , from Switzerland 's Federal Commission on Racial Discrimination , recommends far - reaching changes .
It criticises the practice of allowing members of a community to vote on an individual 's citizenship application .
Muslims and people from the Balkans and Africa are the most likely to be rejected , the report points out .
Switzerland has Europe 's toughest naturalisation laws .
Foreigners must live for 12 years in a Swiss community before they can apply , and being born in Switzerland brings no right to citizenship .
Under the current system , foreigners apply through their local town or village .
They appear before a citizenship committee and answer questions about their desire to be Swiss .
After that , they must often be approved by the entire voting community , in a secret ballot , or a show of hands .
This practice , the report says , is particularly likely to be distorted by racial discrimination .
It cites the case of a disabled man originally from Kosovo .
Although fulfilling all the legal criteria , his application for citizenship was rejected by his community on the grounds that his disability made him a burden on taxpayers , and that he was Muslim .
The report recommends that decisions on citizenship should be decided by an elected executive and not by the community as a whole .
But such a move is likely to encounter stiff opposition .
Foreigners are a key issue in the run-up to Switzerland 's general election next month .
The right - wing Swiss People 's Party , currently leading in the opinion polls , claims Swiss communities have a democratic right to decide who can or cannot be Swiss .

In the December issue of Wired , Seth Mnookin sits down with Universal Music Group CEO / supervillain Doug Morris for a pretty excellent profile .
In it , Mnookin paints the 68 - year old Morris as a crotchety executive who ’s upset that he can’t focus more on simple product and artist development because he ’s too busy worrying about iPods , MP3s , and his company ’s digital strategy ( which was never really supposed to be part of his job description when he took the gig in 1995 ) .
In a way , he almost comes off as cute , like if your grandfather were accidentally hired to run Google ( at one point , Morris hilariously compares his embattled industry to a character in “ Li’l Abner , ” a comic strip that stopped running in 1977 ) .
As for his actual digital strategy , it ’s pretty much what we expected — Morris ’s singular goal these days is to limit the power of Steve Jobs and iTunes .
He puts most of his energy into designing Universal ’s own Internet music store ( Total Music , which is definitely doomed to fail ) , cutting deals with Apple competitor Microsoft for a piece of those massive Zune profits , and heroically doing all he can to make it even more difficult for consumers to justify paying for music online .
But then he says something so ridiculous it sort of blows our minds .
When Morris is asked why the music business did n’t work harder , in the early days of file - sharing , to build its own ( legal ) online presence , there ’s this exchange :
“ There ’s no one in the record industry that ’s a technologist , ” Morris explains .
“ That ’s a misconception writers make all the time , that the record industry missed this .
They did n’t .
They just did n’t know what to do .
It ’s like if you were suddenly asked to operate on your dog to remove his kidney .
What would you do ? ”
Personally , I would hire a vet .
But to Morris , even that was n’t an option .
“ We did n’t know who to hire , ” he says , becoming more agitated .
“ I would n’t be able to recognize a good technology person — anyone with a good bullshit story would have gotten past me . ”
Even though we should n’t be , we ’re actually a little shocked .
We ’d always assumed the labels had met with a team of technology experts in the late nineties and ignored their advice , but it turns out they never even got that far — they did n’t even try !
Understanding the Internet certainly is n’t easy — especially for an industry run by a bunch of technology - averse sexagenarians — but it ’s definitely not impossible .
The original Napster hit its peak in 1999 — kids born since then have hacked into CIA computers .
Surely it would n’t have taken someone at Universal more than a month or two to learn enough about the Internet to know who to call to answer a few questions .
They did n’t even have any geeky interns ?
We give this industry six months to live .

ONLY yesterday stock options seemed to be a sort of corporate wonder - drug , doing to business what steroids do to weight - lifters : dose up your executives , and watch your profits grow .
Now , like steroids , everyone is more concerned about the nasty side - effects , which can include jail time for executives who backdate them to give them more oomph .
AP
A free backdater
Next month Greg Reyes , the former boss of Brocade Communications , will be sentenced following his conviction in August on fraud charges relating to options backdating .
( Backdating refers to retrospectively picking a favourable date to set the price of an option , when the firm 's share price is at a low point , rather than using the price on the day the option is actually awarded . )
He faces up to 20 years behind bars , unless the newly launched Friends of Greg Reyes campaign convinces the authorities that he has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice .
One thing that prosecutors have so far failed satisfactorily to explain is why so many top executives engaged in backdating , which was done so openly and widely in Silicon Valley that it is hard to believe anyone thought they were committing a crime .
Even Steve Jobs , the iconic boss of Apple , did it — though , unlike dozens of other executives , he has not ( so far ) had his collar felt by the authorities .
One possible explanation is that everyone in Silicon Valley at the time was so convinced in the potency of options that the possibility of illegality was not even contemplated .
After all , the accounting rules did not even count options as a cost of doing business — unless , as it turned out , they were backdated .
The mystery is why options were regarded as so wonderful in the first place .
Being ( apparently ) costless helped .
Options advocates invariably point to the motivational power that they have , giving employees a powerful financial incentive to do whatever is necessary to get their firm 's share price up .
They certainly did n't take any notice of The Economist , which in August 1999 ran a cover story called “ The trouble with share options ” ( see article ) .
This argued , among other things , that the “ spread of share options may be distorting the economy , contributing to a temporary overvaluation of equities , encouraging short - sighted managerial decisions and storing up problems for companies in future . ”
Well , no one can claim they were n't warned .
Belatedly , the evidence is now mounting that share options are not all they were cracked up to be .
Consider , for example , “ Swinging for the fences : The Effect of CEO Stock Options on Company Risk - taking and Performance , ” a study in the October issue of The Academy of Management Journal .
The authors , two economists , Gerard Sanders and Donald Hambrick , observe that options create asymmetric incentives : they pay out when a firm 's share price rises above the option exercise price , but once they fall below the exercise price , all further falls make no difference to the ultimate payout , which is nothing .
This , posit the authors , gives an incentive to take big bets , by investing in risky activities with long odds on a high pay - off .
They also posit that these bets will produce more extreme losses than extreme wins .
To test these theories , they examine the impact of the options awarded to the chief executives of some 950 American firms during 1993 - 2000 .
This showed that the bigger the role played by share options in the boss 's pay package , the more likely firms were to invest heavily in risky activities .
It also confirmed that high levels of share options were associated with more extreme ups and downs in a firm 's share price , and that the big downs significantly exceeded the extreme highs .
The authors conclude that “ not only does this asymmetry affect the selection of strategic initiatives , as we have discussed , but it may also cause CEOs to be inattuned to early signs of project failure and generally careless about risk mitigation . ”
Surely this is not the sort of motivational incentives that shareholders want .
To be fair , since the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 , and the more recent backdating scandal , companies have talked about reducing their dependence on options , not least in favour of less asymmetric share - related schemes .
But this sort of steroid seems to be addictive .
As Messrs Sanders and Hambrick note , share options still represent the largest single form of CEO compensation .
A Cool Head
seemed normal to me
In the first day 's debates , everyone favoured bombing Cuba .
The only differences concerned the scale of attack .
Kennedy , Bundy , and some others spoke of a ' surgical strike ' solely against the missile sites .
' It corresponds to " the punishment fits the crime " in political terms ' , said Bundy .
Others joined the chiefs of staff in insisting that an attack should also take out air defence sites and bombers , so as to limit losses of US aircraft and prevent an immediate air reprisal against US bases in Florida .
By the third day , 18 October , another option had come to the fore .
The under secretary of state , George Ball , had commented that a US surprise attack on Cuba would be '... like Pearl Harbor .
It 's the kind of conduct that one might expect of the Soviet Union .
It is not conduct that one expects of the United States . '
Robert Kennedy and Secretary of State Dean Rusk concurred , Rusk observing that the decision - makers could carry ' the mark of Cain ' on their brows for the rest of their lives .
To meet this concern and to obtain time for gaining support from other nations , there developed the idea of the President 's publicly announcing the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba , ordering a blockade to prevent the introduction of further missiles , and demanding that the Soviets withdraw the missiles already there .
( Both for legal reasons and for resonance with Franklin Roosevelt 's ' Quarantine Address ' of 1937 , the term ' quarantine ' was substituted for ' blockade ' . )
To those of Kennedy 's advisers who still favoured quick use of military force ( the ' hawks ' in later classification ) , this quarantine constituted an ultimatum .
If Khrushchev did not capitulate within a day or two , a US air attack on Cuba would follow , followed before long by an invasion .
For those in the ExComm who would later be classed as ' doves , ' the quarantine bought time for possibly developing some diplomatic solution .
On 26 - 27 October , the crisis came to a head .
Khrushchev cabled Kennedy that he was prepared to remove missiles from Cuba in return for a US promise not to invade Cuba - a promise that had already been given more than once .
But , just as Kennedy and his ExComm began to discuss a response , Khrushchev broadcast from Moscow a second message saying the missiles would be removed if , in addition , the United States withdrew nuclear missiles and other ' offensive means ' from Turkey .
The second Khrushchev message provoked furious debate .
With Ball in the lead , Kennedy 's advisers said almost unanimously that Khrushchev 's new condition was unacceptable .
America 's NATO allies would think the United States was sacrificing their security for the sake of its own .
Kennedy alone seemed unconvinced .
When Ball said , ' If we talked to the Turks ... this would be an extremely unsettling business ' , Kennedy replied with asperity , ' Well , this is unsettling now , George , because ... most people would regard this as not an unreasonable proposal ...
I think you 're going to have it very difficult to explain why we are going to take hostile military action in Cuba ... when he 's saying , " If you 'll get yours out of Turkey , we 'll get ours out of Cuba . " ' .
' What Kennedy wanted was to mollify Khrushchev without seeming to make a concession , and above all to avoid any prolonged negotiations . '
In the end , Kennedy found a way to finesse the situation .
He sent Robert Kennedy to see the Soviet ambassador , Anatoly Dobrynin , to tell him that the missiles in Turkey were obsolete , and that the US planned to pull them out within about six months .
All this was true .
He said further , however , that , if the Soviet Union used this knowledge to claim that the US had struck the deal proposed in Khrushchev 's radio message , Kennedy would deny the claim and would not remove the missiles from Turkey .
What Kennedy wanted was to mollify Khrushchev without seeming to make a concession , and above all to avoid any prolonged negotiations .
He had to insist that Soviet missiles come out of Cuba unconditionally , or he would compromise the display of firmness that he judged necessary to protect against a Berlin crisis .
In fact , the exchange between Robert Kennedy and Dobrynin had no effect .
Khrushchev had already decided to retreat to a simple request for a no invasion pledge .
And the crisis ended on that basis .
US reconnaissance aircraft kept watch while the Soviets dismantled their missiles and loaded the parts on ships for return to the Soviet Union .
Hey guys , it ’s Malik and Geo !
This is our blog that we have created together .
We are in journalism together at our college and we just learned about blogging and it sparked an interest in both of us .
We wanted to try something new out and see if we enjoy or not .
So far we love it !
We ’ve been friends for about 3 years now .
We have been in a lot of classes together because our major is a small major in our school so our classes are very small .
We have worked on multiple group projects together and we learned that we work very well together so we are confident in this blog .
We hope that you guys like it and we are very open to suggestions and feedback !
To Beat the Enemy , We Must Understand Him .
Understand the mechanisms of tyrany .

Excellent lecture by Naomi Wolf on " The End of America " .
Kudos to GW for his previous post To Beat the Enemy , We Must Understand Him .
UC San Diego electrical engineers have developed the world 's most complex “ phased array ” -- or radio frequency integrated circuit .
This DARPA - funded advance is expected to find its way into U.S. defense satellite communication and radar systems .
In addition , the innovations in this chip design will likely spill over into commercial applications , such as automotive satellite systems for direct broadcast TV , and new methods for high speed wireless data transfer .
“ This is the first 16 element phased array chip that can send at 30 - 50 GHz .
The uniformity and low coupling between the elements , the low current consumption and the small size – it is just 3.2 by 2.6 square millimeters – are all unprecedented .
As a whole system , there are many many firsts , ” said Gabriel Rebeiz , the electrical engineering professor from the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering leading the project .
This chip – the UCSD DARPA Smart Q - Band 4x4 Array Transmitter – is strictly a transmitter .
“ We are working on a chip that can do a transmit and receive function , ” said Rebeiz .
“ This compact beamforming chip will enable a breakthrough in size , weight , performance and cost in next - generation phased arrays for millimeter - wave military sensor and communication systems , ” DARPA officials wrote in a statement .
“ DARPA has funded us to try to get everything on a single silicon chip – which would reduce the cost of phased arrays tremendously .
In large quantities , this new chip would cost a few dollars to manufacture .
Obviously , this is only the transmitter .
You still need the receiver but one can easily build the receiver chip based on the designs available in the transmitter chip .
Our work addresses the most costly part of the phased array – the 16:1 divider , phase shifters , amplitude controllers and the uniformity and isolation between channels , ” said Rebeiz
The chip also contains all the CMOS digital circuits necessary for complete digital control of the phased array , and was done using the commercial Jazz SBC18HX process .
This is a first and greatly reduces the fabrication complexity of the phased array .
The chip has been designed for use at the defense satellite communications frequency – the Q - band - which goes from 40 to 50 GHz .
“ If you take the same design and move it to the 24 or 60 GHz range , you can use it for commercial terrestrial communications , ” said Rebeiz who is also a lead on a separate project , funded by Intel and a UC - Discovery Grant , to create silicon CMOS phased array chips that could be embedded into laptops and serve as high speed data transfer tools .

The Intel project is a collaboration between Rebeiz , Larry Larson and Ian Galton – all electrical engineering professors at the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering .
Larson also serves as the chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering .
“ If you wanted to download a large movie file , a base station could find you , zoom onto you , and direct a beam to your receiver chip .
This could enable data transfer of hundreds of gigabytes of information very quickly , and without connecting a cable or adhering to the alignment requirements of wireless optical data transfer , ” explained Rebeiz who estimated that this kind of system could be available in as little as three years .
Phased Array Background Information
Phased arrays have been around for more than half a century .
They are groups of antennas in which the relative phases of the signals that feed them are varied so that the effective radiation pattern of the array is reinforced in a particular direction and suppressed in undesired directions .
This property – combined with the fact that radio waves can pass through clouds and most other materials that stymie optical communication systems – has led engineers to use phased arrays for satellite communications , and for detecting incoming airplanes , ships and missiles .
Some phased arrays are larger than highway billboards and the most powerful – used as sophisticated radar , surveillance and communications systems for military aircraft and ships – can cost hundreds of millions of dollars .
The high cost has prevented significant spread beyond military and high - end satellite communication applications .
Engineers are now working to miniaturize them and fully integrate them into silicon - based electronic systems for both military and commercial applications .
The new UCSD chip packs 16 channels into a 3.2 by 2.6 mm² chip .
The input signal is divided on - chip into 16 different paths with equal amplitude and phase using an innovative design , and the phase and gain of each of the 16 channels is controlled electronically to direct the antenna pattern ( beam ) into a specific direction .
By manipulating the phase , you can steer the beam electronically in nanoseconds .
With the amplitude , you control the width of the beam , which is critical , for example , when you send information to from one satellite to another but you do n’t want the signal to reach any nearby satellites .
And with amplitude and phase control , you can synthesize deep nulls in the antenna pattern so as to greatly reduce the effect of interfering signals from neighboring transmitters .
The work was done by two graduate students , Kwang - Jin Koh and Jason May , both at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department ( ECE ) at UCSD .
Rebeiz presented the new chip at DARPA TEAM Meeting , August 28 - 29 , 2007 in Chicago , Illinois .
Additional details of the chip will be submitted to an academic journal later this year .
O ne day in late February my cell phone rang , and it was my boss 's boss .
He and I never really , you know , saw eye to eye .
In fact , when he became my boss 's boss , I felt a twinge of panic .
" He 's gonna find a reason to get rid of me , " I told the paranoid and fleshy reflection in the mirror .
But I 'd been with the company for seventeen years , much longer than he'd been around , and had weathered many a storm .
It did n’t take much effort to convince myself everything would be fine .
He asked if I could meet him for breakfast the next morning .
There was something he needed to talk to me about , and could n't go into it over the phone .
I sensed just the tiniest bit of anxiety in his voice , and it sounded like he might 've been calling from an airport .
Gulp .
It 's worth noting , I think , that this guy is based in Southern California , and I 'm in Scranton .
So it was n't exactly common for him to drop in like this .
Something was up , I knew , something I probably was n't going to enjoy .
And so , over scrambled eggs and bacon , I was gently fired .
After seventeen years , in three cities , and across two divisions of the company , it was over .
Just like that .
They 'd decided they only need one facility on the east coast , and mine was the one they were closing .
It was a very difficult decision , and we 're prepared to offer you a generous severance package ... blah blah blah .
I felt like I was going to vomit .
I 'd been working at that place my entire adult life , it seemed .
It was part of me , and I was part of it .
And here they were telling me they did n't need me around anymore .
I do n't even remember driving home .
Now a few months have passed , and it seems like a hundred years .
I 've been through the full spectrum of emotions : shock , denial , anger , the contemplation of throwing my face through plate glass , etc .
And for some unknown reason I ’m now feeling the need to perform an inventory .
What follows is probably more for me than you , but hopefully it's at least semi-useful , or entertaining .
Or something .
Here are some of the things I 've learned since losing my job ...
Internet job sites
Like everybody else in my position , I reflexively threw together a resume and posted it to Monster , CareerBuilder , and the other well - known job sites .
I figured I ’d make it the heart and soul of my search for new employment , since that ’s the way it ’s apparently done these days .
I foolishly expected to receive a few nibbles on the very first day .
After all , I 'd posted my information before noon .
When that did n’t happen , I told myself not to panic and began applying for jobs listed at each site .
I fired off dozens of resumes , and filled out scores of applications , in a wild frenzy of activity that left me feeling exhilarated and certain better days were ahead .
And I might as well have climbed to the top of an elevated bluff somewhere , unzipped my pants , and begun urinating directly into a powerful headwind .
I have never received a single response from anything I ’ve done at an internet job site .
Since my “ breakfast ” in February I ’ve been on six interviews with three companies , and exactly zero came about because of Monster or CareerBuilder or any of those outfits .
As best as I can tell they ’re a complete waste of time , something akin to typing up a resume and cover letter then throwing it all into an open storm drain .
For the most part , I ’ve now washed my hands of those websites .
Oh , I ’m still receiving their emails every day with a list of exciting new opportunities for me .
And it ’s usually stuff like spinal cord surgeon and assistant key - person at Lids - nothing in between .
I ’m convinced internet job sites are the biggest scam this side of corporate consulting .
Human Resources
One of the reasons the sites do n’t work , I believe , is because resumes and applications get dumped into human resources departments .
And human resources is where resumes go to die .
It ’s been my experience that many HR folks are beaten down with a constant all - consuming concern they ’re going to screw up and allow their company to be sued somehow .
They ’re absolutely averse to risk , and will not take action of any kind unless there ’s almost 100 % certainty it wo n’t come back to haunt them .
Therefore , resumes are scanned ( sometimes electronically ) for a reason to reject it .
That ’s their function : to provide HR an excuse not to take further action .
Every resume shitcanned is a problem solved , and another risky decision delayed .
I have no proof of this , but I believe the only reason anyone ever gets hired anywhere is because an executive finally blows a gasket and tells HR to quit their freakin ' stalling .
And unless you come onto the scene at the exact time that hissy - fit is being thrown , you ’re screwed , brotha .
And that ’s why I ’m doing my best to avoid human resources , and going straight to the execs themselves .
If my new method bears fruit , you can rest assured I ’ll soon be conducting a “ free ” seminar about it at a Ramada Inn ballroom near you .
Watch your newspapers for details .
Four year college degrees I do n’t have a degree , and was convinced it must surely be one of the more popular shitcan - triggers amongst HR folks .
But , to my surprise , it has n’t been as big a deal as I ’d feared .
Certainly I ’ve encountered companies that dig in their heels about such things , and there have been some unpleasant experiences because of it .
I attended a job fair , for instance , and approached a corporation I was ( am ) interested in .
The woman seemed friendly , and took my resume with much enthusiasm .
Then I watched her skip over my entire work history , and go straight to the education section .
My seventeen years of real and relevant experience were just tossed aside , and all she wanted to know is whether or not I have a four - year degree .
It did n’t seem to matter if it was in Physical Education , Herbology , or the Dark Arts .
Once she received my answer , I was treated like a man wearing a sash of sewage .
She handed my resume back as if she believed it to be smeared with post - pub diarrhea .
It was quite a demoralizing afternoon for your corpulent correspondent .
But , for the most part , companies seem to require a degree or a comparable amount of experience .
And that ’s been one of the more pleasant Things I ’ve Learned .
Career counselors
My former employer offered to pay for six months of career counseling , reportedly to help ease the pain of transition .
I ’m from West Virginia and do n’t usually go in for such fancy - pants things , but my wife convinced me to give it a try .
And it ’s been extremely helpful .
Since I had n’t really been on a job interview in more than seventeen years , I had a lot to learn .
I did n’t know ( or believe ) I had a lot to learn , but I did .
Those folks got me prepared for the “ modern ” job interview .
They also helped with my resume , rejecting it four or five times and making me crazy .
It irritated me while I was doing yet another re-write of the thing , but the final product is very good indeed .
I sat through several classes and seminars there , during the early days of panic , and it helped me mentally .
I always came away feeling hopeful and optimistic , and found myself clinging to the place like a life raft .
Now I ’m at a point where I just call my contact for advice and opinions when needed , I do n’t attend many of the seminars these days .
But it remains a valuable resource .
The man knows his stuff , and is a good person to have in your corner .
I ’m glad I was talked into it .
I would n’t have gone on my own .
You know , because I ’m from West Virginia .
Treatment by family and friends
One of the more frustrating consequences of this ordeal is the way some folks insist on treating me .
There ’s a slight pitying tone to their voice , and it seems like they ’re being very careful with the words they choose , etc .
As if I ’m teetering on the edge of sanity , and one wrong move might be all it takes .
I ’m sure they mean well and all , but I do n’t much care for it .
I ’m no delicate flower , and do n’t need to be tip - toed around .
My job was eliminated , and that ’s certainly a kick to the eggs , but it has n’t affected my DNA .
I ’m still the same person I was on February 25 .
My mother - in - law visited us a couple of weeks ago , and told my wife she worries that I might be “ suicidal . ”
This is some kind of Oprah crap she brought with her , along with her water - driven lung machine , and it has no basis in reality .
I busted out laughing when I heard about this latest drama .
Suicidal , my big riffled ass .
Her mind was made up about it before she even left her house .
On the other end of the spectrum is a guy at my old office , a person I once considered to be a friend .
As soon as the work - bond was broken , our “ friendship ” ended .
I called him a couple of times after I left , and we did n’t really have anything to say to each other .
Apparently it was a relationship built entirely on bitching and mockery , and now we ’re all misaligned .
And so it goes .
An opportunity ?
People like to tell you that losing your job is an opportunity .
I think there ’s some truth in that .
Lord knows I was n’t very happy the last few years , and now have a chance to make things right .
While looking for better employment , I 'm also having crazy and terrifying ideas about striking out on my own , and maybe starting a business of sorts .
If I ’m ever going to do it , now ’s the time .
At least that 's what the demons are telling me .
Yeah , these things are exciting in the abstract , but they do n’t make it any easier in real life .
I sometimes feel like I ’m going in twenty directions at once , and standing still as a result .
By definition , of course , options complicate matters .
Some days I have a powerful urge just to get this episode behind us and find another job to complain about - get back into the " real world . "
Then I become angry with myself for being weak , and get all fired up about the small business ideas again .
It 's the kind of thing that causes communism to take hold around the world .
Will somebody please make all my decisions for me , and tell me where to report every morning , and at what time ?
I 'll be getting hammered on potato vodka in the corner if you need me ...
Being patient A watched cell phone never rings , and I do n't much care for it .
Ring , bitch !
Spending time around the house Remember that unlikely episode of The Andy Griffith Show where Howard Sprague dreamed of escaping the hustle and bustle of Mayberry ( ! ) and moved to a Caribbean island where he planned to lie around in hammocks all day , and build ships in bottles ?
Yeah , it turned out to be one of those be careful what you wish for situations .
Once he actually got to the island he was bored to tears , and seemed ready to cast himself into the sea ( which would 've really spiced up the show , now that I think about it ) .
When I was working and mildly miserable , I had my fantasies like everyone else .
Man , I thought , if I did n't have to go to the office every day I 'd be the happiest person alive .
I 'd get so much important work done , and not waste all my time on meetings and conference calls and rolling my eyes behind people 's backs .
And now here I am feeling like Howard Sprague about twenty minutes in .
Sure , economic uncertainty taints the whole thing , so it 's not really a valid comparison .
But I do n't think I could do it , long - term , under any circumstance .
In fact , I 'm writing this on a laptop computer inside a Panera Bread , just to shake things up a bit .
The walls were closing in on me , man .
Hanging around the house all the time , “ doing what I want , ” is a sure trip to Howard 's island , I 've learned .
If you 're not careful it 'll be Sudoku in no time .
Which , as everyone knows , is the beginning of the long slow decline to death .
Replying to newspaper ads According to the books I 've read , and the things I 've been taught , replying to Sunday newspaper ads has one of the lowest success rates of them all .
But I 've had good luck with it so far .
No , I still have n't been hired , but I 've been on interviews , and come very close on two occasions .
The problem ?
You 're going up against dozens of other people , and the odds are long .
Also ( and here 's where the paranoid and fleshy reflection returns ) I believe many companies , when given the choice , will gamble on a young and cheap candidate over a seasoned and more expensive veteran such as myself .
In fact , I 'm almost certain it happened to me recently .
On the other hand , I remember being young and believing the exact opposite .
So who the hell knows ?
One thing I do know is that I 'm watching the papers every day , and firing off resumes and cover letters when appropriate .
The “ experts ” can kiss it .
I will be exceedingly smug when I prove them wrong .
Networking
At your age , they say , networking is the key .
I do n't much care for that statement .
For one thing I 'm not exactly an extrovert ; I 'm much more comfortable operating in the background .
I 'm less a “ performer , ” and more of a guy who shows up every day and performs his duties well .
Some folks seem to be perpetually campaigning for the next promotion , playing golf and laughing real loud and acting like assholes .
That 's not me .
Oh , my inclinations have probably cost me a pay - grade through the years , but it 's cool .
I have my dignity .
Sort of .
And so , I get nervous when so much emphasis is placed on networking , because it 's calling for me to do things which go almost exactly counter to my personality .
I was recently at a neighborhood block party and decided , against my better judgment , to give it a shot .
Everyone 's a potential networking contact , they say , so we 'll see how it goes .
And it was right back to the sash of sewage .
When those guys found out I was unemployed , they almost literally recoiled in horror .
I believe I would 've met with a more receptive crowd if I 'd asked for some of their teenage daughters ' used underwear .
I probably wo n’t be doing much more networking , at my age .
The interviews I attended several interviewing workshops after being restructured out the door by my old company , and they scared the crystal - clear ice water out of me .
They told us we could expect almost anything , then fired off horror story after horror story .
Everything 's changed , they said .
The traditional interview methods most people know have been almost completely abandoned .
Traditional , of course , is you and another person sitting on either side of a desk .
The hirer asks questions , and the potential hiree answers them .
That does n't happen anymore , they claimed .
It 's been replaced by New Methods .
You might , for instance , be subjected to an environment where you 're on one side of a giant conference table , with a freakin ' team of people on the other side , tag - teaming you and sitting in judgment .
I did n't like the sound of that one , not one tiny bit .
Or they might send you from office to office , talking to four or five different people over many hours .
That would be OK , I thought .
Better to get it over with .
Or they might ask you to explain - in excruciating detail - a certain problem you 've encountered in the past , and how you dealt with it .
This one scared me the most , because it can supposedly drag on for the better part of a day , and you 're required to recall every tiny inconsequential tidbit about the event .
It would probably be like going into " the box " with Pembleton on Homicide .
There are others , but these are the ones that jump immediately to mind .
And what kind of interviews have I actually encountered ?
That 's right , traditional .
For the most part , anyway .
Once there were three people on the other side of a table , but only one spoke .
I think they were just trying to screw with my head .
I 'm not sure the other two folks even worked there ; I suspect they were rentals .
So all that worrying and stressing about unorthodox interviewing methods has been for naught so far .
Except , of course , that I always feel a rush of relief when I realize it 's just going to be me and another person talking .
Maybe it was the counselors ' sneaky way of helping us , some kind of reverse - psychology ?
Perhaps they led us to believe we 'd likely be eaten alive , so we'd be happy about only losing an arm ?
I just do n't know .
Conclusion
The bottom - line to all this ?
I 'm prepared ; I 'm horribly unprepared .
I 'm doing the work necessary ; I 'm not doing nearly enough .
I 'm calm ; I 'm freaking the hell out .
I know what I 'm doing ; I 'm stumbling around with drool on my chin .
My background is solid ; who would possibly hire me ?
It 'll all work out in the long run ... but what if it does n't ?
Yeah , it 's under control .

American Stops Washing Hair !
At first glance , the ranch - style stucco house on a quiet Encino street looks no different from its neighbors .
A manicured lawn .
A bottlebrush tree .
Two cars in the driveway .
You could n’t tell , unless you climbed a ladder or glanced into the utility shed , that Richard and Barbara Braun ’s home is a foot soldier in the war against global warming .
On a south - facing slant of the roof , two solar panels warm pipes of circulating water for showers , dishwashing and laundry .
“ It ’s simple -- no complicated parts , ” said Braun , a retired surgeon .
A bill aimed at making such heating systems widely available is expected to move through the state Assembly ’s Appropriation Committee on Wednesday and to the full body next week .
Advertisement
But the bill , which would offer $ 250 million in incentives to build 200,000 solar water systems statewide over the next 10 years , is running into opposition from gas and electric companies .
They do n’t want the plan funded through a surcharge on residential and commercial gas bills .
“ It ’s a noble effort , ” said Avis Kowalewski , vice president for Western Regulatory Affairs at Calpine Corp. , which owns 22 gas - fueled power plants in the state .
“ But this bill could cost our company alone between $ 14 million and $ 18 million over 10 years . ”
But residential gas users would pay only about 13 cents a month extra , according to the California Public Utilities Commission .
And the benefits could be substantial .
Studies by KEMA - Xenergy , an energy consulting firm , show that using solar systems in California homes and businesses with access to sunlight could cut the use of residential natural gas by about 24 % and reduce total statewide consumption by more than 5 % , said Assemblyman Jared Huffman ( D - San Rafael ) , the bill ’s author .

Though natural gas is cleaner than oil or coal , its burning still spews carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and is a major cause of climate change , experts say .
“ This is one of the simplest , easiest steps we can take to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels , ” Huffman said .
Although a federal tax credit currently exists for installation of solar water heaters , no state subsidies have been available since the mid-1980s , when generous incentives were allowed to expire .
Last year , California enacted a “ million solar roofs ” bill , which allocates $ 3.2 billion in rebates for solar photovoltaic panels -- a sophisticated silicon - based technology -- that replace electricity .
But the final law excluded solar water heaters .
Advertisement
A residential solar water heating system can cost $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 , but with the incentives proposed under Huffman ’s bill , consumers could recoup their costs in less than 10 years through reduced gas bills .
On average , a solar system takes the place of about 75 % of the gas normally used in a home .
When Braun installed a solar water system 30 years ago , he had four children and a niece living in the house .
“ We saved a third of our gas bill , ” he said .
Now with only himself and his wife at home , “ The gas is rarely on . ”
For hotels , restaurants , apartment buildings and other big hot water users , the savings can make the difference between profit and loss .

“ They ’ve performed very well and saved me a bundle , ” said William McLaughlin , who installed solar water heaters in the 1980s on three of his Inglewood apartment buildings and on his own house in Rancho Palos Verdes .
On one 28 - unit building , which features 26 panels , the monthly gas bill runs $ 400 , but “ without solar , it would be $ 1,000 , ” McLaughlin said .
Unlike solar photovoltaic electricity , the technology for solar water heaters , also known as solar thermal , is hardly new .
The world ’s first solar water heater was patented in the U.S. in 1891 .
By 1897 , a third of all Pasadena homes had them .
But with the discovery of cheap natural gas in the Los Angeles Basin in the 1920s , solar went out of fashion .
The 1970s energy crisis revived the industry .
Federal and state subsidies that together covered 80 % of costs led to a proliferation of fly - by - night installers charging high prices .
Solar water heating got a bad name , and when the energy crisis lifted , subsidies dried up and the industry all but collapsed .
Last year , only 1,000 solar water heaters were installed in all of California .
Nationwide , 9,000 were installed , nearly half in Hawaii , where hefty rebates are offered .

In the meantime , improved technology and higher fuel prices are boosting the use of solar thermal around the world .
Installations jumped 14 % in 2005 , bringing the worldwide total to 46 million homes .
In Israel , 90 % of homes have solar water heaters .
Even Austria , with its chilly climate , installed 40 times more systems in 2005 than California -- although it has a quarter of the population .
In opposing the bill , Calpine is joined by San Francisco - based Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego - based Sempra Energy , which owns Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co .
But the gas companies and Huffman said they would work to forge a compromise .
There are signs that momentum is building for solar water heating , especially with mounting opposition to proposed liquid natural gas terminals .
A pilot program , sponsored by the Public Utilities Commission , will subsidize 750 installations in San Diego beginning this summer .

Today , homeowners and businesses are wary of the upfront costs of solar heating .
But “ the legislation will create a large enough market that prices will drop and it will become cost - effective in time , ” said Bernadette Del Chiaro , an energy expert for the advocacy group Environment California who helped draft the bill .

Revitalization Detroit : A Modern Day Ruin By Ryan McGreal
Published March 19 , 2007
Detroit , Michigan ( in Canadian pronunciation the name rhymes with " destroy it " ) is perhaps the archetypal automobile city .
Built to accommodate the people who built America 's cars , Detroit is a car city through and through , snaked with expressways and blotted with factories and warehouses - most now abandoned .
Detroit is profoundly suburban , with house after desolate house lining a seemingly endless wash of - wait for it - one - way streets , punctuated by scrapyards and abandoned lots .
Collections of blocks are bounded by mega - blocks a mile on a side , bordered by multi-lane super - roads and expressways .
The scale is staggering and it goes on like this for mile after mile after desparing mile .
Yes , those are cars in the bottom left corner ( Image Credit : Google Maps )
With resale ( mainly foreclosed ) properties starting under $ 10,000 , Detroit 's housing market is stuck deep in the doldrums .
For better or worse ( worse , mostly ) , the housing bubble of the past six years passed the city by .
Now , with subprime lenders teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and credit tightening , Reuters reports that houses in the Motor City now sell for less than cars .
Detroit , where unemployment runs near 14 percent and a third of the population lives in poverty , leads the nation in new foreclosure filings , according to tracking service RealtyTrac .
With large swaths of the city now abandoned , banks are reclaiming and reselling Detroit homes from buyers who can no longer afford payments at seven times the national rate .
A healthy economy is diverse .
Detroit bet the house on cars ( more recently , SUVs and pickups ) and is paying the price as more innovative companies operating in jurisdictions with more robust regulations produce better cars for less money .
A healthy transportation system is also diverse .
Detroit is designed so exclusively for cars ( big surprise ) that neighbourhoods cannot form , local economies cannot evolve , and the public realm is badly degraded .
There are so many negative object lessons to draw from Detroit that it 's hard to know where to start .
We can certainly posit the following :
The source of Detroit 's fame and growth was also the source of its dissolution .
Detroit followed the logic of automobile development to its logical conclusion , and it destroyed the city .
Now the US auto industry itself is in collapse .
Ford and GM are hemmorhaging money at an astonishing rate , and Daimler is looking to unload Chrysler .
All three are slashing their workforces as stagnant sales of their bloated SUVs and pickup trucks drive the companies closer to bankruptcy .

Internet search company Google could well have helped solve a 24 - year old unresolved crime .
In 1982 , Canadian man Jaroslaw ' Jerry ' Ambrozuk , 19 , crashed a rented plane in a lake and left his girlfriend to die .
The couple had been attempting to elope to the United States .
• Computer games ' should be in class '
Dianne Babcock , 18 , was found strapped into the passenger seat of a Cessna , 150 feet down at the bottom of the lake , uninjured apart from a broken collar bone .
Ambrozuk , disappeared , along with extra clothes and £ 10,000 that his girlfriend had taken from her savings account to fund their plan to start a new life in the US .
His disappearance sparked a manhunt in Canada , where the pair lived , and Montana , where the plane crashed into Bitterroot Lake .
Ambrozuk was featured on two episodes of America 's Most Wanted , the television show which targets fugitives .
In the weeks between the crash and the discovery of her body he called a friend in Vancouver from Montana , New York and Dallas , saying he could not save his girlfriend as her seatbelt had jammed when the plane flipped over and sank .
But he did not explain how he was able to save his extra clothes and the cash .
Ambrozuk then disappeared completely .
He was charged with negligent homicide , but Montana authorities held out little hope of finding him .
But in August this year , Flathead County Sheriff James Dupont received a phone call from a woman who had answered a lonely hearts advert on the Internet , posted by " Michael Lee Smith " , aged 34 .
They exchanged e-mails and then met in person .
Eventually , he told her his real name and date of birth .
She went home and did a Google search and found a newspaper story about the case .
Sheriff Dupont , who was at the lake when Babcock 's body was recovered , and thought he was doomed to retire at the end of the year with the case unsolved , said : " She was very legitimate sounding and knew things that only Jerry could have known . "
He recalls Babcock as a pretty girl with long blonde heir , whose body had been preserved by the cold water .
" She was n't injured to the point where she could n't get out of the aircraft , " he recalled , noting that her seat belt was not jammed . "
Thanks to the Google lead , police arrested Ambrozukin at his home in a wealthy Dallas suburb of Plano , Texas .
He had a £ 38,000 Dodge Viper car parked in the drive and a swimming pool in his back garden .
According to Police reports he ran a computer software company , and had a fake social security number and US passport .
Since his arrest , Ambrozukin has been flown back to Montana and is being held without bail .
He is due in court this week and also faces federal charges for living illegally in the United States .
Stunned neighbours recalled Ambrozuk as a quiet guy who led a good life which featured fast cars and skinny - dipping parties .
" He led what , for a lot of guys , would be a pretty enviable lifestyle , " said neightbour Steve Walton .
Babcock 's grandmother , Dorothy Babcock , who lives in Trail , British Columbia , said : " It was such a sad , sad thing .
Dianne had graduated and had put money down to go in and become a nurse .
" She did n't know she was going to die . "
Diary of an IT Innovator
I can take a nap almost anywhere .
When I travel , I ’m often asleep before the flight takes off .
I can even fall asleep in the dentist ’s chair waiting for the Novacaine to kick in .
At night , I ’m asleep in about five minutes .
I was n’t always that way .
Falling asleep is a skill .
I ’ll tell you my method .
I always start by creating a simple story in my head where something good , and highly unlikely , happens to me .
The trick is to focus on something that is more fascinating than your real life .
Maybe you are winning a prestigious award , inventing something that changes the world , or being the first person on the scene of an accident involving the Cirque de Soleil and a tanker of chemicals that turn out to be a powerful aphrodisiac .
The images should be more attractive than whatever bothersome thoughts would float into your head if you were n’t so busy fantasizing .
After a minute or two of that , I release all controlled thoughts and simply watch what floats by .
When my eyes are closed , the part of my brain that interprets vision is apparently still active , because I can see all sorts of random objects drifting by , as if a mall exploded in space .
I try to identify and name them as I see them .
Toaster…car…pencil …couch …snow blower , mitten , etc .
The next thing I know , I wake up .
That ’s my method .
What do you think about when you are trying to sleep ?
" Big Shots , " ABC 's mostly - comedic take on male bonding , is a man 's idea of a woman 's idea of men .
The show 's heroes - each the head of a corporation - are adorable , sensitive , flawed , and yearning for love .
And they 're eager to talk about it .
They gab about troubled relationships on the golf course , across the pool table , in the steam room at the gym .
They buy each other drinks , and sometimes cars , for consolation .
It 's a lot like " Sex and the City " for men , a comparison that surely came up when the show was pitched to network executives .
Except that these characters are n't wrestling with empowerment so much as they 're wallowing in victimhood .
They 're constantly beset by the women in their lives : badgering wives , cheating wives , fickle ex-wives , insidious ex-lovers .
This is the strange state of ABC 's female - friendly Thursday night lineup :
It has become a night of emasculated men and emasculating women .
If the classic male pinup was the strong , silent , unattainable type , tonight 's TV dream man is addled and fawning .
And the empowered woman - once a happy departure from older stereotypes - has become not just self - sufficient , but kind of mean .
In one sense , this is gender - bending stuff as old as Shakespeare , imagining what things might be like if men were more like women , and vice versa .
But on ABC , role - reversal is pursued with such vigor that it feels like a social mission : a feverish , wholly off - putting attempt to break free of the boy - meets - girl formula .
Nowhere is that clearer than on " Grey 's Anatomy , " ABC 's wildly - popular lead - in to " Big Shots , " where the character of Derek Shepherd - once known as " McDreamy " - has completed his transition from guy - the - heroine - pines - for - in - spite - of - herself to simpering McWeenie .
When he was introduced in season one - a neurosurgeon seducing medical intern Meredith Grey at a bar - Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) was the classic TV bad boy .
He was distant and commitment - phobic .
He nursed a deep dark secret .
He was " McDreamy " because he was a fantasy : attractive but unattainable .
Then Shepherd dated Grey , left Grey for his wife , left his wife for Grey , begged for Grey 's affection , rescued Grey from a near - death experience , and wound up so pathetically attainable that he lost his appeal altogether .
Lately , he 's taken to staring moonily into the distance , moaning about lost love and looking as if his pet parakeet has died .
" She does n't let me take care of her , " he lamented two weeks ago to Cristina Yang , Grey 's hard - charging confidante , as they watched a complicated surgery from an upstairs gallery .
" It 's not my job anymore .
She wo n't let me . "
" I'm taking care of her , " Yang replied coolly .
On " Grey's , " in short , empowerment has become a zero - sum game .
And a show that once found creative ways to ogle men has evolved into a show that wants to see them punished or demeaned .
Mark Sloan ( Eric Dane ) , the womanizing plastic surgeon dubbed " McSteamy , " is now in pursuit of Erica Hahn ( Brooke Smith ) , a hard - charging heart surgeon who calls Sloan and Shepherd " Pretty and Prettier . "
And of late , the male character most successful in romance is George O'Malley , the nerdy intern who is going through a remedial year .
One of the other characters nicknamed him " Bambi . "
Last month , the Boston Library Consortium of 19 research and academic libraries in New England that includes the University of Connecticut and the University of Massachusetts , said it would work with the Open Content Alliance to begin digitizing the books among the libraries ’ 34 million volumes whose copyright had expired .
“ We understand the commercial value of what Google is doing , but we want to be able to distribute materials in a way where everyone benefits from it , ” said Bernard A. Margolis , president of the Boston Public Library , which has in its collection roughly 3,700 volumes from the personal library of John Adams .
Mr. Margolis said his library had spoken with both Google and Microsoft , and had not shut the door entirely on the idea of working with them .
And several libraries are working with both Google and the Open Content Alliance .
Adam Smith , project management director of Google Book Search , noted that the company ’s deals with libraries were not exclusive .
“ We ’re excited that the O.C.A. has signed more libraries , and we hope they sign many more , ” Mr. Smith said .
“ The powerful motivation is that we ’re bringing more offline information online , ” he said .
“ As a commercial company , we have the resources to do this , and we ’re doing it in a way that benefits users , publishers , authors and libraries .
And it benefits us because we provide an improved user experience , which then means users will come back to Google . ”
The Library of Congress has a pilot program with Google to digitize some books .
But in January , it announced a project with a more inclusive approach .
With $ 2 million from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , the library ’s first mass digitization effort will make 136,000 books accessible to any search engine through the Open Content Alliance .
The library declined to comment on its future digitization plans .

The Open Content Alliance is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle , the founder and director of the Internet Archive , which was created in 1996 with the aim of preserving copies of Web sites and other material .
The group includes more than 80 libraries and research institutions , including the Smithsonian Institution .
“ I draw the line at war crimes , ” said Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the No. 2 commander in Iraq , meaning that no one who has committed war crimes could join the force .
“ Local commanders can and will draw a more stringent line if they believe it is necessary .
They understand the dynamics of their area better than I do .
We reconcile at the end of any war .
If we are able to buy time from the bottom up , that is a start .
That will help us buy time for the government of Iraq to continue to mature .
As those pockets of security get larger and larger , and we stitch them together , that buys time . ”
It was hoped that under the program Shiites , too , would eventually be recruited , but so far there had been little interest .
The fact that the patience of American politicians was running out had at least concentrated Sunni minds .
For many Sunnis , the American troops were the most reliable protectors they had , and the Americans were looking less like long - term occupiers with each passing day .
The development of new Sunni security forces was a way to blunt any Al Qaeda and Shiite militia countersurge when the Americans eventually pulled back .
That was the vision , and the relative success of recruiting efforts among the Sunnis had been the most favorable , if unexpected , development since the surge began .
Executing the policy , however , has been extremely tricky .
In effect , the American command has been moving on two parallel and possibly conflicting tracks .
One represented a decentralization of power , as the American military organized Sunnis into local security forces .
The second track was to centralize power in the Shiite - dominated government in Baghdad and to strengthen national institutions like the largely Shiite Iraqi Army .
The key to squaring the circle is to establish a link between the new Sunni forces in the field and Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s risk - averse government .
At first , the American effort to work with the tribes in Iraq ’s Anbar Province was not much of an issue ; Iraqi officials were happy to see them take on Al Qaeda militants and did not seem overly concerned about the role of the tribes in a remote western region that had no valuable resources and few Shiites .
But the closer the strategy came to Baghdad , the more anxious the Iraqi government seemed to be about new Sunni groups , and the process has sometimes been a matter of two steps forward , one step back .
In Baquba , the capital of Diyala Province north of Baghdad , where I spent much of June , more than a thousand Sunni locals , including former insurgents , had joined the “ Baquba Guardians . ”
They have not hesitated to challenge Al Qaeda , which , while just one of many insurgent organizations , has been linked to spectacular car bombs and other suicide attacks that have fanned sectarian tensions in Baghdad .
But the project ran into resistance from local Iraqi officials after some Guardians tried to take the next step and join the police .
Capt .
Ben Richards , the commander of Bronco Troop , First Squadron , 14th Cavalry Regiment , who was the first American officer to organize Sunnis in Baquba , told me that the Shiite provincial police chief had used ammunition as a means of political control .
When the province received a large quantity of ammunition from the Interior Ministry , the police chief distributed 40,000 rounds to the predominantly Shiite police force in the nearby town of Khalis .
Much of it is believed to have found its way to the Shiite Mahdi Army of Moktada al - Sadr .
Richards said the Sunni police in eastern Baquba had received nothing .
To oversee the engagement process , the Maliki government recently established a nine - member committee for national reconciliation .
The panel is headed by Safa al - Sheik , the deputy national security adviser and a former Air Force engineer during Hussein ’s rule ; it includes Bassima al - Jaidri , a Maliki aide with a reputation for sectarianism , along with security and intelligence officials .
When I met with Safa in his office in Hussein ’s old Military Industrialization Ministry , he insisted that the reconciliation panel had made progress in the month it had been in existence .
American officials say it has approved 1,738 of the 2,400 Sunnis who had been put forward to serve as policemen in the town of Abu Ghraib , just west of Baghdad .
Still , Safa acknowledged that many Iraqis are worried that the Americans might be inadvertently establishing new Sunni militias that would rise up against the authorities in Baghdad .
Newton , the British officer who was a leader of the Force Strategic Engagement Cell , had the job of bringing the Iraqi government along .
“ We do n’t dress it up , ” he told me .
“ Insurgent groups fear that if they cooperate , they will be targeted by the government of Iraq , and the government fears that the insurgent groups will turn on them after Al Qaeda has been dealt with .
So that is the risk .
We are not minimizing it .
The best way to deal with that risk is to hook these groups close to you .
By doing that , you bring them under a degree of control .
You have the opportunity to learn how they work , which amounts to an insurance policy of future reasonable behavior .

Is The New PSP For Me ?
When Sony first announced an updated PSP at 2007 's E3 show , a lot of people were straining to see what was so new about it .
Indeed , from a distance , the new PSP is almost indistinguishable from its predecessor .
But pick one up , and the differences are more apparent : it 's thinner , much lighter , and sleeker than the original .
It 's also got a few other new tricks under the hood .
The new PSP ( which Sony calls " the PSP 2000 , " to delineate from the earlier " PSP 1000 " model ) will be available in North America on September 10 in two different versions : a black PSP - only package ( $ 170 ) and the Daxter Entertainment Pack version , a $ 200 package that includes a silver PSP with the Daxter game , a Family Guy UMD video , and a 1GB Memory Stick Duo .
A similar Star Wars Entertainment Pack will follow a month later ( white PSP with black Darth Vader monogram and the Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron game -- but no MS Duo card included ) .
Expect the bundle configurations to be updated periodically , along with the possibility of new colors at any time in the future .
If you 're already familiar with the PSP , we 'll cut right to the chase .
The new PSP is an evolutionary upgrade , with the following key changes :
The new PSP is 19 percent thinner and fully one - third lighter than the original version of the console .
Anyone used to the older PSP will immediately notice the reduced weight as soon as they pick it up .
The thinner profile offers a slightly sleeker , more rounded look and feel .
Even better , however , is that all of the control buttons ( the D - pad on the left , the PlayStation circle , X , square , and triangle on the right , and the shoulder buttons on the top ) are all sitting a bit more elevated on the chassis ' face .
As a result , they have a bit more travel and spring to them .
They feel just a tad more responsive -- and that 's a good thing .
The new PSP utilizes a system setting called " UMD Cache " that enables faster loading of game discs .
The secret is the new PSP 's extra RAM -- it 's got 64MB versus the 32MB on the original model , and just like a PC , more memory enables faster performance .
Many games do indeed load faster -- while Test Drive Unlimited showed no real improvement in GameSpot 's testing , Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 and WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007 both showed nice gains , for instance .
But do n't expect miracles :
The UMD load times are still poky when compared to the lightning - fast , Flash - based games of the Nintendo DS and Game Boy .
The new PSP features an AV output jack ( which doubles as a standard headphone connector ) .
With the purchase of a special breakout cable ( composite and component versions are available for about US $ 20 apiece ) , you can display the PSP 's audio and video on virtually any TV .
But there are a few notable caveats -- most notably , the maximum video resolution varies according to the content displayed .
Video content from UMD discs ( prerecorded movies ) and Memory Stick ( home - ripped videos ) can be displayed at DVD - level 720x480 resolutions -- though quality will vary depending upon how the compression of the video in question -- but games are locked into the PSP 's native 480x272 display .
So , if your TV does n't have a robust zoom function , you 're stuck with a window - boxed experience for games .
Another potentially bigger problem with games is that they do n't seem to even work on TVs that can't handle progressive - scan ( 480 p ) output .
So while nearly any HDTV should be fine ( with the component cable ) , older televisions will be limited to displaying non-gaming video output .
The new PSP can be charged via the USB port , but it 's more trouble than it 's worth .
The resulting trickle charge will take about 5 hours to fully juice up the unit , versus about half that using the standard adapter .
Worse , the unit needs to be on and connected to a powered - up PC , and you have to engage the USB mode ( as you would when connecting to PC ) in order to activate the charge process .
If you really need USB charging , opt instead for the Kensington USB Power Tip - - the sub -$ 20 cable lets you charge any PSP ( new or old ) from any USB - powered jack , including that of an iPod power adapter or the Belkin Dual USB Power Adapter .
In other words , there are a couple of nice cosmetic improvements , but the USB charging and video output additions are something of a disappointment .
( Perhaps some of the problems can be addressed via future firmware upgrades . )
But demanding gadget fans will note that there 's still plenty of room for improvement .
Even without a radical redesign , the lack of a second analog stick and some built - in flash memory seems like a lost opportunity .
Likewise , some persistent annoyances -- such as the low volume levels and glossy fingerprint - prone screen -- are frustratingly intact .
And while it 's more a political than a technical limitation , Sony 's continued resistance to the homebrew movement seems shortsighted ; we 'd love to see the PSP be available as an open platform for third - party game and application developers without the need to hack it .
Aside from the slimmer dimensions ( 169.4 x 18.6 x 71.4 mm ) and lighter weight ( about 200 grams with the battery , game disc , and Memory Stick on board ) , the new Sony PSP does n't look much different from its predecessor .
The luscious 4.3 - inch wide - screen LCD display remains , bordered by controls on its left , right , and bottom side , plus two shoulder buttons along the top edge .
The button layout is based on the classic PlayStation controller layout -- four - way directional pad on the left , square , triangle , cross , and circle keys on the right -- so anyone who 's used a Sony console over the last decade should be able to pick up and play .
The bottom left of the front face also houses an analog thumbstick , for more precise movement .
More mundane media controls line the bottom of the screen : select , start , volume , brightness , and a " home " button .
The rounded contours on the backside of the earlier PSP have been replaced with a totally flat surface .
And we mean flat -- unlike the rough exterior of the older model , the skin of the new PSP is perfectly smooth .
And while it certainly looks even sexier , it may well be too smooth for the sweaty palms of some gamers .
They 'll probably want to invest in a case that doubles as a grip enhancer ( just be sure to wait for cases that are specifically designed for the new PSP , not its fatter older brother ) .
Other changes from the old to the new : the UMD bay is now a bit more low - tech ( instead of a sprint - loaded eject , you just pry open the chamber with your fingernail ) and the Wi-Fi on / off switch is on the top edge ( rather than the left side ) .
And the headphone / AV jack is on the bottom edge , free of the obstruction of the handstrap loop .
That does n't sound like a big improvement , but being able to use any set of 3.5 mm headphones -- regardless of the size of the plug nub -- is a nice contrast to the iPhone 's annoying restrictive recessed headphone jack .
The Memory Stick Duo slot remains on the left edge .
Like the UMD bay , it 's a pry-open cover that slides on rubbery plastic rails .
If you 're not buying a PSP bundle that includes an MS Duo card ( or do n't have a spare one from a Sony camera ) , you 'll want to invest in a decently sized one .
Thankfully , 1GB models are widely available for under US $ 30 .
The PSP 's interface is known as the Cross Media Bar , or XMB .
If you 've used the PlayStation 3 , or even one of Sony 's new high - end AV receivers or TVs , you already know what to expect :
It 's a pretty slick menuing system that 's generally pretty easy to maneuver through using the D - pad and control buttons .
As you get into some of the applications , however , that simplicity can get lost .
We wished the Web browser , for instance , was as well - designed as the overall XMB menu system .
The USB port remains centered on the top edge of the PSP .
Sony does n't include a cable , but it 's a standard mini-USB connector , so it 's likely that you already have one lying around .
The USB connector is flanked by two screw holes that allow for accessories to be firmly attached to its frame .
But most people will use the USB port for quick connections to the PC to transfer digital media -- photos , music , video , and even game demos available at Sony 's Web site .
The PSP is primarily a gaming device , but it 's got some notable media functionality as well .
The PSP can play videos from a variety of sources .
The easiest -- and most ill - advised -- is to buy prerecorded UMD video discs .
( With an extremely limited selection , and the fact that the PSP is the only place you can watch them , UMD videos are -- not surprisingly - - pretty hard to find . )
A better -- albeit more involved -- option is to copy your own videos from a computer onto a Memory Stick Duo card , and pop it in to the PSP .
A variety of free and commercial software products can convert files to PSP - friendly formats and resolutions ( MPEG4 or H.264-AVC , up to 720x480 ) .
Other content sources include TiVo Series2 ( the TiVo To Go Desktop software can convert recorded shows for viewing on the PSP ) and dedicated flash media recorders , such as the Neuros MPEG - 4 Recorder 2 Plus and the SanDisk V - Mate , which can be preset to record TV shows in PSP - compatible formats straight away , with no PC needed .
Built into the PSP is the ability to stream live TV from a Sony Location Free TV device , which is Sony 's take on the Slingbox .
As long as the PSP is in a Wi -Fi hotspot , it can stream the video and change the channels on a Location Free box , even if it 's halfway around the world .
The PSP doubles as a decent music player , with the ability to play DRM - free MP3 , WMA , WAV , AAC , and ATRAC3 files , along with support for album art .
Shuffle and repeat modes are supported , along with a visualizer function .
The PSP can display JPEG , GIF , and TIFF photos stored on the MS Duo card -- individually , or as a slideshow .
The PSP can log into a PlayStation 3 on a home network or via the Web , and stream any video , audio , or photos stored on the PS3 .
The PSP can also download and play some PlayStation Network game titles from the PS3 ( mostly PlayStation 1 titles that have been rereleased specifically for that purpose ) .
The PSP has a built - in Web browser , but it 's the one place -- more than games -- where you 'll really lament the device 's lack of a touchscreen ( or even a numeric keypad ) .
A lot of graphically rich pages will be cramped or broken on the screen , and the limited Flash support is n't particularly robust ( no Flash - based video , for instance ) .
That said , using the analog stick to control the cursor is nice , and any Wi-Fi connection is fair game ( it can handle WEP and WPA encryption ) .
And for a lot of people , it will be a better mobile Internet experience than they 're getting on a phone .
A separate RSS reader option is available , but it 's a little more complicated than we'd like to add your own feeds .
The PSP has an upgradeable firmware , and Sony has been diligent about adding additional features , fixes , and updates every few months .
The upgrade is as simple as choosing the option from the system menu .
Outside of North America , the PSP media options are even more robust : Japanese users have the option of a snap - on digital TV tuner for over - the - air broadcasts , while Europeans will soon have a video - on - demand service and VoIP communications .
Likewise , Sony 's international subsidiaries tout other PSP add - ons --a GPS device and a camera -- that never quite seem to turn up in the US .
Can the PSP take the place of your iPod , iPhone , or portable DVD player ?
For die - hard media junkies -- those with an 80 GB iPod filled to the brim with music and videos -- the answer is basically no .
But if you 're looking to travel with a few hours of music or some TV episodes , it makes for some nice diversion from a game , without having to lug a second device along .
And while the screen is n't as large as you 'd get with a portable DVD player , the PSP is decidedly less bulky -- and its screen is considerably larger than that of the iPod or the iPhone .
While its robust media and online functionality are impressive , for most buyers , they 'll be decidedly secondary to the PSP 's raison d'etre : Gaming on the go .
Yes , Nintendo's DS remains king of the portable gaming scene in terms of units sold , but plenty of people are looking for more sophisticated ( read : Less kiddie - oriented ) games than the DS offers .
And for those who can't abide the oh - so - cute antics of a Pokemon , Cooking Mama , Zelda , Mario , or Animal Crossing title , the PSP will be a welcome breath of fresh air .
The graphics on the PSP are noticeably better than those on the DS as well - - games are essentially at the level you 'd expect on the PlayStation 2 .
Early on , the PSP was knocked for being little more than the " PS2 portable , " because so many of its titles were simply ports of PlayStation 2 games .
And , indeed , its hit list is dominated by many PlayStation franchise standbys , including Grand Theft Auto , SOCOM , Tekken , and Burnout .
But many of these are phenomenal titles that have been designed for the PSP from the ground up .
Genre strong suits include sports , racing , action , and shooter titles , but it 's not all sweat and blood , either -- plenty of quirky puzzle games ( Lumines , Puzzle Quest , Loco Roco ) are available , as well as a host of family - friendly favorites as well ( Daxter , Ratchet and Clank ) .
It 's also worth noting that many of the PSP games include an online multiplayer component .
Some games offer ad hoc multiplayer ( peer to peer , for playing against other PSP 'ers in the same room ) , others offer Internet play , or both .
Online gameplay is free , and -- while the experience varies from title to title and is dependent on network speed -- it can be just as fun and fulfilling as playing on a home console .
To keep its slim figure , the new PSP has a flatter 1,200 mAh battery than the more bulbous 1,800 mAh one on the previous model .
But , because it uses power more efficiently , it 's actually rated for the same play time - - 3 to 6 hours of gameplay , or 3 to 5 of video playback .
Going on a long flight ?
The more capacious battery actually fits into the battery bay , and offers several more hours of battery life -- but the battery cover wo n't fit over the top of it .
( Sony will be selling an extended battery kit , with the larger battery and proper cover . )
The better battery life is welcome , of course , but PSP gamers will be disappointed -- unlike that Energizer Bunny of gaming systems , you 'll need to be juicing up the PSP more frequently .
Someday , no doubt , Sony will debut a full - on PSP2 , with a host of next - gen features and a more radical redesign .
But for now , we 've got an evolutionary upgrade of a portable gaming and media console that already had a lot going for it .
Existing PSP owners wo n't need to run out and get this new version unless they really need one of the key upgrades -- video out , lighter weight , or faster load times .
Anyone else need only look at the available lineup of PSP games .
If playing sophisticated , graphically rich versions of games such as Syphon Filter , Metal Gear Solid , MLB : The Show , and -- in 2008 -- God of War is appealing to you , the PSP will ensure that you 'll always be entertained .
With its impressive game library , lower price , and expanded feature set , it 's certainly a much better deal than the original PSP was when it debuted in 2005 .
And while its media and online functions wo n't necessarily replace a dedicated AV device or laptop , you may well find it to be good enough in plenty of situations .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Irregular verbs are the bane of any effort to learn English , but new research looking at how language evolves suggests frequent use keeps pesky irregular verbs like “ take ” from evolving into “ taked . ”

Irregular verbs are the bane of any effort to learn English , but new research looking at how language evolves suggests frequent use keeps pesky irregular verbs like " take " from evolving into " taked . "
REUTERS / Catherine Benson
The research , published on Wednesday in the journal Nature , suggests that frequent use -- in many languages , not just English -- gives words their staying power .
It ’s a linguistic use it or lose it rule .
“ The top 10 verbs in the English language are all irregular , even though irregular verbs make up only 3 percent of the language , ” said Erez Lieberman , a graduate student in applied mathematics at Harvard University ’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics .
The 10 most commonly used verbs in English are the irregular verbs to be , to have , to do , to go , to say , to see , to take and to get , plus the auxiliary verbs can and will .
Most English verbs use the standard - ed ending when forming the past tense .
Lieberman believes this rule won an evolutionary battle of the fittest .
“ There are these six other rules ( for forming the past tense ) that existed 1,200 years ago that died , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ Irregular verbs are the fossils of these six dead rules .
When a rule emerges , it emerges by killing off the others , ” he said , adding , “ Frequency is the armor against the - ed rule . ”
Lieberman said this frequency theory has been long held by linguists , but he and colleagues set out to prove it mathematically .
They undertook an exhaustive study of irregular verbs to find out which verbs have succumbed to the - ed rule .
Of the 177 irregular verbs that existed 1,200 years ago , 145 survived into Middle English and just 98 remain today .
With this database and frequency data , they arrived at a formula that predicts the half - life of irregular verbs -- much like the half - life of a radioactive atom .
As it turns out , the rate at which an irregular verb decays is inversely proportional to the square root of how frequently it is used .
So , a verb used 100 times less frequently will evolve 10 times as fast .
WEDDED BUT NOT THINKED
Based on this model , Lieberman and colleagues predict some other words will soon conform to the - ed rule .
First up will be the verb “ to wed . ”
He predicts couples will soon be “ newly wedded ” and not “ newly wed . ”
Favorite verbs like “ to be ” will likely survive unchanged for another 38,000 years while “ to think ” has 14,400 years before “ thought ” becomes “ thinked . ”
The frequency rule appears not to be restricted to irregular verbs , however .
In a separate paper , Mark Pagel of the University of Reading and colleagues used a statistical modeling technique to analyze four languages : English , Spanish , Russian and Greek .
They compared this to a database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 languages and found that across all 200 meanings , commonly used words evolve much more slowly .
“ The words that change the most slowly include numbers , pronouns and special adverbs , ” Pagel said in e-mailed comments .
“ These all seem to carry lots of meaning , whereas conjunctions and prepositions , which evolve rapidly , often act as place holders , ” he said .
The reason may be that when a word is common , “ ... we are more likely to be ‘ corrected ’ by hearing someone else speak . ”
Pagel said the findings help us understand why languages seem to resist change .
Times : Bush plans to keep Pakistan from being mockery of democracy ' fell apart spectacularly '
John Byrne

In a somewhat sharply worded news analysis in Sunday 's editions of The New York Times , the paper of record takes the president to task on his seeming failure to maintain order in Pakistan .
" For more than five months the United States has been trying to orchestrate a political transition in Pakistan that would manage to somehow keep Gen.
Pervez Musharraf in power without making a mockery of President Bushs promotion of democracy in the Muslim world , " pens the Times ' Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Helene Cooper .
" On Saturday , those carefully laid plans fell apart spectacularly , " they continue .
" Now the White House is stuck in wait - and - see mode , with limited options and a lack of clarity about the way forward . "
Musharraf declared emergency rule Saturday evening , putting the Army in charge of Islamabad .
Most of the Supreme Court was disbanded after they refused to certify his decision ; Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry was placed under house arrest .
Telephone lines were cut and critical media outlets shuttered .
The Times said Pakistan was close to a Bush administration nightmare -- an " American - backed military dictator who is risking civil instability in a country with nuclear weapons and an increasingly alienated public " Stolberg and Cooper also note that top Al Qaeda leaders and Osama Bin Laden are " believed to be hiding out in the mountainous border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan . "
Taken together , these statements could indicate a greater threat to the United States ' security than Iran : an " American - backed military dictator who is risking civil instability in a country with nuclear weapons and an increasingly alienated public " on whose border Osama Bin Laden and top Al Qaeda leaders are " believed to be hiding out . "
Musharraf was one of Bush 's chief allies in the region , despite his all - but - dictatorship .
The US has given Pakistan more than $ 10 billion in aid -- " mostly to the military , since 2001 . "
Now that military is patrolling the streets of Islamabad , cutting off phone lines and critical media outlets and placing opposition leader Imran Khan under house house arrest .
After Musharraf 's decision to suspend the constitution , the Times notes : " there was no immediate action by the [ Bush ] administration to accompany the tough talk . "
Tough talk ?
" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , traveling in the Middle East , called Mr. Musharrafs move ' highly regrettable , ' while her spokesman , Sean D. McCormack , said the United States was ' deeply disturbed . ' "
Teresita Schaffer , an expert on Pakistan at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington told the paper Musharrafs decision was a big embarrassment for the administration .
 There s going to be a lot of visible wringing of hands , and urging Musharraf to declare his intentions ,  Schaffer remarked .
 But I dont really see any alternative to continuing to work with him .
They cant just decide they re going to blow off the whole country of Pakistan , because it sits right next to Afghanistan , where there are some 26,000 U.S. and NATO troops . 

When I met you in 1990 , you said that you 'd marry the man who'd follow you around the world .
We were just sophomores in high school , so I did n't know what to think .
I thought it was just some school girl romantic fantasy .
All I knew was that you were the girl for me .
We were only 15 years old , but I had this feeling that you 'd play a major role in my life .
After we graduated from Aragon High School in San Mateo , you revealed to me that you were accepted to Berkeley , but you wanted to go to Germany for college .
Remember that night we spent ice skating at Fashion Island ?
You said that you loved me , but you had to cut off all ties with to be able to move on .
That was the last time I ever saw you .
I said I 'd wait for you , but you told me not to and to just move on ... but I remember what you said sophomore year .
You were accepted at the University of Tübingen , Berlin .
I left home for Berlin .
For 4 years I looked for you .
You made the impact you always did in Berlin .
People heard of you , but did n't know where you were .
Nobody helped me .
I was n't good enough for Tübingen , so I attended Technische Universität Berlin where I earned a degree .
I am now fluent in German , a language I never intended to learn .
After graduation , I returned to San Mateo thinking you returned as well .
I called your mother on the summer after you graduated , she said you had left for grad school in Tokyo .
I left again , this time , to Tokyo .
Auf Wiedersehen .
Your father said you are studying business at Keio University in Tokyo .
I looked all over Tokyo for you .
From the morning rush at Shinjuku Station , to the last train on the Tozai - line bound for Nakano .
You were never found .
To make ends meet , I got a job at NOVA , then in 1998 I got a real job at DoCoMo .
I fell in love with Japan and its culture .
I learned the language , and I am now fluent .
Another language I never intended to learn .
I went to the graduate office at Keio University 's school of business seeing if you were set to graduate .
There you were , on the list .
I was denied entry to the ceremony since I had no tie to anyone graduating .
That was the closest I had ever come to seeing you since grad night back in high school .
Two months after graduation , I resigned from DoCoMo .
I recieved an email from your cousin ( You know , Jerry 's ex- girlfriend ) saying you had gotten a job in Hong Kong .
I left my friends , my job , my home , my fiance , and everything Tokyo gave me to search for you .
I 'm so sorry Mizuki .
Kima wa itsumo kokoro no naka ni iru .
It was 1999 , and I had just arrived in Hong Kong , and so did you .
Six months later , I found out you had left Hong Kong because you did n't enjoy your new job .
From Causeway Bay to Kowloon , there were traces of you , but never the real entity .
Your father told me you went to India for training for a tech company , then were to be set up in London .
I do n't know if I searched for you for no reason , but then again , my searches have always been fruitless .
I went to Seoul to take up a lucrative job offer at one of LG 's sister companies , Hiplaza , Inc .
In late 1999 , I had already been established in Korea .
I worked for Hiplaza , then 3 years later , LG .
For the first time , I was free of the feeling of having to look for you .
I was in a place I knew you were n't It was like a dream .
A world without you .
The dream ended 3 months ago when I left LG .
Now the curse of your existence has returned .
An nyonghi jumuship siyo .
I 'm now back in San Mateo .
I have n't been here in the bay area since 1996 .
All my high school friends are either married , dead , or gone without a trace .
I have nobody here but my dysfuctional family .
Your brother said last month that you 're still in London and will return to the bay area permanently this summer .
I chased you around the world for 12 years , learned 3 languages , made quite an amount of money , just to meet you in the town where it all began .
Fashion ISland is n't even there anymore , but the ice skating rink is still there .
I 'm not German , I 'm not Japanese , and I am not Korean , but I can say anything in those languages , but I can't say anything to bring you back .
You made the biggest changes in my life without barely stepping foot into it .
I do n't know if I should thank you or hate you , but one thing I 'm sure of , I miss you dearly .
Your cousin told me what your brother could n't bring himself to tell me .
3 hours ago I recieved an email saying the reason why you 're coming back is because you want to have your wedding in San Francisco , and that it was your fiance 's idea .
Fuck you .
Mr. Martin has long said that he favors à la carte because it ’s pro-consumer , but most people in the cable industry — none of whom will speak on the record , for fear of angering the F.C.C. chairman — are convinced that he favors it for the same reason Mr. Winter does : it will allow parents to keep MTV and its ilk out of their homes .
Mr. Martin , who is widely expected to run for office someday in his native North Carolina , has made no secret of the fact that he has “ strong concerns ” about the amount of sex , violence and profanity on television , as he put it in an interview this year with Broadcasting & Cable magazine .
Yet as appealing as the idea might seem at first glance , there is a reason that Congress has not taken the bait and passed an à la carte law .
À la carte would be a consumer disaster .
For those of you who yearn for it , this is a classic case of “ be careful what you wish for . ”
Image Kevin J. Martin of the F.C.C. is the top backer of à la carte .

•
For backers of à la carte , their big moment came in 2004 , when Michael K. Powell , a champion of deregulation , was still F.C.C. chairman .
Asked by Congress to look into the feasibility of à la carte pricing Mr. Powell had the F.C.C. ’s economists work up a study .
To the surprise of many — including , I ’m told , Mr. Powell himself — the study concluded that à la carte would have the exact opposite effect from what its backers claimed .
Instead of reducing prices , à la carte would cause cable bills to rise for most people .
And it would cause many channels to go out of business .
Mr. Powell turned the study over the Congress , and that was that .
Except it was n’t .
Soon afterward , Mr. Martin was named chairman of the commission — and one of his first acts was to “ redo ” the F.C.C. study .
Sure enough , the new study attacked the old one , and claimed that à la carte would , indeed , be good for consumers .
That , in turn , led to a flurry of condemnations and yet more studies that picked apart Mr. Martin ’s study .
The F.C.C. chairman was accused of doctoring the numbers to get the result he wanted .
The study fiasco so hurt Mr. Martin ’s credibility that when an à la carte bill came up in the Senate Commerce Committee last year — a bill Mr. Martin backed — it lost 20 - to - 2 .
But wait : how can it be that à la carte will cause cable prices to rise ?
If you are subscribing to far fewer channels , does n’t it therefore follow that your bill will be lower ?
Strange as this may seem , the answer for most people is no .
True , if you decide to take only one or two channels , à la carte pricing will save you money .
But how many people are going to limit themselves to one or two channels ?
In fact , even if you pick as few as a dozen channels , à la carte will almost surely cost more than your current “ exorbitant ” cable bill .
Personal finance is something that we care about here at Mint .
Learn more with great personal finance tips in our blog article index .
More than 10,000 books have been written about personal finance .
You could spend a lifetime reading them .
Some of them are great1 ; others are 99 % motivation , 1 % actual , actionable information2 .
The truth is personal finance is simple .
Every one of these books can be reduced into three basic principles :
Spend less than you earn
Make the money you have work for you Be prepared for the unexpected
While the principles might sound like common sense , the real trick is to truly understand them , and more importantly , to apply them .
Our Stance : Mint.com was founded to make personal finance simple , understandable , and ultimately life - enhancing .
Money , after all , is a means to an end .
It ’s a tool for doing more , and having more time .
It ’s not just about increasing your net worth or saving for retirement .
As we say at Mint , money is for living .
Spend Less Than You Earn
Put another way , “ spend less than you earn ” means : live within your means , do n’t overspend , do n’t get yourself into debt and start saving .
Easy to say , not so easy to do — especially given the appeal of a new car , a sweet home theater , a couple nights each week out with friends , and a posh tropical vacation every once in a while .
However , setting up a budget and checking in with your spending on a regular cadence is key .
Creating a budget does n’t have to be complex ; budgeting methods such as the 50/30/20 rule make it easy to get started .
This rule stipulates that you spend :
50 % of your monthly income on essentials
30 % of your monthly income on wants
20 % of your monthly income on savings
Try our calculator ; simply put in your monthly income ( after taxes ) , and see how much you have to funnel into each category of purchase .

Here ’s how much you have for : Essentials $ 0.00 Wants $ 0.00 Savings $ 0.00 Monthly after - tax income Reset
Consider Big Spending Decisions , and Plan Accordingly
Creating to and sticking to your budget is the first step , but what about those big purchases ?
You know , the big decisions that significantly affect your expenses ( and therefore your ability to save for other things ) more than anything else .
These are the areas where you need to go in understanding the costs involved , so that you come out remaining financially strong .
1. Buying a House
A house is likely the most expensive purchase you ’ll ever make .
And it ’s not just the mortgage , its property taxes , home owner ’s insurance , maintenance , and the time it takes to mow the lawn .
Too many people think that buying a home is automatically a good investment , since you ’re “ not throwing money away on rent . ”
While owning a home of your own may be the American dream , it does n’t always make economic sense .
If you live in California , the Northeast , or Southwest where housing prices have doubled or tripled in the last 10 years , it ’s almost always better to rent and invest the difference ( more on this in principal # 2 ) .
Even if you live outside those regions , if you move within the next five years ( and if you ’re in your 20s that ’s almost a certainty ) , the closing costs and 6 % realtor fees will eat away your gains .
By contrast , if you plan to stay in the same area indefinitely , a house may be one of the best investments you make .
To determine what ’s right for you , I like the NY Times Rent vs. Buy Calculator .
It ’s the best one on the web , and easy to use : just enter your rent and the price to buy a comparable place3 .
2. Kids ( and when to have them )
Children can be an amazing source of joy in your life .
If you ’re planning to have some , it ’s important to realize the expense involved , so you can make the best decision on when to do so .
Kids mean more money spent on a bigger house , a bigger car , food , clothes , healthcare , and education .
The cost of raising a child calculator at BabyCenter does a good job of breaking things down by region and household income level .
In today ’s dollars , most estimates approach $ 200,000 per child ( excluding college ) .
That ’s about $ 11,000 per year per child .
This cost can be lessened dramatically by waiting a few years .
If you wait to have kids for 4 years , and instead invest that $ 11,000 per year at a 10 % return , you would have $ 67,000 by time your child is born .
As you begin to take $ 11,000 per year out for child - related expenses , part of your original investment continues to grow .
In the 18 years spent raising your child , you will expend only $ 100,000 out of pocket .
It ’s like having a child at half the cost .
3 . Where you live
You probably choose where to live based on job opportunities , proximity to family and friends , or a great climate .
But where you live has a big impact on how much you can save .
For example , if you make $ 75,000 a year in Austin , you would need to make $ 135,000 in San Francisco to maintain your lifestyle .
That ’s an 80 % increase in cost of living .
Unfortunately , moving from Austin to San Francisco , salaries typically increase by only 30 % .
To compare major cities , I like BankRate ’s cost of moving calculator .
It shows the difference in housing costs , doctor ’s appointments , and even the cost of a haircut .
4. Car ( new or used )
Automobile manufacturers and dealers spent more than $ 15 billion in 2007 to convince you to buy a new car4 .
Seriously , that ’s billion with a “ b ” .
Let ’s say you cave and decide to get a 2009 Chevy Malibu because it will “ only ” cost $ 21,000 .
Three years later , the car has depreciated by $ 8,000 and you ’ve paid more than $ 3,000 in finance charges – a total expense of $ 11,000 .
If you bought a used 2005 Malibu instead , depreciation and finance charges add to only $ 3,500 .
That ’s a $ 7,500 difference .
You can see the calculation yourself at Edmunds .
Maybe you want something better than a Malibu .
Buy a 2005 BMW 545i for $ 28,000 instead of the 2009 550i for $ 60,000 .
It will cost $ 32,000 less to buy used , and you ’ll save $ 25,000 in depreciation and finance charges over the next 3 years .
Always buy used , even if only last year ’s model ( I myself own a ’ 94 and a ’ 96 ) .
Impressing the neighbors ( or the ladies ) with an ever so slightly better model probably is n’t worth it .
Easy Ways to Maximize Your Savings
Beyond the “ big four ” financial decisions , there a few things everyone can do to maximize savings .
And they can all be done without radically altering your lifestyle .
Get a credit card that pays you :
Always use a credit card – instead of a debit card , checks or cash – if you pay off your balance in full each month .
A credit card gives you a 30 - day interest free loan , more rewards , and in conjunction with a tool like Mint , better visibility into exactly where your money goes .
Turn the tables on your credit card company and make them pay you with a rewards card .
Whether you opt for points , miles , or cash back is up to you , but do n’t settle for anything less than 1 % back ( or 1 point or mile per dollar ) .
Usually , you can do much better .
Discover ® More Card with $ 50 Cash Back Bonus offers 5 % cash back in categories like travel , home improvement stores , gas , restaurants , and groceries , and up to 1 % on all other purchases .
Capital One® No Hassle Miles℠ Rewards earns you 1.25 miles for every dollar spent on purchases .
The catch is that most cards offering 3 - 5 % cash back have a cap on rewards .
Keeping track of all the restrictions , and calculating whether it ’s better to get cash back on restaurants or utilities is difficult .
Fortunately , Mint does all that work for you .
Based on your unique spending categories , Mint finds the card that maximizes your rewards .
If you carry a balance on your credit card , maximizing your rewards is secondary .
Paying down your debt comes first .
A $ 5,000 credit card bill paid off at a $ 100 minimum monthly payment takes 9 years to pay off .
In that time , you will have spent $ 5,100 in interest charges alone !
You can do the calculation yourself at Yahoo Finance .
If you switch to a 0 % introductory rate card ( and keep switching when the introductory rate expires ) , that $ 100 a month payment means you ’ll be debt free in less than half the time .
The Citi® Platinum Select® MasterCard® charges no interest on balance transfers for up to 18 months and has no annual fee .
Upgrade your bank account :
This year , US banks are expected to charge consumers over $ 55 billion in fees5 .
To add insult to injury , the average savings account pays you only 0.50 % interest ( and most checking accounts earn no interest at all ) .
Banks work by accumulating deposits , then loaning that money out as a mortgage or to a business .
Those loans are paid back at an interest rate that is typically around 5.00 % ~ 8.00 % .
If the average bank pays you only 0.50 % , they ’re taking that difference as profit — profits that could go to you .
Get a savings account from Ally Bank or Capital One that pays much more .
Better rates , better savings .
Why settle for 0 % from your checking or 0.50 % from your savings ?
When compared to an account at 0.50 % , a savings of $ 20,000 in a 5.00 % account can earn you an extra $ 1,000 per year !
Upgrade your bank .
Here are high - yield accounts for your checking and savings .
Checking : E*Trade Max - Rate Checking Account
Savings : Ally Bank
Get a lower price on your bills :
No one likes to overpay , but most of us do .
Are you sure you ’ve got the best price for your internet , TV , or mobile phone service ?
Probably not .
New plans , equipment , and promotional rates come out every day .
Frequently , the biggest savings come from bundling multiple services together .
By switching to Comcast or AT&T you can get phone , TV and internet all for about $ 100 a month ( including taxes and fees ) .
That can save an average household $ 300 - $ 800 each year .
A dollar saved is many dollars earned :
Lower prices on everyday bills , a credit card that pays you , and a bank account that earns maximum interest add up .
On Mint , we ’ve found that the average household can save nearly $ 1,800 each year .
If you start when you ’re 30 , investing that savings at a 10 % return means $ 569,000 by age 65 .
And that leads us to our next topic : the power of compound interest .
Takeaways :
Consciously weigh the financial impact of buying vs. renting , when to have kids , & where you live .
Buy your cars used .
Get a credit card like Discover® More Card with $ 50 Cash Back Bonus or Capital One® No Hassle Miles ℠
Rewards that pays you back with cash or miles .
Pay off your credit cards , highest interest first .
Put your savings in a high - yield account like Ally Online Savings Account .
Use Mint to manage your finances and find a lower price on your monthly bills

In my opinion , while popular , it is largely fluff with only one specific , actionable suggestion : buy real estate as an investment and rent it out .
Under the “ General ” settings for the Rent vs. Buy Calculator , you should try these settings : increase your investment return from 5 % to 10 % , and income tax rate from 20 % to 35 % .

Make the Money You Have Work for You
If you saved $ 10,000 a year for the next 40 years and earned no interest , you would have $ 400,000 .
If you invested $ 10,000 a year and earned a 10 % return each year , you would have $ 5,267,155 .
Why the difference ?
Because your interest earns interest , and its interest earns interest , and so on .
The result is exponential growth .
Remember calculus ?
This time it actually works for you .
To obtain real wealth , you need to redeploy your money .
And that means investment .
It ’s how capitalism works .
You can put your money into stocks where you own a part of a corporation ; bonds where you loan your money out and earn interest in return ; real estate ; or start your own business .
Managing real estate can be a full time job , and owning your own business certainly is .
Since both of these may require radical changes in life style , we ’ll ignore them to focus on investments open to everyone : stocks and bonds .
Stocks vs. Bonds :
Over the last 200 years , stocks have consistently and reliably outperformed bonds .
Not counting inflation , stocks have averaged 10 % a year ; and 14 % for the past 20 years .
Accounting for inflation , stocks have provided a “ real ” return of 7 % annually , doubling their value every 7 years .
By contrast , bonds have produced an average real return of 4.5 % , doubling only every 16 years1 .
For money you need in the next four years , stocks may not be the right choice .
In the short term , the market may swing widely up or down .
You can lose money .
In the long term , however , a portfolio weighted heavily in stocks has consistently outperformed one weighted towards bonds or other fixed - income investments ( such as CDs or money market funds ) .
Individual stocks are risky .
Any one company might go out of business , suffer an accounting scandal , or miss their quarterly earnings .
To distribute your risk ( or in investment terms “ diversify your portfolio ” ) , buy a mutual fund .
But be aware of the big differences between those that are “ actively managed ” vs. “ indexed ” .
Some mutual funds are actively managed by professionals .
This active trading comes with a cost : management fees , administrative fees , and transaction costs can eat up to 2 % of your investment each year .
Active trading also means more taxes in the form of short term capital gains .
Are they worth the cost ?
Often , they ’re not : 80 % of mutual funds under - perform the S&P 500 index .
You should also be aware that choosing the right mutual fund is nearly as hard as choosing the right stock .
By contrast , index funds are “ passive ” – these funds invest in specific set of stocks designed to simply mirror the market instead of trying to out - guess it .
The result : fees at index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 are less than 0.20 % annually .
Pay Yourself First :
You pay the government .
You pay your rent ( or mortgage ) .
You pay your bills .
How about paying your ( future ) self for change ?
They key is to do it automatically , every paycheck , before you get a chance to spend or even see the money .
If your company has a 401 k plan , start contributing .
This money comes out of gross - pay and is not taxed .
Even better , companies often “ match ” employee contributions .
You put in $ 1 , they put in $ 1 ; it ’s like doubling your money immediately .
Even if you company matches only $ 0.50 to the dollar , that ’s still an instant 50 % return .
If your company does not have a 401k ( or you ’ve maxed it out ) , you can setup “ automatic ” investments with E*Trade , Fidelity , Vanguard , and most major brokerages .
Each month , they ’ll take $ 1,000 from your checking account , and put it towards the investment ( hopefully an index fund ! ) of your choosing .
The Magic of Compound Interest :
The end result of automatic monthly investments : wealth that grows year after year .

Think you ’ll be a millionaire ?
Be wary of taxes .
Instead of a 10 % return , taxes knock it back to 7 % .
If you ’re 30 , that means your $ 500 a month investment drops from $ 1,898,319 to $ 900,527 .
But there is a way to avoid taxes ; it ’s called an IRA ( Individual Retirement Account ) .
Like a 401k , an IRA allows your money to grow tax - free until you take it out for retirement .
Unfortunately , if you need to money before retirement , you ’ll be hit with penalties and be forced to pay the extra taxes .
A better alternative , especially if you ’re young , may be a Roth IRA .
Contributions to a Roth IRA are made from after - tax income .
As a result , you can withdraw your original contributions at any time , penalty and tax - free .
By “ avoiding taxes ” and investing small amounts every month , anyone can achieve financial security .
Takeaways :
Weigh your long term portfolio heavily towards stocks .
For money needed in less than four years , keep it in a high - yield savings account , money market fund , or CD .
Invest $ 100 - $ 1,000 a month automatically into index funds or the closest alternative offered by your company ’s 401k plan .

See “ Stocks for the Long Run ” by Jeremy Siegel , Chapter 1 .
Prepare for the Unexpected
The best laid financial plan can be quickly ruined by a streak of misfortune : job loss , fire , theft , or health problems .
You need to protect yourself , but it ’s not nearly as hard as you think .
Emergency Fund :
Without savings , living paycheck - to - paycheck leaves you vulnerable .
You need a buffer , a way to get back on your feet if disaster strikes .
Save enough for at least three months ’ expenses .
For most people , that should be $ 10,000 - 20,000 .
This is savings separate and distinct from your vacation fund and your investments .
It ’s your “ open in case of emergencies only ” fund .
Build your emergency fund .
Earn rates much higher than that of the national average .
Just pay careful attention to the minimum balance require to avoid fees ; amount required to open account ; and amount required to maintain yield .
Accelerate your emergency fund .
Here are two accounts that offer competitive rates .
Ally Online Savings Account
CapitalOne Online Savings Account
Insurance :
Yes , if you ’re an adult , you need insurance .
And no , not just car insurance .
What you need depends on where you are in life .
Medical bills are cited in about half of all bankruptcies1 .
And it ’s no wonder .
Break your leg rock - climbing and you could be stuck with a $ 5,000 + bill .
If your company does n’t provide it , you need health insurance .
If you ’re in your twenties or early thirties , choose an inexpensive plan with a high deductible .
You want something to protect you from disaster , but without breaking the bank .
In most states , you can find a plan with a $ 2-3,000 deductible for $ 50 - 100 per month .
You may not have the prescription drug benefits , or the low co-pay of those $ 300 per month plans , but if you only go to the doctor once or twice a year , you ’ll come out way ahead .
If you rent , you need renter ’s insurance .
Sadly , only about 33 % of renters actually buy this coverage2 .
Renter ’s insurance protects you against fire , theft , and most natural disasters .
Step back and think about how much it would cost to replace your computer , TV , couch , bed , and everything else you own .
With renter ’s insurance , you can get $ 20 k in coverage for only $ 10 - 15 a month .
It ’s dirt cheap and worth it .
Renter ’s insurance also protects you outside your apartment .
If your car window is smashed and someone grabs your laptop , your car insurance will only cover the window , not the laptop .
A good $ 20,000 renter ’s insurance policy would give you up to $ 2,000 to replace your loss .
Keep in mind that roommates ’ possessions are not covered ; your roommate needs a policy of his or her own .
Takeaways :
Save $ 10 - 20 k in an emergency fund .
Keep that fund in a high - yield savings account like Ally Bank or Capital One .
If you need health insurance , consider a $ 50 - $ 100 a month high - deductible plan .
Being without health insurance leaves you too vulnerable to bankruptcy or worse .
If you rent , get rent ’s insurance .
It ’s only $ 120 - $ 160 per year .

Financial Success in Three Steps :
We ’ve now reduced personal finance to three simple principles , and no more than a dozen action items .
But where do you start right now ?
1. Use Mint …and see where your money goes
The first step to financial success is to know where you stand .
You need a complete picture of how much you have , how much you owe , and where it ’s all going .
With Mint , you get all of that – for free , and with less than five minutes of setup .
2 . Pay off your credit cards ( highest rate first )
We ’ve already shown you that a $ 5,000 credit card bill paid off at $ 100 a month will take nine years and $ 5,100 in additional interest charges .
If you ’re paying 20 % interest on credit card debt , action item number one is to pay it off before you do anything else .
There ’s no point investing your money at a 10 - 15 % gain , when it could be used to avoid a 20 % loss .
3. Setup automatic investments
The key to wealth is compound interest .
Invest just $ 200 every month when you ’re 25 and at a 10 % return , you ’ll have $ 1.2 m by 65 .
You ’ll also have savings in case of emergency , money for your children ’s college , and the ability to borrow from your investments for a down - payment on a house .
Not sure you can find $ 200 a month ?
Mint shows the average user over $ 1,800 in annual savings – that ’s $ 150 a month right there .
You ’ll be well on your way .

late one afternoon in October 2006 , Carolyn and Ghassan Daher took their five - year - old son Brayden to a party near Seattle .
Kids got goody bags filled with toys and candy ; a favorite were the yo- yo water balls , liquid - filled spheres attached to long , stretchy cords .
Brayden and his friends hit the kiddie dance floor , swinging the balls over their heads like lassos .
Suddenly Brayden came running to his mother , clutching his neck .
“ His eyes were watering and bloodshot , and I could n’t see anything because the string was clear , ” Carolyn recalls .
“ I could n’t see it was around his neck .
The ball was pulling down — it was like a rock with flashing colors . ”
After what seemed like an eternity , she was finally able to break the cord .
Brayden suffered no permanent injuries .
But Carolyn was shaken , and when she got home she searched the Internet for information on yo - yo balls .
She found that ( like most toys in the United States ) they are typically imported from China or Taiwan , and that ( also like most toys ) they have never been tested for safety by the U.S. government .
She read about Lisa Lipin , an Illinois mother whose son had nearly been strangled by a yo - yo ball in July 2003 .
Lipin begged the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission ( cpsc ) to follow the lead of France , Canada , the United Kingdom , and Australia , and ban the balls .
“ But they just wanted me to go away , ” she says .
In September of that year , despite close to 200 near - deadly incidents , the cpsc stated that the balls posed “ a low risk of strangulation . ”
The agency ’s chairman , Harold “ Hal ” Stratton , even told Good Morning America that he ’d forbidden his own children from playing with the balls — but would not take them off the market .
By late 2006 , the agency had reports on 416 incidents involving yo - yo balls ; 290 of them were classified as strangulation / suffocation .
Ever since Illinois - based rc2 Corp. recalled 1.5 million Thomas the Tank Engine trains in June after they were found to be coated in lead paint , the headlines have been full of reports on the dangers of Chinese imports — lead paint on Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street toys , Barbies with small magnets that came loose , Playskool sippy cups whose spouts broke off , causing toddlers to choke .
Most of the stories have focused on the lack of manufacturer oversight in China .
But the root of the problem is closer to home :
The cpsc , created to prevent hazardous products from winding up in American homes , has been gutted by decades of manufacturer lobbying and White House interference — and the Bush administration has finally paralyzed it to the point that it can barely function .
“ What ’s going on there is not benign neglect , ” says Ann Brown , cpsc chairman under President Clinton .
“ It ’s the systematic dismantling of the agency . ”
the cpsc was created in 1972 with a broad range of powers .
It could impose mandatory safety standards , ban or recall products found to be unsafe and dangerous , and levy fines on companies that hid safety information .
Its job was to keep tabs on more than 15,000 types of consumer goods — just about everything you ’d find in a Wal - Mart except food and drugs .
By 1979 , it had a budget of $ 44 million and a staff of nearly 900 , whose investigations resulted in 545 recalls that year alone .
Then came the Reagan administration .
Within months of taking office , Reagan convinced Congress to pass legislation that crippled the commission :
Before it could impose mandatory standards on any product , it had to wait for industry to write its own standards , and then prove that they had failed .
Recalls plummeted to fewer than 200 a year , and by 1988 the commission ’s budget was down 22 percent and its staff had been cut almost in half .
But it was under Hal Stratton , George W. Bush ’s commission chairman ( and former New Mexico attorney general , as well as Lawyers for Bush cochair ) , that the commission turned from paper tiger to industry lapdog .
Stratton cut back on investigations while taking full advantage of the perks of his office — he turned the agency into “ a little travel bureau , ” according to a longtime staffer .
When a coalition of doctors and safety advocates asked him to look into the problem of adult - sized all - terrain vehicles marketed to kids , Stratton said he ’d do a study .
Three years ( and more than 400 atv - related deaths of kids under 16 ) later , he released the results of fact - finding trips to West Virginia , New Mexico , and Alaska , where he ’d met with safety advocates as well as various atv enthusiast groups .
The upshot : a proposal to let kids ride even bigger , more powerful atv s .
Stratton ’s departure in 2006 left the agency with a grim record — product - related deaths were up from 22,000 in 1998 to 27,000 — and only two commissioners , one from each side of the aisle .
Lacking a quorum , much of the commission ’s work came to a halt .
After waiting more than seven months to pick a new chairman , President Bush nominated a senior lobbyist for the very industry the commission regulates : Michael Baroody , of the National Association of Manufacturers .
In May , Bush withdrew the nomination after it was disclosed that the association planned to give Baroody a $ 150,000 severance package when he took his new job .
That left the cpsc ‘s Republican commissioner , Nancy Nord — the former director of consumer affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce — in place as acting chairman ; she had earlier shown her bona fides by turning down Senate Democrats who wanted to increase the commission ’s budget .
“ I ’m not trying to fight with you , ” Senator Mark Pryor ( D - Ark. ) exasperatedly told her during hearings this spring .
“ I ’m trying to get you more money ! ”
Shortly thereafter , the Chicago Tribune reported on a Seattle toddler who had died on Thanksgiving Day , 2005 , after swallowing tiny magnets that had spilled from a broken Magnetix building set .
The commission had been warned about the hazard of magnetic toys years earlier and failed to act :
Just six months before the toddler ’s death , an Indiana preschool teacher had called to report that one of her students had nearly died when the Magnetix bits he swallowed perforated his bowels .
It was n’t until the following year that cpsc finally recalled the Magnetix sets ; its press release reassured consumers that only old sets were problematic , when in fact the hazardous sets were still being sold ( and stayed on shelves for another year ) .
This past April the commission — having now received reports of 29 Magnetix - related injuries , all but one of which had required surgery — expanded the recall to include 4 million more units .
( The recall press release , negotiated with the company ’s lawyers , was so vague , the cpsc had to issue a separate fact sheet later to tell parents which sets were safe to buy and which were not . )
Asked by Illinois lawmakers what she planned to do about all this , Nord said her agency needed more money after all .
Nord was called back to Capitol Hill this summer during the Chinese toy recalls .
“ What we have here is an agency in distress , ” Senator Pryor told the press .
By September , even the toy industry was pleading for new government standards to help reassure jittery consumers ( and , quite possibly , preempt lawsuits ) .
“ cpsc got caught with their pants down about China , ” says former commissioner Ann Brown .
“ Companies know the agency is toothless , so there ’s no reason for them to worry about the products that they bring into the country . ”
In his much - discussed speech before the VFW ’s national contention this week , Bush told the veterans , “ You know , the experts sometimes get it wrong .
An interesting observation , one historian put it — he said , ‘ Had these erstwhile experts ’ — he was talking about people criticizing the efforts to help Japan realize the blessings of a free society — he said , ‘ Had these erstwhile experts had their way , the very notion of inducing a democratic revolution would have died of ridicule at an early stage . ’ ”
The historian Bush quoted is not pleased .
A historian quoted by President Bush to help argue that critics of the administration ’s Iraq policy echo those who questioned the U.S. effort to bring democracy to Japan after World War II angrily distanced himself from the president ’s remarks Thursday .
“ They [ war supporters ] keep on doing this , ” said MIT professor John Dower .
“ They keep on hitting it and hitting it and hitting it and it ’s always more and more implausible , strange and in a fantasy world .
They ’re desperately groping for a historical analogy , and their uses of history are really perverse . ”
Bush took the quote from Dower ’s award - winning book , “ Embracing Defeat : Japan in the Wake of World War II . ”
But the wordsmiths who tell the president what to say probably should have looked a little closer : Dower believes the White House ’s analysis is “ a misuse of history ” and told the Politico that his views have been “ misrepresented ” by the president .
Did Bush 's speechwriters assume no one would bother checking ?
Or are they really this sloppy ?

BEFORE ( 2002 )
AFTER ( 2006 )
As Don Siegelman , the former Democratic governor of Alabama , goes before a federal judge today to fight a recommended 30 - year prison sentence , he ’s telling anyone who ’ll listen that his prosecution was engineered by White House strategist Karl Rove .
It may be a long shot as a legal argument , but at least one influential Republican and a number of Democrats are questioning whether politics may have played a role in the case .
All but a handful of more than 100 charges against the former governor were rejected , his defenders point out .
And the bribery charge on which he was convicted did not involve pocketing money personally , but rather persuading a rich business executive to put $ 500,000 into a campaign for a state lottery to support education .
Advertisement
Prosecutors said Siegelman , 61 , named the executive to a state board , though the executive had held the same position under three previous governors .
The other charge on which Siegelman was found guilty , obstruction of justice , centered on trying to conceal a $ 9,200 deal involving a motorcycle he said he was trying to sell .
The 30 years in prison that prosecutors are asking U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller to impose could be a life sentence , his lawyers say , and more than the average meted out to murderers in Alabama .
“ Congressional committees ought to investigate what in the world went on in this case , ” said Grant Woods , a Republican former attorney general of Arizona .
Woods , who still tries high - profile cases as a special prosecutor , has reviewed the charges against Siegelman as a former colleague and friend .
Advertisement
“ From start to finish , this case has been riddled with irregularities .
It does not pass the smell test , ” Woods said .
Siegelman ’s supporters argue that his popularity and his history of attracting both black and white voters -- dating to 1998 , when he was elected governor -- made him a target for GOP political strategists and may have played a role in a long - running effort by the offices of Republican U.S. attorneys to bring him down .
His supporters point to a welter of circumstantial and other evidence to support their view .
A previous indictment , for instance , was scotched by another federal judge in 2004 with a scathing rebuke to the government .
Just this month , a Republican lawyer signed a sworn statement that she had heard five years ago that Rove was preparing to politically neutralize the popular Siegelman .

And there are links between the case and GOP political activists , as well as an alleged failure by prosecutors or Fuller to conduct a vigorous investigation into evidence that prejudicial e-mails may have been sent to jurors during Siegelman ’s recent trial .
The controversy in part reflects the loss of credibility suffered by the Bush Justice Department in the wake of evidence that Rove and members of his staff played a role in the firing of eight U.S. attorneys last year .
In several of those cases , U.S. attorneys targeted for removal had been criticized by Bush officials for not being sufficiently attentive to GOP political priorities .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto waved away the controversy , saying : “ Someone is always making some baseless charge about Karl .
Unfortunately I can’t comment in this case while legal proceedings are ongoing . ”
The lead government attorney in the case , career prosecutor Louis Franklin , said he had not been subjected to pressure .

Political corruption cases are nothing new in Alabama .
Siegelman ’s three gubernatorial predecessors -- two Republicans and a Democrat -- faced criminal inquiries .
Two were indicted and convicted .
But Siegelman ’s case differs from the usual pattern in some ways .
For example , former Gov. Guy Hunt , a Republican , was found guilty in state court of personally pocketing $ 200,000 .
And state prosecutors sought probation , not jail time , in the Hunt case .
To support their call for the lengthy prison term for Siegelman , federal prosecutors gave Fuller a list of additional alleged illegal activities , including material from the counts on which the former governor had been acquitted by the jury .
Adding such “ relevant conduct ” to sentencing memos is sometimes done in federal cases .

Still , the sentence is “ extreme ” and unwarranted , said Rep. Artur Davis ( D - Ala . ) , a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Montgomery office who now sits on the House Judiciary Committee .
Although he lauded the professionalism of his former colleagues , Davis said he would press to find out who at the Justice Department approved seeking such a sentence .
Then there are the ties between GOP political operatives and the investigation .
After Siegelman became governor , a Rove protege , Bill Canary , helped lead the successful GOP effort to defeat him in 2002 .
Canary ’s wife , Leura , is a Bush - appointed U.S. attorney in Montgomery whose office won Siegelman ’s conviction .

Leura Canary started to supervise the case but recused herself after complaints from Siegelman ’s lawyers .
This month another Republican activist , lawyer Dana Jill Simpson of Rainsville , Ala. , filed a sworn statement saying that she was on a Republican campaign conference call in 2002 when she heard Bill Canary tell other campaign workers not to worry about Siegelman because Canary ’s “ girls ” and “ Karl ” would make sure the Justice Department pursued the Democrat so he was not a political threat in the future .
Both Canarys reject Simpson ’s claims , as do others on the conference call .
Leura Canary said that suggesting she exerted political influence over the case was “ a ridiculous assertion ” because it was handled by a career prosecutor , Franklin , in conjunction with the public integrity section of the Justice Department in Washington .
Advertisement
After Leura Canary recused herself , Franklin says , he moved his investigative team to a nearby military base to assure its independence .
The present case arose out of Siegelman ’s attempt in 1999 to fulfill a campaign pledge to launch a state lottery that would provide free college tuition for most Alabama college students .
The lottery initiative was defeated at the polls , in part because of opposition from lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his allies who fought gambling enterprises that might compete with casinos operated by Abramoff ’s Indian clients .
Siegelman lost his reelection bid in 2003 by the narrowest margin in Alabama history to a former Republican congressman , Bob Riley , who had backing from Abramoff , the Bush White House and a broad array of Republicans .
Siegelman immediately laid plans to reclaim his old seat , but in 2004 he was indicted on bid-rigging charges by the Bush - appointed U.S. attorney in Birmingham , Ala. , Alice Martin .
Advertisement
On the first day of the October 2004 trial , the judge ended the case with a scathing order rejecting prosecution evidence .
Despite the rebuke , investigators joined forces with the Montgomery U.S. attorney ’s office to develop a series of charges against the former governor .
One month before the 2006 Democratic primary , Siegelman was brought to trial on charges of bribery , obstruction of justice , racketeering and organized crime activity .
The latter charges , which require special approval from the criminal division of the Justice Department , were rejected by the jury .
Siegelman was convicted on the obstruction and bribery counts alone .

This blog , penned by a pseudonymous author identified as a female sex worker , is always an interesting read — but never so much as in her most recent post , " The Price . "
Snip :
It 's not easy to write about prostitution in a totally honest way because it is painful .
Painful like being fat growing up and having people yell lardass at you out car windows and strangers approaching you on the street to tell you to lose weight .
Painful like being a 13 - year - old girl saving her virginity for marriage and being held down and robbed of that .
I am embarrassed to talk about my pain , about the times I have been hurt .
Especially when the road there was tricky and circuitous and partially of my own design .
It 's hard for me to sift through the detritus , much easier to poke fun , to glam it up , to be some badass character .
You guys do n't come to this blog to be depressed and there is plenty to write about that is n't depressing .
But when I get these letters , I see the danger in that approach .
I want to be very clear that I recommend this lifestyle for no one .
It is easy enough to cross the line because the line is invisible .
Much harder still to go back , to return to a time when you shared no piece of yourself with strange men , men you do n't like , even men who do n't like you .
I detached myself completely from the work I was doing and felt that I was getting off scot - free with minimal psychological impact .
I was having fun at first ; I felt beautiful and confident and adored and I was financially secure for the first time ever .
But those nights found their way underneath my skin .
They just burrowed down deep under the folds of my subconscious like a rat nestled at the bottom of a shopping bag .
ON OCTOBER 20th , the finance ministers of the G7 will meet in Washington as part of the annual International Monetary Fund get - together .
It is already clear that foreign exchange markets will be a key part of their discussions .
Ever since the credit crunch developed in July and August , the dollar has been steadily declining against other major currencies , albeit with a modest recovery in early October .
For the euro , a key milestone was passed when its worth exceeded $ 1.40 .
That has already provoked Nicolas Sarkozy , the president of France , and Romano Prodi , the Italian prime minister , to worry aloud about the effect on Europe 's economy .
But what can the politicians do about it ?
Interest rates in the euro zone could be cut , but that is in the hands of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , not the finance ministers .
The best Jean - Claude Trichet , president of the ECB , can manage for the moment is to keep rates on hold rather than raise them , as he wanted to just a couple of months ago .
On the other side of the Atlantic , there is zero chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates to support the dollar at the moment , even though the latest non -farm payroll numbers may have reduced the immediate chances of further cuts .
The American and European central banks could intervene to drive the dollar higher , of course , but would that really be effective ?
Asian central banks are buying dollars every day , but that has done no more than slow the greenback 's decline .
The final option is to talk the dollar back up but will the Americans be supportive ?
After all , a declining currency suits them when the domestic economy is weak .
So it would be a surprise if the G7 came up with an agreement on the scale of the Plaza accord of 1985 ( intended to drive the dollar down ) or the Louvre accord of 1987 ( which aimed to push it back up ) .
But is the current situation sustainable ?
The dollar has been falling in tandem with the weak American economy , which has led to the perception that the Fed will have to cut rates .
But America is dependent on the “ kindness of strangers ” : foreign investors are needed to fund its current account deficit .
At the moment , they are being offered the prospect of a lower return in a depreciating currency .
That does n't look like a great deal .
There are already some signs of strain : the Saudi authorities did not follow September 's rate cut , leading to speculation they might abandon the dollar peg , while the Vietnamese have widened the dong 's trading range against the greenback .
At some stage , the Fed may be asked to choose between safeguarding the dollar from a complete rout and protecting the economy from recession .
It will be interesting to see how it reacts .
Most people would assume the dollar would get sacrificed .
Meanwhile , the " carry trade " has not gone away .
Australian and New Zealand dollars and the Turkish lira have all been showing signs of strength .
This suggests that the risk appetite of investors has not been dented too severely by the credit crunch , the freezing of the money markets , August 's volatility in the equity markets and all the rest of it .
Investors may well be assuming that the problems are contained within the American economy and that emerging markets will carry the global economy on their own .
That would explain why the MSCI emerging markets equity index is at an all - time high and why emerging market shares now trade at a premium rating to the rest of the word .
But that would also suggest that the exciting investment opportunities are all in Asia and Latin America .
In which case why is capital flowing from emerging markets to the developed world , and not the other way round ?
That may just about have made sense when the American economy looked sound and was still the main locomotive for the world .
But that is no longer the case .
LONDON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The mortgage wipeout could result in a $ 2 trillion cutback in lending and have dramatic implications for the U.S. economy , according to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs .
The housing slump is expected to end up costing banks , hedge funds and other lenders an estimated $ 400 billion as defaults on home loans rise , according to Goldman economist Jan Hatzius .
A $ 400 billion loss is equal to just about 2.5 percent of U.S. stock market capitalization - or a bad day on Wall Street , he wrote in a commentary on Thursday .
But most stock investors do n't react aggressively to capital losses the way banks and other lenders do .
A bank that aims to maintain a capital ratio of 10 percent would need to shrink its balance sheet by $ 10 for every $ 1 in credit losses , the note said .
That means that if lenders end up suffering just half of the $ 400 billion in potential credit losses , they could be forced to reduce the amount they loan by $ 2 trillion .
Such a drastic credit crunch could have dire consequences for the economy .
" Even if this occurs gradually , and even if there are some offsets from reduced credit demand and increased lending by other sectors , the drag on economic activity could be substantial , " Hatzius wrote .
Wall Street banks and brokerages face pain on two fronts .
They hold home loans , as well as securities backed by mortgages .
Losses on these holdings are expected to deepen as falling housing prices trigger more defaults .
There are a number of factors that could lessen the lending shock , Hatzius noted .
Regulators could encourage financial institutions to keep lending , even in times of stress .
Some players could raise additional capital by selling stakes in themselves .
But the overall outlook is bleak , as pressure on lending is likely to raise the risk of " significant weakness " in economic activity , the note said .

Facebook Lawmakers in two California cities are discussing unprecedented legislation this month that would widen a growing voluntary movement by landlords and resident associations to ban smoking inside apartments and condos .
Next Tuesday , the City Council of Belmont is scheduled to cast a final vote on an ordinance that would ban smoking in apartments and condos .
The measure , which won initial approval last week , could trigger fines and evictions if neighbors complain and smokers do n't heed repeated warnings .

TENANTS TANGLE : Neighbors take sides on tobacco
In Calabasas on Wednesday , the City Council discussed a proposal that would expand its anti-smoking law to bar lighting up inside existing apartments and most new condos .
The council agreed to request changes to the measure that would exempt all condos and set aside a certain percentage of apartments for smokers , says city spokesman Michael Hafken .
It is slated to consider the revised proposal next month .
The legislative push , which has triggered death threats against council members in both cities , is a controversial part of a mostly voluntary effort to prod landlords and condo associations to adopt smoke - free policies .
Health officials in about 30 states promote the health and economic benefits , including reduced fire risk and lower cleanup costs for multiunit housing , says Jim Bergman , director of the Smoke - Free Environments Law Project , a Michigan group funded partly by the state .
Tens of thousands of apartments and condos have gone smoke - free in the past five years , management companies and health activists say .
Last month , Guardian Management began phasing in a smoke - free policy at 8,000 of its rental units , mostly in Oregon and Washington .
" We 've proven the voluntary approach can work very well , " Bergman says .
He does n't think legislative bans will work because of a " my home is my castle " philosophy .
" The time has come .
The evils of smoking have been known for decades , " says Barry Groveman , a Calabasas councilman who co-wrote the proposal .
Still , he knows he 's struck a nerve .
" I 've gotten threats like you would n't believe , " Groveman says .
" Fresh air should be breathed by everybody , " Belmont Mayor Coralin Feierbach says .
She cites a 2006 surgeon general 's report that says no level of secondhand smoke is risk - free .
Critics say the bans violate civil and personal property rights .
" You should be able to do as you wish in your own home , " says Michon Coleman of the San Mateo County Association of Realtors .
Belmont 's ordinance is " way over the top , " because a smoker can be evicted simply for lighting up , says Warren Lieberman , one of two council members who oppose it .
Such criticism prompted Oakland last month to remove a ban on smoking in new apartments and condos from an ordinance that barred lighting up in public places .
Feierbach says she never intended to create a stir , but she expects other cities to follow Belmont .
" We really broke ground , " she says .

A group of scientists are looking for internet volunteers to take part in what they claim will be the largest galactic census ever compiled .
The act of classifying a galaxy is n't difficult .
The trouble is there 's a lot of them .
Scientifically speaking , the universe is ginormous , and computer programs can't hold a standard candle to the human eye for reliable star system classification .
That 's why a group of scientists developed GalaxyZoo .
The website seeks would - be astronomers to help sort through a collection of one million photographs of galaxies snapped by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico .
Volunteers are prompted to help classify galaxies as either elliptical or spiral — and when applicable — whether they are spinning clockwise or counterclockwise .
The task should help astronomers further understand the structure of the universe .
" It is great that digital archives we have built for science are now being used by the public to look at the universe , " Professor Bob Nichols from the University of Portsmouth said .
" It will be great to have all the galaxies classified ; it 's as fundamental as knowing if a human is male or female . "
After signing on , users are given a brief tutorial on how to classify galaxies followed by a quiz to test their star system spotting mettle .
Once the volunteer has graduated galaxy analysis 101 , they can pick through the organization 's galactic scrapbook and begin the task of organizing the universe .
The galaxies are categorized by several people to help prevent errors and potential astronomy - hating ne 're - do - wells .
GalaxyZoo said they were inspired by projects such as Stardust@home , in which NASA invited the public to sort through dust grains obtained by a mission to Comet Wild - 2 .
" What the Stardust team achieved was incredible , " said Chris Lintott , Oxford researcher and GalaxyZoo team member .
" but our galaxies are much more interesting to look at than their dust grains . "
You can begin sorting through space here . ®

The Great Carina Nebula

Explanation : A jewel of the southern sky , the Great Carina Nebula , aka NGC 3372 , spans over 300 light - years , one of our galaxy 's largest star forming regions .
Like the smaller , more northerly Orion Nebula , the Carina Nebula is easily visible to the naked eye , though at a distance of 7,500 light - years it is some 5 times farther away .
This stunning telescopic view reveals remarkable details of the region 's glowing filaments of interstellar gas and dark cosmic dust clouds .
The Carina Nebula is home to young , extremely massive stars , including the still enigmatic variable Eta Carinae , a star with well over 100 times the mass of the Sun.
Eta Carinae is the bright star left of the central dark notch in this field and just below the dusty Keyhole Nebula ( NGC 3324 ) .
Dell 's latest launch has really taken off .
Unfortunately for Dell 's crumbling profitability , it 's a website called IdeaStorm , not a new PC .
IdeaStorm is designed to get ideas and feedback from Dell users , and the mechanism is much the same as Digg : people make suggestions and everybody votes for the ones they like best .
The problem for Dell is that by far the most popular suggestion is one that Dell will find hard to implement .
It means selling consumers PCs with Linux pre-installed .
The company 's founder , Michael Dell , really wants to do it , and he did n't become a multibillionaire by ignoring great marketing opportunities .
He tried the idea around the turn of the century , when Linux hype was at its highest , and Dell still sells Linux on corporate servers and high - end workstations .
But there are huge problems in offering Linux on mass - market PCs .
The most obvious is deciding which version of Linux to offer .
There are more than 100 distros , and everybody seems to want a different one - or the same one with a different desktop , or whatever .
It costs Dell a small fortune to offer an operating system ( it involves thousands of driver compatibility , peripheral testing , certification , staff training , administration , advertising and support issues ) so the lack of a standard is a real killer .
The less obvious problem is the very high cost of Linux support , especially when selling cheap PCs to naïve users who do n't RTFM ( read the friendly manual ) and would n't understand a Linux manual if they tried .
And there 's so much of it !
Saying " Linux is just a kernel , so that 's all we support " is n't going to work , but where in the great sprawling heap of GNU / Linux code do you draw the line ?
Buying support from a third party such as LinuxCare - which Dell did last time - is n't satisfactory either , unless you can get users to pay extra .
And there 's the rub .
Pay ?
Sadly , most people think they should be able to buy a Dell PC running Linux for less than the cost of a Dell PC running Windows .
In fact , they usually cost more .
This is partly because Linux has high overheads on minuscule sales , and partly because of the fees that PC sellers collect for bundling ISP connections , free antivirus and multimedia software , browser toolbars and so on .
The great collection of crapware that comes with a home user 's Windows PC probably knocks at least £ 20 off the price , maybe much more .
Cost savings also come directly from Microsoft and Intel in the form of discounts and cooperative advertising support for the use of logos , and so on .
These schemes do n't exist for Linux .
But will the tens of thousands of Linux supporters " Digging " the idea on IdeaStorm ever turn into paying customers ?
I can't speak for Dell on this , but I suspect very few will .
Worse , those few are mostly the sort of buyer no - one really wants .
Look at how Dell works .
You see a headline for a fantastic deal for only £ 299 or whatever , go to the Dell site and end up buying something for twice the price .
It only takes a minor upgrade here and there , a bigger hard drive and a bit of software .
Then you treat yourself to a camera , add three years of support and it 's done .
All the profit is in the up - sell .
What Dell really needs are more high - end gamers who buy top - spec PCs in fancy cases for £ 2,500 or more , not low - end Linux users looking to save £ 25 on Windows .
Here 's an idea : Michael Dell started in a college dorm and built a $ 60 bn ( £ 31 bn ) company from nothing .
Why do n't the people asking Dell for Linux PCs start their own companies and do likewise ?
If there 's a market , it should be really easy .
And unlike Mike , you wo n't even have to beat IBM .
The LAPD on Wednesday abruptly scrapped a program to map the city ’s Muslim population , a major retreat for a department that said the system was needed to identify potential hotbeds of extremism .
The reversal comes after a week of protests from Muslim groups and civil libertarians , who equated the mapping with religious profiling .
Others questioned whether it was possible for the LAPD to accurately map the city ’s far - flung Muslim community .
Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Michael P. Downing said Wednesday that in the wake of the protests , officials would drop the mapping aspect of the plan but continue their efforts to reach out to the Muslim community .
Downing and other police officials plan to outline the new strategy to Muslim American activists at a meeting today .
The decision met with praise from some activists , who said they would welcome greater involvement by the LAPD in their communities as long as mapping was off the table .

“ Muslim Americans were very disturbed and concerned about the ramifications of the plan and having their privacy invaded , ” said Salam Al - Marayati , executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council .
“ Downing ’s statement that he ’s pulling the plan says the LAPD is very open to positive community engagement , input and participation .
It ’s the first step to very healthy dialogue between Muslim Americans and the city of Los Angeles . ”
The LAPD has not provided details about how it planned to build the Muslim database .
But in a document reviewed by The Times last week , the department ’s counter - terrorism bureau proposed using U.S. census data and other demographic information to pinpoint Muslim communities and then reach out to them through social service agencies .
Originally , the LAPD planned to partner with USC ’s National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events in building the mapping program .
But after details of the effort were made public last week , USC officials said they were carefully studying whether to join the endeavor and stressed that no deal had been made .
During Oct. 30 testimony before Congress , Downing described the plan as an attempt to “ mitigate radicalization . ”

Downing and other law enforcement officials said police agencies around the world are dealing with radical Muslim groups that are isolated from the larger community , creating potential breeding grounds for terrorism .
He cited terror cells in Europe as well as the case of some Muslim extremists in New Jersey arrested in May for allegedly planning to bomb Ft. Dix .
But in a statement , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said that “ while I believe the department ’s efforts to reach out to the Muslim communities were well intentioned , the mapping proposal has created a level of fear and apprehension that made it counterproductive . ”
Beyond the issue of “ religious profiling , ” some critics said it would be impossible for the LAPD to create an accurate map of where Muslims live .
The Census Bureau is barred by law from asking people for their religious affiliation .
As a result , there is no scientific data on the size of the nation ’s Muslim population , let alone its location , with estimates of totals ranging from about 1.4 million adults in a Pew Research Center study this year to the 7 million or more claimed by some community organizations .
Census data on ancestry would also fail to yield accurate Muslim estimates , because large numbers of people with Iranian backgrounds are Jewish and many people with Lebanese , Palestinian and Syrian roots are Christian .
Advertisement
Some critics said the LAPD plan seemed based on the European experience of isolated and often - distressed Muslim enclaves , a model they said does n’t apply to the United States , where the Muslim population is far more dispersed .
Ramona Ripston , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California , said Wednesday that the LAPD ’s reversal “ shows what community outrage can do .
. . .
We are going to be watchful that they do n’t try again to bring this mapping plan forward with another name . ”
The ACLU on Wednesday filed a public records request for details of the mapping project .
Downing and other LAPD officials have stressed for days that the mapping program was not a form of profiling or targeting but rather a way to better understand the Muslim community .
Advertisement
But until Wednesday , the department had stood by the effort and insisted that critics would accept the idea once officials could provide details .
Al - Marayati said he sent a letter to Downing on Monday telling him the plan should be withdrawn before the LAPD ’s scheduled meeting today with Muslim American leaders .
Then on Wednesday , Al - Marayati said Downing called him to say the LAPD was putting the plan aside .
“ Unfortunately , I think there ’s been damage to the relationship in terms of trust , ” Al - Marayati said .
“ But we feel we can repair that . ”
Mary Grady , the LAPD ’s public information director , said Wednesday that it made sense to remove the mapping element from the plan .
“ The whole purpose of this initiative was to bring together the department with the Muslim community ” she said .
“ The word ‘ mapping ’ gave the impression it was about profiling when it was not . ”

About Dawn
I 'm a single mom of 3 girls
and 3 boys , trying to juggle
kids , work and laundry with
the help of God , family ,
friends and wine ( not
necessarily in that order )
Arrested
On April 18th , I was arrested .
This normally would n’t be big news , but the situation arround which I was arrested brings up serious questions .
I was arrested at Kutztown University , where I am a student , because I decided to try to liven the mood after the Life and Liberty Ministries began to upset students .
They came on campus with signs that featured aborted fetuses , lists of people who will be going to hell , and catchy phrases such as “ JESUS OR HELL ” .
I have friends who are gay , and these people who came onto Kutztown University ’s campus without permission or prior notice were upsetting students all over campus .
I decided not to simply let them upset people , so I went to the bookstore and purchased a posterboard and sharpie marker and made my own sign .
It said “ Equal Rights for Robots ” , a saying I thought no one would be able to take the wrong way .
The protesters had been on campus for about two hours at this time , and the whole time the police were protecting them from the students .
To my knowledge , the protesters at this time had not been asked to leave .
With my sign in hand , I walked out and waved my sign in the air .
I had some small support from students around me , as most saw the attempt at humor to lighten a rough situation .
However , within about two or three minutes a police officer came over to me and told me to come with him .
I was dropped off at the police area , searched and taken to the local precinct where I was held for an hour and a half .
One of the protesters was held there with me , but I do not know why he was arrested .
I was charged with Disorderly Conduct with intent to “ alarm or annoy ” and in the citation it says I was “ warned repeatedly ” to stop .
Neither is true , and when I pointed this out to the officer who wrote it out for me he said something along the lines of I do n’t care and made a comment along the lines of tell it to the judge .
I plead not guilty and face a three hundred dollar fine or up to 90 days in jail if found guilty .
After it happened , I tried to contact the local news and the school newspaper .
Only one newspaper bother to contact me , the others did n’t believe me .

The Keystone , the school newspaper was initially interested in running my side of the story , but then quickly backed down from it when the school decided not to support me .
In fact , according to one student who spoke to school officials right after my arrest , the school had me arrested because “ We did n’t want any jokers . ”
Now , I cannot verify that quote myself , but this student is one I would trust to tell me the truth .
This is what happened , and here are some pictures to verify the truth .

Edit : I ’ve been receiving emails suggesting I start taking donations .
I ’ve even had a donation sent to my email , REDACTED through PayPal .
I really do appreciate it , but do n’t think of this as begging .
If I do not need the donations for my legal fees or fine , I will donate the money to a group like the ACLU which would use the money to help others who got into crappy situations with the police .
So once again , if you really want to donate , use PayPal to sent it to REDACTED , but only if you really want to .
Any extras will be sent to a legal defense fund .
Thank you everyone for your support .
No need to donate anymore .
It ’s been long enough .
EDIT : I ’ve posted another update , https://hngkong.wordpress.com/2007/07/02/new-updates/
By glblguy
Seems it ’s that time again , time to hear that familiar ringing each time you walk towards the entrance of a large store .
The Salvation Army is just one of the many charitable donation requests we ’ll begin to receive as the holiday season approaches .
Although I feel a bit guilty about it but to be honest , I often feel a little overwhelmed with the number of charitable companies looking for money and donations .
Not to mention the often stressful situation of trying to determine if they are truly reputable organizations or just plain scams .
Here ’s a few “ do ’s and don’ts ” to help you filter out the “ wheat from the chaff ” and make the smart giving decisions :
DO’s
Do ask how much of your donation goes to the actual cause vs. administration , people , staff , etc .
High quality charities should be giving 75 % of your money to the actual cause .
Do check out the Better Business Bureau ’s Wise Giving Alliance to ensure the charity is on the up and up .
Do get a receipt that states the amount and includes the Charities name .
Do a quick Google search to see what others on the internet have to say about the charity .
This can provide some valuable insight into the credibility of the charity .
Do trust the organization to allocate your money where it is most needed .
Do n’t try to specify where your money will go .
After you ’ve researched the charity and decided you are comfortable with them , trust them to use the finds in the wisest manner .
Specifying how the money should be used just makes it more difficult and costly on the charity .
DON’Ts
Do n’t give out personal information such as account numbers or social security numbers over the phone or via the internet .
Doing so can put you at risk of identify theft and even theft in general .
When paying online using a credit or debit card , make sure the site is secure .
Do n’t give to telemarketers .
Telemarketing has the highest percentage on scams , and frequently most of these organizations keep 65 to 95 cents of each dollar .
Do n’t succumb to pressure or guilt tactics .
If you are ever heavily pressured or feel threatened call the organizations office or report them to the Better Business Bureau in your area .

Below is an excerpt from a review , published in this week ’s Nature , of the book The Science of Orgasm ( ISBN 9780801884900 ) .
The review is by Prof Tim Spector whose work we ’ve featured previously on Mind Hacks .
Spector published the results of a study in 2005 on the genetics of female orgasm which generated a range of critical commentaries .
His review tackles a new book which aims to cover the latest research on orgasm from a number of perspectives , but also gives a glimpse into the neuroscience of orgasm itself .
In my view , the best part of the book is the neurochemistry of the orgasm .
Studies of paraplegic women clearly show the importance in female orgasm of multiple complex neural pathways such as the vagus nerve .
Functional brain imaging is an exciting area for study and ( despite poor - quality pictures ) the authors present the latest findings of multiple areas of brain activity during orgasm ‚ Äî which make any simplistic dopamine ( stimulatory ) ‚ Äì serotonin ( inhibitory ) mode of action unlikely .
They postulate a central role for areas such as the cingulate cortex , which is also where pain is perceived ‚ Äî linking pain and orgasm as related sensory processes .

Well , if you ’re worried that Bush ’s next war of aggression will involve nukes , there ’s good news and bad news .
First the Good News .
The Cheney Cabal has apparently concluded that their previous ridiculous argument is n’t working .
That Iran ’s nuclear programs  albeit Safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency  are somehow an existential threat to you and yours and have to be " taken out , " using nukes " if necessary . "
So , increasingly , the Cheney Cabal argues that we have to launch a war of aggression against Iran because the Shi’ite Iranians are somehow responsible for the " murder " of American soldiers in neighboring Iraq by Sunni Iraqi insurgents .
Last week Senator Joe Lieberman got the Senate to pass ( 97 - 0 ) a " Sense of Congress " that
" ( 1 ) the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable and unacceptable act of hostility against the United States by the foreign government in question ; and
" ( 2 ) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must take immediate action to end all training , arming , equipping , funding , advising , and any other forms of support that it or its agents are providing , and have provided , to Iraqi militias and insurgents , who are contributing to the destabilization of Iraq and are responsible for the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces . "
According to Lieberman ;
" The threat posed by Iran to our soldiers , to our allies , and to our national security is a truth that cannot be wished or waved away .
Congress today began the process of confronting it . ”
Who does Lieberman consider " our allies " ?
Well , apparently , the puppet governments we have installed by force of arms in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And , right on cue , U.S. News and World Report chronicled current US efforts to confront the alleged Iranian threat to our soldiers and to our national security in Afghanistan .
According to " Afghan officials , " Iran " is supporting local warlords " who control most of Western Afghanistan " with trained men and arms . "
So , that ’s the good news .
Bush ’s next war of aggression will be probably be against a country which everyone now knows does n’t have nukes or even a nuke program .
Bush ’s new rationale for his war will not involve nonexistent Iranian nukes , but rather unproven Iranian complicity in the " murder " of Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Now , here ’s the bad news .
Suppose Bush ’s next war of aggression is against Pakistan .
A few days ago , some dirty guys ambushed a Pakistani military convoy somewhere " near the Afghan border , " killing 17 Pakistani troops .
The Bush - Cheney White House immediately demanded that our " ally , " Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf , establish control of those " tribal " areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan over which he obviously now has little , if any , control .
Spokesman Tony
Snow even threatened attacks against  and invasion of  Pakistan because " it is clearly of the utmost importance to go in there and deal with the problem in the tribal areas . ”
Howzat ?
Well , according to the most recent National Intelligence Estimate , over the past two years al Qaeda has reestablished it central organization , training infrastructure and lines of global communication in those " tribal " areas , resulting in a " heightened threat environment " for our " homeland . "
But White House threats to " go in " to those " tribal areas " can only magnify the already serious threats , to Musharraf ’s life , as well as to his control of Pakistan and its arsenal of " Islamic " nukes .
Recall that , on 28 May , 1998 , Pakistan stunned the world by answering Indian nuke tests with nuke tests of its own , of at least two different designs , at least one being Uranium - 235 based and another Plutonium - 239 based .
Proud Pakistan is the only country among the 57 members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to not only have a nuke arsenal , but to have developed from scratch a complete nuke weapons infrastructure , including state - of - the - art weapons - grade uranium enrichment , plutonium and tritium production facilities .
Pakistan currently produces enough highly enriched uranium to make nine or 10 nukes each year .
Furthermore , since 1998 , they could have been producing 10 to 15 kilograms of Plutonium per year in their heavy - water , natural - uranium reactor at Kushab .
But , the Kushab reactor can be used to produce tritium  rather than Plutonium  to be used in “ boosted ” weapons .
If you know what that means , keep it to yourself .
If you do n’t , it means the Pakistanis know how to make small deliverable fission nukes .
The Kushab reactor  if used to produce tritium  would produce enough to boost perhaps 20 or so small sophisticated fission weapons , with design yields of up to 100KT .
Pakistan is also manufacturing very pure reactor - grade graphite and has its own heavy - water plant .
Hence , Pakistan has the capability to build additional plutonium - tritium production reactors and is now constructing one which will be at least as productive as the existing Kushab reactor .
Pakistani , like India and Israel , is not a signatory to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
So , unlike an invasion of Iran , an invasion of Pakistan  resulting in Musharraf being killed or deposed  could easily result in nukes being used , not all of them ours .
Here is what Dictator Musharraf had to say seven years ago in an awards ceremony for the " fathers "  both named Kahn  of Islamic nukes .
" I would like to reiterate this resolve on this occasion , loud and clear in military terms : Death before dishonor .
" I would also like to say to you , the new custodians of the nation ’s nuclear capability , that my government will provide you with every possible political and financial support .
" We will take whatever pressures come .
" We will do whatever it takes to ward off such pressures .
" We will find the resources to back your work .
" The nation is united on this issue .
There are no ambiguities whatsoever here . "
So , heres the good news .
If Bush next attacks Iran , nukes probably wo n’t be used .
Unless , of course , Bush uses them .
Which would be bad news since Russia and / or China may well then honor their NPT commitments to come immediately to Iran ‘s assistance .
Finally , here ’s the really bad news .
Suppose Bush next attacks Pakistan , hoping to kill Osama bin Laden and to destroy al - Qaeda .
Well , according to the Terrorist Threat to the US Homeland ;
" We assess that al Qaeda will continue to try to acquire and employ chemical , biological , radiological , or nuclear material in attacks and would not hesitate to use them if it develops what it deems is sufficient capability . "
When one dares to dig beneath the surface of governmental programs to reveal undisclosed purposes , he or she is usually met with charges of being a " paranoid " defender of " conspiracy theories . "
More often than not , such an accusation silences the questioner , as it is designed to do .
I long ago came to the conclusion that those who chastise others for spouting " conspiracy theories " tend to do so because they do n't want the implications of their own schemes revealed to the public .
" Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain ! , " intoned the Wizard of Oz , an admonition designed to intimidate the inquisitive into silence .
I , for one , gladly admit to the embracing of any conspiracy theory for which there is credible evidence .
But those who condemn me for my views never seem interested in examining the evidence , their purposes being more to prevent the raising of discomforting questions .
Having read a good deal of history over the years , I ask my critics to account for the countless foreign intrigues , plots , assassinations , alliances , and other cabals that have been at the heart of so much of the history of the world .
Do Shakespeare 's tragedies — almost all of which are grounded in conspiracies of one kind or another — have nothing to teach us about the machinations of human behavior ?
A Jewish acquaintance once criticized me for my views , adding " there are no conspiracies . "
" May I quote you on that ? , " I asked .
He could not understand my purpose in wanting to do so , so I told him : " because it 's not often one hears Jewish people denying the Nazi holocaust the way you just did . "
After advising him that the " Nazi holocaust " requires a conspiracy of German government officials , he was prepared to modify his statement to allow for the kinds of conspiracies that he believed in .
One of my colleagues , who teaches antitrust law , attacked me for defending even the idea of " conspiracies , " until I asked him if he intended to reduce his course from three units to one .
" Since so much of antitrust law consists of u2018conspiracies ' to restrain trade , or fix prices , or divide up markets , or monopolize an industry , or engage in such more subtle u2018conspiracies ' as u2018conscious parallelism , ' I assume that , since you do not believe in conspiracies , you will take the lead in condemning such specious theories . "
Conspiracy theories abound in our society , and are widely accepted , . . . provided you are identifying the " politically correct " conspiracy .
World War II was conducted , in part , on the premise that the so - called " axis powers " were conspiring to take over the world .
But if one tries to offer evidence that FDR secretly manipulated the Japanese into an attack on Pearl Harbor in order to serve his political agenda , the " anti-conspiracy league " quickly appears to attack not the evidence , but the state of mind of the accuser .
When World War II ended , the " international communist conspiracy " was hurriedly rushed onstage to justify the commitment of trillions of dollars of wealth and hundreds of thousands of lives to fight a " Cold War . "
When the " Cold War " critics began to speak and write about how this campaign was designed to serve American corporate - state interests at the expense of the American people , the " anti-conspiracy league " was again called into action .
For those who are paying attention , the incongruity of the critics of conspiracy theories should be apparent .
" We are busy conducting wars against sinister foreign conspiracies , " they might argue , " and anyone who suggests that we might be engaged in conspiracies of our own , are u2018 paranoids . ' "
" They " conspire , in other words , but " we " do not .
A childishly simple explanation for consumption by childishly simple minds .
" Paranoia " consists not in a fear of others , but in a baseless fear .
Would one regard a Jew , in Nazi Germany , as " paranoid , " because he thought the government was out to do him harm ?
If so , how would we characterize the state of mind of another Jew , similarly located , who did not see any threat from his government ?
When one further considers how preoccupied government officials are with protecting themselves from those they imagine themselves to represent — to the point of routinely having bomb - sniffing dogs , armed security guards , and military helicopters and soldiers accompany their public appearances — it should be asked : just who is being " paranoid ? "
It is interesting to observe the psychological projection that takes place in such dynamics .
The defenders of statism attack their critics as " paranoids " while , at the same time , fostering an endless supply of " enemies " against whom they promise us protection !
Politics thrives on the mobilization of the fear of others .
President Bush 's unilateral declaration of a permanent war against the rest of the world can only be premised upon the most paranoid assumption that everyone else is involved in a conspiracy against American interests !
It has always been comforting to most people to imagine , albeit unconsciously , that the " dark side " of their personality — i.e. , the capacity for violence , dishonesty , bigotry , etc. — can be severed from themselves and projected onto others , against whom punitive action can then be taken .
All that occurs in such behavior , of course , is the punishment of the others who stand in as scapegoats for the feared shortcomings of those engaged in projecting .
This kind of thinking has produced the current Bush - induced mindset that when America bombs other countries — killing innocent men , women , and children in the process — it is a force for " good " defending " freedom . "
When these other countries retaliate for such attacks — killing innocent men , women , and children in so doing — they represent the forces of " evil " engaged in " terrorism . "
That grown men and women can internalize this kind of playground logic , particularly when the consequences are so deadly , is indeed frightening .
This war  whose name is ever - changing — has moved far beyond simply retaliation against those responsible for attacking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11th .
It has become more of a self - righteous " holy crusade " against nations that are unprepared to acknowledge America as the rightful ruler of the entire world .
Neo - conservative zealots have exploited the September 11th tragedy to pursue a much broader agenda of American hegemony .
It is no longer sufficient to track down the perpetrators of that attack , the war must be expanded to include nations whose identities seem to have been selected from someone 's Rolodex file of place - names !
" Who shall we attack next ? " has been the operative question around Washington .
After months of bombing Afghanistan , President Bush was quick to declare an " Axis of Evil " as the broader enemy , suggesting that North Korea , Iraq , and Iran were engaged in some conspiracy , apparently of satanic dimensions , against America .
Soon , new candidates were offered up for public consumption : the Philippines , Indonesia , Somalia , the Sudan , Colombia , and perhaps other Middle Eastern or African nations .
The candidates for inclusion on this list may include anyone unprepared to genuflect before American interests .
( The list will presumably not include China , which would likely offer deadly resistance . )
Let us suppose that some criminal has engaged in a violent attack upon your Uncle Willie 's home .
Let us suppose , further , that Willie has undertaken a campaign to discover — and bring to account — the perpetrators of this offense .
This would be a perfectly rational response on his part , for which the rest of us would likely lend our support .
But suppose that Willie goes further than this and , not being able to discover the criminal , begins going through his neighborhood shooting anyone about whom he has become suspicious , or against whom he has long harbored a grudge .
Would your response be to jump on his bandwagon and assist his undertaking , or would you want him confined to some facility that could provide him with a whole lot of couch time ?
It is time for sane men and women to put down their flags and begin to recognize the current war - mania not simply as a misguided adventure , but as the collective psychopathic disorder that it has become .
When those in power tell us that they are engaged in an endless war against endless enemies , it is time to say " enough ! "
We have a responsibility to maintain the conditions upon which life may flourish on this planet , not to follow the madness of those who have no greater vision than to commit all of mankind to a state of universal and eternal warfare in furtherance of their delusions .
It is time for intelligence and human decency to transcend the frenzied jingoism now prevailing upon the land , and for intellectual honesty to expose the schemes of those who conspire against life itself .

The Best of Butler Shaffer
This week 's report showed that gasoline prices , which normally start to free - fall at this time of year , indeed headed back up this week .
The Energy Information Administration , the same outfit that puts out This Week in Petroleum on Wednesdays , publishes a gasoline price survey on Mondays .
The report can be found at :
I predict that prices will continue to rise .
I think they have to .
I also think we will see the ramifications of present inventory levels for quite some time .
On the other hand , we did go into the end of 2003 with inventories in this range , so we do have some history suggesting that levels can recover without requiring sharply higher prices .
But do n't bet on it .
Three weeks ago I wrote that I expected gas prices to rise , which would be unusual for this time of year :
The last couple of TWIPs have shown that gasoline inventories are slowly growing ( which will favor lower prices ) but inventory levels are still incredibly low ( which will support a higher price level ) .
What I think we will see are pretty healthy prices through the winter , and then we will start a Spring climb again from a higher base .
This should again lead to record high prices by May of next year .
Gasoline prices in California have risen more than the national average .
The L.A. Times commented on the " unusual September climb " :
Gasoline prices still rising
Drivers took a hit at the pumps over the last week , the Energy Department said Monday , as gasoline continued its unusual September climb in most of the nation and U.S. diesel prices topped $ 3 a gallon for the first time in more than a year .
The average price of a gallon of self - serve regular gasoline in California rose 5.7 cents to $ 2.961 , which was 20.1 cents above the year - earlier price , according to the Energy Department 's weekly survey of filling stations .
Nationally , gasoline rose 2.5 cents to $ 2.812 a gallon .
That was 43.4 cents above the price in the same period a year earlier .
TWIP
This week 's numbers were contrary to most expectations , but there is n't too much to get excited about .
Refinery utilization was down , but that is to be expected as some areas have started fall turnarounds .
If you look at the history , the end of September almost always sees utilization fall by several percentage points .
Gasoline demand is reportedly up over this time last year , but is falling as might be expected for this time of year .
The important items from this week 's report ( to me ) :
U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.0 million barrels per day during the week ending September 21 , down 339,000 barrels per day from the previous week 's average .
Refineries operated at 86.9 percent of their operable capacity last week .
Gasoline production fell compared to the previous week , averaging 8.7 million barrels per day .
Distillate fuel production rose last week , averaging 4.1 million barrels per day .
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) rose by 1.8 million barrels compared to the previous week .
Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 0.6 million barrels last week , and are well below the lower end of the average range .
Distillate fuel inventories increased by 1.6 million barrels , and are in the upper half of the average range for this time of year .
Over the last four weeks , motor gasoline demand has averaged nearly 9.4 million barrels per day , or 0.4 percent above the same period last year .
Analysts had expected a fall in crude inventories , a smaller increase in gasoline inventories , and most notably for refinery utilization to be around 89 % ( instead of 87 % ) .
Have you ever wondered what a dying person feels ?
It sounds morbid , but science and accounts from lucky survivors have helped us make an idea about it .
Still , only the dead know exactly how it feels and the sensations you experience at that moment .
A report released by New Scientist earlier this month answered to some questions related to the feelings and sensations a person experiences in various ways of dying .
But what 's the medical / biological support for all these aspects ?
Read on !
Generally , a person is considered dead when blood circulation ( translated in heart activity ) has stopped .
This is the clinical death , but in many cases , modern technology has permitted the restart / recovery of heart activity - such methods include cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , defibrillation , epinephrine shots .
So perhaps it would be more biologically correct to say that the person has died when the brain is dead .
Still , the only way to instantly kill the brain is by shooting a bullet into someone 's head .
There are other ways in which the brain is killed more slowly , mainly by stopping its blood supply .
The brain can function for a while without nutrients , but the brain cells ( neurons ) die in a matter of seconds when they lack oxygen .
In fact , this is called a stroke : the death of some brain portions .
In most cases of death , the victim 's brain is killed ?
' indirectly ' ( so to say ) , by stopping the heart ( the so - called heart attack ) .
The heart attack can be spontaneous , caused by heart coronary disease ( when the heart muscle is deprived of its circulation , and portions of it die ) .
The main symptom is angina pectoris , the famous chest pain , a sensation of pain and squeezing radiating mainly to the left arm but also to all the surrounding areas , accompanied by massive sweating , nausea and palpitations .
The asphyxiated brain loses consciousness in a maximum of 10 seconds , and minutes later the brain dies .
Decapitation was believed to be rapid and painless , but it takes about 7 seconds for the brain to lose consciousness .
Eye and facial expressions ( grimaces ) still persist for 30 seconds after the head has been cut off , which leads us to probably the most famous such case in world history , that of the French queen Marie Antoinette - what could the grimace on the face of this unlucky queen ( guillotined during the French revolution ) mean ?
That famous smile was surely not one of happiness .
Lethal injection is considered a ' humane ' alternative to the electric chair and attempts to stop the heart while stopping the functions of the brain through three active principles : an anesthetic ( like sodium thiopental ) , a paralytic agent ( like pancuronium bromide ) and potassium chloride ( ultrashort - acting sedative ) .
A mixture of these should be redundant : if one chemical does not kill the inmate , one of the other two will do it .
Many people believe that the potassium chloride injection causes burning pain , but the paralyzed convicted cannot show what he / she feels .
If the dosage is not the right one , or if the one performing the injection misses the vein , the victim will not only feel a burning sensation caused by the chloride , but it will take him up to 9 minutes to die of asphyxiation due to the blocked breath muscles .
Hanging should be an unconsciousness asphyxiation , occurring in 10 seconds : the convicted should be left unconscious and paralyzed by choking , having the neck broken from the first cervical vertebra , and death should come in a matter of seconds , maximum 2 minutes .
The reality is more shocking : over three quarters of the convicted die after a torture of many minutes , during which they desperately try to breathe .
Judicial hangings , opposed to suicides , cause a significant damage to the spinal cord .
When the fall is longer than predicted , the victim may even be decapitated .
Sometimes , intense fear can induce a cardiac arrest to the convicted .
It was quite an offence for royalties to be hanged , as the victim loses control of its sphincters ( anal and urethral ) .
Drowning is in the end also a type of asphyxiation .
The panicked victim tries to hold his breath , but they generally live up to 90 seconds without breathing , and even diving champions cannot resist over 6 minutes .
The human brain is highly intolerant to the accumulation of carbon dioxide ( a result of the cell respiration ) in the blood irrigating the brain , and the urge for breathing cannot be stopped .
Drowning survivors described a " tearing and burning " sensation when water floods the lungs , followed by a feeling of tranquility , as the brain can no longer sustain high activity .
What 's next is the same scenario : the lack of oxygen leads to consciousness loss , heart attack , and brain death .
Blood loss , called hemorrhagic shock in medicine , produces in the end the same effect : no oxygen for the cells .
That 's why victims that are massively bleeding breathe so heavily : the lungs are trying to send more oxygen to the oxygen - hungry body .
A 70 kg ( 180 pounds ) man has about 5.6 liters of blood ( 8 % of the body weight ) .
Losing 1.5 liters of blood makes the individual feel weak , since all the blood has gone from the organs ( including muscles ) towards the lungs and heart , which try to compensate for the oxygen deficit .
The adrenalin released to increase blood pressure in the arteries causes anxiety .
Arginine vasopressin released to keep the water in the kidneys ( the organism loses a lot of water through blood ) makes the individual feel thirsty .
If the blood loss is not stopped , and the body has already lost 2 liters of blood , these compensating mechanisms fail .
The ion balance is destroyed , and the blood flow through capillaries is constricted .
The cells can no longer function , and fluid and protein leakage out of the cells occurs .
At this stage , even if the victim receives blood , the prolonged vasoconstiction has caused irremediable damage .
The unoxygenated brain falls into dizziness and confusion , followed by unconsciousness .
If the aortic or pulmonary artery dissection has taken place , pain similar to heart attack can occur .
Electrocution through a household device can paralyze the heart ( heart attack ) , interfering with its own electric signal coordinating the contraction of the heart muscle .
Much powerful shocks go beyond electrical impairment of the body , destroying tissues .
Damage to the heart tissue means heart attack , but to the brain it causes rapid unconsciousness , if not instant death .
Those executed on the electric chair can even experience tissue burning and paralysis of the breath muscles , of course , through asphyxiation .
When falling from a height , the heart does not stop , it breaks into pieces .
Usually , the ribs break in many pieces , which stab all the organs around .
The thoracic shock , causing instant death , prevails amongst suicide jumpers .
Survivors of such incidents describe the feeling of time slowing down .
Burning the heretics was believed to be the worst kind of death during the Medieval Ages .
But a sufficiently big fire kills the victims before them being touched by the flames , as the smoke gases , especially carbon monoxide , combine with the hemoglobin - the blood 's red pigment carrying oxygen to tissues .
The hemoglobin can no longer transport the oxygen to the tissues , and even if the victim is taken out of the burning building , or saved by firemen , he / she will die since the brain can not be oxygenated .
If the flames touch the skin of the conscious victim , they will induce tremendous pain , which slowly decreases with the destruction of the skin nerves , but persists , as inner tissues have pain sensors too .
Carbon monoxide is also the main culprit for sleep asphyxiation death cases caused by broken stoves ( the gas is the result of incomplete burning of wood or any other fuel ) .
This is perhaps the less painful death , also employed by suicidal people using car smoke generated in a closed room .
Explosive decompression means a sudden ( less than 0.1 seconds ) air pressure drop , caused by violent explosion , like in the case of a contained system ( inner airplane ) exposed in a moment to outer atmosphere or explosions caused by gas accumulation .
No , people do not ?
explode ? in such cases .
The exposure to low pressure causes swelling , but our skin is elastic and resistant and can cope with a drop of one atm .
( the required drop for killing a person is of about 8 atmospheres ) .
Survivors of such events reported chest pain , similar to the one you feel when someone hits you hard ( due to the swelling of the lungs ) , and even the feeling of air going out of the lungs .
If oxygenation is impeded , the individual loses consciousness in 15 seconds and dies of asphyxiation .
An incident recently occurred at an outpatient imaging center in western New York State , in which a firearm spontaneously discharged in a 1.5 - T MR imaging environment with active shielding .
To our knowledge , this is the first documented case of such an occurrence .
The event confirms previously reported theoretic risks of a firearm discharging in an MR imaging environment [ 1 ] .
In this report , we examine the incident in detail from the official police and ballistic reports .
Case Report Choose Top of page Case Report << Discussion References CITING ARTICLES
An off - duty police officer went to an outpatient imaging center ( not affiliated with our institution ) in western New York State to have an MR imaging examination .
The facility housed a 1.5 - T MR unit ( Signa ; General Electric Medical Systems , Milwaukee , WI ) with active shielding .
The officer was carrying a model 1991 A - 1 compact .45 caliber semiautomatic pistol ( Colt's Manufacturing , Hartford , CT ) .
The officer notified the technologist that he was carrying the weapon before entering the MR dressing room .
The technologist told the officer to take the gun with him .
The technologist intended to meet the officer in the MR patient waiting area before the examination and secure the weapon in that room , where he felt it would be safe .
However , the officer apparently misunderstood and took the gun into the MR suite .
The technologist was entering the officer 's personal data into the computer and did not see him entering the MR suite .
Once the officer was inside the MR suite , the gun was pulled from his hand as he attempted to place the gun on top of a cabinet 3 ft ( 0.9 m ) away from the magnet bore .
The gun was immediately pulled into the bore , where it struck the left side and spontaneously discharged a round into the wall of the room at the rear of the magnet .
Fortunately , no one was injured .
Although the gun struck the magnet bore , only minimal cosmetic damage occurred to the magnet itself .
The MR unit had full functional capability immediately after the gun discharged .
The weapon 's thumb safety was reportedly engaged when the gun discharged .
An unsuccessful attempt to remove the gun from the magnet resulted in the gun being pulled to the right side of the magnet ( Fig. 1 ) .
The decision was then made to power down the magnet to remove the gun .
Examination of the weapon by a ballistics laboratory concluded that the force of the magnetic field was responsible for the firearm 's discharge .
To understand how the gun discharged requires a brief discussion of the firing mechanics of the Colt 1991 A - 1.45 caliber pistol and the weapon 's safety mechanisms [ 2 ] .
When the weapon is normally fired , the trigger is pulled , which releases the sear .
The sear , in turn , releases the hammer .
The hammer then moves forward to strike the firing pin , which moves forward to strike the primer of the chambered round .
The Colt 1991 A - 1 pistol has three safety mechanisms ( Fig. 2A,2B ,2C,2D ) , including a thumb safety , grip safety , and firing pin block .
The thumb safety locks the sear in place and prevents the hammer from moving forward when the trigger is pulled .
The thumb safety also locks the slide in place .
The thumb safety is the weapon 's only active safety mechanism ; it must be turned on in order to work .
The grip safety is located at the back of the gun handle and prevents the trigger from being depressed .
The grip safety is a passive mechanism ; it is always on unless deactivated .
To deactivate it , the grip safety must be depressed at the same time the trigger is depressed ; otherwise , the trigger can not be pulled .
The firing pin block is a small metal block , approximately the size of a pencil eraser , that sits in the firing pin channel and prevents the firing pin from moving forward .
The firing pin block is held in place by a small spring .
When the trigger is pulled , a series of levers cam the firing pin block up into its own well within the slide to allow the firing pin to move freely within its channel .
At the time the weapon discharged , it was reportedly in a cocked and locked position ; that is , the hammer was cocked and the thumb safety was engaged to prevent the hammer from striking the firing pin .
A live round was in the chamber .
( Many people who choose this weapon for personal protection will carry it in this manner because it allows them to quickly fire the weapon if needed . )
When the firearm was removed from the magnet , the gun was still in a cocked and locked position .
An empty cartridge was found in the chamber .
The presence of an empty cartridge in the chamber is highly unusual .
If the thumb safety were not engaged and the weapon fired normally by depressing the trigger , the normal backward recoil of the slide should have automatically ejected the empty cartridge , and a new live round should have automatically been chambered .
As discussed earlier , the thumb safety performs two functions : it prevents the sear from releasing the hammer , thereby preventing the hammer from striking the firing pin ; it also locks the slide in place , preventing retrograde motion of the slide and automatic ejection of the empty cartridge .
Thus , the presence of an empty cartridge in the chamber confirms that the thumb safety was engaged at the time the gun was fired .
Given that the thumb safety was engaged when the gun discharged , it is also likely that the normal trigger and hammer mechanism of firing the gun was bypassed because the thumb safety would have also prevented release of the hammer .
The gun likely discharged as a result of the effect of the magnetic field on the firing pin block .
The firing pin block was probably drawn into its uppermost position by force of the magnetic field .
The firing pin block has to overcome only light pressure from a relatively small spring to release the firing pin .
The pistol was likely drawn into the magnetic field so that the muzzle struck the magnet 's bore first .
With the firing pin allowed to move freely in its channel , the force of the impact on the muzzle end was sufficient to cause the firing pin to overcome its spring pressure and move forward to strike the primer of the chambered round .
This account explains how the weapon discharged when the thumb safety was engaged .
The presence of an empty cartridge in the chamber explains why the gun did not discharge a second time when it was moved from the left to the right side of the bore .
Even if the identical forces were repeated , an empty cartridge , not a live round , was in the chamber at this time .
More talking - back to the powers that be .
This time on domestic spying , FISA , impeachment–and those pesky ex-Reagan officials accusing the Bush administration of war - crimes .

I do n't remember my university offering courses on how to make friends .
It might have – but I did n't know about it , and neither did any of my friends .
No one ever mentioned hearing of such a thing .
Yet New York University now offers a seminar called Facebook in the Flesh , reports the New Yorker .
The idea is to help freshmen who already know dozens of their classmates online but who worry they do n't know how to make new friends in person .
That 's the fear and the whimsy behind NYU assistant dean David Schachter 's decision to hold the workshop , even though he says he 's never been on Facebook and his advice to students parallels exactly what users already do online .
The mind boggles .
It makes me think of the moaning and wailing surrounding mobile devices and how we supposedly do n't connect " for real " anymore .
How we 're allegedly replacing real relationships with fake ones , true intimacy with illusion and strong social bonding with pseudo - social networking .
This is all because a lot of people apparently spend a lot of time conversing online rather than in the flesh .
And in order to keep up with all these relationships , we 're supposedly not being as attentive to the people around us as we should .
Not our loved ones , mind you , but the people we encounter casually as we go about our lives : bank tellers , dog walkers , grocers .
Tell me again why I should spend less time with the people I love and more time with strangers ?
Convince me that it 's more important to yak with a stranger at the neighborhood coffee house than it is to text conversation with my dear friend Monique .
It might look like I 'm ignoring a passing acquaintance in order to " use my phone . "
But actually I 'm checking in with a new mom who is running home , baby and business on her own while her partner 's job has him commuting to Canada temporarily .
( Hooray for unlimited international minutes ! )
Explain to me why I am contributing to The Decline of Morals and Manners in This Society because I prefer to attend to friends and lovers through our cell phones rather than allow geography to determine who I can and can't relate with .
I do n't dismiss out of hand the concerns about techno - communication .
Daniel Goleman , a proponent of the science of empathy , intuition and emotion and a thinker I trust , writes about a mass wave of disconnection in the introduction to his book Social Intelligence .
In explaining how mood and emotion are contagious , he notes the ripple effect of rude behavior and how spreading negativity and hurt feelings damages the human web more than most people realize .
But rudeness is a separate issue from connectivity .
Mobile devices should not make us impolite .
I recently caught myself flirting by text message while checking into a hotel .
I did n't particularly want to connect with the hotel guy – I wanted to keep going with the sweet ( and spicy ) nothings .
It was an almost physical wrench to set the phone down even for five minutes .
Yet to do otherwise would be as churlish as carrying on a conversation with a companion as if the clerk was n't even there .
( Which does happen , alas , but not by me . )
We all need to accept responsibility for our manners .
But harnessing technology to nurture our existing relationships has not damaged our ability to connect " for real . "
Connectivity gives shy swains time to craft what they want to say , and it gives extroverts layers of interaction to satisfy their craving for people contact and shared energy .
People once took for granted the idea that meeting new people was easier for some folks than others .
And I think people who are not comfortable using technology to do that , who simply can't do it , or who have burned out or become overwhelmed by technology worry about those who can handle it .
I think they feel left out .
Like we 're in a secret club they can't get into , or did n't enjoy once they got through the door .
Mobile service providers know exactly what we use cell phones for .
Cingular 's commercials about what dropped calls can do to lovers get right to the heart of the matter .
And Vodaphone has a great one about a sleeping model , an opportunist and the trouble we can get into with camera phones .
Just like the fears people express about internet users " replacing " love and sex with delusion and cybersex , the concerns about " everyone " interacting through devices rather than in person miss the point .
Two points .
For one thing , many of the people we 're interacting with through our mobiles are our intimates .
They are people we feel so connected with , we want to be with them across time and distance .
For another , we have to trust each other to disconnect when we need to .
I 'm not going to bemoan a " dependence " on technology - facilitated communication ( as if our entire economy is n't based on such a thing ! ) when we can all put down the phone or walk away from the computer when we get overwhelmed
We are not going to wreck society simply because we can choose who we want to talk to at any given time , based not on proximity but on attachment and affection .
I even believe we are strengthening human bonds through these technologically supported connections .
With mobile devices especially , we 're sharing the love .
Our mobiles are less anonymous and more personal than online message boards or blog comments , and we use them as extensions of ourselves and our relationships .
They define " personal tech . "
And the very limitation that makes flirting and lovemaking so fun also makes it too frustrating to bother with flaming and hate speech .
I have also found that nurturing relationships through tech has taught me to be more forgiving and patient .
I 'm a better listener , because texting forces me to slow down .
I 've also become better about asking for clarification when I do n't understand something , rather than jumping to a conclusion ; I do n't agonize over the question , " What did he mean by that ? "
Modern relationships – whether between colleagues , friends or lovers – flow between flesh and technology more easily every day .
Let 's accept that we 've been dazzled by the novelty of our devices long enough and dust off our manners .
Then let 's embrace the truth that emotions are contagious , and ensure that the emotions we inspire in even the most casual of encounters are pleasant or at least neutral .
And then let 's get back on our devices and send a text message so hot , so loving , so clever that our bosom buddy cannot help but pass that warmth on to someone else .
See you in a fortnight ,

WooMe is a new way to speed date .
It 's an online network that lets you schedule times to hold a meeting , where you 'll get to chat with them in live 1 - minute conversations .
I got a chance to check it out while it was still in private beta , and I only wish I 'd been prepared with my webcam for the session I had with WooMe co-founder and CEO Stephen Stokols !
Needless to say , it 's a fun , easy and painless experience .
You schedule an event , and let people join up .
You can also invite others to join your event .
If you 're logged onto WooMe , the session will automatically begin , so make sure your webcam and microphone are ready .
After each conversation , the next one will proceed .
At the end , you 'll see the profile pictures of everyone you 've spoken with , and then you make a final decision on which ones you liked , and which ones you 'd like to dump .
During your speed session , you 'll also be asked to write one word that describes the person you 're conversing with .
These tag words will be used on their personal profiles , and sort of build reputations for users on the site .
Mutual connections get to know each other on a more personal level , though unlike SpeedDate , there 's already a good amount of information you can find about a person by checking out their profiles on WooMe .
I should add that sessions do n't have to revolve around speed dating .
Stokols gave me an example of how one person had used WooMe to interview potential roommates .
And WooMe will actually use its speed sessions to screen potential employees before bringing them in for an in - person interview .
What makes WooMe different from other speed dating services is that it's not just about dating , so that makes its format far more flexible to be used for other situations .
That also means that speed sessions do n't have to be contrived or organized by WooMe , and you do n't have to wait around for an even number of boys and girls .
Interestingly enough , Stokols mentioned an advertising opportunity that arises from these unevenly paired speed sessions .
Once you 've got a person with no one left to chat with , you have their attention for another 60 seconds or so before the session is over .
I noticed that WooMe already has some fun music playing to keep you from being too bored , but Stokols would also like to use this for ads , of varied nature .
Any type of mutlimedia ads would work here , from widgets to games , to videos .
I 'll be keeping an eye on this to see how ad options play out , and how appealing they are to marketers .
Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings , please call your boss and urge him to read your May 9 speech to the National Summit on America 's Silent Epidemic in Washington , DC .
Your eloquence in describing the silent epidemic was exceeded only by our shock at the facts you described .
" The dropout rate for African - American , Hispanic , and Native American students approaches 50 percent .
. . .
Every year nearly a million kids fail to graduate high school .
. . .
The United States has the most severe income gap between high school graduates and dropouts in the world . "
You exhorted us to deal with this problem because " stopping the exodus " is both a " moral imperative " and an " economic necessity . "
You lambasted our government 's current " state of denial " and demanded " a state of acknowledgement . "
Right on , Secretary Spellings .
But your own boss must be one of those in a state of denial .
At the same time you were delivering your call for action , President Bush was demanding passage of the Senate immigration bill which would dump many more millions of high school dropouts in your lap .
According to the Pew Hispanic Center , 49 percent of illegal aliens are high school dropouts , compared with 25 percent of legal immigrants , and only 9 percent of native - born Americans .
Secretary Spellings proclaimed in her speech that " the days when you could earn a good living off the sweat of your brow are disappearing .
In industries ranging from manufacturing to micro-processing , a high school diploma is the bare minimum for success . "
But that 's not what corporate lobbyists are telling the Senators .
The lobbyists are saying that employers need waiters and dishwashers to work in restaurants , lettuce and strawberry pickers for big agriculture , and grass - cutters and shrub - trimmers to tend our lawns .
High - school dropouts are the kind of workers these employers want to hire .
That 's why employers are lobbying to legalize the up to 20 million illegals already here and also to bring in hundreds of thousands more in a guest - worker program .
The CEOs of multinationals publicly announced their dissatisfaction with the Senate bill because it contains some feeble provisions to give some limited preference ( eight years into the future ) to foreigners with skills instead of giving preference to remote relatives of the illegal alien high school dropouts whom the Senate bill would legalize .
Big business employers prefer to import foreigners who are eager for any kind of menial job .
They come from countries where they have endured a poverty so severe that it is incomprehensible to even the poorest of U.S. citizens .
Big business employers know that legalized illegals and guest - workers are willing to work long hours at sub-minimum wages .
Employers know that U.S. taxpayers will supplement those low wages by the handout called the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) and to pay the costs of medical care , public schooling , school lunches , housing subsidies , and dozens of other tax - paid benefits that flow to low - income workers .
The Heritage Foundation estimates that U.S. taxpayers pay about $ 20,000 per year to every household headed by a high school dropout .
That 's even before retirement age enables the high school dropouts and their imported relatives to cash in on Social Security and Medicare .
In her speech , Secretary Spellings coined an apt phrase and also borrowed a pertinent phrase from the immigration debate to describe urban public schools .
She called them " dropout factories " and decried the fact that they have been " in the shadows for so long . "
You said it well , Secretary Spellings .
It 's not just illegal aliens who need to be brought out of " the shadows " ; it 's the scandal of forcing the taxpayers to pay an average of $ 10,000 per public school student even though many students are not taught how to read .
A typical bureaucrat , Spellings ' solution is to pour more taxpayers ' money into the schools .
But that could only address the problem of kids still in school ; it does nothing for the dropouts who have given up on schooling and gone out to the streets where they get into all sorts of mischief .
What our own high school dropouts need is a job so they can get started building a life .
Instead of rewarding illegal aliens with a Z - visa to enable them to hold a job legally , Secretary Spellings should ask the Senate to authorize a Z - diploma to encourage U.S. businesses to hire our own high school dropouts .
The primary result of the Senate immigration bill will be to provide corporations with more high school dropouts , and that 's exactly what our country does not need .
Secretary Spellings , when you phone President Bush , maybe he will answer if you press 2 for Spanish .
Throughout your life , you are given bits of advice , by experts , by newspapers , by people who have done it themselves and know what they are talking about and by people who have no idea what they are talking about .
And you filter it for whether it makes sense and whether it dovetails nicely with what you have already decided to do .
Then you get pregnant and a number of factors change : first , the advice is much more patronising , and much more militant .
Take last Friday 's announcement that , instead of allowing themselves the odd glass of wine , as previously recommended , from now on pregnant women should drink nothing at all .
Not based on any new research , by the way , just " to be on the safe side " .
Second , you lose the nonchalant " if cheese really were poisonous , he would have died by now " attitude you had when you got your first puppy , say , and freely fed it treats .
And third , just when you start to take advice most seriously , it conflicts .
I 'll give you an example - the other day , I went to the doctor with a kidney infection , and she said : " Cocodamol is the best thing to take when you 're pregnant . "
I walked across the Asda car park into the pharmacy , where the pharmacist said : " You ca n't take cocodamol , you 're pregnant . "
So I did what the pharmacist told me to , because it seemed rude to ignore the advice of the person standing right in front of me - but that 's not necessarily the best way to make medical decisions , is it ?
So amid the barrage of advice , what should you take seriously , and what can you ignore ?
What 's right , and what 's just scary nonsense ?
I decided to do some research on the subject , rather than just taking the government 's word for it .
Alcohol
It is a shame , but there is very little research done on the prevailing attitudes to the drunk pregnant person , so we will have to rely on patched - together accounts from my mum and my own memory .
Thirty years ago , it was not the done thing to get rolling drunk while pregnant , but it was n't the done thing for non-pregnant women either .
You could certainly drink moderately while pregnant , however .
Ten years ago , an EastEnders storyline had Tiffany out on the razzle while she was up the duff , and Grant getting upset .
EastEnders is a brilliant barometer for a certain sort of acceptability - it is n't an accurate portrait of anything , but it does indicate that in 1996 , middle - class people definitely thought getting lashed up while with child was dangerous , and that it was probably something working - class people did .
Still , a glass of wine a day was considered a decent way to proceed .
Five years ago , the government advice was as it was until last Thursday , one or two drinks once or twice a week , but it was taken as given that this was akin to government advice on regular drinking - that is , " 14 units a week , are you kidding ? " , and nobody frowned upon the expectant mother having a drink a day .
For the past two years , however , the Daily Mail has been obsessively reporting surveys saying expectant mothers should not drink at all as there is no safe lower limit , and for the past year , this has been bread and butter for right - wing broadsheets too , plus the Observer .
A typical article about foetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) will start like this : a case study will be presented , in which a child with the full range of symptoms is described .
These include mental impairment , very low birthweight and subsequent growth restriction , and a distinctive phenotype ( a small and misshapen head , widely spaced eyes , thin lips and a flat philtrum ) .
Then it will describe the rapid growth in FASD , without pointing out that this correlates exactly with the rise in binge drinking .
( Nobody is in any doubt that binge drinking is bad for foetal health .
The question mark is over whether or not we should be abstaining completely . )
Then it will say something like , in America , pregnant women are advised not to drink at all , and then a doctor - quite often it is Raja Mukherjee , consultant psychiatrist at the Surrey and Borders Partnership trust - will be quoted thus :
" The uncertain level of individual risk to the developing foetus , coupled with the possibility of misinterpreting a health promotion message , mean that the only safe message in pregnancy is abstinence from alcohol . "
The piece , if it's in a quality newspaper , will then rather sheepishly deliver the information that the original case study was the child of a serious alcoholic , drinking upwards of a bottle of vodka a day .
In a tabloid , this will be passed over .
Last week the government guidelines changed , and we are now told that abstinence is the only responsible choice , because , as the Guardian put it , " Ministers believe the change in guidance on alcohol is needed because too many women underestimate the risks to their baby , although there is no new scientific evidence . "
All this despite the fact that a study in 2006 by the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology concluded that there was no convincing evidence of adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure at low to moderate levels , where moderate was defined as 10.5 units per week ( but , the study author Dr Robert Fraser reminds us , not at one sitting , obviously ) .
Physiologically and sociologically , it just does not make sense that small amounts of alcohol are bad for you when pregnant .
As Dr Eric Jauniaux , professor of obstetrics and foetal medicine at the Royal Free hospital in London , points out : " Alcohol is mainly metabolised by the liver , and only what 's left will be met by the placenta .
The amount that could reach the foetus in a glass of beer or a glass of wine is negligible .
I would be much more concerned with breastfeeding and drinking . "
Jauniaux , incidentally , has been studying transfer through the placenta for the past 20 years , is one of the leading national experts on the matter and yet is never quoted in connection with any of the scare stories you read on alcohol and unborn babies .
And sociologically , of course , Jauniaux reminds us : " How long have people been drinking wine or beer , thousands of years ? "
Many of our mothers drank during pregnancy , and while this may not be very scientific , the lack of alcohol - related brain damage in our generation should militate against blank credulity when you are told not to touch a drop .
The obvious question now is , what is this enthusiasm for giving women advice that is strict to the point of being unscientific ?
First , consider Mukherjee 's perspective , which is not of foetal research but of neuroscience .
He sees children with , for example , behavioural problems , poor concentration and hyperactivity disorder .
Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion , in that once you have ruled out a raft of medical conditions whose current prevalence is largely unexplained , then you diagnose FASD .
Research on the impact of ethanol on pregnant rats leads Mukherjee to believe that small levels of alcohol can be dangerous in humans , but obstetrics experts such as Robert Fraser at the National Perinatal Epidemology
Unit have not been sufficiently impressed by the research to let it sway their conclusions .
Anyway , Mukherjee maintains - I am paraphrasing , but not unfairly , I think - that , when you have this web of often indistinguishable conditions , ruinous to the lives of children and , of course , their parents , if there is even a possibility that alcohol could be causing any of it , then can't we at least stop these pregnant women drinking altogether so we can see what is going on ?
You can see his frustration , but from the point of view of the pregnant woman , presented with no bona fide evidence for foetal harm at low drinking levels , the response is , of course , " Sod that . "
Incidentally , in America , the great white hope of the teetotal pregnancy , oft cited by all the teetotal campaigners , the single greatest cause of foetal growth restriction is crack addiction .
There has never been any controversy about this - crack addiction is strongly discouraged during pregnancy as it is illegal .
And yet the message of abstinence has not worked .
Abstinence messages never work .
Everybody knows they do n't work , and I would go one further and say that social conservatives never intend them to work - they intend , rather , with their stringency , to effect a severance between the state and the individual .
Do n't come crying to us if it all goes wrong .
We have already warned you to be perfect .
Listeria
If you have the misfortune not to be pregnant , you might not know that the expectant mother is instructed by everyone , very forcefully , not to eat blue cheese or any cheese that has n't been pasteurised , likewise unpasteurised milk and ice cream .
Also you must not eat : rinded cheese , goat 's cheese , pâté , terrines and rillettes , sushi , sashimi and artisan - smoked fish ( as opposed to the industrial sort , which is smoked to death ) .
This is besides the other fish injunctions , which tend to be about mercury - oh , and bagged salad .
Basically , if you can get it in a deli and it's costed per 100g , you probably are n't allowed to eat it .
Most of these injunctions are about avoiding listeriosis , which is the disease proceeding from the listeria bacteria ( apart from the mercury stuff , and " no liver " injunctions , which are about an excess of vitamin A ) .
Listeria has been my particular bugbear ever since a midwife - that is , a trained prenatal professional who , unless I develop complications , represents the highest medical authority I can expect to deal with throughout my pregnancy - told me that I could get listeriosis , thereby brain - damaging my foetus , without knowing about it .
Now , listeriosis is an incredibly serious disease , with extremely serious symptoms , taken extremely seriously by epidemiologists nationwide .
Get it without noticing it ?
If I got listeriosis , the national papers would know about it .
It would be the third outbreak that has occurred in this country in the past 20 years .
My beloved , C , said : " Well , she was just erring on the side of caution . "
This is a common line .
But the distinction between " caution " and " misinformation " could not be more important - when it is blurred , as it so often is , the upshot is that pregnant women either become neurotic , or lose faith in the medical profession altogether .
Here are some other things that are wantonly untrue : pasteurisation , in fact , has nothing to do with a cheese 's ability to harbour the listeria bacteria .
The bacteria that characterise different cheeses are introduced after the pasteurisation process anyway .
Listeria flourishes in moist environments , so parmesan is safe where camembert is n't , but even rinded and soft cheeses are safe once they have been cooked .
But food hygiene is a much more important factor than moisture - raw fish does not come out of the sea carrying listeria , but contracts the bacteria from contact with dirty hands .
Of the past two outbreaks of listeria in Britain , one was from butter and the other from lettuce ( there have been other instances of product recalls , but no human contamination ) .
In fact the three worst recorded cases of list - eria since 1992 have all been in France , and were all from pork tongue in jelly , which nobody in their right mind would ever eat .
Of the past 10 listeriosis outbreaks in America , only two were from cheese , and one of those was a Mexican homemade cheese .
The notion that there are pregnant people out there whipping themselves into a frenzy of guilt because they have eaten some gorgonzola is just infuriating .
Jauniaux cites an interesting difference between Google hit rates and those on PubMed , a collected source of peer - reviewed papers in medical journals .
" Listeria and pregnancy - Google , 190,000 hits ; PubMed , 107 hits .
Cheese and listeria - Google , 194,000 hits ; PubMed , 169 hits .
Sushi and pregnancy - Google , 628,000 hits ; PubMed , 0 hits .
Raw fish and listeria : Google , 123,000 hits ; PubMed , 49 hits .
You can see immediately , " Jauniaux concludes , " the disproportion between the epidemiological evidence and the general public hysteria about the disease . "
I wrote a potted rant about listeria hysteria some weeks ago in this paper , and readers emailed me accusing me of murdering people 's foetuses with misinformation .
Which is completely foolish .
Jauniaux gave a lecture at the annual conference of bacteriologists two years ago , and no one in attendance had come across an outbreak of listeria in years .
In England and Wales , the last figures for listeriosis were 2.7 cases per million ( and that is among the entire population , not pregnant women ) .
This risk is not negligible - tolerable risk is defined by the government as one in a million - but it is pretty small and , more importantly , the advice is misleading .
In fact the potential danger comes from ready - to - eat foods : it could be anything that gives you listeria , it could be cheese or butter or lettuce or coleslaw ; an ice - cream cake or a rice salad .
In Spain , pregnant women are told not to eat any salad .
All of this is overblown , and none of it is as effective as a simple food hygiene message , telling you to observe the basic rules that you would hold to if you were cooking for people you did n't want to poison : wash knives and boards , wash foodstuffs and so on .
And by the way : the most dangerous places to eat in Britain are hospitals and old people 's homes , and that is before they have even had a go at treating you .
Toxoplasmosis
Foetal exposure to the disease results in brain damage , blindness or possibly death .
Famously , you get it from cat poo : except that almost nobody ever does .
Jauniaux points out : " The cat will only give it to you when it has infected itself .
It does n't live in the cat . "
In fact , undercooked lamb and beef ( all meat could carry it , but it is not considered safe to eat pink chicken or pork ) are the cause of toxoplasmosis most of the time , and you can also get it from root vegetables .
In short , you can get it from anything that grows in the ground or that eats plants from the ground .
Again , thorough cooking banishes the disease , so there is no great mystery to avoiding it .
Rates , however , are very high - vastly greater , at one in 2,000 mothers - to - be getting infected , than with listeria .
Rates are broadly comparable to Down 's syndrome , which , of course , is screened for .
In France , rates are one per 500 pregnant women , but " most of the population in France is immune , which is interesting .
They have a much more varied diet , " Jauniaux observes .
These figures are a bit complicated , since the likelihood of the mother transmitting to the foetus goes up dramatically according to gestational age ( first trimester , 5 % chance , final trimester , 80 % ) , but the chances of the foetus being brain damaged by the disease decrease with its gestational age .
It is not necessarily helpful to talk about stamping the disease out altogether , since having had it pre-pregnancy ( this is known as " seroprevalence " , which is much greater in France but even there has gone down in the past two decades ) cancels your chances of passing it on to your offspring .
Most interesting of all is this : toxoplasmosis can be screened for during pregnancy , and can also treated in the womb , which is not the case for Down 's syndrome .
This is your classic authoritarian sleight of hand - with a scattergun delivery of partly accurate , partly misrepresented and partly plain wrong information , all our attention is focused on our individual responsibilities , which we will probably , through a combination of waywardness and stupidity , fail to fulfil anyway .
Yet , statistically , it would be a better investment for our unborn children if we were to eat whatever we liked and spent our time and energy pressuring MPs for better prenatal screening and better standards of hygiene in medical institutions .
Caffeine
Excessive consumption of caffeine has been linked to miscarriage , cleft palate and low birthweight .
It is frowned on far more in the US than here .
There , pregnant women are told to stop eating chocolate , despite the fact that the average chocolate bar has 30mg of caffeine , and 240 mg a day has always been considered a safe amount .
In other words , you would have to eat eight bars of chocolate a day to tip the scales , in which case your risk factor would more probably be that you were obese and / or suffering from malnutrition .
If a clearly pregnant woman were to order a double espresso in America , it would be on about the same scale of taboo as Kate Moss being photographed here buying a pack of fags while pregnant .
Even in the UK , the advice is " three cups of coffee a day " , though I can't tell you ( and do n't think I have n't looked ) whether this means decent coffee or service - station coffee , nor whether that advice is on the basis of miscarriage - risk or another factor , nor , for that matter , how big the cups of coffee are .
At the beginning of this year , a Danish study published findings on this subject : 1,200 women were surveyed , which is more than double the sample of the next largest study .
The adjustments for confounding factors were comprehensive , and the conclusion was that no significant differences occurred between the caffeine drinkers and the decaff drinkers , in the birthweight of their babies or the frequency of preterm delivery : even among women who drank more than seven cups of coffee a day .
But when a midwife - a different one from the listeria woman - said , " Do n't drink coffee " , and I said , " There 's actually this Danish study out ... " , she said : " Who do you think knows better , a doctor , or a Danish study ? "
As if there were something inherently untrustworthy about being Danish .
But besides that , well , let 's see - who would know more ?
A general practitioner or a research body conducting the largest European study on record ?
As a pregnant woman , you are expected to relinquish your critical judgment altogether ; the atmosphere seems to be , " You can make your own stupid judgments when it 's about your own stupid skin , but you are in charge of a foetus now .
You 'll probably do it wrong . "
In conclusion
Despite having got yourself into a spot of bother , pregnant women , you are still in the possession of adult judgment , and you are still allowed to use it .
If the official advice sounds stringent to the point of insanity , examine it more closely - you are n't just a selfish person , looking for loopholes for your own sorry enjoyment .
Try to remember , when the advice turns out to be nonsense , that not everyone has evil motives : some people will give you bad advice because they are stupid or ill - informed .
Others will give you bad advice because , without even realising it , they have a yen to bring the business of procreation under closer central control .
They just do n't trust you .
But then , why should they ?
You are an absurd shape and you keep crying .

Battlestar Galactica : Razor type TV Show network USA
Special ” Battlestar Galactica : Razor ” recap
Man , it has been too long since we got together like this , to talk about last night ’s Battlestar Galactica .
And I ’ve missed you .
Really .
Okay , maybe the last time we spoke , things were a little chilly .
It was me , not you .
But here we are , with the only new Galactica we ’re likely to get for a long , long while .
Good thing it was awesome .
The battlestar Pegasus is a ghost ship , haunted by the mistakes of the past .
Her first commander , Admiral Helena Cain ( Michelle Forbes ) , was a stern taskmaster , forced by circumstances to make decisions as she saw fit , decisions that are judged by the Galactica crew ( and , by extension , us ) to have been disasters .
Then came Commander Fisk ( Graham Beckel ) , her executive officer , who let greed pull the shining battlestar further into the muck .
And then Commander Garner ( William Heard ) , an engineer who , seeing the machine but not the men , could n’t right the ship .
Razor follows two stories , both of which revolve around a young Pegasus officer named Kendra Shaw : Admiral Cain ’s experiences during , and following , the Cylon attack on the colonies , and newly minted commander Lee Adama ’s first mission at Pegasus ‘ helm .
( There ’s also a mini - detour further back in time to peep at Bill Adama ’s first mission as a Viper pilot . )
And we pick up Razor as Lee Adama takes command of the Pegasus .
He says to his new crew , ” We ca n’t always choose our circumstances , but we can choose how we handle them . ”
As if these people had n’t already learned that lesson the hard way .
We can see the price they ’ve paid on Kendra Shaw ’s ( easy on the eyes ) face , as she stands in front of her new commanding officer .
She ’s worn , beaten — and not just a little bit high — and surprised by Lee ’s offer of a promotion to XO .
Especially after her priceless ” Your daddy just gave you a battlestar ” line .
If Lee ’s learned one thing under his father ’s command , it ’s that you need to have someone willing to tell truth to power .
Scorpion Fleet Shipyards , 10 months ago .
A scene we ’ve seen in almost every space opera since classic
Trek : the officer getting his / her first look at a new commission .
So many little character touches .
The introduction of Cain ’s executive officer , Colonel Belzen , as a man with a wife and kids — a family that knows Cain well enough to want to see her on shore leave .
It only makes it that much more devastating when she shoots that XO in the dome for not following an order .
Just after he tells her , ” Once in a while , it ’s okay to get off the treadmill , ” she starts to run even faster , a tacit rebuttal of that very concept , that it ’s okay to ever relax when you ’re in command .
A Cylon as a network administrator .
Fitting , considering they would use those very networks to cripple the fleet .
Gina ’s last name , Envierre , means ” resurrection . ”
Again , those little throwaway things .
God , as they say , is in the details .
So , that ’s what the Cylon attack looked like .
There are times , and this is one of them , that I ’m amazed at what BSG ‘s effects dudes ( and dudettes ) can pull off .
To not only render the scope of this all - out attack on the shipyards — complete with Raider carpet - bombings — but to do it in a faux hand - held style — man , that ’s tough .
Say what you will about Cain , she ’s good in a crisis .
Her choice to order a blind FTL jump underlines the idea that , sometimes , what matters is not that you made the right decision , it ’s that you made any decision at all .
If the choice falls between certain death and possible death … well , that ’s not much of a choice , is it ?
Okay , now we ’re back in the ” present . ”
( You ’ll have to forgive these blunt little way markers ; there ’s so much temporal shifting in these two hours that keeping it all straight requires some bluntness . )
Adama gives
Lee his first mission : a search - and - rescue operation , looking for some missing scientists .
( Before we get any further , I just want to take a moment to say how refreshing it is to see Edward James Olmos again .
After a fall TV season full of man-boys — Reaper , Chuck , The Big Bang Theory — it ’s nice to see a real solid hunk of maturity again .
Sometimes , I just wanna hug him . )
( Too much with that last bit there ?
I get that .
Sorry . )
Back in the ” past , ” we learn the defining ethos that separates Cain from Adama .
She tells Shaw , ” Hold on to that anger , and you keep it close .
It ’ll stop you being afraid the next time , and it ’ll tell you what to do . ”
The mark of Cain is anger .
The mark of Adama ?
Duty .
When push came to shove , Cain gave free rein to her anger and lashed out , while Adama circled the wagons .
( It also helped that Adama — and he admits as much — had President Roslin perched on his shoulder . )
” War is our imperative … payback . ”
( And I ’m not gonna mention the purportedly rousing but actually pretty cheesy ” So say we all ” rally .
No , sir . )
And when Cain dropped her anger , just for a moment , to find solace in the arms of Gina Six , Gina ’s treachery only encouraged Cain to wear her anger as a shield , to wield it as a weapon .
Alas , I ’m getting a little ahead of myself .
If it was n’t clear before , it seems the Six model was created for the express purpose of seduction .
( Six is , after all , just one vowel away from sex . )
Caprica
Six seduced the secrets right out of Gaius Baltar , and Gina Six made with the hot love to get in good with Cain and , by extension , her crew , allowing her to get the access codes ( to somethingorother ) from Shaw .
NEXT : Classic ’ 70s Cylons attack !
” Present ” : Holy crap !
Classic Cylon raiders .
You know , from the ’70s show .
Bearing down on Starbuck and Pegasus .
Just when you think that BSG has left the past behind , out come those same shiny rocket plates that Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict did battle with .
” By your command , ” indeed .
And I love that Starbuck is faced with an officer who ’s as crazy - reckless - brilliant as she is .
And Kara does n’t know what to do with that .
I got the feeling watching Razor that Shaw is exactly what Starbuck would ’ve become without Adama ’s guiding hand — and Starbuck sees that , and it scares her a little .
” Past ” :
And here ’s that moment we heard about , back when Tigh and Fisk were sharing an officer - to - officer drink - up in the Pegasus two - parter : Cain shooting her own XO for failing to follow an order .
The scariest thing ?
I ’m sure that Cain is everything they teach commanding officers to be in , er , commanding - officer school .
Just without the temperance that life teaches you .
And if she ever had a touch of that , it was burned out the minute Shaw revealed Gina Six to , indeed , be a Cylon .
” Way past ” ( and , yes , I know this is getting confusing ) :
On the mention of a Cylon hybrid — the missing link between machine and organic being — Adama flashes back to a mission during the first Cylon War .
And damned if the guy they got to play young Adama , Nico Cortez , does n’t look more like Olmos than his own son , Bodie ( who plays Hotdog , one of Galactica ‘s Viper jocks ) .
Young Bill Adama stumbles onto what looks like the set for a direct - to - DVD Hellraiser sequel .
Blood , viscera , and distended body parts everywhere .
Truth to be told , this stuff was my least favorite segment of Razor .
While it ’s kinda neat to see ” Husker ” on his first mission , it does n’t really add anything to the story .
That material actually plays much better as stand - alone webisodes , à la ” Resistence . ”
And that ’s all I ’m gonna say about that .
” Present ” : Didja ever find yourself working on a project or something , one you knew you could do perfectly well , and your father was hovering over you — not actively undermining you , but taking you off your game with his very presence ?
( Yeah , I just revealed a little too much there . )
But that ’s how Lee must ’ve felt when dear old Dad transferred ” his flag ” over to Pegasus for the mission to rescue their lost crewmen from this Cylon hybrid .
” Past ” : Torturing Gina .
The fact that we now know the events leading up to the Cylon ’s debasement does n’t justify it — but we understand the motivation behind it .
( I actually typed ” her debasement ” and then deleted it .
A machine ca n’t be a ” her , ” can it ?
Ah , the eternal Galactica debate rages on , if only in my head . )
Cain wanted Gina to feel as crappy about herself as Cain did .
Cain felt abused , and so must Gina .
Does n’t make it any easier to watch , though , knowing what ’ll happen .
If , as Cain explained to her crew , war is their imperative , it makes perfect sense that the Pegasus would strip - mine that civilian fleet of everything worth having .
And it makes sense that Shaw would become the instrument of that imperative — and the catalyst for that massacre — since she ” came of age ” under Cain ’s guidance .
Again , does n’t make it right , but I get it .
And I get that shooting those innocent people would leave Shaw a husk of a woman , who could fill that void with either drugs or redemption .
And drugs are easier .
I wanna take a moment to talk about Michelle Forbes , who rises to the task of transforming what could easily be a one - dimensional character into a woman you can empathize with , even just a little bit .
The things she does are horrible .
But she knows this .
And she does them anyway , even if those actions cost her her soul .
But she believes , and that belief is what allows us to pity her more than we hate her .
And Forbes walks that tightrope like a ninja .
” Present ” : The big rescue .
Standard top - flight Galactica .
Smart action , great effects ( though part of me wanted the old Centurions to be dudes in suits , and not CG ) , requisite moral quandaries .
( Should Lee nuke the basestar ?
Who will stay behind to set off the bomb ? )
Of course , you knew that Starbuck was n’t gonna buy it , not here .
That ’s the only problem with this episode : that you basically knew that Shaw was n’t going to make it back alive , since we never saw her before .
So once that crossroads appeared on the horizon , you knew who was gonna stay behind .
Meeting the Hybrid 1.0 was cool , though .
Cryptic .
Serene .
Dropping that ominous hint about Kara Thrace — that ” she will lead the human race to its end … .
She is the herald of the apocalypse ” — which will echo clear through to the upcoming fourth season .
All in all , Razor was pretty much everything you could ask for — provided you did n’t ask for it to further the ongoing story lines .
But as a stand - alone adventure , it satisfied the hunger that so many of us have had for Galactica — good Galactica — since midway through last season .
Now , if only the wait for next season did n’t feel so interminable …
What do you think ?
Was Kendra Shaw ’s story a tragic or a heroic one ?
Can one find redemption for actions so horrific ?
Was the Cylon hybrid telling the truth about Kara , or is it another Cylon trick ?
GOP lawmakers accuse White House of selective leaks on Syria raid David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 22 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush has consistently refused to comment on leaked claims that US intelligence believes the target of an Israeli raid in Syria on September 6 was a nuclear rector being built for Syria by North Korea .
Rep. Peter Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , and Rep. Ileana Ross - Lehtinen ( R- FL ) , a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , say that they have been briefed on the intelligence but many members of Congress have not .
They are accusing the administration in a Wall Street Journal op - ed ( sub. req. ) of using selective leaks , thereby " preventing due diligence and oversight . "
The lawmakers write , " We are concerned that , although the Bush administration refuses to discuss the Israeli airstrike with the American people or with the majority of Congress , it has not hesitated to give information on background to the press to shape this story to its liking .
New York Times writer David Sanger authored and coauthored articles on Oct. 14 and 15 that appeared to reflect extensive input from senior policy makers .
Washington Post writer Glenn Kessler coauthored an article on Sept. 21 that also cited inside information from the administration .
We believe this is unacceptable . "
The White House has denied authorizing any leaks and is not commenting on Hoekstra 's remarks .
Hoekstra and Ros-Lehtinen are both known for their support of a more aggressive foreign policy towards Iran .
In 2006 , Larisa Alexandrovna reported for RAW STORY on Hoekstra 's approval of Vice President Cheney 's renewed use of former Iran - Contra middleman Manucher Ghorbanifar to help frustrate diplomatic talks between the US and Iran .
A follow - up article by Alexandrovna revealed that Hoekstra himself had met with Ghorbanifar in the late spring or early summer of 2006 in a possible attempt to create " falsified intelligence " that could lead to war with Iran .
Alexandrovna has also reported that the target of the Israeli airstrike was not a nuclear facility and , most recently , that sources in the intelligence community believe Vice President Cheney is behind the selective leaks concerning the incident .
One intelligence official told Alexandrovna , " The allegations that North Korea was helping to build a nuclear reactor have not been substantiated by US intelligence , but that has n't stopped Dick Cheney and his minions at the NSC , Elliot Abrams and Steve Hadley , from leaking the information [ to the press ] , which appears to be misleading in the extreme . "

NAMING yourself after the three - headed dog that guards the gates to hell was , perhaps , asking for trouble .
Cerberus , the private - equity beast in question , now finds itself at the centre of a fierce debate about whether corporate America is in for a hellish time , as the credit crisis spreads from financial services to the rest of the economy .
Only months ago Cerberus was praised as the saviour of the American car industry when it bought Chrysler from its German owner and struck a remarkable deal with the unions to cut jobs and benefits .
But on November 20th it emerged that Cerberus 's bankers had abandoned efforts to sell $ 4 billion of the debt it took on when it bought Chrysler .
Investors turned up their noses even when offered a 3 % discount .
Cerberus has also been hit by growing problems at GMAC , the financing arm of General Motors , in which it bought a 51 % stake for $ 14 billion last year .
GMAC reported a net loss of $ 1.6 billion for the third quarter , up from a loss of $ 173 m in the same period last year .
More controversially , on November 14th Cerberus pulled out of a $ 4 billion deal to buy United Rentals , a power - tool rental firm .
This provoked so much criticism that the famously secretive private - equity firm broke its vow of silence , telling the Wall Street Journal that the attacks on its credibility and integrity were “ unfounded ” and that it still has “ more than $ 10 billion of available liquidity ” .
What happens to private equity may be a leading indicator of how the crisis in the financial system will affect the rest of the business world , both because private - equity deals are so dependent on large amounts of debt , and because many of the shrewdest judges of corporate value work for private - equity funds .
The number of new private - equity deals has plunged with the financial crisis , and nobody expects activity to pick up again soon .
The collapse of deals suggests that the business climate has changed sharply .
But how , exactly ?
Were the cancelled deals so marginal , and so dependent on cheap credit , that a relatively small rise in the cost of debt ruined them ?
Did Cerberus conclude that prospects for the American economy are now too bad to go ahead with the United Rentals deal ?
Does it see better uses for its capital elsewhere , in distressed debt , say ?
Is that $ 10 billion of liquidity really available ?
And is it really true that as goes Cerberus , so goes the rest of private equity , and the rest of business ?
The only truly upbeat firms in America nowadays are the accounting giants , which for once are not being blamed for a financial disaster ( this time that honour belongs to the rating agencies ) .
They are determined to keep it that way , and are said to be racking up huge fees by challenging every assumption in banks ' financial models to make sure they can not be accused of optimism .
The banks are thus having to disclose ever bigger write - offs , contributing to fear of recession in America both indirectly , by delivering a stream of bad news , and directly , by constraining banks ' ability to lend ( see article ) .
The reduced supply of credit is contributing to recessionary fears that are greater in America than in the rest of the world , because the American consumer faces an unusual combination of difficulties , says Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics , a research firm .
Fuel prices are soaring , house prices are falling , confidence is plunging and there are early signs that the jobs market is weakening , he says .
So far , the evidence that the credit crisis is spreading to other industries is more in the mind than in the data .
For instance , most of GMAC 's problems relate to its subprime mortgage lending , rather than defaults on car loans .
But there are gloomy predictions about the outlook for consumer spending .
Car sales are expected to be down from 16.5 m last year to 16 m this year , for example .
The outlook for 2008 is even worse .
Jerry York , a former GM board member , sees sales slipping to 15.5 m , and Thomas Stallkamp , a former Chrysler president who oversees automotive investments at Ripplewood , another private - equity firm , expects something between 14.5 m - 15 m .
The lower figure would amount to the largest decline since 1991 , when there was a full - blown recession .
There are other signs that stress is spreading , though it is not yet at recessionary levels — not least because corporate profits remain at record highs in America , and many firms have taken advantage of the years of plenty to get their balance sheets in shape .
Even so , Home Depot recently said that it can no longer afford to continue with its share - repurchase plan .
In the most recent survey of banks ' senior loan - officers , 19.2 % reported a tightening of lending standards to large and medium - sized firms , up from 7.5 % three months earlier , and zero a year ago .
Surveys of small companies suggest they are finding it harder to get the credit they need to grow .
Between June 12th and November 19th , the spread in interest rates between high - yield corporate debt and Treasury bonds doubled , from 2.6 percentage points to 5.2 , says Ed Altman of New York University .
The yield on high - yield bonds has risen to 9.33 % , the highest level since 2002 and a sign of growing default risk , even though defaults remain near a historic low .
Mr Altman is especially worried by the large amount of low - quality debt issued in recent years , much of it to finance private - equity deals .
Some 42 % of high - yield corporate bonds issued since 2003 were rated B - or lower , rising to nearly 50 % in the first six months of this year .
Moreover , some $ 160 billion of leveraged loans are coming due next year .
Refinancing them may be a struggle in today 's financial markets .
Martin Fridson of FridsonVision , a research firm , has calculated that a severe recession ( which , he stresses , he is not predicting ) could result in a peak rate of between 16 % and 20 % of annual defaults on corporate bonds , far higher than in 1991 .
If so , lenders will retreat further and distressed - debt investors like Cerberus will be baying for blood .
Businesses need lenders to finance their operations : they must be quaking at the prospect .
" Are you there , Rude ?
It 's me , Judy ?
" During an NRA speech Rudy Giuliani got a " surprise " phone call from his current wife Judy Giuliani .
This was , at the very least , the second time this sort of cutesy - poo phone interruption happened during a campaign speech .
How precious !
Does he honestly believe he can get away with bullshit like this in the internet age ?
How stupid does he think we are ?

it looked as if leroy smith was going to get some recognition after all .
A safety manager at a federal prison in California , he had challenged his bosses , risked his job , and endured threats of retaliation to expose hazardous conditions in a prison computer recycling program where inmates were smashing monitors with hammers , unleashing clouds of toxic metals .
Now the federal government was flying him to Washington , D.C. , as a whistleblowing hero .
The Office of Special Counsel ( osc ) , the federal agency charged with protecting government employees who expose waste , fraud , and abuse , had scheduled a catered event honoring Smith as “ Public Servant of the Year . ”
The office ’s director , Scott Bloch , had prepared a flowery speech that was later posted on the agency ’s website , referencing Sophocles and The Shawshank Redemption : “ In the end , Morgan Freeman ’s character truly becomes what his name implies — a
Free man , ” it read .
“ One person can root out corruption and abuse of power .
Once he understands this , he is redeemed and can break out of the trap of fear , and break free into the light of integrity and justice .
That is the effect of seeing a brave whistleblower stand up and win ; it inspires the rest of us . ”
Only Bloch never delivered that speech .
Just minutes before the September 7 ceremony was to begin , Smith received word that the event was off because a relative of an osc staffer had died .
It seemed “ kind of fishy ” to Smith ; indeed , an osc source told me the excuse was so transparent as to be “ ludicrous . ”
The real problem , the source said , was that Bloch — a Bush appointee who , employees say , shares his boss ’ antipathy for dissent — had learned that Smith was planning to speak at a press conference sponsored by the whistleblower group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( peer ) , a persistent critic of the osc .
The peer event went forward as planned , and at it Smith told the press that he felt the osc “ bears some examination . ”
True , he had been vindicated , but many of his colleagues who ’d made similar disclosures had been ignored , and the prison conditions had not changed .
“ I can not help but feel that my experience is a beacon of false hope for public servants who are trying to correct wrongdoing , ” he said .
Then again , given the current climate for whistleblowers , false hope might be all the hope there is .
A series of court rulings , legal changes , and new security and secrecy policies have made it easier than at any time since the Nixon era to punish whistleblowers ; the climate has deteriorated in recent years with the Bush administration ’s emphasis on plugging leaks and locking down government information .
Bloch ’s tenure — he is the first director of the whistleblower office to face a whistleblower complaint of his own — has only added insult to injury .
It ’s come to the point where some advocates now counsel federal employees against coming forward , period .
“ When people call me and ask about blowing the whistle , I always tell them , ‘ Do n’t do it , because your life will be destroyed , ' ” says William Weaver , a professor of political science at the University of Texas - El Paso and a senior adviser to the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition .
“ You ’ll lose your career ; you ’re probably going to lose your family if you have one ; you ’re probably going to lose all your friends because they ’re associated through work ; you ’ll wind up squandering your life savings on attorneys ; and you ’ll come out the other end of this process working at McDonald’s . ”
Weaver says that most of the people who contact him are so determined , they go ahead with their disclosures anyway .
“ I see what the result is , ” he sighs .
“ It ’s destruction from one end of their lives to the other . ”
the term “ whistleblower ” refers to the warning English bobbies used to sound when they saw a crime in progress , an alarm to other officers as well as bystanders .
The first U.S. law protecting whistleblowers , the 1912 Lloyd - La Follette Act , came after the Taft administration tried to forbid federal employees from talking directly to Congress .
But whistleblowers continued to encounter harassment and retaliation ; in 1969 , Air Force auditor Ernie Fitzgerald , who had told Congress about massive cost overruns in the C - 5 cargo plane program , found himself fired at the behest of President Nixon .
( On the Watergate tapes , Nixon can be heard saying , “ Get rid of that son of a bitch ! ” )
Later , Nixon ’s plumbers went after Daniel Ellsberg , who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times , at one point breaking into Ellsberg ’s psychiatrist ’s office in an effort to discredit and humiliate him .
In response to these and other cases — and to the role that Mark Felt , a.k.a.
Deep Throat , had played in exposing Watergate — Congress passed a wave of anti-retaliation measures , including the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act , which established the Office of Special Counsel , and the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act .
But today , many of these safeguards are gone or at serious risk .
In 2005 , the Washington - based Project on Government Oversight reported that the Whistleblower Protection Act has “ suffered from a series of crippling judicial rulings [ that ] have rendered the Act useless , producing a dismal record of failure for whistleblowers and making the law a black hole . ”
Says Thomas Devine , longtime legal director of the Government Accountability Project and one of the law ’s key advocates : “ My baby turned out to be Frankenstein . ”
Long gone are the days of successful whistleblowers such as Ernie Fitzgerald — who ended up winning his job back and worked at the Pentagon until his retirement last year .
“ That ’s the wrong model for today ’s environment , ” a senior Pentagon official told me .
“ The model for today ’s environment is Deep Throat .
You need to be buried deep in the system , completely anonymous , in order to have effective protection . ”
These days , he added , whistleblowers who go public can expect “ 15 minutes of fame and 40 years of misery . ”
In theory , the Office of Special Counsel is supposed to prevent those problems — both by taking whistleblower tips and referring them for investigation , and by helping whistleblowers facing retaliation .
In practice , advocates as well as some of the agency ’s staffers say , the osc has become yet another black hole into which disclosures and complaints disappear .
Bloch , 48 , who ’s tall and heavyset and wears a close - cropped goatee , is a former law professor and attorney from Lawrence , Kansas .
A devout Catholic and one - time fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute , he was tapped early in President Bush ’s first term as the deputy director of the Justice Department ’s Task Force for Faith - Based and Community Initiatives ; then , in June 2003 , the president nominated him to run the osc .
It was a culture clash from the start .
Having chosen as his deputy a Catholic lawyer who had publicly taken a position against the “ homosexual agenda , ” and hired young lawyers from Ave Maria Law School , the conservative Catholic school founded by Domino ’s Pizza billionaire Tom Monaghan , Bloch questioned whether the osc should defend federal workers discriminated against for their sexual orientation .
When the story got out and dozens of members of Congress signed letters of protest , Bloch blamed whistleblowers : “ It ’s unfortunate that we have a leaker or leakers in our office who went to the press rather than coming to me , ” he told the Federal Times .
Eventually , an embarrassed White House delivered a subtle rebuke to Bloch in the form of a statement reaffirming a long - standing federal prohibition against sexual - orientation discrimination , and noting that the president “ expects federal agencies to enforce this policy . ”
Bloch ’s high - profile troubles had only begun .
In February 2005 , his office was accused of improperly dismissing hundreds of whistleblower cases that had been pending when Bloch took over .
Among them was the complaint of Adam Finkel , a senior official at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration who , in October 2003 , had disclosed to the osc that the government had refused to offer blood testing for federal workplace inspectors who were likely to have been exposed to the toxic substance beryllium while inspecting plants that use the metal .
( When osha finally did test the inspectors , in 2004 , 3.7 percent in fact came up positive for exposure to beryllium , which can cause fatal lung disease . )
“ It ’s bad enough that this all happened at osha , where they have a worker - protection mission , ” says Finkel , who is now a visiting professor at Princeton University , “ but the federal employee who goes to osc looking for some kind of intelligent and grown - up analysis of these health issues , at least in my case , is getting nothing of the kind .
I got nothing but skepticism and amateur science ….
I was treated like , ‘ You ’re a Harvard Ph.D. but you ’re not a medical doctor , are you ? ' ”
Bloch says he did not dismiss any cases improperly , but was simply trying to reduce the osc ‘s perennial backlog .
Before his tenure , he points out , some whistleblowers died while waiting for a response to their complaints .
“ If outside advocacy groups want to throw rocks at me , that ’s fine .
We can take criticism .
But it ’s really unfair to federal workers , and it ’s really unfair to the career staff here who have been working their tails off to bring justice in a more timely fashion . ”
It ’s those same career staffers , though , who have become Bloch ’s harshest critics .
Weeks before the controversy over the dismissed cases erupted , Bloch announced , with no warning , that he was reassigning 12 staffers — about 10 percent of the total osc workforce , and the majority of them his perceived critics — to field offices across the country .
They had 10 days to accept , or else they ’d be fired .
( Ten ultimately resigned . )
Three months later , four Washington - based advocacy groups and an anonymous group of current and former osc employees — some affected by the transfers , some not — filed a complaint against Bloch with his own office .
The transfers , says the employees ’ lawyer , Debra Katz , were retaliation against Bloch ’s critics , those perceived to be loyal to his predecessor , and those seen to have a “ homosexual agenda . ”
Members of Congress also considered Bloch ’s reorganization suspicious .
During a Senate oversight hearing in May 2005 , Senator Daniel Akaka ( D - Hawaii ) said he was “ alarmed ” by the restructuring — especially given that it came on the heels of a $ 140,000 outside evaluation of the office that had not recommended anything of the kind .
So that Bloch would n’t have to investigate himself , the complaint against him was ultimately referred to the inspector general in the federal Office of Personnel Management .
The investigation has been under way for more than a year , and there have recently been reports in the conservative press — which has cast Bloch as a martyr to liberal and gay activism — that the White House may be trying to cut him loose .
“ Bloch has been ostracized by the White House and was privately sent word that he should resign , ” the Weekly Standard reported in October .
Bloch would neither confirm nor deny the report , saying only , “ I look forward to being exonerated .
There simply is no truth to the allegations , and I stand by that . ”
whatever bloch ’s fate , his critics say the osc controversy is symptomatic of a larger problem .
“ The Bush administration has absolutely not endorsed the concept of whistleblowing — they see it as disloyalty , ” one senior osc official told me .
Bloch ’s tenure , echoes Sibel Edmonds , a former fbi translator and the founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition , is simply “ a very good example that shows that the system is broken . ”
Helped by post -9/11 security fears , the Bush administration has worked to lock down information in all areas of government .
“ Secrecy has become a central axis of executive branch policy , ” William Weaver , the Texas professor , testified before Congress this winter .
The administration has fought disclosures by invoking provisions such as the State Secrets Privilege and “ sovereign immunity ” — the English common - law notion that the king can do no wrong .
It has worked behind the scenes on Capitol Hill to undermine whistleblower legislation , and , in the case of the National Security Agency ’s domestic spying program , has launched a criminal probe to determine the source of leaks to the press .
The president himself told reporters that leaking the nsa program had been “ a shameful act ” and said “ the fact that we ’re discussing this program is helping the enemy . ”
More documents than ever before are being shielded from public view — the number of classifications nearly quadrupled from 1995 to 2005 , from 3.6 million to 14.2 million .
The rampant classifications put whistleblowers at risk of criminal prosecution : Disclosing classified national security information to someone not cleared to receive it is a felony .
In fact , in the administration ’s view , even members of Congress who sit on the intelligence committees and have top security clearances do n’t have the right to know some of the government ’s business .
After nsa whistleblower Russ
Tice made clear his intention to report the agency ’s warrantless surveillance program , carried out under a highly classified Special Access Program ( sap ) , the nsa warned him that “ neither the staff nor the members of the [ Senate and House intelligence committees ] are cleared to receive the information covered by the sap s. ”
The courts have also not been kind to whistleblowers .
Last May , in what whistleblower lawyer Steve Kohn calls “ the single biggest setback for whistleblowers in the courts in the past 25 years , ” newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito cast the tiebreaking vote in Garcetti v. Ceballos , a case involving a prosecutor in the Los Angeles district attorney ’s office who claimed whistleblower retaliation .
Under the ruling , Kohn says , public employees — all 22 million of them — have no First Amendment rights when they are acting in an official capacity , and in many cases are not protected against retaliation .
“ What that means is for employees who are making these disclosures on the job or in any official capacity , unless they have some statutory protection , they ’re shit out of luck , ” says Jeff Ruch , executive director of peer , the whistleblower advocacy group .
Kohn estimates that “ no less than 90 percent of all whistleblowers will lose their cases on the basis of that decision . ”
Members of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — scrambled to pass broader protections but failed in the face of opposition from the White House .
There are signs that Congress might be poised to reclaim some of its authority .
On a bleak and snowy morning in late winter , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform — in whose name chair Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) had just restored the word “ oversight , ” stricken by his Republican predecessor — held hearings on government secrecy , with Edmonds and Tice watching from the gallery .
That day , Waxman introduced whistleblower - protection legislation that has since passed in the House of Representatives ; the White House has threatened a veto .
Later this year , Congress will also take up the fate of Bloch ’s osc , which is up for reauthorization .
( Proposals include moving the agency into Congress ’ Government Accountability Office , removing it from the White House ’s purview . )
For Bloch ’s critics , change can’t come soon enough .
“ The public has every reason to be concerned , ” says the osc official .
Bloch , he adds , “ has contempt for whistleblowers . ”

Joseph Darby
WHISTLE BLOWN ON : Fellow soldiers at Abu Ghraib
ALLEGATION : Torture
REWARD : Death threats
UPSHOT : Still fears for his life
For weeks after turning over graphic pictures depicting the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib to military investigators , Army Specialist Joseph Darby slept with a cocked pistol under his pillow , fearing what might happen if his fellow soldiers caught wind of what he ’d done .
His name surfaced in Seymour Hersh ’s April 30 , 2004 , New Yorker exposé on Abu Ghraib but troops in Iraq did n’t notice .
A week later , as Darby sat in the mess hall watching a congressional hearing about Abu Ghraib , he heard Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld publicly thank “ Specialist Joseph Darby , who alerted the appropriate authorities that abuses were occurring . ”
Darby was quickly dispatched back to the United States ; upon his arrival , the Army warned him not to return to his hometown of Cumberland , Maryland , where many regarded him as a traitor .
He and his wife now live in an undisclosed location .
In a rare interview with 60 Minutes in December , Darby said he still fears for his safety .
“ I worry about the one guy who wants to get even with me , ” he said .
Rumsfeld “ nailed [ Darby ] to the cross , ” a senior Pentagon official told me .
“ How can you go home and get a job selling cars in Maryland when you ’ve just been revealed to be the guy who narc’d on all your people from Maryland who were from the same unit ? ”
He added , “ That case was completely blown .
That guy ’s life has been ruined . ”

ALLEGATION : Agency infiltrated by spies
REWARD : Fired
UPSHOT : Went on to expose nsa domestic spying
A veteran intelligence official involved with the nation ’s most secretive special - access ( or “ black ” ) programs , Russ Tice was subjected to emergency psychological testing , trailed by the fbi , stripped of his security clearance , and then exiled to the National Security Agency motor pool to gas up cars and chauffeur government officials — all after he reported his suspicion that a colleague at the Defense Intelligence Agency might be spying for China .
It hardly seemed like a coincidence when , days after his May 2005 appearance at a press conference on Capitol Hill to advocate for stronger whistleblower protections , the nsa fired him .
Seven months later , Tice made headlines as a source for the New York Times ‘ exposé on warrantless eavesdropping by the nsa .
The Bush administration quickly launched a grand jury investigation — into the leaks , not the eavesdropping — and Tice was served with a subpoena , a move he says was meant to intimidate fellow whistleblowers .
Tice insists that he did n’t provide the paper with any classified material , and says he has much more information about “ probable unlawful and unconstitutional acts ” at the nsa and the dia .
But thus far he has been prevented from sharing this information with Congress because , the nsa maintains , no one on Capitol Hill has the security clearance to hear what he has to say

Bogdan Dzakovic
WHISTLE BLOWN ON : Federal Aviation Administration
ALLEGATION : Lousy airport security ( pre-9/11 )
REWARD : Demotion
UPSHOT : Still sidelined
Wanna know how to get a bomb onto a plane ?
A submachine gun ?
Ask Bogdan Dzakovic , who for seven years led an faa “ red team ” that probed airport vulnerabilities and managed to breach security 90 percent of the time .
Instead of taking action , the faa attempted to whitewash Dzakovic ’s findings .
“ We were ordered not to write up our findings in some cases and not to retest airports where we found particularly egregious vulnerabilities to see if the problems had been fixed , ” he later told the 9/11 Commission .
“ Finally , the agency started providing advance notification of when we would be conducting our ‘ undercover ’ tests and what we would be checking . ”
After his worst fears came true on 9/11 , Dzakovic filed a disclosure with the Office of Special Counsel .
Overnight , he went from commanding an elite security force to “ punching holes in paper and putting orientation binders together ” for the Transportation Security Administration .
The osc ordered the Transportation Department to investigate .
In 2003 , the probe substantiated Dzakovic ’s key concerns ; four years later , Dzakovic is still hole - punching at the tsa .
Life as a State Secret
Sibel Edmonds
WHISTLE BLOWN ON : FBI
ALLEGATION : Bureau infiltrated by spy
REWARD : Fired
UPSHOT : $ 285,000 legal bill
Fluent in Turkish , Farsi , and Azeri , Sibel Edmonds was hired in the fbi ‘s translation unit shortly after 9/11 .
Just six months later , after reporting her suspicions that her department had been infiltrated by a Turkish intelligence operation , she was abruptly fired .
The department ’s inspector general later found many of her allegations to be well founded and concluded that the fbi displayed “ an unwarranted reluctance to vigorously investigate these serious allegations . ”
The report offered eight recommendations for improving the fbi ‘s translation service .
None were implemented .
Edmonds sued the Justice Department for unfair dismissal ; former Attorney General John Ashcroft mounted an unprecedented defense , invoking the State Secrets Privilege to essentially classify any information regarding the case and even barring Edmonds and her lawyer from hearing the government ’s arguments to the judge .
The suit was dismissed and Edmonds was left with a $ 285,000 legal bill .
“ Five years of fight , and it ’s like , ‘ Why do we even blow the whistle ? ' ” she says .
“ It did n’t fix the system . ”
Banished to the Basement
Richard Levernier
WHISTLE BLOWN ON : Department of Energy
ALLEGATION : Nuclear weapons sites wide open to terror attacks
REWARD : Security clearance pulled , demoted
UPSHOT : Retired from dead - end job
Until August 2000 , Richard Levernier , a 26 - year Department of Energy employee , organized terrorist attacks against U.S. nuclear weapons sites — mock raids designed to expose weaknesses in the doe ‘s security procedures .
More than half the time , his pretend attacks succeeded .
“ The reason for this abysmal record was ingrained bureaucratic negligence to a terrifying degree , ” Levernier told Congress last year .
Alarmed by doe ‘s refusal to reform security procedures , in 2000 Levernier provided the media with an unclassified , but damning , report by the agency ’s inspector general .
That got his bosses ’ attention — but instead of fixing the problem , they yanked Levernier ’s security clearance and transferred him to a windowless basement to oversee the department ’s foreign - travel program .
Levernier took his case to the Office of Special Counsel , which eventually sided with him .
But the office did n’t have the power to restore his clearance , only to order doe to investigate his allegations .
That report took 18 months to complete , and as Levernier noted in congressional testimony last year , it “ insisted that all of the problems that I had identified had been fixed , despite the fact that there were at least a dozen reports … that said exactly the opposite . ”
After five years of administrative purgatory , Levernier finally decided to retire last year — rather , he told Congress , “ than being paid not to contribute to the national security . ”
Murder , He Wrote
Sandalio Gonzalez
WHISTLE BLOWN ON : Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
ALLEGATION : Informant implicated in multiple murders while on payroll
REWARD : Ultimatum : Leave , or be downgraded
UPSHOT : Retired , won financial settlement
By the time Sandalio Gonzalez fired off a letter to the Office of Special Counsel on June 30 , 2004 , he ’d tried everything else .
For months , the longtime dea agent , then head of the agency ’s El Paso field office , had been trying to jump - start an official inquiry into the “ House of Death ” murders , in which a paid informant for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement was implicated in a series of brutal drug - related killings in Juarez , Mexico .
In one case , the informant bought the duct tape used to bind a victim , restrained him as he was immobilized , and provided quicklime to dissolve the remains .
Worse , ice officials , who had the informant wear a wire and monitored his phone conversations , may have had foreknowledge of some of the killings ( the code “ carne asada ” was frequently used to indicate an impending murder ) , yet refused to intervene , so intent were they on building a case against a particular high - level drug smuggler .
Gonzalez knew that blowing the whistle was unlikely to earn him friends within the agency .
Years earlier , when he was the second in command of the dea ’s high - profile Miami field office , he had raised concerns about the suspicious disappearance of 10 kilos of cocaine from a raid , and for his trouble he had been transferred to the agency ’s much smaller field office in El Paso .
This time , the agency had confronted him with an ultimatum : Retire quietly , or accept a downgrade on a crucial performance review .
Nevertheless , Gonzalez went ahead and alerted the osc .
Days later , the whistleblower agency informed him that it “ receives a large number of matters concerning disclosures of information ” and that “ cases are generally processed in the order in which they are received . ”
Facing the end of a 32 - year career in law enforcement , he wrote back again in September , this time filing a whistleblower reprisal complaint .
When asked to describe the nature of his original disclosure , he wrote in neat capital letters : “ MURDER . ”
By November , Gonzalez had received his response :
The case was being closed without investigation .
Two months later he retired from the dea , after 26 years of service .
Unlike many whistleblowers , Gonzalez did get a taste of vindication :
He won an undisclosed financial settlement from the dea when he filed a retaliation suit in connection with the “ House of Death ” case ; then , last December , a federal jury found that his transfer had also been an act of retaliation and awarded him $ 85,000 .
Now 56 , Gonzalez lives near Miami and works for a defense contractor .
Despite his settlement , he remains bitter .
“ This stuff consumes you , ” he says .
“ The whole thing is so unfair .
And then you come to the realization that your government is a farce .
That ’s what really hits you .
I have no confidence in this government whatsoever , because I ’ve seen it from the inside . ”
In 1919 , Sir Arthur Eddington led expeditions to Brazil and to the island of Principe , aiming to observe solar eclipses and thereby test an experimental prediction of Einstein ’s novel theory of General Relativity .
A journalist asked Einstein what he would do if Eddington ’s observations failed to match his theory .
Einstein famously replied : “ Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord .
The theory is correct . ”
It seems like a rather foolhardy statement , defying the trope of Traditional Rationality that experiment above all is sovereign .
Einstein seems possessed of an arrogance so great that he would refuse to bend his neck and submit to Nature ’s answer , as scientists must do .
Who can know that the theory is correct , in advance of experimental test ?
Of course , Einstein did turn out to be right .
I try to avoid criticizing people when they are right .
If they genuinely deserve criticism , I will not need to wait long for an occasion where they are wrong .
And Einstein may not have been quite so foolhardy as he sounded . . .
To assign more than 50 % probability to the correct candidate from a pool of 100,000,000 possible hypotheses , you need at least 27 bits of evidence ( or thereabouts ) .
You cannot expect to find the correct candidate without tests that are this strong , because lesser tests will yield more than one candidate that passes all the tests .
If you try to apply a test that only has a million - to - one chance of a false positive ( ~ 20 bits ) , you ’ll end up with a hundred candidates .
Just finding the right answer , within a large space of possibilities , requires a large amount of evidence .
Traditional Rationality emphasizes justification : “ If you want to convince me of X , you ’ve got to present me with Y amount of evidence . ”
I myself often slip into this phrasing , whenever I say something like , “ To justify believing in this proposition , at more than 99 % probability , requires 34 bits of evidence . ”
Or , “ In order to assign more than 50 % probability to your hypothesis , you need 27 bits of evidence . ”
The Traditional phrasing implies that you start out with a hunch , or some private line of reasoning that leads you to a suggested hypothesis , and then you have to gather “ evidence ” to confirm it — to convince the scientific community , or justify saying that you believe in your hunch .
But from a Bayesian perspective , you need an amount of evidence roughly equivalent to the complexity of the hypothesis just to locate the hypothesis in theory - space .
It ’s not a question of justifying anything to anyone .
If there ’s a hundred million alternatives , you need at least 27 bits of evidence just to focus your attention uniquely on the correct answer .
This is true even if you call your guess a “ hunch ” or “ intuition . ”
Hunchings and intuitings are real processes in a real brain .
If your brain does n’t have at least 10 bits of genuinely entangled valid Bayesian evidence to chew on , your brain cannot single out a correct 10 - bit hypothesis for your attention — consciously , subconsciously , whatever .
Subconscious processes can’t find one out of a million targets using only 19 bits of entanglement any more than conscious processes can .
Hunches can be mysterious to the huncher , but they ca n’t violate the laws of physics .
You see where this is going :
At the time of first formulating the hypothesis — the very first time the equations popped into his head — Einstein must have had , already in his possession , sufficient observational evidence to single out the complex equations of General Relativity for his unique attention .
Or he could n’t have gotten them right .
Now , how likely is it that Einstein would have exactly enough observational evidence to raise General Relativity to the level of his attention , but only justify assigning it a 55 % probability ?
Suppose General Relativity is a 29.3 - bit hypothesis .
How likely is it that Einstein would stumble across exactly 29.5 bits of evidence in the course of his physics reading ?
Not likely !
If Einstein had enough observational evidence to single out the correct equations of General Relativity in the first place , then he probably had enough evidence to be damn sure that General Relativity was true .
In fact , since the human brain is not a perfectly efficient processor of information , Einstein probably had overwhelmingly more evidence than would , in principle , be required for a perfect Bayesian to assign massive confidence to General Relativity .
“ Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord ; the theory is correct . ”
It does n’t sound nearly as appalling when you look at it from that perspective .
And remember that General Relativity was correct , from all that vast space of possibilities .

The claim that Obama is a Muslim vanished from public view quickly , but persists in chain e-mails .
Untraceable e-mails spread Obama rumor
When Fox News aired a report in January claiming that Sen. Barack Obama had been educated at a radical Muslim madrassa , his campaign beat the story back — hard — with the candidate himself going on television to call it “ ludicrous ” and a “ smear . ”
And his aggressive defense worked , or so it seemed at the time :
The notion that Obama has secret Muslim roots faded from the mainstream media , and even from most conservative blogs and magazines .
Advertisement
But rather than vanish , the whispered smear campaign appears to have gone underground , and in its purest form : Obama himself , according to a pair of widely circulated anonymous e-mails , is a Muslim .
“ Barack Hussein Obama has joined the United Church of Christ in an attempt to downplay his Muslim background , ” warns an e-mail titled “ Who Is Barack Obama , ” that was circulating in South Carolina political circles this summer and sent to Politico by a South Carolina Democrat .
“ The Muslims have said they plan on destroying the U.S. from the inside out ; what better way to start than at the highest level ? ”
“ Please forward to everyone you know , ” it ended .
The other widely forwarded e-mail is titled “ Can a good Muslim become a good American ” and answers that question in the negative , before concluding : “ And Barack Hussein Obama , a Muslim , wants to be our president !!! ”
The misinformation is buttressed by occasional winks from conservative pundits like Ed Rogers , who referred to the candidate as “ Barack Hussein Obama ” and radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh , who regularly includes the senator 's otherwise little - used middle name .
( Shock jock Michael Savage did him one better , according to the liberal media monitor Media Matters , calling the senator “ Hussein Barack Obama . ” )
Road to Christianity
Obama , in fact , is not a Muslim .
The assertion that he is one is based on his paternal ancestry from a Muslim family in Kenya , his living in Indonesia with a Muslim stepfather and , briefly , as a child , attending a public school there which reportedly offered some religious instruction to its predominantly Muslim study body .
But he was raised primarily by his mother , who eschewed organized religion .
> He has written and spoken at length about his path to Christianity and the black church as a community organizer in Chicago .
In recent months , Obama has been talking more openly about his faith , especially in the South .
He has worshipped at three large South Carolina churches over the past two Sundays .
Last weekend , he raised eyebrows at the Redemption World Outreach Center in Greenville by saying he was “ confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth . "
Indeed , on www.snopes.com — the site that fashions itself as the place where urban legends go to die — there is a lengthy page devoted to debunking the myth that Obama is a “ radical , ideological Muslim ” that includes a reference to a 2004 Chicago Sun - Times story where he talks of his “ personal relationship with Jesus Christ . ”
Obama ’s aides are aware of the theme , but it ’s far harder to respond to faceless whispers than to open assertions .
“ We 've got to be vigilant to knock down any untruth out there about us , ” said spokesman Bill Burton .
Popular , but wrong
It ’s hard to directly measure the impact of chain e-mails which circulate beneath the radar .
But there are at least two indications that the whispers are being heard .
First , “ barack obama muslim ” is the third most popular Google search for the presidential candidate 's name , behind “ barack obama ” and “ barack obama biography , ” according to Google Suggest , which tracks the frequency of word searches .
Second , a CBS News poll in August found that , in response to an open - ended question about Obama ’s faith , 7 percent of Americans identified him as a Muslim — more than any other response .
The right answer , Protestant , was second at 6 percent .
( Most did n’t know or would n’t say . )
Underscoring this data , Politico has been alerted to both the e-mails and the persistent rumor numerous times by multiple sources , most of whom work outside politics .
Bemused political operatives and reporters regularly regularly receive forwarded messages from friends and relatives , but they typically are less pernicious , often amounting to an off - color punchline about Hillary Clinton .
But the Obama e-mails are different from those tired jokes about Bush and Clinton .
For many people , the Obama - is - a - Muslim e-mail is among the first things they " learn " about a man who was virtually unknown until recently , and the campaign of whispers threatens to play a quiet role in defining him .
The whispers appear not to have surfaced during his 2004 Senate bid .
The first clear appearance of the theme on the Web came in a Dec. 18 , 2006 , column by Debbie Schlussel , a Detroit - based writer who often alleges ties between mainstream American figures — most recently , former Sen.
Fred Thompson — and Islamic radicalism .
“ I had a lot of readers ask me about Barack Obama and his background , and a lot of them had heard he was a Muslim or thought he was a Muslim , ” Schlussel said .
“ I looked into it , I found out his middle name was Hussein . ”
The result : a column titled “ Barack Hussein Obama : Once a Muslim , Always a Muslim . ”
Schlussel ’s theme was picked up in the Unification Church - owned online magazine Insight the next month , which reported , with no named sources but a political twist , that Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign was pushing a story about Obama ’s Muslim heritage .
“ Are the American people ready for an elected president who was educated in a madrassa as a young boy and has not been forthcoming about his Muslim heritage ? ”
Insight asked Jan. 17 .
The story jumped to Fox and then faded from public view in the face of Obama ’s angry response .
It partly died because it was debunked but also because many mainstream conservatives refused to pay it much heed .
“ It ’s like the ‘ tax your e-mails ’ chain e-mails that get going , ” said Erick Erickson , editor of blog Redstate .
“ Eventually it circles the Earth , but it ’s still b.s . ”
Yet what many in the political class dismiss out of hand continues to live in the subterranean world of forwarded e-mails and the unknowing assumptions made about a person with such an unusual name and background .
For Obama , the rumors have the potential of adding another , steeper hill to climb in his bid to make history .
While it ’s no longer “ socially acceptable to hate black people , ” it is still “ to hate Muslims , ” lamented the South Carolina Democrat who forwarded the messages .
“ The Obama campaign have to be very vigilant about this , ” said John Weaver , a former adviser to John McCain who saw McCain ’s campaign stall in 2000 in South Carolina amid false rumors that he had fathered an African - American child .
“ It ’s a difficult thing to combat , and you have to ask yourself , at what point will it ever stop ?
How many African - Americans do we have to have do well until this kind of stuff stops ? ”
Weaver said campaigns rarely have the resources to trace a whisper like this to its source .
“ It may not be organized , but at the end of the day , competitors turn a blind eye to it , ” he said .
“ The better he does , the more he ’s going to see this crap . ”

@ emails = [ ]
@ voice_mails = [ ]
end
end
class Employee

end
class Employee ...
def assistant
@ assistant = Employee .
find_by_boss_id ( self . id ) unless instance_variable_defined ? : @assistant

This is probably going to be included inso I took another pass through it following all of your comments .
Thanks for the feedback .
Initialize an attribute on access instead of at construction time .== >
The motivation for converting attributes to be lazily initialized is for code readability purposes .
While the above example is trivial , when the Employee class has multiple attributes that need to be initialized the constructor will need to contain all the initialization logic .
Classes that initialize instance variables in the constructor need to worry about both attributes and instance variables .
The procedural behavior of initializing each attribute in a constructor is unnecessary and less maintainable than a class that deals exclusivey with attributes .
Lazily Initialized Attributes can encapsulate all their initialization logic within the methods themselves .
The code below is an Employee class with the email attribute initialized in the constructor .
Moving to a Lazily Initialized Attribute generally means moving the initialization logic to the getter method and initializing on the first access .
Using ||= for Lazily Initialized Attributes is a common idiom ; however , this idiom falls down when nil or false are valid values for the attribute .
In the above example it's not practical to use an ||= operator for a Lazily Initialized Attribute because the find_by_boss_id might return nil .
In the case where nil is returned , each time the assistant attribute is accessed another database trip will occur .
A superior solution is to use code similar to the example below that utilizes the instance_variable_defined ?
method that was introduced in ruby 1.8.6 .
As any woman born blonde will tell you , golden tresses guarantee a lifetime of weird encounters .
Certainly , with men who have bought into the myth about the sexual allure and availability of blondes .
Just consider Mae West 's quip , " A hard man is good to find , " or Lauren Bacall 's famous catchphrase in To Have and Have Not , in which she tells Humphrey Bogart that if he wants her he should " just whistle . "
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
" You know how to whistle do n't you ? " she asks , confronting him with what became know as The Look .
" You just put your lips together and blow . "
That kind of blonde promotion is just a curse for anyone who lives outside of celluloid .
Then there are the teachers and employers who suspect blondes are dimwits .
Other women may view them with hostility as strong competitors for the ( dubious ) favours of men in general , or as predators eyeing their man in particular .
Blondedom is n't the party everyone thinks , and I 've long waited for someone to discuss it .
So I was disappointed by W channel 's documentary The Blonde Mystique ( which airs Sunday evening ) because it did n't get much beyond the Clairol question of whether blondes have more fun -- meaning more attention , or more men .
( And I 'm here to tell you that " men " and " attention " do n't necessarily add up to fun . )
We 're treated to a few facts about the centuries - old lure of blondes .
For example , Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost published a 2006 study in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour that showed that blondes ruled even in the Ice Age .
How else to explain the prevalence of bright hair and blue eyes in northern European tribes , except by the preference a relatively small pool of men showed for blonde mates ?
But our young women investigators -- one blonde and two brunettes -- spend most of the showing bringing stereotypes to life .
There 's the broken - down car at the side of the road test in which a hidden camera records the blonde actress attracting four times as many men to her rescue as her brunette sisters .
Then again , men practically queue to ask blondie if she remembered to fill the gas tank -- a question no one puts to the women with brainier tresses .
In the bar , the blonde has much the same affect on men as a Venus flytrap on insects , while the two brunettes ( who are both prettier ) get a fraction of the free drinks .
But here too there 's evidence of the dark side of light hair .
While blondie enjoys free flowing booze , she also earns the crude comments and clumsy mauling that brunettes are spared .
Is that because men assume brunettes are the only ones with self - defence training ?
A risky assumption , I 'd say , and I was wishing someone would ask that masher what the hell he was thinking .
Dumb assumptions
What is it about flaxen locks that implies blondes are an easy mark ?
That 's what the faired haired really want to know .
Why are only blonde women assumed to be dumb ?
If blonde is the ne plus ultra of femininity , and masculinity is defined as dark , then why have n't men been combing soot - based concoctions into their hair for centuries ?
And why is that the icon of feminine beauty is also the image of stupidity ?
Is it because smart women are less feminine ?
But our trio does n't dwell on any unpleasantness , they 're all about the mystical power of blonde .
Of course , glossing over the hazards is part of the myth of blonde supremacy .
Everyone remembers the bombshell of bombshells , Marilyn Monroe , and her signature film , Gentleman Prefer Blondes .
They conveniently forget that the film was inspired by an Anita Loos story , and the rest of the saying is " ... but they marry brunettes . "
Blondes are obviously perceived as playthings rather than people -- several men our trio chats up claim fair - haired girls are " more fun " and I do n't think they were referring to their wit .
One also comments that they 're " more approachable . "
Whoa !
What makes him think that ?
I want to hear more of his musings .
Alas , our guides are less reporters than they are walking mike stands .
Apparently blonde is a state of mind as much as a hair colour .
And therein lies the problem with this doc -- or maybe that 's its appeal ? -- it 's written for bottle blondes .
For the record , it 's the peroxide queens who give blondes a bad name , and they 're a hefty audience -- hair dye companies say blonde shades sell 5 - 1 .
How do I know they inspired the belief that there 's a connection between the brightness of a woman's hair and the dimness of her intellect ?
Because you 'd have to be a fool to volunteer for all the unwelcome attention , patronizing , and downright harassment that comes with a head of hair that is actually telling the world that you come from a long line of Celtic warriors whose ancestors were the models for Valkyries .
Yeah , and some blondes still have the ancestral broadsword , boyo ...
But I digress .
Roman goddesses
The documentary includes sound bites of the occasional academic theorizing about Rapunzel , Goldilocks , Aphrodite and all the other fair - haired babes .
Historians tell us that blonde has long been the hooker 's halo , and that call girls in ancient Rome dyed their hair to compete with the Nordic spoils of war their husbands brought back to populate the brothels .
The Virgin Mary was depicted as a chaste brunette in art , until the 14th century when the relentless spread of Christianity into Europe began equating light skin and hair with superiority and virtue .
Evolutionary biology contributes the idea that since pale hair is common in children , it 's perceived as a sign of youth and therefore fertility in grown women .
Then there 's the simple explanation : sunny locks make a woman more noticeable .
Maybe .
But then , why are n't red heads the ones with all the mystique since their hair is far more noticeable than blondes ?
And given how rare a natural redhead is , you 'd think there might be some cachet in catching one .
But I 've never heard some wag commenting about a Titian - haired girlfriend the way he would about a blonde mate , with the line " ... and she 's a real redhead , too . "
The quip is always accompanied with some variation on a nudge - and - a - wink that invites a retort of equal wit .
Perhaps with a broadsword ?
No , this doc is a frothy romp that reinforces the notion that blondes do have more fun .
Well , for most of the show .
Our trio decides to swap hair colours and run all their tests again , with some predictable results -- the blondes still get all the attention .
Only the girls do n't enjoy it as much as they ( or other non-blondes ) might expect .
One former brunette admits that she felt she had to keep proving herself to people because they assumed she was dumb .
Much hairdo about nothing
In the end , no one wants to part with her raven hair , even the natural blonde who is going to need upkeep on those fair roots .
Turns out these three are n't psychological blondes after all , just actors who know how to pull the biggest audience .
And their conclusion is n eye - opener for any dusky - haired woman who has envied a golden girl .
So the audience that really needs to see this doc is hairdressers .
Especially the woman who has cut my hair for more than decade and watched my luminous locks mellow into a caramel colour that is much less of a nuisance .
Recently , she decided it was time to return it to its original shade , and could n't understand why I balked .
" I thought everyone wanted to be blonde ? " she asked , perplexed .
Nooooo .
Genetics thrust it upon me .
And as the filmmakers found , once you 've achieved the hair colour of credibility , you should n't mess with it .
Although it was n't the film 's intention , The Blonde Mystique ends up showing us why it 's so much better to be a brunette .

The Pirate Bay filed complaints against some of the key players in the entertainment industry for corrupting and sabotaging their BitTorrent tracker .
The MPAA has now responded to these claims and deny that they worked with MediaDefender .
Unfortunately for the MPAA , we have proof that they did .
MPAA attorney Espen Tondel told the Norwegian newspaper Dageblatet that the companies represented by the MPAA never requested MediaDefender to do the things The Pirate Bay claims .
This is a lie of course , and there is an archive of leaked emails to back this up .
To give an example , Universal Pictures – a company represented by the MPAA – contracted MediaDefender to protect movies , which basically means that they pollute BitTorrent sites with fake files to make the real files harder to find .
There are several emails that prove this , and quotes such as “ can you jump all over this swarm and try to kill it ? ” leave little room for speculation .
Universal Pictures is not the only MPAA movie studio MediaDefender worked for , the emails clearly show that they were also hired by Paramount , 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures .
I would suggest Tondel to go through these emails before making ungrounded claims like this again .
Brokep , one of the Pirate Bay founders told Torrent Freak earlier that they decided to file complaints because they want to make these big media companies aware of their own wrong doings : “ I want them to take their crappy methods and stop their wrong - doing .
They are going around accusing the pirate community for doing immoral stuff , when they do illegal stuff , ” he said .
It will be interesting to see how this case develops .
One thing is for sure , it will be hard for these media companies to deny their involvement with these emails as evidence .
The changes , which all apply to all new homes , company and public buildings , will make micro-generation , such as solar panels to heat hot water , solar photovoltaic panels on roofs to generate electricity or small wind turbines for houses , mandatory in less than two years .
The Government of Northern Ireland is proposing changes to the Building Regulations which will make the use of renewable energy compulsory in all new buildings from 2008 , according to Secretary of State Peter Hain MP .
Launching an £ 8 million ( US $ 14.8 million ) renewable energy Household Program , Peter Hain said that Northern Ireland is leading the rest of the United Kingdom in green energy .
Some 4,000 households will benefit under the Household Program to install renewable energy systems in their home .
The Department of Social Development is providing 100 % grant assistance to install solar hot water systems in 500 homes in private fuel poor vulnerable households .
In the public sector , the Northern Ireland Housing Executive is to install 600 solar water panels in its properties .
As a Government , we are also moving forward in changes to the building regulations to help and encourage greater use of renewable energy .
Changes will come into effect in November that will result in a 40 per cent reduction in emission and set onerous targets to encourage the use of renewables .
Planned amendments to the Building Regulations will make micro-generation mandatory in new builds from April 2008 .
This comprehensive range of measures puts Northern Ireland in a good position to develop its renewable energy options .
— Peter Hain
The Household Program will offer grants to up to 50 % to 4,000 households of the cost of installing systems such as solar heating schemes and photovoltaic panels , small scale wind turbines , biomass boilers and geothermal heat pumps .
The change to the Building Regulations is unique to Northern Ireland .
To date , Building Regulations deal with insulation and efficiency , the move to micro-generation is a new initiative in which Northern Ireland is taking the lead .

Obviously we ’re all interested in who the next US president is going to be , since it affects our risk of being blown up on the bus to work .
According to the New York Times – which has covered this story at least three times – a commercial company which specialises in giving brain images to advertisers has discovered which parts of a voter ’s brain are most activated by different candidates , by taking pictures of their brains while they supposedly think about them .
Functional brain imaging is a great idea .
Your brain is made up of lots of different areas , which often seem to do different jobs , and you can determine that in all kinds of different ways .
For example , Broca ’s area ( near the front on the left ) seems to be involved in generating language : it is often knocked out in strokes , and when it goes , you have difficulty speaking , but you can still hear and understand language fine , because the part of the brain that receives and decodes speech is still intact .
The motor cortex ( in an arc from above your ear to the top of your head ) contains a map of all the parts of your body , and if you stimulate it , by taking your skull off with a circular saw and giving it a small electric shock with a battery , the associated part of your body will twitch .
Brain imaging is a less destructive way of examining the brain : you perform a task , while lying inside a scanner , and the parts of your brain which are most active during that task light up , because they are doing more work , and so receiving more blood flow .
Brain imaging experiments are designed to constrain activity in the brain , so that the results are meaningful : for example , you might give two tasks where the only difference between them is the use of one faculty .
You might compare “ lift each finger in order from left to right ” against “ lift each finger in whatever order you fancy ” as a basic microcosm of which bits of the brain become more active when you have to make a decision .
But if you just show someone the word “ republican ” , God knows what ’s going on in their head .
They might be smirking with schadenfreude at how loopy the Christian right are .
They might be feeling angry about them .
They might be rehearsing the word repeatedly and determinedly on their internal phonological loop , thinking that they ’re being helpful .
In fact , lots of parts of your brain will light up in brain imaging studies and it ’s tempting to over - extrapolate , selling activation locations as supporting your favoured hypothesis , while ignoring all kinds of alternative interpretations .
And that ’s in proper research .
Here , they showed people a picture of Democratic nominee John Edwards .
“ Subjects who had rated him low on the thermometer scale showed activity in the insula , an area associated with disgust and other negative feelings . ”
But the insula is a large area , with different bits activated in many tasks , including balance , pain , all kinds of stuff .
“ The good news for Mr Edwards is that the swing voters who did not give him low ratings , when looking at still photos of him , showed significant activation in areas of the brain containing mirror neurons – cells that are activated when people feel empathy .
And that suggests these voters feel some connection to him . ”
This is a fanciful view of mirror neurons ( I wish I had space to tell you about them ; they ’re more interesting than anything in any newspaper ) but even if we leave that aside , there are several regions containing mirror neurons , and those areas also contain lots of other neurons which , well , do not respond like mirror neurons .
They do n’t tell us how many subjects were in each group , what the tasks were , how they correlated with scores on their preferences , or indeed anything useful .
With science , you publish a description of your experiments , in an academic journal , so that people can see what you ’ve done , not your interpretation .
That is why academic journals exist , instead of just newspapers , and that is why a huge posse of proper professors of cognitive neuroscience have waded in and sent a long , angry letter to the NYT , not over politics , or a view , but simply over the importance of ideas .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 15 — Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday will lay out a plan to secure health insurance for all Americans while severely limiting the ability of insurers to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with chronic illnesses and other medical problems , her aides and advisers say .
Mrs. Clinton ’s purpose , they said , is not only to cover the 47 million people who are uninsured but to improve the quality of health care and make insurance more affordable for those who already have it .
The goal of Mrs. Clinton ’s plan , to be outlined in a speech in Des Moines , is similar to that of the ill - fated plan that she and President Bill Clinton pushed in 1993 and 1994 .
But advisers to Mrs. Clinton , a Democrat from New York , said Saturday that she would try to avoid the perception that she was advocating a bureaucratic , big - government solution .
That perception , promoted by conservative Republicans and the insurance industry , sank the Clinton plan in 1994 .
· ' Three strikes and your broadband is out ' policy · France 's new rules will relax copyright protection
French officials are proposing to cut off the broadband connections of people who illegally download films or music over the internet .
In the country 's hardest crackdown yet on online filesharing , President Nicolas Sarkozy said that he was backing a " three strikes " policy against internet pirates , while simultaneously announcing a new deal with film and music companies which would see access to cultural offerings boosted on the web .
The scheme - which was drawn up following an independent review by Denis Olivennes , the head of a French entertainment retailer - involves plans to clamp down on piracy by sending offenders a series of email warnings .
If ignored , the culprit could face having their broadband account suspended or even closed .
The new rules will also see entertainment companies drop all copyright protection on French material , meaning that any music or videos bought online can be played on any sort of computer or digital player , although it would also make the files easier to copy .
The move was hailed as a ground - breaking development , and in a speech yesterday , the French president welcomed the news : " Everywhere in the United States , in the United Kingdom and elsewhere , professionals and governments have tried for years to find the ' grail ' to fight the problem of internet piracy , " he said .
" We are the first , in France , to form a big national alliance around concrete and effective proposals . "
The deal was backed by more than 40 signatories , including France 's finance , justice and culture ministers , internet service providers and the entertainment industry .
As part of the plans , the French film industry has also agreed to release DVDs more swiftly , moving the release date of DVDs from seven and a half months after their cinema screening to six months .
Some groups in France said the new scheme was unnecessary , since illegal downloading is already punishable by up to three years in prison .
Opponents , including consumer groups and some politicians , fear the deal is too repressive and poses a threat to civil liberties .
Record labels and film studios , however , welcomed the proposals as the latest victory in their ongoing war with filesharers , who they blame for the decline of CD sales and cinema attendance .
Many internet service providers , including those in the UK , already employ so - called " traffic shaping " techniques to reduce the activity of heavy downloaders .
Data for 2005 showed that as broadband penetration rose sharply in France to well above 20 % of households , so did filesharing , while music sales fell dramatically by more than a quarter in the 2002 - 04 period , according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
John Kennedy , who heads the IFPI , the organisation representing the recording industry worldwide , said : " This is the single most important initiative to help win the war on online piracy that we have seen so far . "
He said Sarkozy had " recognised the importance that the creative industries play in contemporary western economies .
The winners will be French music , French employees and French music fans . "
2 . We agree with the Congress that there should be no funding gap while we attempt to resolve our differences .
At the same time we 're " aggressively debating " the right long - term solution , it 's encouraging that we have agreed not to allow funding to lapse in the short run .
Last weekend the President signed a bill that will keep funding going to States through mid-November .
Here 's where we disagree .
3 . We think the " C " in SCHIP stands for " children " .
Over the past several years , adults have been added to SCHIP .
Some were parents of kids with health insurance , others were adults without children .
We were responsible for some of those additions , as we approved State waiver requests .
We made a policy shift this year , based in part on further input from the Congress , and we 're now returning SCHIP to its original purpose .
Over the next few years , our policy will return SCHIP to a kids - only program .
States that are now covering adults will have to move them onto Medicaid or a State program .
While the advocates for HR 976 argue they share this goal , the bill does n't match the rhetoric - it lets adults in some states back into SCHIP .
And in six States ( IL , NJ , MI , RI , NM , and MN ) , more than half of their projected SCHIP expenditures this year are for adults .
We think this is the wrong direction for a program that should be about children .
4 . We think SCHIP should be about helping poor kids .
This bill also raises taxes to subsidize health insurance for some middle - income kids .
New York wants to use Federal dollars to cover kids who are clearly not poor : for a family of four , they would like to use Federal tax dollars to pay 65 % of health insurance costs for a family of four with income as high as $ 82,600 .
( We measure this in terms of a multiple of the " poverty line " - NY wants to cover kids up to " 400 % of poverty " . )
This is a fundamental philosophical difference - should we collect more taxes to subsidize those in the middle class , or fewer taxes and subsidize only the poor ?
The President wants to focus Federal tax dollars on helping kids in families with incomes below twice the poverty line .
Note that in the current debate , they count as " poor " kids .
We created a lot of heat by sending a letter from the head of the SCHIP program , Dennis Smith , to State Medicaid Directors .
Basically , Dennis ' letter says to States , " You can't expand your program to non-poor kids until you 've demonstrated that at least 95 % of poor kids in your State have coverage . "
Amazingly , this simple insistence that we help poor kids first is considered controversial .
New York has announced they 're going to sue CMS .
Should a childless Kansas couple with $ 50 K of income pay higher taxes to subsidize health insurance for a New York family with two kids and $ 80 K of income , when the Kansas family may be having trouble affording health insurance for themselves ?
We think not .
Congressional advocates for HR 976 argue that we have been misrepresenting HR 976 - they argue that the bill does not provide extra federal funding for all kids up to 400 % of poverty .
To be clear , it does not , nor have we claimed that it does .
The bill does , however , provide extra federal funds to subsidize some kids who are not poor .
Under HR 976 :
In New York , kids up to 400 % of poverty would be eligible and the State would be paid extra to enroll these kids .
For a family of four , this is $ 82,600 of annual income .
In New Jersey , kids up to 350 % of poverty would be eligible and the State would be paid extra to enroll these kids .
For a family of four , this is just over $ 72,000 .
In all other States , kids up to 300 % of poverty would be eligible and the State would be paid extra to enroll these kids .
For a family of four , this is just over $ 62,000 .
5 . We think the goal should be maximizing the number of kids with health insurance , not maximizing the number of kids enrolled in government health insurance programs .
The President 's priority is to help kids without health insurance afford the purchase of private health insurance .
Unfortunately , this bill would encourage families to drop the private health insurance they have now for their kids , and instead substitute low - premium government - provided health insurance .
This is called " crowd out " , and it's both undesirable and a tremendously inefficient use of taxpayer dollars .
If a family drops a kid 's privately - purchased coverage , and substitutes health insurance financed by the taxpayer through the government , then you have n't reduced the number of uninsured kids .
Our numbers suggest that , under HR 976 , one in three people newly enrolled in SCHIP would be people who dropped their current health insurance to get something from the government
( mostly ) for free .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that under HR 976 , 2 million of the 5.8 million new people enrolled in government health plans would drop private insurance to enroll .
6 . We do n't think you should raise taxes to pay for more spending .
And tobacco taxes are regressive - they fall hardest on low - income people .
7 . We think this bill is fiscally irresponsible , because it creates an unfunded and unsustainable set of promises .
As you can see from the graph below , HR 976 would increase spending by 121 % over five years .
But it would then cut spending 65 percent over two years , to below where it is now .
This is clearly unrealistic .
Once the expectation is created among individuals and the States for $ 14 B / year of spending , the likelihood that the Congress would actually allow a 65 % funding cut is near zero .
In reality , the actual projected spending probably looks like this .
It 's no secret that , for a long time , the iihadists were kicking American ass in the information war – especially online .
Slowly , slowly , the U.S. government is starting to push back , just a little .
The new arsenal of the propaganda campaign : Arab - language bloggers , podcasts , " webchats " – and maybe even Second Life and cell phone games , too .
That 's the word from Duncan MacInnes , who works in the State Department 's Bureau of International Information Programs .
He 's testifying today before the House Armed Services Committee 's panel on terrorism , where chairman Adam Smith is holding hearings into this issue of strategic communications right now .
" My sense is that we lack a coordinated , comprehensive , adequately resourced strategy to confront al - Qaeda ’s ideology through a strategic message campaign , " Smith sighs .
DANGER ROOM has advanced copies of the testimony .
There 's some small , encouraging signs .
But I doubt Smith will be all that reassured .
During the hearing , MacInnes is scheduled to talk about the State
Department 's " Digital Outreach Team , " launched as a pilot program " to counter ideological support for terrorism . "
It employs Arabic speakers to post entries on influential Arabic - language blogs , challenging misrepresentations and providing accurate information about U.S. policy and
American society .
These bloggers speak the language and idiom of the region , know the cultural reference points and are often able to converse informally and frankly rather than adopt the usually more formal persona of a
U.S. government spokesperson .
This is a major departure from our previous ways of conducting public diplomacy .
It requires both creativity and a new set of skills .
The cultural sensitivity that this approach affords has been very successful , but it is labor - intensive .
We are currently in the process of expanding the original team of two Arabic bloggers to six , while also adding one Urdu and two Farsi ( Persian ) linguists .
The team does not engage hardcore militant sites , but concentrates on mainstream sites with heavy traffic that discuss U.S .
policy , such as BBC Arabic , Al - Jazeera Talk , and Elaph On - Line News .
We are also exploring how we can use the applicability to our mission of new cyber - technologies such as Second Life and cell phone games to further advance our mission .
Our Bureau of International Information Programs is fully engaged in dramatically expanding public diplomacy and countering extremist ideologies through the Internet .
Our English language website and six foreign language sites – including Arabic and Persian – are being revamped to use more videos , blogging , podcast and webchats designed to reach younger audiences .
The
Arabic web site has the specific goal of countering violent extremism by offering a positive vision rooted in American values .
It attracts more than
200,000 visitors per month , top users coming from Saudi Arabia , Egypt , the
United Arab Emirates and Morocco .
Ummmm ....
Two bloggers , and 200,000 visitors – that 's kind of small potatoes , right ?
I mean , even lame sites like this one bring in more traffic .
And of course , this would all be a hell of a lot easier if the 180,000
American troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan were encouraged to spread the word about what they do online .
But as we all know , that ai n't the case .
What 's more , Michael Doran , who serves in the Pentagon doing public diplomacy support , warns that even these kind of outreach efforts are only part of the equation .
" We can not simply focus on ' getting our message out , ' or on writing better talking points , " he says .
It primarily requires taking actions that make the alternative narrative real , and building partnership capacity among our Muslim allies .
Thus , other key components of an effective CIST [ countering idealogical support to terrorism ] program include civil affairs , security , education reform , establishing the solid rule of law , and opening economic opportunity for all .
And then publicize the hell out of them .
UPDATE : Matt Armstrong was all over this story – in late September .
And he was n't terribly impressed .
Targeting the wrong people , the outreach team goes to posts comments instead of feeding information .
By virtual definition , they are attempting to be post hoc
change agents .
Better [ to ] targe[t ] influential nodes to inform , and thus influence , the creation and original interpretation of news and commentary .
Restricting their contributions to comments on discussion boards and the comments sections of blogs ignores the leaders who likely do n't have a lot of time to read the comments ... let alone the tendency to tune - out and mock commentary from left field .
UPDATE 2 : Rep . Smith stops by , and offers his post - hearing thoughts .

­­ It seems to happen most around the holidays -- the electrical outlet begins putting on extra weight .
There are nine strings of lights for the tree , electric candles , a CD player with holiday music and -- for some reason -- a George Foreman Grill .
It seems like just staring at this mess of electrical cords for too long will give it just the extra boost it needs to catch fire .
­ Overloaded outlets do cause fires -- an estimated 5,300 annually in American households [ source : CPSC ] .
Almost 2,000 of those occur during the holidays [ source : ESFI ] .
Visions of burning sugarplums got HowStuffWorks to wonder -- just how many things can you plug into an electrical outlet before it catches fire ?
It depends -- there are a variety of factors that can make a difference .
Advertisement

To figure out how many things you can plug into an outlet before it will catch fire , first we need to get to the heart of how electricity works .
At any given moment , the average American house has 120 volts of electricity flowing though it .
Somewhere in your house , you 'll find a wall - mounted box , containing either circuit breakers or fuses ( found in older homes ) .
Circuit breakers and fuses act as failsafes against electrical overload .
They regulate the amount of current -- the volume of electrons moving through a conductor , such as an electrical cord -- which can be drawn from a circuit .
This current is expressed in amperes , or amps .
Most circuit breakers and fuses regulate at either 15 or 20 amps .
­ If too much current is drawn from the circuit , the circuit breaker trips or the fuse blows , breaking the circuit to prevent an overload .
But circuit breakers and fuses are n't always reliable .
Another potential ­hazard occurs when more than one outlet is wired to a single circuit .
If you wander back to your circuit breakers or fuse box , you may see a single circuit labeled " Dining Room " or " A/ C unit and Washer / Dryer . "
You may find that all of the outlets in an entire room are connected to a single circuit .
This means that you do n't necessarily have to overload a single outlet to cause a fire .­
­
So how do you find out how much is too much ?
Actually , it 's pretty easy .
To determine how much electricity you 're using with all of those holiday decorations , you just need to do a little math .
The formula looks like this :
p/e=i ( wattage divided by volts equals amps ) .
­ Say you 're using 2,000 watts of power with your holiday lights and other decorations .
You divide that number by the volts in your house ( usually 120 ) and you come up with 16.6 amps of current that you 're using .
With a 20 amp electrical outlet , you 're using around 80 percent of the available current , whic­h is the most you should be using per circuit .
On the next page , you 'll find out about some of the other factors that you should take into account when preventing a very toasty holiday .

Via Media Matters , which has plenty of proof that this is not an isolated incident , Bill O'Reilly on how he can't get over that black people are , well , people :
You know , I was up in Harlem a few weeks ago , and I actually had dinner with Al Sharpton , who is a very , very interesting guy .
And he comes on The Factor a lot , and then I treated him to dinner , because he 's made himself available to us , and I felt that I wanted to take him up there .
And we went to Sylvia 's , a very famous restaurant in Harlem .
I had a great time , and all the people up there are tremendously respectful .
They all watch The Factor .
You know , when Sharpton and I walked in , it was like a big commotion and everything , but everybody was very nice .
And I could n't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia 's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City .
I mean , it was exactly the same , even though it 's run by blacks , primarily black patronship .
It was the same , and that 's really what this society 's all about now here in the U.S.A .
There 's no difference .
There 's no difference .
There may be a cultural entertainment -- people may gravitate toward different cultural entertainment , but you go down to Little Italy , and you 're gonna have that .
It has nothing to do with the color of anybody 's skin .
-- snip --
O'REILLY : That 's right .
That 's right .
There was n't one person in Sylvia 's who was screaming , " M - Fer , I want more iced tea . "
WILLIAMS : Please --
O'REILLY : You know , I mean , everybody was -- it was like going into an Italian restaurant in an all - white suburb in the sense of people were sitting there , and they were ordering and having fun .
And there was n't any kind of craziness at all .
Anna Kournikova led a campaign to get women wearing sports bras
Some 9.5 million British women could be irreversibly damaging their busts by exercising without a proper sports bra , the Portsmouth University team said .
They found breasts moved in a 3D figure of eight and that uncontrolled movement strained fragile tissues and ligaments .
The study suggested as a woman runs a mile , her breasts bounced 135m .
The report found each breast moved independently of the body by an average of 9 cm for every step taken on the treadmill .
With the average breast weighing between 200 and 300 grams , this movement puts great stress on the breast 's fragile support structure - the outer skin and connective tissues known as Cooper 's ligaments .
Irreversible breast sag
The research team found breast movements resulted in temporary pain and discomfort .
But it also led to a more permanent stretching of the Cooper 's ligament which leads to irreversible breast sag .
They claim that wearing an ordinary T - shirt bra reduced bounce by 38 % , but wearing a sports bra by the firm Shock Absorber - which sponsored the research - reduced bounce by 78 % .
Dr Joanne Scurr who carried out the research said women needed to be aware of the effects of exercising without properly supporting their breasts .
" People rightly spend time and effort to get the right footwear for exercise and it is equally important to wear the correct sports bra .
" Proper support for breasts will reduce the stretch to the Cooper 's ligament . "
There is very little treatment for baldness
Male pattern baldness , or androgenetic alopecia , is hereditary and partly caused by male sex hormones .
Researchers found that Asian men - who are less likely to go bald than their Western counterparts - were more likely to lose their hair if they smoked .
The study , of 740 Taiwanese men with an average age of 65 , is published in Archives of Dermatology .
Far Eastern Memorial Hospital in Taipei gathered information about the age at which the men started losing their hair , and risk factors which may have affected their hair loss .
They found the risk of hair loss increased with advancing age - but remained lower than the average risk for Caucasian men .
However , smoking at least 20 cigarettes a day was linked to an increased risk of baldness , even after other risk factors were taken into account .
The researchers suggest that smoking may destroy hair follicles , or damage cells at their roots that circulate blood and hormones .
Smoking is already linked to a range of diseases , including cancer and cardiovascular problems .
It is known to increase the tendency of the blood to clot , raising the risk of life - threatening conditions , such as heart attack and stroke .
Exposure to tobacco smoke is also associated with other signs of ageing , such as wrinkles and grey hair .
If there was any doubt to the US public that Gen. Petraeus was being used a puppet for Bush 's war --- it should be gone now .
Brit Hume of FOX Propaganda was granted an exclusive interview with the general , who is supposed to be giving an honest assessment of the " surge " and the state of affairs in Iraq .
Bush might have well as given Rush Limbaugh the honors .
No longer can the administration claim he is the voice of reason or not acting as an echo chamber for their plan to keep the surge and the war going as long as possible .
" On Fox News Sunday this morning , host Chris Wallace announced the interview :
WALLACE : Now a special program note .
Tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. eastern on the Fox News Channel , Brit will have an exclusive interview with General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about the state of the Iraq war and their testimony to Congress .
Please be sure to watch . "
The American people already have little faith in his report and this event should seal the deal .
If he was truly non-partisan , then this interview would never be taking place .
The sale and import of products containing cat or dog fur is to be banned across the European Union , officials said Monday , Nov. 26 .
EU agriculture ministers formally adopted a proposal to this effect put forward a year ago by the European Commission during a regular council meeting in Brussels .
The proposal , which becomes European law at the beginning of 2009 , calls for a total ban on the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur in all of the EU 's 27 member states .
The European Commission proposed the legislation after public outcry that fur traders were not following a voluntary prohibition and cat and dog fur was found in EU products .
The new EU rule , however , does not say how the ban will be enforced .
Common set of rules
The European Parliament agreed to a similar proposal once already
At present , only 15 EU countries have some sort of legislation in place with regard to cat and dog fur .
These are : Austria , Belgium , Britain , Cyprus , Denmark , France , Germany , Greece , Italy , Latvia , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland , Slovenia and Spain .
The rules also differ from state to state .
Some ban such pets from being reared for production purposes while others impose strict import bans .
The regulation adopted by ministers on Monday , which is expected to be re-approved by the European Parliament in December , harmonizes and strengthens these rules across the bloc .
Some exceptions remain
Germany 's Animal Protection Association said the ban was a step in the right direction , but criticized the union for moving too slowly on the issue .
The ban does not prohibit trade in other fur products
" The period of time until the actual ban is too long -- by the end of 2008 thousands more animals will suffer excruciatingly and die , " Wolfgang Apel , the association president , said in a statement .
" Even though there are still individual exceptions for educational and taxidermal purposes are allowed , the decision can be called a success . "
The amount of products containing cat or dog fur in EU markets is difficult to determine as the fur is usually used as a fraudulent substitute for more expensive fur or for synthetic fur substitutes , the European Commission noted .
During parliamentary debate on the issue in June , British Labour MEP Arlene McCarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" The majority of cat and dog fur comes from China , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" At least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat -- more if puppies are used . "
Pork agreement signals normalizing relations
German pork could be destined for Chinese plates next year
In a separate signal of improving relations with China , German officials reached a veterinary agreement that is likely to open the Chinese market to German pork exports , the agriculture ministry said .
" I am optimistic that we will achieve the breakthrough next year , in the light of comments from the Chinese side , " parliamentary agriculture secretary Gerd Müller told the German DPA news agency .
The deal provides for closer cooperation in safety and in tracing the origin of foodstuffs , as well as for an increased exchange of information on diseases like bird flu .
The agreement was the first bilateral agreement reached by the two countries since China called off a series of high - level meetings after Chancellor Angela Merkel met with the Dalai Lama in September .
Calling negotiations " very constructive and open , " Müller , who was in Beijing to sign the agreement , said his meetings with Chinese agriculture officials were not hampered by the dispute over Merkel 's meeting with the Tibetan religious leader .
Masterful , no speaking necessary .

If you want to know something as simple as who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , do n’t bother to ask the safety agency ’s communications office .
Without special permission , officials there are no longer allowed to provide information to reporters except on a background basis , which means it cannot be attributed to a spokesman .
Without such attribution , there are few circumstances under which most reporters will report such information .
This makes for interesting dealings with the office charged with providing information about the nation ’s top automotive safety agency .
So , I will end the suspense about the boss ’s identity .
The administrator is Nicole R. Nason , who took over on May 31 , 2006 , after she was appointed to the post by President Bush .
And it is she who put the big hush on one of the government ’s most important safety agencies .
I found this out recently when I asked to talk to an N.H.T.S.A. researcher about some technical safety issues in which he had a great deal of expertise .
Agency officials told me I could talk to the expert on a background basis , but if I wanted to use any information or quotes from him , that would have to be worked out later with a N.H.T.S.A. official .
The arrangement struck me as manipulative , and I declined to agree to it .
It seems that Ms. Nason has adopted a policy that has blocked virtually all of her staff — including the communications office — from providing any information to reporters on the record , which means that it can be attributed .
As an alternative I was told I could interview Ms. Nason on the record ( instead of the expert on the subject of my article ) .
I declined , failing to see how her appointment as administrator — she was trained as a lawyer — made her a expert in that subject .
When I said I would like to talk to Ms. Nason on the record about her no-attribution policy , she was not available .
The agency ’s new policy effectively means that some of the world ’s top safety researchers are no longer allowed to talk to reporters or to be freely quoted about automotive safety issues that affect pretty much everybody .
“ My God , ” said Joan Claybrook , who was N.H.T.S.A. administrator from 1977 to 1981 and is now president of Public Citizen , a consumer advocacy group .
Given that N.H.T.S.A. is the leading source of automotive safety information in the United States , its researchers are public officials and people are entitled to “ know what information they have , whether it is on paper or in their heads , ” Ms. Claybrook said .
The policy of allowing information to be attributed only to political appointees is intermittently enforced around other parts of the Department of Transportation , including the Federal Railroad Administration .
But it is a radical change from the way N.H.T.S.A has operated for at least 20 years .
In the past , reporters could talk to its experts and the agency was proud to discuss its research and accomplishments .
Ms. Nason felt it was necessary for N.H.T.S.A. to have a “ central spokesperson ” and “ we were finding a lot of stuff did not need to be on the record , ” David Kelly , her chief of staff , told me .
He also insisted , after our telephone conversation , that he did not want to be quoted and had intended to speak only on background .
( My notes show no such request . )
So that central spokesperson is Ms. Nason , whose previous job was assistant secretary for governmental affairs in the Department of Transportation .
“ In that position , she was responsible for oversight of congressional affairs , coordinating all legislative and nonlegislative relationships between the D.O.T. and Congress , ” according to her N.H.T.S.A. biography .
If she has any experience in keeping a Congressman from skidding out of control , that could come in handy now that she is speaking for an entire agency of seasoned safety experts .
Simon Collins
CEO
KPMG 's corporate finance
LONDON : If the US goes the recessionary way , here 's a unique spin about the impact on India .
Simon Collins , global CEO of KPMG 's corporate finance , does n't think that there will be much of a trade effect in India ; on the contrary , a slowdown in US may speed up the flow of talent to India .
" Anecdotally , I know that a lot of professionals are moving back to India .
Any job slowdown in US will probably mean more will move , " he says .
And clearly , global financial crisis or no , India is a booming market for M&A and corporate finance specialists .
The message , Mr Collins says , is out and everyone wants a slice of the action .
He 's really more interested in taking the mystique out of structured finance and telling Indian companies the most innovative ways of raising money than talking about the general effects of globalisation .
But he also admits that right now , most of the mid-market companies in India , who are avidly looking for overseas acquisitions , do n't really need very sophisticated financing options – like 100 - year - bonds .
But sometimes , Indian companies just want to do things because it 's fashionable or glamorous , he says .
And that 's where KPMG 's focus in India comes in .
" At one time , any M&A activity for India was about overseas companies buying things in India .
Now Indian companies are looking for ways to buy entry into strategic markets overseas , " says Mr Collins , who 's been a regular visitor from the early 90s .
Mr Collins is spearheading the company 's corporate finance thrust , and has notched up some pretty big M&A deals in recent times .
And now he 's focusing on the Indian market for M&A advisory , something like what Rothschild does .
" A bank or an investment bank , which Indian companies have preferred till now , will not only advise , but also provide financing .
There is a conflict of interest .
I find that now many Indian companies are open to independent advisors , " he says .
Yes , he says , often clients want a big - name investment banker " for the glamour of the association , " but there is a niche for independent advisors , mostly led by top line companies turning global .
From the top line to mid-market companies , he finds Indian companies are moving out across various geographies and sectors , slowly but surely .
Mr Collins sees India Inc 's out - migration fuelled by different strategies ; one is to gain entry into strategic markets , and here , the activity is mostly in Western Europe ; more UK , Denmark , Germany and the US .
Another good strategy is to look for less sophisticated markets as Indian consumers upgrade to higher quality products .
Africa , for instance , is becoming a favourite destination for Indians .
As the Indian consumer gets more demanding and sophisticated , the African market is emerging as a good option for Indian companies to shift cheaper products to .
" Indian companies are selling a lot of low - grade items , like household goods and clothing in Africa .
Companies can upgrade the quality of their domestic products and sweat markets like Africa for cash , " he says .
Africa 's a big market and does not require any energy to service , he says .
While he feels that East Europe should be an fit for India Inc , there 's still not that much movement there .
" Maybe because the region does not have an established diaspora , " he says .

Investigations of prehistoric burial sites in Europe indicate that the region 's population may have practiced ritual human sacrifice , according to a new study .
The large number of multiple - burial sites , some containing skeletons of dwarfs and deformed children with ornate burial offerings such as ivory beads , suggests that human sacrifice was a custom in Europe in the period between 28,000 and 10,000 years ago , said biologist Vincenzo Formicola of the University of Pisa .
" These findings point to the possibility that human sacrifices were part of the ritual activity of these populations , " Formicola wrote .
Three multiple - burial graves in Russia , the Czech Republic and Italy are the focus of the study , published in the scholarly journal Current Anthropology .
A grave in Russia reveals the skeletons of a boy and girl , thought to be between 9 and 13 years old , lying head to head alongside spears of mammoth tusk , hundreds of fox canines and thousands of ivory beads .
The skeleton of the girl shows evidence of a congenital disease .
Formicola believes that the beads may have been made specially for the children , because of their small size compared to beads found on an adult male at the same site .
Rich burials traditionally suggest high status , Formicola wrote , and " it is hard to imagine this kind of motivation for two children . "
" The enormous amount of time required to prepare all those ivory objects and the possibility that ivory beads were made specifically for the two children by a few specialists would imply that those grave goods were ready when the two children died , which in turn leads one to wonder whether this ceremony was foreseen long in advance , " Formicola wrote .
Rupert Housley , a professor of archaeological science at the University of Glasgow , suggested in a telephone interview that there may be other explanations for the unique inhumation , or burial .
The beads may have been family heirlooms , prepared years earlier for a person of high status and incorporated into the graves of the children .
Housley , who is conducting a study in southern Russia on the connection between Neanderthals and modern humans , said that evidence of cannibalism has been found at sites 12,000 years ago in the same area , which could suggest a pattern .
But he said multiple burials were common in the period Formicola is investigating , and many children died at a young age .
" Diseases could explain children dying at the same time , and then being placed at the same burial site .
So if one is going to invoke sacrifice on the rest of it , it 's a possible explanation but there are also others , " said Housley .
" I would entertain the idea but it is only one of many possibilities . "
Another well - known site in the Czech Republic holds three skeletons of bodies aged 16 to 25 , two males and one deformed individual whose sex has not been determined , according to Formicola .
At a site in Italy , a female skeleton appears to be holding a dwarf , aged 17 , whom Formicola suggests may have received a special burial because of his physical condition .
" Elaborate burials , selected individuals , rich ornamentation , and site of inhumation continue to raise questions ... and stimulate reflections about social organization , conceptions of life and death , and the perception of diversity , " Formicola wrote .
Richard Klein , an anthropological science professor at Stanford University , called the findings interesting but lacking substance .
" The sample is too small to draw that conclusion , " Klein said .
" I 'm not against the idea , but there is no link between the burials and anything with human behavior .
They 're far apart and come from different cultures . "

Hrant Zeitountzian , 97 , of Pasadena still remembers being forced from his village into Syria by Turkish soldiers in 1915 .
He was 6 years old .
His father , a mule driver , had already been taken from the family farm by Turkish soldiers .
As Zeitountzian marched to Syria , he watched his brother and sister , both toddlers , fall ill and die , bodies in the mud , two of an estimated 1.5 million who would die during the relocations .
It was stories like his , told by Armenian survivors in the decades following the mass deaths , that fueled a growing movement seeking official recognition of the killings .
This week , Zeitountzian and others feel that they are closer than ever to winning official recognition in Washington of the genocide .
Until now , their quest has been blocked for geopolitical reasons :
The U.S. is a close ally of Turkey , which strongly opposes any official recognition of the genocide .
Advertisement
Many in Washington have argued that it is more important to respect the Turkish government than to address past wrongs .
Congress failed to pass legislation recognizing the genocide in 1975 and 1984 , due in part to intense lobbying by Turkish groups .
But the latest resolution , sponsored by Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( D - Burbank ) , passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee this week and has the support of Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
“ We ’ve been through this game , ” said professor Richard Dekmejian , director of the USC Institute of Armenian Studies .
But this time , “ There seems to be a moral tipping point in favor of the Armenian genocide precisely because it has happened in other places , in Rwanda and Darfur , the feeling that if we do n’t come clean , they are going to happen in other places , ” he said .

For Armenian Americans in Southern California , which has the largest Armenian community in the United States , the campaign had become a multi-generational obsession .
The movement included outreach to non-Armenians and the Bush administration , which is fighting the measure , saying that it would hurt relations with Turkey .
Many first - generation Armenian immigrants pushed the painful history aside to assimilate in America , settling where they found work in the Rust Belt , the mill towns of New England , in Glendale and Fresno .
A second wave of immigrants arrived in the 1960s , fleeing wars in Lebanon , Iran and other Middle Eastern countries , and settled primarily in Burbank , Glendale , Pasadena and an area that became known as “ Little Armenia ” in east Hollywood .
They opened businesses , built ornate churches and schools , and sought elected office .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , a third wave of Armenians flocked to hubs in Glendale and Hollywood , boosting the community ’s political clout .
Together they would become the country ’s largest Armenian enclave , with more than 60,000 in the city of Los Angeles and more than 300,000 in Southern California , a large chunk of the 800,000 Armenians in the U.S. , Dekmejian said .

“ Everybody has relatives who were lost , ” Aram Hamparian , executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America , said of Armenians in Southern California .
“ People are very motivated . ”
Each year , thousands of Armenians gather to commemorate the genocide on April 24 , and as their numbers have grown , so have the ceremonies .
Eventually , winning a national acknowledgment of the tragedy became a civil rights struggle .
In 1965 , on the 50th anniversary of the genocide , local Armenians unveiled the country ’s first memorial on public land in Montebello .
Former Gov. George Deukmejian , who recently recorded two promotional video messages in favor of passing the resolution , remembers standing with thousands of fellow Armenian Americans , watching then - Gov. Ronald Reagan dedicate the white concrete monument in Montebello ’s Bicknell Park , with its plaque commemorating the “ Armenian victims of genocide ” and “ Men of all nations who have fallen victim to crimes against humanity . ”
Deukmejian said having Reagan attend the event was a huge moment for many Armenian Americans , giving them hope that they could also win recognition in Washington .

Father Vazken Movsesian , an Armenian American priest in Glendale , agreed .
“ We realized at that moment that it was n’t just a family story , it was a community story , ” Movsesian said .
“ There is a struggle that has to be answered . ”
In recent years , the cause has been taken up by a younger generation of Armenians in their 20s and 30s who learned about the genocide from their elders .
Young people as well as survivors have traveled to Washington to share their stories .
Armenian youth fasted outside the Turkish Consulate on Wilshire Boulevard , marched from Fresno to Sacramento and last week protested outside the office of Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Venice ) .
Advertisement
Harman , a former sponsor of the genocide resolution , recently changed her mind and sent a letter to Rep.
Tom Lantos ( D - Burlingame ) urging him to withdraw the bill .
Harman did not return calls to her office late this week seeking comment .
But in a Times Op - Ed piece Friday , she said that although she recognizes that the Armenians were victims of genocide , she realized after visiting Turkey earlier this year that passing the genocide resolution “ would isolate and embarrass a courageous and moderate Islamic government in perhaps the most volatile region in the world . ”
The Turkish government acknowledges that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died as a result of the forced relocations from eastern Turkey in 1915 , but argues that it was not a systematic Ottoman government effort , but the result of World War I , famine and disease that killed Turks , too .
In response to the House ’s action , the Turkish government recalled their U.S. ambassador .
The conflict could jeopardize transportation of U.S. military supplies to Iraq that pass through a key air base near the southern Turkish city of Adana .
Advertisement
A showdown on the resolution is expected on Capitol Hill in coming weeks .
Carla Garapedian , the granddaughter of survivors and a Los Angeles native , is scheduled to travel to Washington next week to screen her new documentary about the genocide , “ Screamers , ” for members of Congress .
Earlier this year she was summoned for a private screening of the film , which features Armenian Los Angeles rockers System of a Down , with David and Victoria Beckham in Beverly Hills .
“ We ’re angry .
It is our generation that is making people listen , ” Garapedian said .
The Armenians of Southern California intend to keep lobbying in coming weeks , the old and the young .
Advertisement
“ A lot of people ask me why we care so much , especially the youth because we are a few generations out from the genocide , ” said Caspar Jivalagian , 20 , of Pasadena , a senior psychology major at Cal Poly Pomona who has fasted and marched for the cause , most recently outside of Harman ’s El Segundo office Friday afternoon .
“ Every Armenian we have it in us , under our skin . ”
Zeitountzian , the survivor , said he was cheered by this week ’s progress .
“ I am glad for the victory we have started , ” he said , but his real goal is to live long enough to see Congress finally pass the genocide resolution .
“ That will make me very happy if I live , ” he said , blue eyes shining .
“ I am optimist . ”

Another Rat Jumps Ship ; Trent Lott to Resign Senate Seat
New lobbying regulation laws that go into effect in 2008 could produce a rush of end of year resignations by Republicans dreading working in a congress with an ever greater Democratic Majority .
Lott , Senator from Mississippi and number two senator , will resign before the end of the year , sources report .
NBC news reports ,
NBC News has learned that Sen. Trent Lott , R - Miss. , the minority whip is in the midst of informing close allies that he plans to resign his senate seat before the end of the year .
It 's possible a formal announcement of his plans could take place as early as today .
Politico reports ,
Lott 's departure opens up a position within Republican leadership , and there could be a fight to replace him .
Lamar Alexander , who ran for the position last year , would be a natural candidate , but there are plenty of GOP up - and - comers who could compete for the slot , including Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , and Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , who are part of the current leadership team and could be looking for a promotion to the no .
2 spot in the hierarchy .
His term expires in 2012 ; and a resignation would prompt a special election to fill the remainder of his term .
In 2006 , he was reelected with 64 percent of the vote .
This will be a tough one for Democrats to pick up .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour ( R ) will name a successor to serve through the general election of 2008 .
Among the likely candidates to fill out Lott ’s term are Rep. Chip Pickering ( R - Miss . ) and former Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore ( D ) .
Another possible GOP contender for the seat would be Rep. Roger Wicker ( R - Miss . )
Barbour will have to name a successor within 10 days of Lott ’s official resignation .
When my former congressman , Jim Greenwood , retired , in 2004 , he took a job as a lobbyist , paying over $ 800,000 a year .
That laid the groundwork for Patrick Murphy to take a seat that would have been unassailable had Greenwood held on to it .
Now , Sen .
Trent Lott has resigned , joining Denny Hastert in avoiding tougher 2008 lobbying Rules .
My guess is that at least a few more high powered Republicans , not looking forward to an even weaker Republican minority in the house and senate come 2009 , will be joining the rats who have already jumped ship .
That will make it MUCH , MUCH easier for Democrats to capture seats that were held by incumbents .
The GOP is very short on money , and so they are recruiting wealthy candidates who can carry their own weight and pay their own way .
The problem is , that kind of candidate does not usually win .
Making a lot of money does not include the same skill set as campaigning and persuading voters to elect you .
The questions are , how many and which other Republican congressional leaders will decide it is time to jump ship early , so they can hitch a ride on the lobbyist gravy train a year earlier .
Once 2008 rolls around , new laws will require legislators to wait two years , instead of the current one year before starting as a lobbyist .
That could cost some of these Republican legislators a cool million or more dollars for that first year 's work .
And , as the new 2009 congress launches , with diminishing Republican influence , could even cost the Republicans job opportunities altogether .
That said , there may be some Democratic resignations too .
After all , the Democrats will probably have more say in funding .
Spook Country
William Gibson
G.P. Putnam 's Sons ( 2007 )
Just do n't call William Gibson dystopian .
The author of the cyberpunk classic Neuromancer , and eight novels since , admits his invented worlds are n't altogether pleasant places to imagine .
But " someone stuck in Darfur right now might be happy to live in them .
People who say I 'm dystopian are middle class pussies ! "
Gibson is loosening up this morning in his favourite noisy café on South Granville Street in his home city of Vancouver .
He does n't want to be called a futurist either , primarily because " I do n't know what will happen in the future and I know that I do n't know . "
Spook Country , his latest book , like Pattern Recognition , his previous one , is set in the current day , and gives us a post - 9 - 11 America spooked by terror threats , manipulated by marketing , and mesmerized by digital artifice .
As one of his characters declares , cyberspace is " everting , " meaning that it is less a destination we choose , and more and more an environment that envelops us .
The plot is a knot from several threads : a Cuban / Chinese crime family in New York working a shadowy exchange , an ex-punk rock star exploring the limits of virtual reality art , and rumoured rogue arms traders on the high seas .
Readers of Pattern Recognition will note the return of a creepy genius of advertising named Hubertus Bigend , who Gibson defends as " more Luciferian than Satanic . "
After a grueling book tour , Gibson clearly is happy to be back home ( and speaking tonight at the Vancouver International Writers ' and Readers ' Festival ) .
Vancouver 's essence , he says , is its young age , barely 100 years old .
" Even 30 years ago , it was astonishingly thin on the ground . "
As a result , Vancouver is " sort of a video game , " unencumbered by obsolete infrastructure that " you 've got to repurpose .
There 's relatively little to repurpose here . "
And that , he likes .
During our conversation , here 's what else Gibson had to say :
On being confused with being a ' futurist '
" The slot in culture that I 'm most closely associated with is one in which charlatans declare that they know the future .
My job is to sit near that slot and when people approach me I say : ' Only charlatans say they really know the future . '
I sit near the tent where they give out bullshit and offer people a different sort of dialogue .
My role is to raise questions . "
On whether people will prefer life inside the screen to the real world
" I think that we 're already there .
And that is the nature of our experience of emergent technology and new media .
A friend of mine was mining YouTube last month and he came up with footage shot in the street in New York on a particular day , in the evening .
And he knew that this footage was shot the day before broadcast television began in New York .
So this footage is of the last night that streets in New York were the way they were before everyone started staying home to watch television .
All the footage that he 's been able to find afterward is dramatically different .
It changed .
It changed the night they turned it on .
The night they started to broadcast television in New York , New York ceased to be what it had been before .
Because everyone stayed home to watch television .
" It 's not that we prefer it , it 's not even that conscious .
It becomes the nature of our experience .
If it 's going to happen at all , it becomes the nature of our experience .
If it does n't happen it just becomes one of those iconic retro-future images . "
On retro virtual reality
" There 's some ironic stuff going on in Spook Country , for me anyway , around the virtual reality gear .
Virtual reality was one of our most recent experiences of a future that did n't happen .
The one before that would have been interactive television , on which millions of dollars were spent .
Nobody wanted it .
Nobody wanted it at all .
But the Internet was n't here yet , and people were saying , it would great if people could go back and forth with media , but it turns out the medium they wanted to do it with is one that presents the world , rather than a bunch of entertainment -- the Internet . "
On the seamless net being woven
" There 's some enormous number , millions and millions , of Iranians who are about to get their first cell phones .
The infrastructure has been built .
That 's an interesting side of Iran we do n't hear so much about .
And you know , they 're not just getting cell phones , they 're getting Internet .
What is that going to do to that country ?
The government is not going to be able to control what those people are watching .
I just find that amazing , really .
" We 've grown up thinking : ' Over here is the Internet , over there is cellular telephony , and here are iPods . '
It 's not going to be like that .
That stuff is all just one cloud of stuff and it works together and you can't just get a little piece of it .
The kids being born today will grow up finding the quaintest thing about the past was that people had these different devices that had discrete functions . "
On whether we care less and less about what is authentic
" Does n't that question imply an assumption it was different previously ?
And I 'm not convinced of that .
I think a lack of concern about virtual and real maybe telling us as much about what we used to call real as it is about what we now call virtual .
I think that everything we 've been doing since we sat around camp fires telling stories and started making cave paintings , everything we 've been doing as a species seems to me to be part of this [ desire and ability ] to create prosthetic aspects of the self that are capable of surviving the death of the individual or indeed the death of an entire society .
Other animals do n't do that .
And we 've been doing it forever . "
On how much ' new ' is really old
" One of the things that I 've found through whatever loosey goosey reading of human history I 've managed through my life , is that very little is really new .
You know , the Internet , for the first 25 years of its existence , has been almost exclusively text based .
And so [ people ] are writing with frequency unseen since the Victorian heyday of the British Empire , when there were three mail deliveries a day , and people wrote and communicated constantly .
We went back to it .
It was n't new .
Very few things in the last 45 years have caused me to go ' Whoa !
That 's new ! ' "
On whether he enjoys conspiracy theories
" Conspiracy theories are popular because no matter what they posit , they are all actually comforting , because they all are models of radical simplicity .
I think they appeal to the infantile part of us that likes to know what 's going on . "
On whether he believes 9 - 11 might have been an inside job
" Absolutely not .
It makes no sense .
I mean how could incompetents , particularly incompetent at keeping secrets , have done this ?
But that 's a perfect example .
People want to believe a simple version , a radically simplified , actually imbecilic version of complex and largely incomprehensible reality . "
On whether some new terrorist attack will make 9 - 11 look small
" Eventually , I would say it 's almost inevitable .
Not immediately , because there is no need .
The last one is still working .
In some strange way , [ for terrorists ] anything that was less than 9 - 11 wo n't do .
Anything less spectacular just wo n't do .
" How terrorism works in the broadest sense really is the inversion of the psychology of the lottery .
The paradigms of asymmetrical warfare are such that one of the defining and unchanging characteristics of the terrorist is that he has very , very little in the way of stuff to work with .
He can't really do much .
He can kill a few people .
He can knock down a few buildings in New York .
But if he does it in a terroristically effective way , and if the society he does it to responds in what to the terrorist is the optimal way , everybody in society feels threatened .
In spite of the fact that the odds of any given individual being done in by a terrorist 's bomb are about the same odds of that individual winning the lottery .
" Terrorism is a con game .
It does n't always work .
It depends on the society you are playing it on .
It certainly has worked with the United States . "
On why the 9 - 11 attacks ' worked '
" I think that if I were Osama Bin Laden , I can't really imagine what more I could ask for .
The strafing of Mecca , possibly .
But we 've done everything we could wrong .
It 's not only America .
It 's like Thomas Kuhn 's thinking on the structure of scientific revolutions , how we have these deeply held cultural paradigms , for instance about what we do when we are attacked .
And we have these huge structures , armies and air forces and all of that , and they can be triggered by an event .
But in this case , the event they were triggered by was a criminal act .
It was n't a military invasion of the island of Manhattan .
" But emotionally , I think it caused an understandable infantilization of society .
Not just American society .
I think there was a bubble right after 9 - 11 when the whole world seemed quite labile .
Myself included .
As we moved through that , all these existing mechanisms in our various societies moved forward to do what they believed they were there to do .
Things that we sort of have in our immediate cultural mindset .
What do we do when we are attacked ?
We invade countries .
What do we do to countries that wo n't do what we want them to do ?
We use air power .
" Invade countries .
Use air power .
Well , it turns out , those are the two things not to do .
The old paradigm is the wrong paradigm . "
On the best way to fight terrorism
" The new paradigm is about degrading your opponent 's trust networks .
There would be a lot of money spent on training translators in Middle Eastern languages .
So how is that going to play in Alabama .
The people in Alabama are not going to be impressed and they are n't even going to know about it because it would all have to be done in secret .
" The assumption that the enemy is some sort of monolithic manifestation of whatever , that 's also a losing assumption .
Your enemy always consists of lots of different groups of people , and your first job , apart from deciding that those people are the enemy , is to start sorting them out and pitting them against one another .
It worked in the Cold War . "
On whether he is hopeful
" The present zeitgeist , now , is only one news cycle long .
Something could happen tomorrow that would throw everything into a cocked hat . "
William Gibson will be appearing at this year 's Vancouver International Writers ' and Readers ' Festival tonight at 8 p.m. at " The Purpose of Fiction " with Liam Durcan , Claire Keegan , A.L.

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Experts , not government ministers , should decide what kind of hybrid animal - human embryo experiments to allow in Britain , a parliamentary panel said in a report issued on Wednesday .
Parliamentarian Phil Willis , who led the committee , said the government should leave the decision to regulators with the expertise to weigh potential scientific benefits .
“ On the question of research using inter - species embryos , the committee is quite clear that it wishes to see a greater role for the regulator within a broad permissive framework set out by Parliament , ” Willis told a news conference before the release of the report .
The panel was asked to review a draft bill intended to reform Britain ’s 17 - year - old fertility laws .
Scientists say hybrid embryos could provide a plentiful source of stem cells for researching new treatments of human diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson’s .
In December , the government proposed a ban on creating the hybrid embryos because of public unease at the idea , but it later bowed to protests by scientists who feared Britain could lose its leading role in stem cell research .
Opponents say mixing even a tiny amount of human genetic material with that of an animal is unnatural and wrong .
The panel ’s report also urged the government to scrap a plan , in the draft bill , to combine the two watchdogs that oversee fertility treatment and human tissue , saying this could risk the established reputations of the separate agencies .
It agreed with organizations such as the British Medical Association that a new agency would lack expertise and could end up hampering medical research .
The report also urged parliament to have a nonpartisan vote on the principle of whether to allow inter-species embryo licenses .
“ The committee believes that once you cross that line and mix human and animal material , it is just a matter of degree , ” Willis said .
“ We are asking for a free vote because major issues of conscience are involved . ”
Scientists currently rely on human eggs left over from fertility treatments , but these are in short supply so researchers are exploring the use of hybrid embryos to further their studies .
Wills said the panel ’s report undercuts a major portion of the government ’s bill , but that any delay in the legislation would not necessarily affect two pending applications to carry out human - animal embryo experiments .
The report also recommended the establishment of a joint parliamentary bioethics committee and asked for more clarity about the proposed ban on human cloning and the creation of embryos for IVF treatment from genetic material of two women .
The Storm Worm 's days may be numbered , according to a University of California researcher .
Brandon Enright , a network security analyst at UC San Diego , has been tracking Storm since July and said that , despite the intense publicity that the network of infected computers has received , it 's actually been shrinking steadily and is presently a shadow of its former self .
On Saturday , he presented his findings at the Toorcon hacker conference in San Diego .
Storm is not really a computer worm .
It 's a network of computers that have been infected via malicious e-mail messages , and are centrally controlled via the Overnet P - to - P protocol .
Enright said he has developed software that crawls through the Storm network and he thinks that he has a pretty accurate estimate of how big Storm really is .
Some estimates have put Storm at 50 million computers , a number that would give its controllers access to more processing power than the world 's most powerful supercomputer .
But Enright said that the real story is significantly less terrifying .
In July , for example , he said that Storm appeared to have infected about 1.5 million PCs , about 200,000 of which were accessible at any given time .
Enright guessed that a total of about 15 million PCs have been infected by Storm in the nine months it has been around , although the vast majority of those have been cleaned up and are no longer part of the Storm network .
Since July , it 's been downhill for Storm .
That 's when antivirus vendors began stepping up their tracking of Storm variants and got a lot better at identifying and cleaning up infected computers , Enright said .
Then on September 11 , Microsoft added Storm detection ( Microsoft 's name for Storm 's components is Win32 / Nuwar ) into its Malicious Software Removal tool , which ships with every Windows system .
Overnight , Storm infections dropped by another 20 percent .
Today , Enright said that Storm is about one - tenth of its former size .
His most recent data counts 20,000 infected PCs available at any one time , out of a total network of about 160,000 computers .
" The size of the network has been falling pretty rapidly and pretty consistently , " he said .
Still , Storm has had a remarkably successful run .
It 's called Storm because it first popped up in mid-January in spam e-mails that offered late - breaking information on powerful storms that had been battering Europe .
Users who clicked on the " Full Story.exe " or " Video.exe " attachments that accompanied the spam were infected by malicious software , making them part of the Storm network .
These machines were then used to send out more spam and launch attacks against other computers .
The recent MP3 stock spam that was first spotted earlier this week was sent out by the Storm network , Enright said .
Storm was effective because its creators were really good at creating messages that victims would feel compelled to click , Enright said .
In its first few days , it managed to infect more than 300,000 computers , making it the worst malware outbreak since 2005 .
Its creators have since been masters at creating timely messages for their spam and have also had success getting victims to click on fake e-greeting cards .
The Storm network itself is constantly changing , and has used a variety of technologies that have made it an interesting phenomenon to study .
In addition to the peer to peer network , it has used rootkit software to disguise its presence on the PC and a server - switching technique called " fast - flux , " which makes the Storm servers harder to find on the network .
It 's also developed some interesting ways of keeping researchers like Enright at bay .
" If you 're a researcher and you hit the pages hosting the malware too much ... there is an automated process that automatically launches a denial of service [ attack ] against you , " he said .
This attack , which floods the victim 's computer with a deluge of Internet traffic , knocked part of the UC San Diego network offline when it first struck .
Lately Storm has been responsible for a large quantity of " pump and dump " spam , which tries to temporarily boost the price of penny stocks .
But one area that does not seem to be of interest to Storm 's creators is identity theft .
" Believe it or not , credit card numbers are n't worth that much money , " Enright said .
" It 's much better to make money ... via pump and dump . "

As the Bush administration deals with the fallout from the recent killings of civilians by private security firms in Iraq , some officials are asking whether the contractors could be considered unlawful combatants under international agreements .
The question is an outgrowth of federal reviews of the shootings , in part because the U.S. officials want to determine whether the administration could be accused of treaty violations that could fuel an international outcry .
But the issue also holds practical and political implications for the administration ’s war effort and the image of the U.S. abroad .
If U.S. officials conclude that the use of guards is a potential violation , they may have to limit guards ’ tasks in war zones , which could leave more work for the already overstretched military .
Advertisement
Unresolved questions are likely to touch off new criticism of Bush ’s conduct of the unpopular Iraq war , especially given the broad definition of unlawful combatants the president has used in justifying his detention policies at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The issues surrounding the private security contractors are being examined by lawyers at the departments of State , Defense and Justice .
Disagreements about the contractors ’ status exist between agencies and within the Pentagon itself .
“ I think it is an unresolved issue that needs to be addressed , ” said a senior Defense Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject .
“ But if that is in fact the case , what the heck are we doing ? ”
The use of private contractors by the U.S. military and governments worldwide began long before the U.S invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , but it has mushroomed in recent years .
With relatively little controversy , contractors have assumed a greater share of support and logistics duties traditionally handled by uniformed military , such as protecting diplomats inside a war zone .
Advertisement
On Sept. 16 , a Blackwater USA security team guarding U.S. diplomats was involved in a shooting that killed as many as 17 Iraqis .
Blackwater said its personnel were under attack , but Iraqis said the team began the shooting .
Other incidents portraying the private guards as aggressive and heavily armed have since come to light .
The guards also operate under immunity from Iraqi law -- immunity was granted in 2004 by U.S. officials -- and in a murky status with respect to American laws .
The designation of lawful and unlawful combatants is set out in the Geneva Convention .
Lawful combatants are nonmilitary personnel who operate under their military ’s chain of command .
Others may carry weapons in a war zone but may not use offensive force .
Under the international agreements , they may only defend themselves .

The amount of force being used in Iraq by security firms like Blackwater has raised questions .
The United States already has faced international criticism about its interrogation techniques and detention procedures , and charges that such practices do not adhere to international treaties .
It was the government lawyers involved in those matters who first raised questions about the legal status of the private security contractors under Geneva Convention provisions .
But there is debate among those studying the question .
Lawyers at the Justice Department are skeptical that the contractors could be considered unlawful combatants , but some in the State and Defense departments think the contractors in Iraq could be vulnerable to claims that their actions make them unlawful combatants .
If so , some experts say , the U.S. would have to pull them out of the war zone .
Advertisement
Legal experts widely agree that private contractors are allowed to use force to defend themselves .
But the threshold between defensive and offensive force is ill - defined .
“ In terms of these private military contractors , it really is , legally speaking , very convoluted , ” said the senior Defense official .
“ It is always true that people can defend themselves .
The question then becomes :
At what point does a contractor who is providing defensive security go beyond that ? ”
Interpretations also vary in academic circles , where the issue has been the subject of articles and discussions .
For a guard who is only allowed to use defensive force , killing civilians violates the law of war , said Michael N. Schmitt , a professor of international law at the Naval War College and a former Air Force lawyer .
“ It is a war crime to kill civilians unlawfully in an armed conflict , ” he said .
Advertisement
If the contractors were the aggressors in an incident , they could be deemed to be unlawfully using offensive force , said Scott Silliman , a retired Air Force lawyer and now a professor at Duke University .
He said they could claim self - defense only if they had been fired on .
“ The only force they can use is defensive force , ” Silliman said .
“ But we may be seeing some instances where contractors are using offensive force , which in my judgment would be unlawful . ”
Some current Defense Department lawyers think that interpretation is too restrictive .
Like soldiers , the security guards should be able to defend themselves if they detect “ hostile intent , ” said the Defense official .
But the guards often participate in operations where the line between defensive and offensive force is hard to determine , such as escorting a diplomat through a neighborhood in a war zone , as many frequently do .
Advertisement
Those operations may be best left to the military , some experts said .
“ To what extent is it appropriate to have people not in the chain of command under the president of the United States involved in the application of force ? ” the official asked .
Any doubt on the legal status of the contractors is likely to open the United States to further criticism from the international community .
John Hutson , a former top
Navy lawyer , said he did not consider contractors to be unlawful combatants .
Advertisement
But that will be a difficult argument for U.S. officials to make , he emphasized .
“ We are going to be hard - pressed to draw a distinction between the guys in Blackwater carrying automatic weapons and the bad guys setting bombs along the side of the road , ” said Hutson , now dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center in New Hampshire .
U.S. officials have described many of the suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates it holds at Guantanamo Bay as unlawful combatants either for taking part in hostilities against the United States or by supporting the hostilities while not part of a nation ’s military .
By that standard , some of the private guards in Iraq and Afghanistan also could be seen as unlawful combatants , particularly if they have taken offensive action against unarmed civilians , experts said .
Advertisement
“ If we hire people and direct them to perform activities that are direct participation in hostilities , then at least by the Guantanamo standard , that is a war crime , ” Schmitt said .
The 2004 immunity measure prevents Iraq from prosecuting private guards under Iraqi law .
But some international law experts think Iraq could use international treaties to try contractors for killing civilians .
For now , such trials are considered unlikely , especially because the Iraqi government does not have the contractors in custody .
Many of the current and former federal officials think the administration has an obligation under the Geneva Convention to clarify the contractors ’ status .
Some are perplexed that the Bush administration did not resolve these issues -- or at least discuss them more thoroughly -- before putting contractors on such a complex battlefield .

“ It ’s confusing , ” Silliman said .
“ And a lot of us are wondering why the Department of Defense pushed them into core military roles . ”

Hubble Finds ' Dorian Gray ' Galaxy
10.16.07
NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope has found a galaxy that is the equivalent of the painting of Dorian Gray , a portrait in an Oscar Wilde novel that appears mysteriously to age .
Image above : Called I Zwicky 18 , the galaxy has a youthful appearance that resembles galaxies typically found only in the early universe .
Hubble has now found faint , older stars within this galaxy , suggesting that the galaxy may have formed at the same time as most other galaxies .

Like the fictional painting , the galaxy I Zwicky 18 appears to look older the more astronomers study it .
What astronomers once thought was a toddler galaxy by galactic standards may now be considered an adult .
The galaxy ’s youthful appearance was identified some 40 years ago through observations at the Palomar Observatory .
Those studies showed that the galaxy erupted with star formation billions of years after its galactic neighbors .
Galaxies resembling I Zwicky 18 ’s youthful appearance are typically found only in the outer reaches of the universe , when the cosmos was much younger .
Astronomers were thrilled that a newly forming galaxy could be studied nearby to learn about galactic evolution , which is normally only observable at great distances .
New Hubble data have quashed that possibility .
The telescope found faint older stars contained within the galaxy , suggesting its star formation started at least one billion years ago and possibly as much as 10 billion years ago .
The galaxy , therefore , may have formed at the same time as most other galaxies .
“ Although the galaxy is not as youthful as was once believed , it is certainly developmentally challenged and unique in the nearby universe , ” said astronomer Alessandra Aloisi from the Space Telescope Science Institute and the European Space Agency in Baltimore , Md. , who led the new study .
Spectroscopic observations with ground - based telescopes have shown that I Zwicky 18 is almost exclusively composed of hydrogen and helium , the main ingredients created in the Big Bang .
Heavier elements are forged within the cores of stars and blasted into space when the stars die .
The galaxy ’s primordial makeup suggests that its rate of star formation has been much lower than that of other galaxies of similar age .
The galaxy has been studied with most of NASA ’s telescopes , including the Spitzer Space Telescope , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer ( FUSE ) .
However , it remains an outstanding mystery why I Zwicky 18 formed so few stars in the past , and why it is forming so many new stars right now .
The Hubble data also suggest that I Zwicky 18 is 59 million light - years from Earth , almost 10 million light - years more distant than previously believed .
While this is still in our own backyard , as measured by extragalactic standards , the galaxy ’s larger - than - expected distance may explain why astronomers have had difficulty detecting older , fainter stars within the galaxy until now .
In fact , the faint , old stars in I Zwicky 18 are almost at the limit of Hubble ’s resolution and sensitivity .
Aloisi and her team discerned the new distance by observing flashing stellar mile - markers within I Zwicky 18 .
Massive stars , called Cepheid variable stars , pulse in a regular rhythm .
The timing of their pulsations is directly related to their brightness .
By comparing their actual brightness with their observed brightness , astronomers can precisely measure their distance .
The team determined the observed brightness of three Cepheids and compared it to the actual brightness predicted by theoretical models calculated specifically for I Zwicky 18 ’s low metal content .
This comparison allowed the astronomers to determine the galaxy ’s distance .
The Cepheid distance also was validated through another distance indicator , specifically the observed brightness of the brightest red stars older than 1 billion years .
Cepheid variable stars have been studied for decades and have been instrumental in the determination of the scale of our universe .
This is the first time , however , that variable stars with so few heavy elements were found .
This may provide unique new insights into the properties of variable stars , which is now a topic of ongoing study .
Aloisi and her team published their findings in the Oct. 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Aloisi ’s team consists of Francesca Annibali , Jennifer Mack , and Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute ; Marco Sirianni of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the European Space Agency ; Abhijit Saha of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories ; and Gisella Clementini , Rodrigo Contreras , Giuliana Fiorentino , Marcella Marconi , Ilaria Musella , and Monica Tosi of the Italian National Astrophysics Institutes in Bologna and Naples .

Now even the New York Times is saying it .
In an editorial on Oct. 20 , the Times wrote , " Every now and then , we are tempted to double - check that the Democrats actually won control of Congress last year . "
Noting how the Democratic House and Senate had rolled over and given the president permission to massively spy on Americans without showing any probable cause , the Times concluded , " It was bad enough having a one - party government when Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress .
But the Democrats took over , and still the one - party system continues . "
There is no question about it .
The Democrats , after persuading voters to hand over control of Congress to them last November , have been worse than failures .
They have betrayed the trust of the voters .
Although the party clearly has the power to end the Iraq War by simply refusing to approve funds for continuing the mayhem and madness , it has instead given the president every dollar he 's asked for to continue it , and then some .
Although every leading Democrat admits that the president has been torturing the Constitution , not one member has submitted a bill calling for the president 's impeachment , and the one bill submitted calling for Cheney 's impeachment , submitted by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , has been pushed off on a siding by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her gang of " leaders . "
More recently in the Senate , where 41 Democrats could stop any presidential appointment , 53 senators instead approved a new attorney general , Michael Mukasey , who refuses to say waterboarding is torture and illegal , and who , even worse , says that in his view the president has the power to ignore laws passed by the Congress .
The Democrats in the Senate had the votes to stop this outrageous nomination , and did n't .
I would go the Times one step further .
There is no need to check to see if Democrats won control of Congress .
It does n't matter .
The Democrats have simply ceased to be an opposition party .
The party of Franklin D. Roosevelt is now simply a collection of incumbent hacks who are looking to their own re-election , and who stand for nothing .
So what is to be done ?
Various left - leaning activist organizations , like Democrats for America and Progressive Democrats of America , and pseudo - progressive organizations like Move - On and DailyKos , argue that liberal Democrats need to work within the party to elect more progressive candidates and party officials .
But this strategy is doomed for several reasons .
First of all , the leadership of the Democratic Party does n't want real liberals or , heaven - forefend , lefties .
It wants candidates who can appeal to the corporations that bankroll both parties .
And second , the leadership undermines those liberals who do have a chance of replacing the hacks who currently hold Democratic seats in Congress .
As I have written before , we have seen more than 50 years of betrayal of liberal and left voters and their issues by the Democratic Party , and despite the efforts of would - be reformers , the situation has been getting worse , not better .
The answer , I submit , is to tell Democratic incumbents and party officials that we 've finally had it .
We are not going to be ignored or walked over or taken for granted any longer .
How to do this ?
By mass resignations from the Democratic Party , at which it is made crystal clear that there are two reasons for the actions : Congress is n't stopping the war funding , and Congress is n't initiating impeachment hearings .
I am proposing that left and progressive organizations , civil rights groups , Church groups , anti-war coalitions , labor unions and other progressive and liberal groups start organizing mass actions that involve marches to the local board of elections or voter registrar 's office , for collective de-registration from the Democratic Party .
Here in Philadelphia , we could have a mass march from Independence Hall to the Board of Elections , for example .
This is a strategy that would hit the Democratic Party leadership like a bucket of ice water -- or a brick -- in the face .
The beauty of the idea is that it will garner enormous press coverage , even if the numbers are relatively small .
Thanks to the overall pro-Republican bias of the media , news outlets like AP , CNN and especially Fox TV , will find the idea of Democratic activists marching on voter offices and quitting the Democratic Party irresistible .
And as other groups across the country see these protest actions , they will want to join in .
In no time , Democratic incumbents in Congress , at the DNC , and in city halls and Democratic clubs across the country will see their most loyal voting base eroding .
If that should happen , they will be in a panic .
Just watch how fast they start impeachment hearings and stop passing war funding appropriation bills !
Now whenever I 've suggested this scheme , after the wild applause subsides , there are always those who raise the question about voting for progressive candidates in primaries , and about electing progressives to party office .
I agree these are important steps , and that they should be attempted , but mass party quitting does n't preclude doing them .
In many states , first of all ( CA , NH , VA , MA , and SC , for instance ) , you do n't need to be registered in a party to vote in that party 's primary .
But even in those states like my own Pennsylvania , where you do need to be registered in a party to vote in its primary , it is an easy thing to re-register in time to qualify for the primary .
Just check with your voter registrar and learn the deadline .
Then , after you 've voted , just quit again .
The same for party caucuses .
Those who are elected to positions like county committeeperson should stay in the party , where they can try ( good luck ! ) to make change .
The important thing is those mass quit events .
The other thing I hear is the argument that people should not be just urged to quit ; they should be urged to join a third party .
I disagree .
As soon as you start trying to get agreement about joining a third party , you are introducing division into a movement that should be narrowly focused on the two issues of getting the Democrats , now , to end funding for the war and to initiate impeachment hearings .
Anything else is a diversion .
Besides , getting significant numbers of progressive - minded people to cut their ties to the Democratic Party offers the potential of creating a new base out of which a genuine mass party of the left might come .
The first step though , is for all of us , who have been tethered to the Democratic Party for most of our adult lives , to cut the leash .
If desperate Democratic officials respond by according us the same attention and support that they regularly accord to hedge fund managers and health insurance companies , if they meet our demands to end the war and defend the Constitution , so be it .
Maybe we will back them in November '08 .
If they do n't , then we 're free to go somewhere else , or to found a new party .
One thing is clear :
If we do n't do this , we will no longer live in a democratic state .
We will live in a one - party state .

Browse column N ext May 25 , John Rambo will open in wide release across a troubled planet , 20 years to the day after the opening of the last Rambo sequel , Rambo III .
Like last year 's Rocky Balboa , the eponymous final installment in the Rambo franchise was written and directed by Sylvester Stallone in an attempt to recapture some of the early magic of his most famous roles , and thus rescue a career that was born in the glory of Rocky but soon became shorthand for the end of mild retardation as an impediment to success in the dramatic arts .
Anyone who ever endured Rhinestone or Tango & Cash in a snowed - in three - channel motel knows that Stallone deserves all four of his Razzie awards for Worst Actor ( he 's been nominated a record 12 times ) .
When he 's not playing Rocky , he really is that bad .
One of Stallone 's Razzies recognized his performance in Rambo III , the explosion - filled crap - fest apotheosis of the 80s action genre .
Back then he was teaming up with heroic Mujahideen in Afghanistan to rescue his old friend Colonel Trautman , held hostage by a cartoon villain Soviet officer named Zaysen .
The movie was the most expensive film ever made at the time ( $ 63 million ; 1988 ) ; it was also the most ridiculously violent .
According to the Guinness Book of World Records , the movie has 221 acts of violence resulting in 108 onscreen deaths , most of them KIA 's racked up by Rambo's heavy - caliber machine guns , explosive - tipped arrows , and eighteen - inch survival knife .
It also has some of the best / worst action dialogue ever written .
Zaysen : " Who are you ? " Rambo : " Your worst nightmare . "
And who can forget this classic exchange : Zaysen : " Who do you think this man is ?
The Lord ? " Trautman : " No . God would have mercy .
He won't . "
Rambo III has two other claims to movie fame .
Stallone signed on to the Rambo sequels in the depths of Reagan 's Cold War , and the story - lines and scripts were prepared against a news backdrop of creeping Sandanistas in Central America and bigger payload SS - 20s in Central Europe .
But all that started shifting between the second and third Rambo sequels , and Rambo III was released into the immediate wake of Gorbachev 's famous 1988 charm assault in Washington , which sent Gorby - mania through the roof and set the stage for the End of the Cold War .
Hollywood 's scarface Russian villains suddenly looked ridiculous and passe .
Rambo III and its bloated budget twisted in the box office winds , red-faced and saddled with the distinction of having the worst timed release in movie history .
It was the last unabashedly idiotic Cold War flick ever made .
What 's an action - hero moron to do when the commies become pitiful eastern Europeans , the Vietnam POW myth finally draws its last malarial breathe , and the freedom fighters of the Mujahideen morph into the dreaded bin Laden - harboring Taliban ?
Rambo did what any psycho vet with bad knees and a little money would do .
He moved to Thailand .
An unofficial preview for John Rambo has been on YouTube since Cannes , where Stallone personally lugged a reel of the three and a half minute clip he edited himself .
It starts with a shot of Rambo fishing with a bow and ( non-explosive ) arrow at dawn .
Stallone is 62 now and looks it -- fat , melted - ass - looking face ; torso still massive but no longer poster - worthy .
Cut to Rambo declining an offer to take a clueless group of NGO - type do - gooders upriver to Burma , aka Myanmar .
" Burma 's a war zone , " Rambo informs them .
" It 's more like genocide ! " says a fresh - faced NGO kid , referring to the real - life Karen people , who 've been waging a low - grade insurgency against the Burmese junta for years .
" You bring any weapons ? " asks Rambo .
" Then you ai n't changin ' nothin ' . "

Jon Stewart tells Bolivian president America 's elections are ' rigged ' Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday September 26 , 2007
Print This Email This Bolivian president Evo Morales and his translator joined Jon Stewart to discuss the leader 's rise from poor farmer to Bolivia 's " first indigenous president . "
Morales also made use of the the opportunity to take some jabs at America and the West .
" I understand that all have rights .
It 's not just intellectuals and professionals who can become president , " Morales said through translation .
" People who have other experiences , who have a working life as well , can become president .
Therefore indigenous persons can also become president . "
" In Bolivia , " Steward deadpanned .
" In America , it 's a little rigged . "
" So if it 's rigged , then something needs to be done to change that , " the leader said .
Discussing Morales 's accomplishments , Stewart noted that the president 's campaign promises , which had included pledges to nationalize resources , convene a constitutional assembly and institute agrarian reform , were all completed within eight months of his election .
" What are you trying to pull ? " Stewart asked .
" On the issue of nationalization of oil and gas , " Morales said , " in 2005 , before I came president , the Bolivian state received only 300 million dollars from its oil and gas exports .
And now since they 've been nationalized , the Bolivian state receives more than two billion dollars .
Therefore , we followed through on what we promised . "
" We are going forward with the idea of a multi- cultural state , " he continued , " a multi-national state , trying to live in unity at the same time respecting our diversity . "
" We 're so diverse , there are blue and green - eyed people like you , " the president joked , pointing at Stewart .
Responding to a question about the US and its relationship with countries including Venezuela and Cuba , Morales said the nations should come together to think about " how we can support life and human kind . "
" It should be the millennium of life , " he said .
" I personally know that there are presidents in countries who send troops abroad to save lives , " Morales added later in the program , " but there are also countries who send troops abroad to take away lives .
If we compare these two things ... certainly we 're going to the conclusion that these policies must change . "
" And please do n't consider me to part of the axis of evil , " he begged .

Religion has faced formidable foes in its history .
But atheism has n't generally been one of them – until today .
A recent string of bestselling books has put believers of all stripes on the defensive .
Religion , say authors such as Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett , and Christopher Hitchens , is an unreasonable form of blind faith , often leading to fanaticism and violence .
Reason and science , they contend , are the only proper foundations for forming opinions and understanding the universe .
Those who believe in God , they insist , are falling for silly superstitions .
This atheist attack is based on a fallacy – the Fallacy of the Enlightenment .
It was pointed out by the great Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant .
Kant erected a sturdy intellectual bulwark against atheism that has n't been breached since .
His defense does n't draw on sacred texts or any other sources of authority to which people of faith might naturally and rightfully turn when confronted with atheist arguments .
Instead , it relies on the only framework that today 's atheist proselytizers say is valid : reason .
The Fallacy of the Enlightenment is the glib assumption that there is only one limit to what human beings can know – reality itself .
This view says we can find out more and more until eventually there is nothing more to discover .
It holds that human reason and science can , in principle , unmask the whole of reality .
In his 1781 " Critique of Pure Reason , " Kant showed that this premise is false .
In fact , he argued , there is a much greater limit to what human beings can know .
Kant showed that human knowledge is constrained not merely by the unlimited magnitude of reality but also by a limited sensory apparatus of perception .
Consider a tape recorder .
It captures only one mode of reality , namely sound .
Thus all aspects of reality that cannot be captured in sound are beyond its reach .
The same , Kant would argue , is true of human beings .
The only way we apprehend empirical reality is through our five senses .
But why should we believe , Kant asked , that this five - mode instrument is sufficient ?
What makes us think that there is no reality that lies beyond sensory perception ?
Moreover , the reality we apprehend is not reality in itself .
It is merely our experience or " take " on it .
Kant 's startling claim is that we have no basis for assuming that a material perception of reality ever resembles reality itself .
I can tell if my daughter 's drawing of her teacher looks like the teacher by placing the portrait alongside the person .
With my eyes , I compare the copy with the original .
Kant points out , however , that comparing our experience of reality to reality itself is impossible .
We have representations only , never the originals .
So we have no basis for presuming that the two are even comparable .
When we equate experience and reality , we are making an unjustified leap .
It is essential to recognize that Kant is n't diminishing the importance of experience .
It is entirely rational for us to use science and reason to discover the operating principles of the world of experience .
This world , however , is not the only one there is .
Kant contended that while science and reason apply to the world of sensory phenomena , of things as they are experienced by us , science and reason cannot penetrate what Kant termed the noumena – things as they are in themselves .
Some critics have understood Kant to be denying the existence of external reality or of arguing that all of reality is " in the mind . "
Kant emphatically rejects this .
He insists that the noumenon obviously exists because it is what gives rise to phenomena .
In other words , our experience is an experience of something .
Perhaps the best way to understand this is to see Kant as positing two kinds of reality : the material reality that we experience and reality itself .
To many , the implication of Kant 's argument is that reality as a whole is , in principle , inaccessible to human perception and human reason .
So powerful is Kant 's argument here that his critics have been able to answer him only with derision , as though his arguments are self - evidently fallacious .
When I challenged Daniel Dennett to debunk Kant 's argument , he responded on his website by saying several people had already refuted Kant .
But he did n't provide any refutations and he did n't name any names .
Basically , Mr. Dennett was relying on the ignorance of the audience .
In fact , there are no such refutations .
Although Kant 's argument seems counterintuitive – in the way that some of the greatest ideas from Copernicus to Einstein are counterintuitive — no one who understands the central doctrines of the world 's leading religions should have any difficulty grasping his main point .
Kant 's philosophical vision is largely congruent with the teachings of many faiths that the empirical world is not the only world .
Ours is a world of appearances only , in which we see things in a limited and distorted way – " through a glass , darkly , " as the apostle Paul writes in I Corinthians .
The spiritual reality constitutes the only permanent reality there is .
Christianity teaches that while reason can point to the existence of this higher domain , it cannot on its own fully comprehend that domain .
Thus , when Christopher Hitchens and other atheists routinely dismiss religious claims on the grounds that " what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence , " they are making what philosophers like to call a category mistake .
We learn from Kant that within the domain of experience , human reason is sovereign , but it is in no way unreasonable to believe things on faith that simply cannot be adjudicated by reason .
When atheists summarily dismiss such common ideas as the immortality of the soul or the afterlife on the grounds that they have never found any empirical proofs for either , they are asking for experiential evidence in a domain that is entirely beyond the reach of the senses .
In this domain , Kant argues , the absence of such evidence cannot be used as the evidence for absence .
Notice that Kant 's argument is entirely secular :
It does not employ any religious vocabulary , nor does it rely on any kind of faith .
But in showing the limits of reason , Kant 's philosophy " opens the door to faith , " as the philosopher himself noted .
Kant exposes the ignorant boast of atheists that atheism operates on a higher intellectual plane than theism .
He shows that reason must know its limits in order to be truly reasonable .
Atheism foolishly presumes that reason is in principle capable of figuring out all that there is , while theism at least knows that there is a reality greater than , and beyond , that which our senses and our minds can ever apprehend .

to Curves and color_guru , I think if you are now , or have ever been , on the red carpet , you have immediately and indefinitely opened yourself up to ridicule .
To be fair , I also believe that posting on the Internet should open you up for the joke making as well .
So , you have my permission to laugh at me , Kathy , or the Woz .
@ Brian Lam :
As soon as we keep from having fun with those we admire , we deify them .
And I do n't know if my alter can fit Woz , Joe Pesci and the Flying Spaghetti Monster .
And to set the record straight , I do admire Wozniak , and to a lessor extent , Kathy .
I also admire Dennis Leary , but I make jokes about " Two if by Sea " every chance I get .
I am not a professional evolutionary biologist .
I only know a few equations , very simple ones by comparison to what can be found in any textbook on evolutionary theory with math , and on one memorable occasion I used one incorrectly .
For me to publish an article in a highly technical ev-bio journal would be as impossible as corporations evolving .
And yet when I 'm dealing with almost anyone who 's not a professional evolutionary biologist ...
It seems to me that there 's a substantial advantage in knowing the drop - dead basic fundamental embarrassingly simple mathematics in as many different subjects as you can manage .
Not , necessarily , the high - falutin ' complicated damn math that appears in the latest journal articles .
Not unless you plan to become a professional in the field .
But for people who can read calculus , and sometimes just plain algebra , the drop - dead basic mathematics of a field may not take that long to learn .
And it 's likely to change your outlook on life more than the math - free popularizations or the highly technical math .
Not Jacobean matrices for frequency - dependent gene selection ; just Haldane 's calculation of time to fixation .
Not quantum physics ; just the wave equation for sound in air .
Not the maximum entropy solution using Lagrange multipliers ; just Bayes 's Rule .
The Simple Math of Everything , written for people who are good at math , might not be all that weighty a volume .
How long does it take to explain Bayes 's Rule to someone who 's good at math ?
Damn would I like to buy that book and send it back in time to my 16 - year - old self .
But there 's no way I have time to write this book , so I 'm tossing the idea out there .
Even in reading popular works on science , there is yet power .
You do n't want to end up like those poor souls in that recent interview ( I could n't Google ) where a well - known scientist in field XYZ thinks the universe is 100 billion years old .
But it seems to me that there 's substantially more power in pushing until you encounter some basic math .
Not complicated math , just basic math .
F=ma is too simple , though .
You should take the highest low - hanging fruit you can reach .
Yes , there are sciences whose soul is not in their math , yet which are nonetheless incredibly important and enlightening .
Evolutionary psychology , for example .
But even there , if you kept pushing until you encountered equations , you would be well - served by that heuristic , even if the equations did n't seem all that enlightening compared to the basic results .
I remember when I finally picked up and started reading through my copy of the Feynman Lectures on Physics , even though I could n't think of any realistic excuse for how this was going to help my AI work , because I just got fed up with not knowing physics .
And - you can guess how this story ends - it gave me a new way of looking at the world , which all my earlier reading in popular physics ( including Feynman 's QED ) had n't done .
Did that help inspire my AI research ?
Hell yes .
( Though it 's a good thing I studied neuroscience , evolutionary psychology , evolutionary biology , Bayes , and physics in that order - physics alone would have been terrible inspiration for AI research . )
In academia ( or so I am given to understand ) there 's a huge pressure to specialize , to push your understanding of one subject all the way out to the frontier of the latest journal articles , so that you can write your own journal articles and get tenure .
Well , one may certainly have to learn the far math of one field , but why avoid the simple math of others ?
Is it too embarrassing to learn just a little math , and then stop ?
Is there an unwritten rule which says that once you start learning any math , you are obligated to finish it all ?
Could that be why the practice is n't more common ?
I know that I 'm much more embarrassed to know a few simple equations of physics , than I was to know only popular physics .
It feels wronger to know a few simple equations of evolutionary biology than to know only qualitative evolutionary biology .
Even mentioning how useful it's been seems wrong , as if I 'm boasting about something that no one should boast about .
It feels like I 'm a dilettante - but how would I be diletting less if I had n't studied even the simple math ?
The headline kind of says it all : a little hex editing of iTunes , a little hostfile hacking , a little program called Phone Activation Server v1.0 , and you 're on your way to an AT&T service free iPhone , friend .
That 's right , Jon , knock that toxic AT&T - tied iPod - coffee out of Steve 's hand .
Ok , so apparently the phone still does n't work ( we wonder if there is n't some kind of mechanism that binds the iPhone to select AT&T SIMs ) , so it 's not like it's an unlocked device , but at least you can now use it as " the best iPod [ Apple 's ] ever made . "
We 've yet to confirm the method though -- anyone want to give it a shot ?
Let us know in comments .

WASHINGTON , July 9 — President Bush , invoking executive privilege for the second time in his clash with lawmakers over the firing of federal prosecutors , said today that he is refusing to comply with Congressional subpoenas for testimony from two top former aides .
In a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees , Mr. Bush ’s counsel , Fred F. Fielding , declared that the legislative and executive branches of government were at an impasse .
Mr. Fielding wrote that the president is directing the two aides — Sara M. Taylor , the former White House political director , and Harriet E. Miers , the former White House counsel — not to testify .
“ The assertion of executive privilege here is intended to protect a fundamental interest of the presidency : the necessity that a president receive candid advice from his advisors and that those advisors be able to communicate freely and openly with the president , ” Mr. Fielding wrote , adding that in the case of the firing of federal prosecutors , “ the institutional interest of the executive branch is very strong . ”
The move was not unexpected .
Mr. Bush said last month that he had no intention of letting Ms. Miers or Ms. Taylor testify .
Alan Dershowitz has written a post that first attacks Larisa Alexandrovna for suggesting he 's pro-torture , and then goes on to accuse the Huffington Post of censorship .
Regarding Ms. Alexandrovan , he apparently feels it's " name - calling " - and worse - to state what appears to be obvious : Although Mr. Dershowitz professes his opposition to torture , he continues to advocate for its use .
Specifically , he wants to make it legal for the United States government to engage in torture practices under certain conditions .
Mr. Dershowitz 's logic appears to be that making torture legal and then establishing guidelines for its limited use is actually a form of noble opposition .
It 's hard to understand how he can argue that this make him " anti-torture , " but his motives and state of mind are immaterial to the discussion .
Here 's what Mr. Dershowitz told CNN in 2003 : " If torture is going to be administered as a last resort in the ticking - bomb case , to save enormous numbers of lives , it ought to be done openly , with accountability , with approval by the president of the United States or by a Supreme Court justice . "
He went on to advocate the use of " torture warrants " that put " a heavy burden on the government to demonstrate by factual evidence the necessity to administer this horrible , horrible technique of torture . "
Were these just slips of the tongue ?
Then let 's look at Mr. Dershowitz 's written words on the subject ( with my commentary in parentheses ) .
He has written :
I am against torture as a normative matter ...
( It 's unclear in which sense he 's using the word " normative . "
If he means he does n't want us to use torture as a normal practice , then he explicitly does not state that he is against torture in exceptional situations .
If he means " normative " to be established in rule and precedent , he contradicts himself later by laying out suggested guidelines for its use . ) ... I would like to see its use minimized .
( Minimized - not eliminated )
I believe that at least moderate forms of nonlethal torture are in fact being used by the United States and some of its allies today .
( But does he oppose this practice ?
He specifically avoids saying so . )
I think that if we ever confronted an actual case of imminent mass terrorism that could be prevented by the infliction of torture , we would use torture ( even lethal torture ) and the public would favor its use ....
( I 'm not sure he 's right .
In any case , matters of ethics , law , and morality are not decided by popularity contest . )
I pose the issue as follows .
If torture is , in fact , being used and / or would , in fact , be used in an actual ticking bomb terrorist case , would it be normatively better or worse to have such torture regulated by some kind of warrant , with accountability , recordkeeping , standards and limitations ?
( In this sentence Dershowitz a ) endorses the fictional " ticking bomb " scenario , b ) introduces the concept of " torture warrants , " and c ) proposes " standards and limitations " for acceptable forms of government torture . )
This is an important debate , and a different one from the old , abstract Benthamite debate over whether torture can ever be justified .
( In other words , that question has been answered in the affirmative : Torture can be justified under the " ticking bomb " scenario . )
It is not so much about the substantive issue of torture as it is about accountability , visibility , and candor in a democracy that is confronting a choice of evils .
( See above .
Torture is sometimes justifiable , and it is incumbent upon our government to define the terms of its use and create legal mechanisms that permit torture to be conducted by the United State . )
It is impossible for any reasoning person to read the above words and come to any conclusion but this one : Mr. Dershowitz believes torture is unpleasant , but that it is useful in certain situations .
He wishes to see it legalized as a form of state practice , but with restraints on its use .
In short , Mr. Dershowitz supports the use of torture in certain circumstances , and is actively advocating for its legalization .
That means that Larisa Alexandrovna was clearly correct in asserting that Mr. Dershowitz supports torture .
Given that Alexandrovna , Dershowitz , and I are members of the Jewish - American community , I 'll grant that she was definitely taking the gloves off by pointing out that torture was a common Nazi practice .
That 's a matter of style , however , and not substance .
Mr. Dershowitz 's rebuttal questions her accuracy , but the fact is clear : Dershowitz is objectively pro-torture .
I do n't know Mr. Dershowitz personally and I do n't bear him any ill will .
If my interpretation of his own words is incorrect , I invite him to clarify and / or retract them - or to explain how I have misinterpreted them .
If he does so in a matter that suggests that he is in fact opposed to torture , I will gladly and publicly withdraw any and all statements to the contrary .
That should address Mr. Dershowitz 's propensity to suggest that any challenge to his stated positions is a personal attack .
I can't speak to Mr. Dershowitz 's other accusations against the Huffington Post , but given his misrepresentation of my positions and those of many others in the past , I would suggest the burden of proof lies with him and not his opponents .

The supernova SN 2006gy is the brightest and most energetic stellar explosion ever recorded , and may be a long - sought new type of explosion .
At top , an artist 's illustration shows how SN 2006gy may have appeared at a close distance .
The bottom left panel is an infrared image by the Lick Observatory of NGC 1260 , the galaxy containing SN 2006gy .
The panel to the right shows Chandra 's X - ray image of the same field of view .
Scientists have detected a stellar explosion that is the brightest and most energetic ever recorded , and which could be the first evidence of a new type of supernova fueled by an antimatter engine .
The " SN 2006gy " explosion occurred in a galaxy 240 million light - years away , called NGC 1260 , and was 100 times more energetic than typical supernovas .
It was detected in September 2006 using ground - based telescopes and NASA 's Chandra X - ray space observatory .
It brightened slowly for 70 days , and at its peak emitted more than 50 billion Suns worth of light - shining 10 times brighter than its host galaxy - before dimming slowly .
Most supernovas reach peak brightness in days to a few weeks .
" Of all exploding stars ever observed , this was the king , " said Alex Filippenko of the University of California , Berkeley , who led ground - based observations of the supernova at Lick Observatory in California and Keck Observatory in Hawaii .
" We were astonished to see how bright it got and how long it lasted . "
NASA has released an image and animation of what the explosion might have looked like .
The finding , presented today at a NASA press conference and detailed in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal , provides evidence for a fundamentally different type of supernova explosion that only occurs with the universe 's most massive stars .
The monster supernova suggests the first stars that illuminated the universe died in explosive lightshows .
" We may have witnessed a modern - day version of how the first generation of the most massive stars ended their lives , " Filippenko said .
Astrophysicists also think the supernova could be a preview of what they will see when a massive star in our own galaxy explodes .
Going out with a bang
Supernovas are stellar swan songs .
They occur when ancient , massive stars do as poet Dylan Thomas advised , that is , to " burn and rage at the close of day , " and " rage , rage against the dying of the light . "
Most supernovas are the result of stars with 8 to 20 times the mass of our Sun collapsing under their own gravity .
Astronomers think something different happened with SN 2006gy , whose star was much bigger - - about 150 solar masses .
Stars this massive are extremely rare : Scientists estimate there are only a dozen or so such stars in the Milky Way 's stellar population of 400 billion .
Supermassive stars are thought to produce so much gamma-ray light at the end of their lives that some of the radiation is converted into matter and antimatter , mostly electrons and positrons .
Antimatter particles have the same mass as ordinary matter but opposite atomic properties such as spin and charge .
Gamma radiation is the energy that prevents the outer layers of a star from collapsing ; once it starts disappearing , the star 's outer layer falls inward , triggering a thermonuclear explosion that destroys the star .
The new findings suggest some of the first stars in the early universe , which were also very massive , went out in spectacular explosions like SN 2006gy , instead of bypassing the supernova stage and collapsing directly into black holes .
" In terms of the effect on the early universe , there 's a huge difference between these two possibilities , " said study leader Nathan Smith , also of UC Berkeley .
" One pollutes the galaxy with large quantities of newly made elements , and the other locks them up forever in a black hole . "
Eta Carinae
Scientists think SN 2006gy could be a sign of things to come in our own galaxy .
Eta Carinae , the most luminous star in our Milky Way , is located some 7,000 light - years away and seems poised to undergo its own explosion at any moment .
" This could happen tomorrow or it could happen 1,000 years from now , " said Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , who was not involved in the research .
Eta Carinae is an unstable star currently radiating about 5 million times more energy than our Sun and is undergoing eruptions on its surface that are similar to what scientists think happened on the star that produced SN 2006gy just before it blew .
Despite its relatively close proximity to us , Eta Carinae 's death is not likely to pose any significant threat to life on Earth , scientists say .
" I think we can sleep quietly tonight for Eta Car not extinguishing life on Earth , " Livio said , " but [ SN 2006gy ] and all the questions it brings about will keep us awake for quite a while . "
In a study that involved teaching monkeys to associate Arabic numerals with their corresponding quantities , German researchers fingered the prefrontal cortex as the part of the mammalian brain that is responsible for relating symbols with abstract concepts .
The finding was surprising to the Andreas Nieder , head of the Primate NeuroCognition Laboratory at the University of Tübingen , and his graduate student Ilka Diester , who figured that the intraparietal sulcus , a lateral region in the rear brain , handled this task .
" In verbally counting humans , the parietal cortex seems to be the key structure for symbolic number representations , " Nieder says , about the study result is published this week in PLoS Biology .
" Damage to certain parts of the parietal lobe in humans can elicit very specific deficits in dealing with numbers . "
Instead , researchers discovered that the semantic associations are made in the prefrontal part of the cortex ( the brain 's central processing area ) , indicating that this region in children and monkeys is involved in the early learning of numeric links — such as that between the numeral 4 with the quantity of four dots — and that the parietal region takes over the job in teens as the associations become more automatic .
In fact , imaging studies of children have shown that their prefrontal areas are heavily engaged when drawing connections between symbols and concepts .
Nieder and Diester trained two rhesus monkeys for their experiment .
First , they taught the animals to discriminate between different quantities by showing them sets of dots and having them pluck out the ones with equal numbers of dots ( from one to four ) on them .
They then spent several months linking each set of dots to different Arabic numerals .
Following the lessons , the researchers gave the monkeys performance tests during which they were trained to pull a lever when a numeral and its matching number of dots appeared before them .
The monkeys made the correct association nearly 90 percent of the time .
As the animals mulled their options , researchers scanned 692 randomly selected neurons in the prefrontal cortex and 437 nerve cells in the parietal cortex .
The researchers found that 23 percent of the prefrontal neurons showed increased activity during the task , but only 2 percent of the parietal neurons responded .
In addition , groups of neurons in the prefrontal cortex appeared to be tuned to certain amounts , with subsets of the cells responding to specific numerals or quantities : some to 1 , others to 2 ( and so on ) .
In addition , if a monkey was about to make an incorrect decision , Nieder notes , the researchers observed a very different pattern of activity in the prefrontal neurons than what appeared when they were correct .
Jamie Roitman , a research assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago , says the new study clears up an unanswered question in numerical cognition : whether there are two steps in naming a numerical value .
Previously , it was believed that the brain first learned to summate a quantity of beads or dots or dogs , etcetera , and that higher quantities would be met with greater activity in neurons .
Then , a second set of neurons ( in the parietal cortex ) would determine the corresponding cardinal value — 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and so on .
" [ The new study ] finds that neurons in [ the ] prefrontal cortex respond similarly when viewing a stimulus of four dots or the symbol ' 4 , ' as if these neurons are able to map the symbol onto the cardinal value , " she says .
" It suggests that this kind of association between symbols and what they represent may occur in the activity of prefrontal neurons . "
Nieder believes the work can be applied to humans .
" Humans learn to use symbols as mental tools during childhood ; prior to the utilization of signs as symbols , long - term associations between initially meaningless shapes and semantic categories must inevitably be established , " he says , noting that animals are capable of making rudimentary associations , as shown in this study .
" In animal models , we have a chance to learn about the cellular mechanisms underlying such cognitively demanding tasks . "
USA Today had a good item about Rep. Henry Waxman , the California Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
As the article explained , Waxman wields the gavel very effectively , using the committee ’s oversight powers as a successful watchdog should .
And then there ’s Waxman ’s Senate counterpart : Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , chairman of the same committee , who apparently does n’t care about doing his job at all .
Subscription - only Roll Call had this depressing report today :
Though the two committees have similar investigative powers and mandates to uncover waste , fraud and abuse of government funds , Waxman has held eight hearings on Iraq and contracting abuses this year , while Lieberman has held only one on reconstruction challenges in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
And though Waxman rarely has missed an opportunity to fire off angry letters to the administration over potential waste , fraud , abuse and misconduct among government contractors , Lieberman — along with his predecessor and current ranking member , Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) — has shown relatively little interest in tackling those issues .
And what of all the contracting abuses that Waxman is scrutinizing ?
Lieberman said he gets “ angry when I hear about fraud or corruption in the spending of American dollars , ” but it ’s not one of his “ priorities . ”
A year ago , seeking re-election , Lieberman said this committee was his top priority , and he was desperate to return to the Senate so he could wield the gavel .
And now that he has the authority he sought , he ’s decided not to conduct any real oversight of the administration at all .
He seems to have desperately sought a chairman ’s gavel just for the sake of having it — Lieberman wanted power he had no intention of using .
Instead of a Senate Committee on Government Affairs that functions as it should , Lieberman just treads water , using his gavel as a flotation device .
It ’s an embarrassing waste .
Pfizer Inc.'s decision to shelve a novel insulin inhaler and take a $ 2.8 billion pretax hit on the product -- one of the drug industry 's costliest failures ever -- rids the company of an albatross .
But it suggests the risks Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler and other industry executives face as they steer makers of traditional pills more deeply into biotechnology drugs .

CNN : Giuliani campaigning on record as ' Mr. 9/11 ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 11 , 2007 Print This Email
This CNN's John Roberts announced a new political series on Monday , saying that each week " we 'll tell you about a defining moment for one of the presidential candidates . "
The first installment in the series concerned Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 .
After playing a clip of Giuliani insisting , " this war is not a bumper sticker , " and pointing out that he has based his entire campaign on his ability to fight terrorism , CNN turned to political reporter Dominic Carter , who covered Giuliani when he was mayor .
" Terrorism was not so much on his radar screen , " said Carter of Giuliani .
" He was more of a law and order mayor . "
Carter praised Giuliani's leadership after the 9/11 attack , but questioned his judgment leading up to it , mentioning the controversial siting of Giuliani 's emergency management center at World Trade Center Building 7 and " the issue of the radios between the police and fire department , " which was a factor leading to the deaths of 342 firefighters when the towers collapsed .
The country 's largest firefighter union is now leading an anti-Giuliani campaign .
Giuliani has also recently come under heated criticism for ignoring toxic air pollutants in pressing for a rapid cleanup of the World Trade Center site after 9/11 , CNN concluded with former FBI director Louis Freeh -- who worked as a prosecutor in the 80's under then - US Attorney Giuliani and is now a member of Giuliani 's campaign team -- calling Giuliani " the best and the brightest . "
That phrase , which Freeh used with no apparent sense of irony , comes from the title of a 1972 book by David Halberstam , which detailed the disastrous decisions by seemingly brilliant advisers to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations that led the US into a quagmire in Vietnam .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on June 11 .
Neuroscientists have significantly advanced brain - machine interface ( BMI ) technology to the point where severely handicapped people who cannot contract even one leg or arm muscle now can independently compose and send e-mails and operate a TV in their homes .
They are using only their thoughts to execute these actions .
Thanks to the rapid pace of research on the BMI , one day these and other individuals may be able to feed themselves with a robotic arm and hand that moves according to their mental commands .
“ Our work has shown how important the learning process is when using brain - controlled devices , ” says Andrew Schwartz , PhD , of the University of Pittsburgh .
“ By permitting the subject to adaptively recode the generated neural activity , the overall performance of the device is dramatically increased .
“ Furthermore , as we have progressed in this work , it has become apparent that the basic idea of ‘ intention ’ during learning is very important and can be addressed by the direct observation of the neuronal transformations taking place during this fundamental processing , ” Schwartz says .
Among the research institutions conducting cutting - edge research on the BMI is the University of Pittsburgh , where scientists recently succeeded in developing the technology that allows a rhesus macaque monkey to mentally control a robotic arm to feed itself pieces of fruit .
The robotic arm ’s fast and smooth movements were triggered by electrical signals that were generated in the monkey ’s brain when the animal thought about an action .
In previous studies , this lab developed the technology to tap a macaque monkey ’s motor cortical neural activity making it possible for the animal to use its thoughts to control a robotic arm to reach for food targets presented in 3D space .
In the Pittsburgh lab ’s latest studies , macaque monkeys not only mentally guided a robotic arm to pieces of food but also opened and closed the robotic arm ’s hand , or gripper , to retrieve them .
Just by thinking about picking up and bringing the fruit to its mouth , the animal fed itself .
The monkey ’s own arm and hand did not move while it manipulated the two - finger gripper at the end of the robotic arm .
The animal used its own sight for feedback about the accuracy of the robotic arm ’s actions as it mentally moved the gripper to within one - half centimeter of a piece of fruit .
“ The monkey developed a great deal of skill using this physical device , ” says Meel Velliste , PhD .
“ We are in the process of extending this type of control to a more sophisticated wrist and hand for the performance of dexterous tasks . ”
Velliste and the other members of the Pittsburgh research team point out that imparting skill and dexterity to these devices will help amputees and paralyzed patients to perform everyday tasks .
The animal ’s thoughts emitted electrical signals that were recorded by tiny electrodes that the scientists had implanted in the monkey ’s motor cortex .
A computer - decoding algorithm translated the signals into the robotic arm and gripper ’s movements .
In another study , a Washington University School of Medicine research team has generated new information about a long - held theory about the separate functions and responsibilities of the left brain and the right brain .
In the process , the researchers , led by Eric Leuthardt , PhD , and his graduate students Kimberly Wisneski and Nick Anderson , have applied their findings to a new neuroprosthetic strategy to improve the rehabilitation of stroke and trauma victims who have suffered damage to either the right or left half of the brain .
“ Classic understanding of brain function has asserted that one hemisphere , or one side of the brain , controls arm and leg movement on the opposite side of the body , ” Wisneski explains .
The team ’s new findings indicated that if the left hemisphere were damaged , the right side of the brain still had electrical signals that could be used to trigger right - sided arm and leg movement .
The scientists recorded the brain activity of six epilepsy patients in which electrodes were placed over the surface of their brain for reasons that were not connected to the purpose of the study .
( The intracranial electrode arrays were implanted on the surface of each patient ’s brain to locate the brain areas that were involved with the patient ’s seizures . )
“ This access provided us with insights that could not be obtained using other methods , ” Leuthardt says .
The team recorded electrocorticographic signals while each patient opened and closed his or her hands .
These recordings revealed brain activity in the hemisphere on the same side of the body in which movement was occurring .
These same - side signals occurred at a lower frequency than did the signals emitted in the hemisphere opposite to the moving side of the body .
In addition , these same - side signals were emitted in spatially distinct areas of the brain and earlier in time in comparison to the hemispheric signals recorded for opposite - side hand movement .
“ This evidence demonstrates that the brain encodes information regarding planning for movements of the same - sided limb and that this information is encoded in a way that is unique from that corresponding to opposite - side limb movements , ” Wisneski says .
The team next determined how these results could be used to improve the rehabilitation of stroke and brain injury patients .
Their focus : the brain computer interface ( BCI ) , an external device that was designed to benefit patients with spinal cord injury and other disorders that did not affect the brain .
The BCI enables individuals to control with their thoughts alone a cursor on a computer screen , a wheelchair , or a robotic arm .
To benefit stroke and brain injury patients , the BCI would have to be adapted to respond to signals from only one side of the brain .
“ To allow these patients to benefit from the use of a brain - computer interface , signals for control for two sides of the body must be acquired from the single functioning hemisphere alone , ” Leuthardt says .
“ In this paradigm , one side of the body — the side opposite to the unaffected half of the brain — would be controlled through normal physiologic pathways , and the other side of the body — the side affected by the stroke and on the same side as the unaffected hemisphere — would be controlled through neuroprosthetic assistance using same - side signals from the undamaged hemisphere . ”
Other scientists are studying the phenomenon in which neurons are active in the brain ’s motor cortex , not only when an individual bends a leg but also when he or she observes other people while moving their legs .
This neural mechanism may help explain the development of innate skills such as speech and new motor skills such as a golf swing .
Graduate student Dennis Tkach and colleagues at University of Chicago hope to tap this neural mechanism to modify BMI systems for use by people who are paralyzed from spinal cord injury or related trauma .
Currently the BMI ’s functioning depends on mathematical maps that connect brain cell activity to the action — arm or leg movement , for example — that the system is designed to replace .
Tkach says that the phenomenon of congruent neural activity may provide the mathematical maps of these paralyzed patients .
“ The existence of these neurons offers the means of creating this mapping by relating neural activity of the patient to an action observed by that patient , ” he says .
“ The neural activity is congruent because the way that the neurons fire during observation of familiar action is the same as the way they fire when the individual is performing that same action . ”
The University of Chicago study , which was conducted with rhesus monkeys , was the first to analyze a neural system that showed congruent activity with movement on a single cell level in the primary motor cortex .
The monkeys were trained to perform a video task in a two - dimensional , horizontal workspace located in front of them .
They guided a circular cursor to a square target .
Both the cursor and the target were projected onto the workspace .
The animals controlled the cursor by moving an exoskeletal robot arm in which their active arm rested .
They were then trained to relax and watch a playback of the task they had just performed .
During the playback , the monkeys saw either or both the target and the cursor on the screen .
“ We varied visibility of the video task components in an attempt to gain a better understanding of what facilitates the neural congruency between observation and action , ” Tkach says .
“ The study showed that the presence of the goal of an action bears a greater impact on the strength of this congruence , while the observation of the motion to this goal carries minimal importance . ”
This result emphasized the importance of the goal as the facilitator of this action - like neural response , Tkach says .
The brain cell activity patterns were recorded from arrays of 100 electrodes surgically implanted in the monkeys ’ motor cortical areas .
Because of these arrays , Tkach was able to obtain simultaneous neural activity data from a population of single cells along with a more global neural signal .
Analyzing the data , he noted that the activity patterns of the neurons during the observation period correlated highly with the cells ’ activity patterns when the animal was using its right arm to guide the cursor .
“ Our results lead us to believe that when presented with the observation of a familiar action the monkeys inadvertently generate a motor command that is very similar to one that would occur if the animal were to execute the behavior , ” Tkach says .
The congruence of this motor command to the “ actual ” one was not an all - or - nothing phenomenon but instead spanned a continuum that was contingent upon the components of the observed action that was present .
In other work , Wadsworth Center scientists in Albany , N.Y. , have succeeded in developing a BCI that provided people who are severely disabled with the ability to use their personal computers .
For example , they were able to word - process , send e-mail messages , and remotely turn on or off the lights or TV in their homes .
In the future , even more environmental control options will be available , says Eric Sellers , PhD .
The Wadsworth Center BCI system enabled a scientist with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , to communicate by e-mail with his research team .
“ It has allowed him to continue to direct a highly successful NIH - funded medical research program , ” Sellers says .
“ The initial results indicate that the BCI can function without close technical oversight and can improve communication ability and quality of life .
This initial success suggests that a home BCI system can be of practical value for people with severe motor disabilities and that caregivers without special expertise can learn to support it . ”
Five severely disabled people have participated in the Wadsworth research program that evaluates the center ’s BCI system .
The first participant , the 49 - year - old scientist with ALS , has been unable to move any muscles in his body except for his eyes .
For up to five to seven hours every day since February 2006 , he has worn a simple electrode cap on his scalp that picks up the electrical activity generated by his brain .
The cap recorded electroencephalographic ( EEG , or brain wave ) activity at eight scalp locations .
The user ’s brain waves were translated into simulated keystrokes .
Software developed at Wadsworth presented rows and columns of a 72 - element , 8 ″ x 9 ″ matrix that flashed in random order while the user paid attention to the element that he or she wanted to select .
The software recognized that element and executed the appropriate keystroke .
With this design , the patient could use the entire keyboard .
Sellers says that caregivers and family members learned to place the electrode cap on patients ’ scalps , enable the software , and generally maintain the system , which the researchers monitored remotely via data transferred weekly from patients ’ homes to the lab .
To date , a total of five people with ALS have used the Wadsworth system in their homes .
In addition , the Wadsworth Center team has tested protocols in the laboratory that extend BCI functionality to benefit people with limited eye mobility , poor visual acuity , or difficulty maintaining gaze , impairments that can occur with severe motor disorders such as ALS , brainstem stroke , or cerebral palsy .
For these individuals , the scientists have been developing a BCI system that uses auditory rather than visual stimuli .
In the auditory BCI system , the rows and columns of a 6 ″ x 6 ″ matrix of 36 letters and numbers are represented by six environmental sounds .
For each selection , the user paid attention to the sound representing the column or row containing the desired choice .
Thus far , most of the people who tested this auditory system in the lab used it with accuracy sufficient to support effective BCI operation .
The researchers also have been developing a BCI system that uses sensorimotor rhythms ( SMRs ) , oscillations in the EEG recorded from the scalp over the sensorimotor cortex .
The SMRs provided simple communication capabilities , and the people learned to use SMRs to control a computer cursor in one or two dimensions .

Outrage fatigue ?
Get over it /
Are you sick of being sick ?
Suffering way too much Bush - induced nausea ?
Well , tough
I know how it is .
You 've had it up to here .
There are only so many stories about blood and death and pain you can take , only so many times you can hear about random shootings and corporate malfeasance and how BushCo 's squad of scabrous flying monkeys have , say , supported torture or endorsed wiretapping or gouged the nation for another $ 200 billion to pay for a failed war .
Your nerves are raw and your heart is tired and the media will just not shut the hell up already about the sadness and the war and the mayhem and the Cheney and the doom doom doom .
It is outrage fatigue , and it is epidemic .
It 's that feeling that we are being hammered unlike any time in recent history with so many appalling and disgusting and violently un-American incidents and scandals and manipulations that our b.s.- detectors are smoking like an old V - 8 engine on a hot summer 's day and it's all we can do to get up every day without screaming .
What 's more , it 's not the mere quantity of moral insults , either .
It 's the bizarre absurdity of the subject matter , the things we are being forced to consider , or reconsider , that seem to make it all so horrific .
Torture ?
Are you kidding ?
Allegedly the most civilized , the most morally aware nation on the planet and we are still debating , in the highest courts and government offices in the land , about whether the United States should strap human beings to gnarled metal benches in rancid foreign bunkers and inflict such inexplicable terror and fear upon them that they confess to things they did n't even do just to get us to stop ?
Is this the Middle Ages ?
Are we regressing back to the goddamn cave ?
Oh my , yes , plethoric are the reasons you should be outraged indeed , and torture just might be one of the most incendiary reasons in the past few years .
If nothing else , its disgusting return to U.S. political dialogue certainly means it 's no time to be laying down arms in exhaustion , no matter how tempting it might be .
Take this fine example : Keith Olbermann , as is his wont , executed another pitch - perfect bout of outrage recently on his excellent MSNBC show , taking BushCo to task on the issue of waterboarding like you never hear in major on - air media anymore .
Olbermann only barely held on to his trademark fierce hyper-articulation against the sheer disgust he / we have to endure at the idea that a sitting American president obviously thinks medieval torture is a gul - dang swell idea , no matter what psychologists , military experts , ethicists , the United Nations , the Geneva Convention and Jesus himself all say .
It was wonderful , powerful stuff , a razor - sharp , highly informed media pundit who dares to presume an unusually high level of intelligence among his viewers , speaking truth to power in a way most liberal media - haters complain never really happens anymore .
And of course , his subject was one of the most deserving of our moral outrage in recent history .
But then I read some of the reaction to Olbermann 's diatribe on various political blogs and on some news - aggregate sites , with many saying , gosh Keith , lighten up already , who cares , enough with all the outrage and the spittle , wow I 'm so sick of all this ranting and raving and gosh I 'm tired of these smarty media people telling me how to think and hey maybe torture is good let 's kill us some more , haw haw haw snort .
On the one hand , it is , you can argue , generally the way of the meaner - than - thou blogosphere , with all but the most professional and intelligent and positive - minded of outposts seeming to suffer an undue percentage of reactionary chyme in their comment areas , hordes of Net - drunk twentysomethings and extremists and shut - ins who have way too much free time and merely chime in to see their sneers " published " and to prove how much more jaded and apathetic they are than the next person , while adding zero to the conversation .
But maybe it 's worse than that .
Because this is where it can happen , where you can get sucked into the vortex of whining and bitterness and where you might feel part of yourself wanting to wallow too , desiring to avoid doing the actual moral and spiritual work of dissecting and researching and analysing something as politically messy and morally ugly as torture for yourself , opting instead for the easy path , for closing your eyes and sticking your fingers in your ears and going , nyah nyah nyah shut up shut up SHUT UP !
Hey , it sure beats thinking .
Or maybe we can flip it around .
Maybe , with the right intent , the exact reverse can happen , and you see this ocean of nasty ennui , this pile of oft - misspelled , poorly punctuated reactionary effluvia as , in and of itself , something to be a bit livid about .
Maybe , in other words , you can enjoy , as one blogger put it , a big dose of " fatigue outrage , " the feeling of disgust you get when faced with all those people who think mental lethargy and laziness is , like , way funny , dude .
In other words , enough with the childish , frat - boy - grade complaints about media overload and too many rants and outrage fatigue .
You have to earn that sort of thing .
If you never give a crap about engaging the world , if you never want to think deeply about complex issues and care about ramifications and see what truly resonates with your own informed spirit and then stand up for what you believe , this pretty much eliminates your right to sneer at others who do .
It is , for me , all about modulation .
It is about remembering that outrage does not necessarily equal misery .
Outrage does not mean you must wallow in fear and fatalism and yank out your hair and wake up every morning hating the world and hating yourself and hating humanity for being so stupid / numb / blind and wondering how the hell you can escape it all .
Outrage is rich with humanistic understanding .
It is not some evangelical Christian parent " outraged " that her kid saw a woman 's nipple on TV .
It is not some right - wing Family Council " outraged " that someone put S&M outfits on Barbie , or that some art gallery is displaying Jesus as a woman , or that scientists dared to say that stem cell research does not equal abortion , or that the mayor is n't taking care of all the potholes and stray kitties .
That 's not outrage , that 's reactionary whining .
True outrage , like Olbermann's , like ( occasionally , hopefully ) this column's , like what you should ideally be experiencing on a daily basis while Bush is in office , is honed and sharp and poignant .
It contains a powerful sense of deeply informed decency , and therefore has a true feel for when that sense has been violated .
Outrage has meat and substance and intellectual nourishment .
It is actually healthy .
Smart , informed outrage engages you and fires your heart , your mind .
It is fuel .
It is the reason you claim you enjoy being an American , to question malevolent government actions and take a stand and demand accountability where there has , for the past seven years , been none .
Bottom line :
We simply cannot let them convince us , by way of an all - out assault on science , sex , love , et al , that the good fight just ain't worth fighting .
After all , the flying monkeys are far from done raiding the closet and stealing your babies and making a mockery of everything wise and calm and open - hearted people hold dear .
And baby , if you ain't outraged about that , something is very wrong indeed .

Burmese embassies across Asia have been targeted by protesters angered by events in the military - run country .
Thousands gathered in the capitals of Thailand , Malaysia , the Philippines , Taiwan and Australia among others on Friday .
They are protesting over the Burmese military 's bloody crackdown on recent anti-government protests , that left at least nine people dead on Thursday .
Many fear a repeat of 1988 , when the regime brutally suppressed the last popular uprising , killing around 3,000 people .
The crackdown on monks , who have led the protests , has outraged many .
This Filipino man 's head is shaved beside a poster of Burmese leader Than Shwe .
Workers at the foreign ministry in Indonesia tied red bands around each other 's arms before holding a silent protest .
This protest in the centre of Kuala Lumpur was watched by a man from inside the Burmese embassy .
Many protesters carried pictures of Aung San Suu Kyi , who has become a symbol of resistance in Burma .
Posters of Than Shwe were attacked by protesters in the Philippines .

What are these ?
Right !
So here 's the deal , yeah ?
You 're stranded on this 404 island because whatever you 're looking for is n't here anymore .
I suggest looking for it — whatever the hell it bloody is — by examining your daddy issues instead .
Or maybe just use the search box to the left .
A comment by Thomas Geis on my first RubyBeans post lead me to another rework of the RubyBeans metaprogramming example .
Thomas accurately points out :
I think the property should sit in a proxy - object , that does inform the listeners of its change .
In your example , one could directly change the properties value from within the class without a call to the property_changed method .
This would be a concern for me .
Is n’t it a concern for you ?
Yes it is !
I tried the proxy - object solution , but I am not satisfied with it for two reasons : the code get lengthy and inelegant , but mostly because the proxy - objects themselves are n’t protected from direct access .
I believe I have a nicer solution to protect the properties from direct access : closures .
The first few lines of code remain unchanged :
class RubyBean def initialize @listeners = [ ] end def register_listener ( l ) @listeners .
push ( l ) unless @listeners .
include ? ( l ) end def unregister_listener ( l ) @listeners .
delete ( l ) end
Now , observe how value is captured in the getter and setter blocks .
The scope of the value local variable is the local block and the blocks passed in define_method .
These blocks “ close over ” the value local variable .
def self .
property (* properties ) properties .
each do | p | value = nil define_method ( p ) { return value } define_method ( " #{p}= " ) do | new_value | return if value == new_value @listeners .
each do | l | l .
property_changed ( p , value , new_value ) end value = new_value end end end end
Finally , here is an example of how RubyBeans would be used ( were they not a Java idiom shamelessly ported for illustration purposes ) .
The impotent_name= method cannot affect the name property , it will create a name instance variable , unrelated to the property .
class SimpleBean < RubyBean property : name , : firstname def impotent_name =( new_name ) @name = new_name end end class LoggingProperty ChangeListener def property_changed ( property , old_value , new_value ) print property , " changed from " , old_value , " to " , new_value , "
" end end test = SimpleBean .
new listener = LoggingPropertyChangeListener .
new test .
register_listener ( listener ) test .
name = " Parker " test .
firstname = " Charlie " test .
firstname = " Maceo " test .
unregister_listener ( listener )
Let me know if you spot something else !

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military is sending 3,000 soldiers home from Diyala province , the second large unit to leave Iraq as troop levels are cut after a 30,000 - strong “ surge ” earlier this year .
U.S. soldiers walk through dust in front of their base after a patrol in Baquba June 26 , 2007 .
The U.S. military is sending 3,000 soldiers home from Diyala province , the second large unit to leave Iraq as troop levels are cut after a 30,000 - strong " surge " .
REUTERS / Goran Tomasevic
Soldiers from the 3rd Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division , will not be replaced by a new unit when they leave the ethnically and religiously mixed province north of Baghdad by January , military officials said on Tuesday .
Instead , troops from the larger 4th Striker Brigade Combat Team , 2nd Infantry Division , located near Baghdad , will take over the area , said military spokeswoman Major Peggy Kageleiry .
“ Most of the ( brigade ) will be home by Christmas and indeed a few people have left , ” Kageleiry said .
About 2,200 Marines from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit left western Anbar province in late September under President George W. Bush ’s plan to cut troop levels in Iraq .
Bush poured in an extra 30,000 troops from mid-February in a bid to stop Iraq spiraling into sectarian civil war .
There are around 162,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq , the Pentagon said .
U.S. and Iraqi officials say the troop “ surge ” , more efficient Iraqi security forces and the use of neighborhood patrols have helped bring about sharp falls in U.S. military and Iraqi civilian casualties in the past two months .
Kageleiry said the overall number of troops in Diyala , where violence spiked when al Qaeda fighters were driven out of western Anbar province earlier this year , would not decrease .
With the daily toll of suicide bombs , sectarian killings and other violence slowing , General David Petraeus , the U.S. commander in Iraq , plans to pull out five of his 20 brigades in Iraq by July 2008 .
“ The security situation in northern Iraq has improved exponentially , ” Kageleiry said .
“ The ultimate goal is to transition Iraqi security forces to be able to provide security to citizens of Diyala independent of coalition forces . ”
Mortar and rocket attacks dropped to their lowest level in October since February 2006 .
In Baghdad , Iraqi military officials plan to reopen some streets and hope to end a joint U.S. - Iraqi security operation in Baghdad soon .
Despite the security improvements , 2007 has been the deadliest year for U.S. soldiers since the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein , with 857 killed so far .
The U.S. military says drawdowns in troops will occur only where security conditions allow .
Other areas in northern Iraq such as Mosul , Iraq ’s third largest city , often suffers fierce fighting between security forces and al Qaeda .
The troop surge and improved security were meant to pave the way for political progress on legislative benchmarks designed to promote national reconciliation , but progress has been slow .
Today ’s New York Times reports on the fairly ambitious surveillance plans that authorities have forÂ downtown Manhattan :
By the end of this year , police officials say , more than 100 cameras will have begun monitoring cars moving through Lower Manhattan , the beginning phase of a London - style surveillance system that would be the first in the United States .
The Lower Manhattan Security Initiative , as the plan is called , will resemble Londonâ€™s so - called Ring of Steel , an extensive web of cameras and roadblocks designed to detect , track and deter terrorists .
British officials said images captured by the cameras helped track suspects after the London subway bombings in 2005 and the car bomb plots last month .
If the program is fully financed , it will include not only license plate readers but also 3,000 public and private security cameras below Canal Street , as well as a center staffed by the police and private security officers , and movable roadblocks .
(…)
The license plate readers would check the platesâ€™ numbers and send out alerts if suspect vehicles were detected .
The city is already seeking state approval to charge drivers a fee to enter Manhattan below 86th Street , which would require the use of license plate readers .
If the plan is approved , the police will most likely collect information from those readers too , Mr. Kelly said .
But the downtown security plan involves much more than keeping track of license plates .
Three thousand surveillance cameras would be installed below Canal Street by the end of 2008 , about two - thirds of them owned by downtown companies .
Some of those are already in place .
Pivoting gates would be installed at critical intersections ; they would swing out to block traffic or a suspect car at the push of a button .
Unlike the 250 or so cameras the police have already placed in high - crime areas throughout the city , which capture moving images that have to be downloaded , the security initiative cameras would transmit live information instantly .

Democratic legislators have introduced a bill that will tie university financial aid funding to universities imposing stiff penalties for file - sharing , and to universities subsidizing student subscriptions to failed DRM - based systems like Napster and Ruckus .
This is about as ugly as pork - barrel politics can get : politicians are so in debt to four of five ailing giants from the entertainment industry that they 're prepared to deny low - income children access to a college education if universities do n't punish kids for listening to music and piss away money on a useless service that no one wants to use .
The congressmen behind this are Reps. George Miller from California and Ruben Hinojosa of Texas and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
These three men are proposing to make colleges into a subsidy system for the MAFIAA .
Remember those names come election time — and if you live in their districts , call them today .
The U.S. House of Representatives bill ( PDF ) , which was introduced late Friday by top Democratic politicians , could give the movie and music industries a new revenue stream by pressuring schools into signing up for monthly subscription services such as Ruckus and Napster .
Ruckus is advertising - supported , and Napster charges a monthly fee per student .
The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) applauded the proposal , which is embedded in a 747 - page spending and financial aid bill .
" We very much support the language in the bill , which requires universities to provide evidence that they have a plan for implementing a technology to address illegal file sharing , " said Angela Martinez , a spokeswoman for the MPAA .

Many who are new to networking and security wonder what it means to have “ ports ” open on your computer .
Some get rather anxious when an online port scan reveals that something ’s open on their system .
What follows is a silly , but hopefully memorable way for beginners to remember how network ports work .
Houses , Windows , and Midgets
Imagine a house with many , many windows .
And imagine that all these windows are spring - loaded so they slam shut when they are n’t being actively held open .
Also within the house are a number of midgets .
Each one is able to talk to people outside the house temporarily , but only through an open window .
Well , ports on a computer are the windows on the house , and the applications running on your computer are the midgets .
And just like our spring - loaded windows , ports are always closed by default .
The second an application stops holding one open , it closes .
So when you find open ports on your system , do n’t worry about the port itself .
It ca n’t stay open without help .
Instead , focus on the reason it ’s open , i.e. the application that ’s keeping it that way .
For that task you can use a program from Foundstone called Fport .
It ’ll give you the name of the program so you can find it and shut it down .
Once you ’ve shut down the program the port will be closed again . ::
Heres my new take on The Last Supper , this time attempting to stay as faithful as possible to Leonardo Da Vincis original :
Hundreds of years of deterioration and poorly executed restorations  have left it uncertain exactly how the original once looked , so I ended up basing my version most closely on an early 1800s life - size mosaic copy from the Church of the Minorites in Vienna :
Below is the current state of the Da Vinci original after its most recent modern restoration in 1989 :
I was prompted to take another go at The Last Supper this week when I was interviewed about The Brick Testament by my local paper .
In addition to running several sample images from the Brick Testament website , they also wanted to get a photo of me posing with a MOC from The Brick Testament in hand .
My old version of The Last Supper immediately came to mind , since its iconic , relatively portable , and one of the few scenes from The Brick Testament that Ive kept intact over the years .
But Id just recently sold it as an artwork to someone who had seen it at the art gallery in Bratislava , Slovakia I was invited to last Spring .
So I began working on a new replacement  Last Supper .
But since this was going to be a stand - alone piece , I did not feel constrained to have the scene necessarily match the version in my Last Supper story from The Brick Testament .
That version was , of course , inspired by Da Vincis version , but it was by no means an exact replica done in LEGO .
I decided to keep the face of Jesus the same as it appears in The Brick Testament , but everything else I was willing to change to match the Da Vinci version .
This meant new faces and outfits for the disciples ; tile floors and a new table design ; and perhaps the most noticeable change is the trapezoid shape of the room to mimic the perspective of the Da Vinci version .
Heres the photo as it appeared in the article :
Im pretty happy with this new third version of The Last Supper .
I still see room for improvements , though .
I still havent tried adding in a ceiling ( which would make it much harder to properly light the scene ) , and the perspective still doesnt truly match the original ( maybe a different camera lens would help ? ) .
And finally , though I did try to have the disciples match the poses of the Da Vinci version , its pretty impossible to get their arms into positions that match the original .
Unless I resort to flex tubing and other trickery .
Hmmm ...
Unfortunately , its my comparatively crude first version that has achieved the most notoriety to date ( being the version seen in Time magazine , on Wikipedia , and passed around on many blogs and forums ) .
But what can you do ?

THE SURGE ….
Is the surge working ?
That is , even if you ignore the lack of political progress , are we even making tactical progress ?
Since violence in Iraq tends to be seasonal , the only reasonable comparison is one between summer 2006 and summer 2007 , so I went to the latest Brookings Iraq Index to check out the most recent numbers .
No figures are available for August , and the surge was n’t completely up and running until June , so the best comparison is between June / July 2006 and June / July 2007 .
I ’m not pretending this is conclusive or anything , but the news sure does n’t look very good .
The two tables below tell the story .

I must say that my appreciation for this type of shot has grown exponentially over the years ( I'm a bird lover from way back ) .
I only gave this a 6 in my naivete of the expertise it took to capture something so graceful .
Today , it would have easily garnered a 10 .
I 'm very sorry to hear of demise ; however , I 'm sure that he has been appreciated the world over because of your essentially flawless capture .
Congratulations on your achievement ( and his ) - I hope that it is some comfort in your grief .
[ 213 favorites is certainly nothing to sneeze at ! ]
He 'll live on through your love for both the subject and photography .
Thank you for the privilege of sharing him with us .

I cannot express in words the feelings I felt when I first looked at this photograph .
And the second time I looked .
And the third .
Spectacular Mr. Simon !
I am an amateur wildlife / nature photographer -- with an obsession for photographing birds -- and take some excellent photos with my Leica .
However , my editing skills on the computer are poor and I have not yet even mastered my camera .
I spend much time on each photograph and am never satisfied .
I am using PSP XI - - probably too amateur for the work you accomplish .
I do own Photoshop but have much difficulty with the program .
So frustating .
Congratulations !

Lowell ,
Computers , within the rules of this website at least , cannot alter composition save by cropping .
The balance , poise and urgency of this image are very much real , and I believe are the reason this obtained a well deserved average of over 8 .
To avoid taking this shot or press the delete button would have been greater affronts to photography , not reducing unavoidable noise and background disturbances .
If a " great image with terrfic impact " posted on a digital photography website with strict editing rules leaves you " kind of sick to [ your ] stomach " , may I suggest that you 're in the wrong place .

wow very sharp good catch man
Photographer found comment helpful .
Lowell - I agree that digital editing is sometimes very disappointing when it 's abused .
However , in defence of this particular shot it was one ( as acknowledged above ) which was a victim of very poor light .
This photo is all about the subject , his stance and character .
This was the basis of my shot and the element which I wished to capture above all else .
In this instance , despite an equally purist stance on most editing ( which helps me take better pictures ) , I accepted that the out - of - camera shot would need my help in post - processing to achieve my vision .

No problem Digitalknight - the original is here for anyone who is interested in seeing the out - of - camera shot .
I could have used fill - flash for subject like this , but it would have destroyed the subtlety of the light .
On checking the histogram I knew that I had all the data I needed , but it just needed to be brought out with some help in post - processing .
Do you dare show the original ? :p
It 's a beautiful photo , well done .

Thanks again for some kind words - and spending the time to view and consider the photo .
- Peterish , the shot was softly backlit with natural light and there was a lot of shadow on his front side .
All I have done is lift some of that gloom with curves and levels .
I also deepened the background ( which was linear plank panels ) to knock them right back and leave him to loom out of the darkness .
That is how I wanted him to look - and how it felt at the time .
Wow , what a captivating photo ... that bird scares me .
The textures and reflections on the wing feathers look almost surreal ; how did you make it like that ?
Photographer found comment helpful .
I was so tempted to try to turn this image into an animated gif ... it's head just felt like it was moving and nodding .

I can't believe that I did n't comment on this during the voting , I probably took it for granted that I already did since I gave it a 10 .
This is excellent !
Good work at capturing the soul of such a creature .
You somehow made an eerie icon look beautiful !
The detail , the lighting , the composition ... everything is superb !
Congrats on the blue .

That background was what disturbed me , I think , looking at it - and I was convinced this had to be a stuffed bird - surely , I thought , in this kind of light , you just could n't get this detail on this bird without really being some kind of monster - full time wildlife photographer .
Really outstanding .

Apple " walk of shame "
Following a week of waiting for Apple to arrange for the pickup of a malfunctioning iMac G5 , a Dublin says he has decided to prove that he can walk to Cork -- the location of the nearest Apple repair center -- faster than Apple can arrange for the pickup of his broken Mac .
" I think there comes a time when the only thing that works with these companies is to show them up publicly and shame them into taking you seriously , " said Karl Hayden , who is frustrated after repeated efforts to resolve the issue with Apple customer care .
Hayden says his 10 - month - old iMac crashed on the 14th of July , after which he received two replacement logic boards , a power supply unit , and a back casing which failed to fix the problem .
The Dublin man claims Apple finally agreed to replace the computer on August 14th following a long phone conversation , but has failed to pickup the old system prior to shipping his new iMac .
Hayden has decided to " shame " Apple by setting out next Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. local time from his Charlemount Street home in Dublin on foot carrying his iMac G5 back to Apple in Cork to prove that he can deliver the computer faster on foot than the company can arrange to have it picked up .
" [ Apple is ] only interested in how negative publicity affects [ its ] sales and share price .
Apple only seems to respond to customer concerns when direct action is taken to highlight [ its ] failings . "
Hayden also said that he previously waited nine weeks for repairs to another Mac which was lost three times in Apple 's service system , but was recovered and repaired in the end -- with a bill attached for the repair work .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla .
–Free of his wheelchair and tethered only to heart rate and blood pressure monitors , astrophysicist Stephen Hawking yesterday fulfilled a dream of floating weightless on a zero - gravity jet , a step he hopes leads to further space adventures .
" It was amazing , " Hawking said after the flight , which took off from the space shuttle 's runway at the Kennedy Space Center .
The modified jet , named G - Force
One but nicknamed the vomit comet , carried Hawking , his four doctors and two nurses , and dozens of other passengers up to 7,200 metres over the Atlantic off the coast of Florida .
Hawking 's nurses lifted him up and carried him to the front of the jet , where they placed him atop a special foam pillow .
The jet then climbed to around 9,600 metres and made a parabolic dive back to 7 , 200 metres , allowing Hawking and the other passengers to experience weightlessness for about 25 seconds .
The plane made a total of eight parabolic dips , including two during which Hawking made two weightless flips like " a gold - medal gymnast , " said Peter Diamandis , chairman of Zero Gravity Corp. , the company that owns the jet .
" We had a wonderful time .
It was incredible , far beyond our expectations , " Diamandis said .
Hawking , a mathematics professor at the University of Cambridge who has done groundbreaking work on black holes and the origins of the universe , has the paralyzing disease ALS , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease .
The 65 - year - old was the first person with a disability to experience the flight by Zero Gravity , which has flown about 2,700 people out of Florida since 2004 .
" I want to demonstrate to the public that anybody can participate in this type of weightless experience , " Hawking told reporters .
Hawking 's personal physicians were on hand to make sure nothing went wrong .
Others on the flight included financial backers of Zero Gravity and passengers who donated $ 150,000 ( U.S. ) to charity to go on the flight .
The jet 's interior is padded to protect the weightless fliers and equipped with cameras to record their adventure .
The astrophysicist hopes the zero - gravity flight is a step toward going on a suborbital flight , which may be offered by private space companies by the end of the decade .

Foreskin cells are thought to be more vulnerable to HIV infection
The findings are so striking , the US National Institutes of Health decided it would be unethical to continue and stopped the trials early .
It supports a previous South African study which reported similar results .
Experts said it was a significant breakthrough but could not replace standard methods of preventing infection such as condoms .
These findings are of great interest to public health policy makers who are developing and implementing comprehensive HIV prevention programmes
Dr Elias Zerhouni

The two trials of around 8,000 men took place in Uganda and Kenya were due to finish in July and September 2007 respectively .
But after an interim review of the data by the NIH Data and Safety Monitoring Board , it was decided to halt the trials as it was unethical not to offer circumcision in the men who were acting as controls .
Bleeding less likely
The trial in Kenya found a 53 % reduction in new HIV infections in heterosexual men who were circumcised while the Ugandan study reported a drop of 48 % .
Men must not consider themselves protected
Dr Kevin De Cock
World Health Organization
Results last year from a study in 3,280 heterosexual men in South Africa , which was also stopped early , showed a 60 % drop in the incidence of new infections in men who had been circumcised .
There are several reasons why circumcision may protect against HIV infection .
Specific cells in the foreskin may be potential targets for HIV infection and also the skin under the foreskin becomes less sensitive and is less likely to bleed reducing risk of infection following circumcision .
When Aids first began to emerge in Africa , researchers noted that men who were circumcised seemed to be less at risk of infection but it was unclear whether this was due to differences in sexual behaviour .
A modelling study done by international Aids experts earlier this year showed that male circumcision could avert about six million HIV infections and three million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa .
A further trial in Uganda to assess the risk of HIV transmission to female partners is due to report in 2008 but the effect among men who have sex with men has not yet been studied .
Implementation
Dr Kevin De Cock , director of the HIV / Aids department of the World Health Organization told the BBC the results were a " significant scientific advance " but were not a magic bullet and would never replace existing prevention strategies .
" We will have to convene a meeting which we hope will happen quite soon to review the data in more detail and have discussions about the implications .
" This is an intervention that must be embedded with all the other interventions and precautions we have .
Men must not consider themselves protected .
It 's a very important intervention to add to our prevention armamentarium . "
Dr De Cock said that countries in Africa who wanted to use this approach would still have to decide what age groups to target and there would have to be training and hygienic practices in place .
" This is about as good epidemiological data as we can request .
There will be many other research questions about implementation but this is very persuasive . "
NIH director Dr Elias Zerhouni said : " Male circumcision performed safely in a medical environment complements other HIV prevention strategies and could lessen the burden of HIV / Aids , especially in countries in sub-Saharan Africa where , according to the 2006 estimates from UNAids , 2.8 million new infections occurred in a single year . "
Dr Jeckoniah Ndinya - Achola , co-principal investigator at the University of Nairobi , Kenya said : " The Ministry of Health of the Kenyan government is already holding discussions about how this can be made available .
It will need a certain amount of improvement to existing facilities . "
But Tom Elkins , Senior Policy Officer at the National AIDS Trust warned : " There is a real danger in sending out a message that circumcision can protect against HIV .
This is not the case and could lead to an increase in unprotected sex .
" There is still a long way to go in providing comprehensive prevention programmes in many countries , and resources should go into normalising the use of condoms , which are the most effective method currently available for preventing HIV . "

The Baltimore Sun reports :
Apparently , somebody in Baltimore is n’t a fan of Rush Limbaugh .
A large billboard advertising local air times for the conservative radio talk - show host has been defaced .
Robert Murrow , a spokesman for the city ’s Department of Public Works , saw the vandalism as he drove to work this morning on I - 83 near the Guilford Avenue exit .
He called The Sun , saying that someone had poured paint on the image of Limbaugh ’s face .

Obama would snub VP offer from Hillary if asked Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 29 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) said Monday he wouldnt accept a vice presidential slot should his rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton , defeat him in securing the Democratic partys nomination for president .
 Im not running for vice president ,  he said .
 I dont have intentions of being on the ticket as vice president .
The candidate made his remarks during the webcast of a presidential dialogue co-sponsored by MTV and the website MySpace , which allowed Obama to field instant messages from viewers watching online .
One question was about his willingness to run with Clinton .
After initially saying it was too early  to make those kinds of determinations , the senator was pressed by the events co-moderator , Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post , who specifically asked if he would serve as the vice presidential half of a Clinton - Obama ticket .
 No ,  he said .
 Im not running for vice president , I m running for president of the United States . 
The online discussion came as Obama seeks to turn up the pressure on Clinton , who continues to hold commanding leads in national polls .
In recent comments to the New York Times , the candidate said he would be taking a harder line against his opponent , and admitted that his lack of assertiveness  played a part in Clintons polling success .
 In an interview on Friday that was initiated by his campaign to signal the change of course , Mr. Obama said now is the time for him to distinguish himself from Mrs. Clinton ,  reported the Times .
 While he said that he was not out to kneecap the front - runner , because I dont think thats what the country is looking for ,  he said she was deliberately obscuring her positions for political gain and was less likely than he was to win back the White House for Democrats .
Obama was also sharply critical of Sen.
Clinton in an article published today in the Des Moines Register , in which he derided her for voting to approve a recent Senate resolution on Iran  a measure Obama says mirrors Clintons vote to authorize military action in Iraq .
" I think it 's important that we not provide any additional support for blank checks to a president and vice president that have shown no restraint whatsoever when it comes to our foreign policy , " Obama told the paper .
" I think Senator Clinton has tried to straddle the line at times . "
A tape of the Obama event , which was broadcast from Coe College in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , will air tonight on the MTV network .

Much of Israel 's military equipment is supplied by the US
The GBU - 28 is a 2,000 - kg conventional weapon with a powerful warhead that can burrow through six metres ( 20 feet ) of concrete or 30 metres of earth .
The sale has gone ahead despite concern that Israel might use the weapon for a unilateral attack against Iran .
Congress has 30 days to reject planned foreign military sales , but correspondents say it rarely does so .
Israel - assumed to be the Middle East 's only nuclear - armed state - says it is not planning a military strike against the Islamic republic .
However , the bombs are to be fitted on its F - 15 fighter jets , which would put Iran within range .
Some analysts say the deal may be intended by Washington to back up with a bit of military muscle European diplomatic efforts to avert the prospect of a nuclear - armed Iran .
Talks between the Europeans and Iran are deadlocked over Tehran 's refusal to give up uranium enrichment which could be used for arms production .
The US has accused Iran of using its civilian nuclear programme as a cover to develop nuclear weapons , a charge Tehran denies .
Today is Thanksgiving in the US .
Typically , that means gathering with friends and loved ones , eating prodigious amounts of turkey , mashed potatoes , and stuffing , and watching the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys play football .
Hopefully , people also take time to reflect on the things in their lives that they 're thankful for .
In that spirit , Ars is offering up a list of events and developments in 2007 that we think fellow geeks should be thankful for .
Finally , DRM is dying
Ken Fisher : 2007 is the year of the infamous Steve Jobs open letter on DRM , the year that EMI got brave enough to kick DRM to the curb , and even Universal is considering the idea .
I 've long argued that DRM is n't about piracy , it 's about selling your rights back to you .
With the growing backlash against DRM , smart players are realizing that their customers do n't want to be treated like thieves , even if the MPAA has the gall to suggest that they do .
Yet , even the MPAA knows that customers are tired of seeing their fair use rights trampled , coming out earlier this year to call for a change in the industry .
DRM is n't dead yet , but the writing is on the wall .
DRM for music will likely not last another year .
DRM for video is another matter , as those players remain convinced that their products need protection .
Once DRM dies in the music scene , however , the pressure will be on Hollywood to explain why it continues to trample on fair use .
Gaming went mainstream in a big way
Ben Kuchera :
What am I thankful for this holiday season ?
While it may annoy the more hardcore gaming audience , I 'm going to have to say the new mainstream acceptance of gaming .
With the Wii selling to every demographic and games like Guitar Hero bringing games to people who never tried the hobby before , it 's a great time to be in the industry .
While some people are scared that the hardcore gamers are being forgotten , there is n't much evidence of that yet ; this year was chock full of wonderful games for the hardcore market as well as games that broke through to a wider audience .
Just take a look at the features titles we reviewed , as well as the heap of mini-reviews this year .
I love the fact that I have plenty of games to play with my friends and family , even if they 've never picked up a game controller before , they can play many Wii games , and the rhythm game genre is turning many parties into Guitar Hero gatherings .
Gaming is now reaching out to more people , and that 's good news for everyone .
The big disrupter : the iPhone
Eric Bangeman : I admire many of Apple 's products — and I 've been a Mac user for 22 years — but I also find myself irritated by some of the things the company does .
But this year , I 'm truly thankful for a game - changing product from Apple , the iPhone .
I 've been a smartphone / PDA junkie for close to a decade and have used just about every mobile OS known to humankind during that time .
The iPhone has truly made my life easier with its innovative UI , ease of use , and incredibly tight integration with Mac OS X ( something no other smartphone has ever achieved ) .
It makes me more productive ( NewsGator 's iPhone RSS interface is simply amazing ) , entertains me when I want to be entertained , and in its jailbroken form allows me to add extra functionality as I wait for official third - party apps to be released early next year .
The iPhone is significant not just because it is such a compelling product , however .
The iPhone is sending a message to people at Apple and indeed everywhere that phone lock - ins are n't cool , and that the product can and will be made better by its community .
In just a few short years , we 'll look back and see how the iPhone caused a mobile revolution much like the BlackBerry did in the Enterprise .
Yes , we 're even thankful for " Web 2.0 "
Jacqui Cheng : I 'm grateful for the mass proliferation of Web 2.0 .
Do n't laugh !
While some ( okay , a lot ) of Web 2.0 services serve little purpose , many others have done wonders to connect our online lives with our offline lives — that 's what the Internet is for , after all .
Social networking sites like Facebook have exploded and brought in a huge number of users online who would n't have used the ' Net so much otherwise , helping them get back in touch with old classmates and friends as well as make new ones .
Services like Twitter may seem like a niche catering to stream of consciousness fans , but it also serves to let me know what everyone 's up to when I 'm out and about , on devices ranging from laptops to just regular old mobile phones .
I 'm now a faithful worshiper of GrandCentral — having voicemails accessible through the web or sent to me in MP3 format is almost as good as Visual Voicemail on the iPhone .
( Almost . )
Flickr now serves as a photodocumentary for my life , and the numerous ways I can send photos directly to it ( through my phone is my favorite ) mean that everything is there .
There are numerous others that I have n't listed , and there are a lot of other technologies that tie into making these services useful ( wireless broadband , near - ubiquitous WiFi , more feature - rich handhelds ) .
Overall , the new ( ish ) wave of services that connect our real lives to each other through the ' Net have made both my online and offline lives more enjoyable .
With the proliferation of powerful handheld devices like the iPhone and the N800 , we 'll be able to do even more online while enjoying life offline .
Volunteerism is at an all time high
Ryan Paul :
The principle of volunteerism has elevated open - source software intothe public awareness and transformed the software industry .
The growingimportance of open - source software is a poignant reminder that everyonewho participates has the capacity to make a difference .
Everyparticipant , regardless of the scope or nature of their contribution , is helping to bring better software to all of us .
That does n't justmean programmers .
It also includes unsung heroes , like documentationwriters , artists , beta testers , bug reporters , and users who teach andsupport other users .
Without the principled commitment of all of thosepeople , I would n't be who I am today .
I feel compelled to express my gratitude for the open - source software community and all of the hard - working volunteers who contribute their precious time and effort .
The collective labor of the open source community has delivered technological liberty to myself and countless others .
I 'm grateful for the culture of volunteerism and collaboration that makes the community such a powerful and compelling medium for ideological interchange and technological progress .
I 'm also thankful for the Creative Commons , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , and other tireless defenders of freedom who work every day to ensure that our future will not be locked down and encumbered by increasingly draconian intellectual property laws .
You can see our coverage of the EFF 's battles here .
I would also like to extend my appreciation to companies like Red Hat , Novell , Canonical , Google , Nokia , Collabora , Fluendo , and so many others that are coming to the table , motivated by enlightened self interest , to collaborate with the open - source software community and spread freedom for our mutual benefit .
OLED and E Ink : the future is now
Jon Stokes :
The earliest mention that I can find of E - Ink 's technology on Ars is a post that I made way back in 2002 , when the technology was " three to five years away " from commercialization .
I was excited about it then , and I 'm excited about it now , in spite of some of its teething problems ( i.e. , the slow refresh time ) .
I 've also been covering organic LED ( OLED ) technology for at least this long , also as part of the " three to five years away " beat .
So I 'm thankful that in 2007 , both of these technologies began to enter the market in a meaningful , high - profile way .
Sure , there were products based on E - Ink and OLED before 2007 , but 2007 feels like the year that both have rounded some kind of corner and are poised to become truly mainstream .
Now if we could just see some action on the Moller Aircar front ...
In all , a great 2007
2007 has been a great year for tech , but of course there 's one other thing we must give thanks for .
You !
Ars Technica readers are some of the smartest on the ' Net , and it's for you that we 're here working tirelessly day in and day out .
Although there is much work to be done before we can close the books on 2007 , we 're already looking forward to a great 2008 .
Markos has already commented on the ridiculousness that 's supposed to pass for a Time correction on the story Joe Klein has been forced to update five times .
( Five times ! )
But I want to raise another point or two on this .
The first is that this is a perfect illustration of the chronic inability of the traditional media to play this game seriously , a point raised earlier today by SusanG , in her review of Ron Brownstein 's book .
Here 's the what Time was willing to squeeze out , once they were caught with their pants down :
In the original version of this story , Joe Klein wrote that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) would allow a court review of individual foreign surveillance targets .
Republicans believe the bill can be interpreted that way , but Democrats do n't .
Now , before we even get into the rest of this , let 's look at what Joe Klein has said about his article :
Democrats say that I was wrong to report that the bill includes a FISA court review of individual foreign terrorist targets who might communicate with U.S. persons , although it does include an annual " basket " review of procedures used by U.S. intelligence agencies to target foreign suspects .
The Republican Committee staff disagrees and says my reporting is correct .
I have to side with the Democrats .
Bam !
STFU , Time editors .
Why , at the very , rock - bottom minimum , does this " correction " not say :
" Republicans believe the bill can be interpreted that way , but Democrats do n't .
And upon reflection , neither does Joe Klein . " ?
I mean , it 's true , right ?
And accurate .
And , you know , kind of informative .
But Time wo n't say it .
Even though Joe Klein himself already has .
You tell me why Time wo n't stand by its own writers now , and prefers to try to stick it to the Democrats by pretending there 's a valid he - said / she - said storyline here .
No , better yet , do n't you tell me .
Why does n't Time tell all of us ?
Yes , once again the traditional media goes out of its way to find " balance , " even if they have to make it up , which is just what SusanG told us earlier today was a chronic problem for the media generally , and a trap that Brownstein falls into in particular .
No , folks , Republicans do not believe this bill can be interpreted this way .
They are merely willing to say that they do , so that it will be repeated by Very Serious People like Joe Klein , who is n't even one of the Very Serious People who believe Republicans very often to begin with .
So you just know it 'll get worse when it gets into the hands of the conscious shills and water carriers .
That 's just what a spin like this is designed to do .
Klein helped them do it , but had the presence of mind at least to back away from it with sufficient pummeling .
No such luck with the Very Serious Editors of Time magazine .
But no , Republicans do not believe this .
They are saying it so that reporters will have to print it , 1 ) because it offers them their precious " equivalence , " and ; 2 ) because you can't prove someone does n't believe something if they 're willing to say they do .
How do we know they do n't really believe this ?
Because seven years ' experience has shown us how Republicans really believe that this and every other law on the books can be interpreted as the president prefers , or even be ignored outright by the president if he says " national security " demands it .
There is no way on God 's green Earth that George W. Bush would obey this law anyway , much less interpret it the way Republicans want reporters to believe that they believe Democrats mean for it to be interpreted .
Why would he ?
If there 's any reason at all that he would , it would be to game an outcome so that some poor suckers somewhere could be endangered or killed ( or just have their endangerment or deaths lied about ) so that he could blame Democrats for it .
The previously existing FISA law was perfectly clear , but restrictive , so he demanded a change .
But in the meantime , you do n't think he was obeying it , do you ?
Of course not .
And he has admitted as much , because Dick Cheney and his Svengali , David Addington , have convinced him -- insofar as you can convince the congenitally incurious -- that the presidency has " inherent powers " to make the illegal legal with the snap of the presidential fingers .
No , Republicans do not believe the law can be interpreted this way , nor would they care if it was .
And their president certainly wo n't be handicapping himself with such an interpretation ever , at any point , from drafting to enactment to " enforcement . "
And that 's the story -- and a pretty damned big one at that , I 'd say -- that Time 's readers and the nation at large are missing out on , all for the sake of the egos of the petty tyrants at Time , who'd rather stick it to some bloggers than tell the country their Constitution is going down the toilet .

BARREL CARRIAGE CHEEKS TOOLS LOADING ENGRAVING HUNT
How to Hunt Wisconsin Whitetail Deer with a
12 pound Mountain Howitzer Cannon
... by : Buck Stix
***************************************************
THE WHITETAIL DEER HUNT WITH A MOUNTAIN HOWITZER
***************************************************
BUCKSTIX DEER SCENT MADE THIS HUNT POSSIBLE
For those of you unfamiliar with cannon artillery talk , a 12 pound Mountain Howitzer cannon was a small cannon used during the Civil War .
The early mt howitzer cannons were originally designed to be disassembled and packed into the mountains on horseback , hence the name , Mountain Howitzer .
The later model Mountain Howitzers , like this one , were built on a carriage designed to be " pulled " by horses .
The " pound " designation ( 12 pdr ) in the name " 12 pound Mountain Howitzer " refers to the weight of the projectile that the mt howitzer cannon shoots .
Therefore , a 12 pound Mountain Howitzer ( 12 pdr ) shoots a 12 pound cannonball .
All artillery cannons with smooth bore barrels were described in the " pound " weight of their projectiles and were called " Cannons . " ( like the 12 pound Mountain Howitzer Cannon )
Artillery cannons with rifled barrels were described in the " inch " of their bore diameters and called " Guns . " ( like a 3 inch Gun )
First , let me start by saying that I 'm pretty sure that it may not be entirely legal to use a Mountain Howitzer Cannon for deer hunting , at least not in Wisconsin . ( I did n't actually ask the DNR about using a Mountain Howitzer , but according to Thomas Van Haren , a Conservation Warden & Natural Resources Policy Officer of the Bureau of Law Enforcement for the Wisconsin DNR - " the use of a Cannon is not legal for hunting any species of game in Wisconsin . " )
Be sure to check with your own State Hunting regulations , ...... ( Call them and ask them to look under the " Hunting with Artillery " section . )
But , never - the - less , if you live on the edge , and want a real hunting experience , ... read on ...
So having said all that , I 'll give the standard disclaimer ...
" Do n't try this at Home " ... " Leave it to Professionals . "
THE " HUNT "
In order to shoot a whitetail deer with a 12 pound Mountain Howitzer Cannon , you must first purchase a 12 pound Mountain Howitzer Cannon .
Or if you prefer , you can build your own Mountain Howitzer .
Anyone needing help building his own cannon , please e-mail me ........... or click the links below for a special deal on Mountain Howitzer blueprints .
I can supply detail drawings of my " full scale " 1850 No. 2 Mountain Howitzer Prairie Carriage ...
... as well as detail drawings of my 12 pound Mountain Howitzer barrel .
** TO BUY MOUNTAIN HOWITZER PLANS ** <~~~CLICK HERE
AFTER READING , COME BACK AND CLICK ON THE FOLLOWING PICTURES TO SEE HOW I BUILT MY OWN MOUNTAIN HOWITZER
THE " HUNT " CONTINUES
To begin with , one must decide on a proper load with which to shoot a whitetail deer using a Mtn. Howitzer Cannon .
Since it would be rather difficult to hit a deer with a Mountain Howitzer Cannon that used a single 12 pound cast iron ball , ( even an exploding one ) and because down range fall - out ( from 1000 to 1500 yards ) would be a factor with that single 4 - 1/ 2 " diameter ball , it would be more practical to use a standard load of what was called " Canister Shot " .
Using Canister
Shot turns the Mountain Howitzer into rather large shotgun .
A standard load of canister shot for the 12 pound Mountain Howitzer Cannon - is 148 individual lead balls , specifically , .69 caliber ( dia ) lead " musket balls " .
All 148 lead balls are packed into a 4 - 1/ 2 " diameter tin can with the spaces between the balls , filled with saw dust .
Total weight of this load is about 10 - 1 / 4 pounds .
Velocity of the load is approximately 1000 feet per second , being lethal to about 250 yards .
Down range fall - out is limited to only approximately 400 yards .
( individual results may vary )
The nice thing about using a canister shell in the Mountain Howitzer , is that each individual .69 cal lead ball weighs 1 - 1/ 4 ounces .
This is exactly the same size and weight of a standard 12 gauge shotgun slug .
( by the way ... when you hunt with a Mtn. Howitzer Cannon , it is advisable to have a 12 gage shotgun with you , with plenty of empty fired shell cases .
- details will follow )
Casting the needed 148 lead balls takes a bit of time , and lots of lead .
It is not necessary to have perfect balls (? ) but check the weight of each to insure that none of them have large internal voids which could affect their accuracy .
Here is what the assembled canister shell for a Mountain Howitzer looks like .
The 12 pound Mountain Howitzer canister shell is easy to make .
You simply fill a tin container with the 148 lead musket balls , and then attach the container to the top of a wooden sabot ( spacer ) with small nails .
A standard load of 1/2 pound of cannon powder ( in a packet ) is tied to the bottom of the wooden sabot .
When the Mountain Howitzer is fired , the tin can ruptures and separates from the musket balls , much the same way as a shotgun wad separates from the lead shot .
This pre-manufactured canister shell has the outer profile of the inside of the mountain howitzer 's chamber .
It is loaded into the mountain howitzer cannon barrel by pushing the complete assembly down the bore .
You should only need one canister shell to bag your deer using your howitzer , but assemble more than one if you have a mind to .
Now , set up the Mountain Howitzer aimed down your favorite deer trail and adjust the Mt. Howitzer barrel elevation to 5 degrees using a gunners quadrant .
( shown below )
This angle will give a clear shot from 100 yards out to about 250 yards and limit your down range fall - out of fire .
Keep at least 30 feet clear " behind " the mountain howitzer for recoil .
Choosing an area where you can see all around the howitzer is a very good idea .
For example , set - up the mountain howitzer on a deer crossing that runs through the center of an open 100 acre marsh .
( keep in mind , however , that marsh grass may be easily ignited in dry weather and mountain howitzers shoot a lot of flames )
NOW , ... there are several very important things that must be done to avoid potential problems during and after the event of shooting the deer with a Mountain Howitzer .
Follow the 10 steps below for a successful and safe hunt .
1 . Have a lot of land under your control .
( privately owned land or leased land is much preferable to public land )
That way you can limit who enters the area .
It would be advisable to have control of the land at least 1000 yards in the direction the Mountain Howitzer 's muzzle is pointing .
Post lots and lots of NO TRESPASSING signs all around the property .
2 . Mark the probable down - range DANGER area with " Danger - Tape " , the kind of tape that says " Police Line DO - NOT - CROSS " is a good choice , or , " DANGER --- BLASTING AREA " is another good one .
You will need about 1000 yards of this tape .
Lay the tape along the ground starting from 5 foot either side of the mountain howitzer 's muzzle and flare down range at a 15 degree angle .
Extend the tape out to about 500 yards .
Keep the tape laying directly on the ground so the deer can easily step over it .
( Do n't worry about the wording , the deer can't read ) IMPORTANT , BE SURE THE TAPE DOES NOT GET TANGLED ON BRUSH .
( the reason for this will be made clear in step 7 . )
3 . Tell everyone in your hunting party to STAY AWAY from you , ... until 1/2 hour " after " they hear a really BIG BOOM .
Or , better yet , hunt alone when using a Mountain Howitzer .
4. Instead of lighting a Quill fuse to discharge the Mountain Howitzer , I would suggest using a device that is known as a " friction primer " .
A friction primer is a small copper tube that contains powdered chemicals similar to those found on the striking end of a farmer 's match .
( the friction compound )
It also contains a small charge of fine black powder .
A coarse wire with an exposed loop runs through the friction compound .
When the wire is " jerked " out of the friction compound , it ignites the black powder in the tube which in turn shoots a flame down into the Mountain Howitzer 's chamber .
This neat little device provides near instantaneous ignition with no delay .
( It was invented during the Civil War and was used with all Artillery .
It replaced the Quill Fuse . )
FRICTION PRIMER REAL QUILL FUSE MADE FROM A FEATHER QUILL
( I can supply kits for making your own cannon Fuse ) < click
With the friction primer in place in the fuse hole of the Howitzer barrel , a long pull - cord ( lanyard ) is attached to the wire loop .
It allows you to position yourself far away from the Mountain Howitzer Cannon .
Distance is limited only by the length of the lanyard you use .
Make sure to stay off to the side and not directly behind the Mountain Howitzer or it 's wheels .
REMEMBER !
The Mountain Howitzer will " recoil up to 30 feet " depending on the terrain .
5 . When an unsuspecting deer happens to wander in front of your Mountain Howitzer Cannon , PULL THE CORD !
Make sure that the deer is within 250 yards range and directly in - line with the howitzer 's bore .
Also be sure the deer is no closer than 100 yards .
A minimum distance of 100 yards is a " must " for reasonable meat recovery .
( less damage )
You do n't want to hit the deer with all 148 musket balls .
( your goal is to shoot the deer with your mountain howitzer , not " pulverize " him )
Also , at extended distances , it will be less likely that you will shoot off the horns if the deer is a really nice Buck .
6 . When the quiet of the morning is suddenly shattered with a loud BOOM ... you 've done it .
You 've shot a deer with a Mountain Howitzer .
DO NOT CHECK FOR A BLOOD TRAIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHOOTING .
First , pick - up your 12 gage shotgun ( along with the pocket full of empty fired cases that you brought with you ) and FINISH STEP 7 .
7. QUICKLY COVER THE MOUNTAIN HOWITZER WITH A CAMOUFLAGED TARP , AND QUICKLY PICK UP ALL THE DANGER TAPE .
You may wish to practice these steps so you can do it very fast .
( hint : paint the inside of your mountain howitzer travel tarp in a camo pattern , then simply turn it inside - out for hunting )
8. Now , " GET THE HELL OUT OF THE AREA UNTIL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED " ( You have just created a smoke cloud that is likely visible from the moon .
It may take up to 30 minutes for the smoke to dissipate depending on the particular area and wind conditions )
Move away from the howitzer by one - half mile .
( or more )
Sit down and eat your lunch .
Keep an eye on the area from a distance , making sure there are no nosey hunters that wander over to see what all the noise ( and smoke ) was about .
In the unlikely event that a crowd of unknown hunters should wander over , play dumb , talk with your mouth full , drool , and entice them away from the area of the howitzer .
If they comment about the " smell of rotten eggs " ( the sulfur form the 1/2 pound of black powder you just ignited ) tell them you ate a lot of hard boiled eggs for breakfast , and you have gas .
If they should discover the Mountain Howitzer Cannon , " tell them that they are trespassing on private land " , and threaten to call the Sheriff if they do n't leave at once .
9 . After the smoke ( and the coast ) has cleared , go back and start trailing your deer .
However , if you did everything correctly with your howitzer , the deer will likely be dead on the spot ... and wo n't need any trailing .
It would be a good idea to drag the deer away from the cannon area before starting to field dress him .
( just in case other hunters wander over )
Now is also a good time to spread - out lots of those fired 12 gage empty hulls .
10 .
In the event that you " do " have unscheduled on - lookers while you are field dressing the deer , ( especially if a Game Warden happens by ) be ready to explain to him that you got very , very , excited and that you kept shooting your " 12 gage shotgun " until the deer finally went down .
Tell him you fired " at least as many times as you find holes in the deer " .
Take him over and show him all the empty cases which are strewn about .
( the ones you previously spread - out far away from the Mountain Howitzer I hope )
Act very , very , excited and be very , very , convincing .
( your freedom may depend on your acting ability )
You may need to tell him that you had to reload , two or even three times , depending on the number of holes you find in the deer .
( the pattern of your individual mountain howitzer cannon will dictate the extent of your tale )
However , if you shot your deer at less than 100 yards , this may not work at all , and you will now be in big trouble .
( Hopefully the Judge will have a sense of humor when he exclaims to the Game Warden , ..............
" You telling me he actually shot a Deer with a Mountain Howitzer Cannon ? " )
Wrap -up .
OK , since there was very little for you to do while you were just sitting there hunting with your Mountain Howitzer Cannon , you would find it easy to " simultaneously " take a picture of your shot with your digital camera .
Be sure to take a lot of pictures of your successful Mt. Howitzer cannon hunt so you can show all the grandkids .
( Having a lot of pictures also helps to convince the disbelievers )
for example :
This wonderful trophy was taken at 8:00 a.m. on November 22nd , 2003 .
And , it was done without damaging a single point of this Buck 's very nice 8 point rack .
Meat recovery was very reasonable for this 120 yard shot .
Although the holes look big , there was very little extended meat damage .

Translation of the PRISM press release
Recently , an organization with the blandly orwellian name Partnership for Research Integrity in Science & Medicine ( PRISM ) was founded .
They represent those who like making easy money off publically - funded research , and are wetting their pants that someone in Congress might figure out their scam , and take their precious golden goose away .
They sent out this press release .
For those of you who can't be bothered unpacking its double - speak , I 've provided a translation :
The formation of a coalition of scholarly societies and publishers was announced today
If coalition means lobby group for an industry that depends on government financing .
in an effort to safeguard the scientific and medical peer - review process
Since we do n't pay our reviewers anything to do the hard work of peer - reviewing our articles – they add the value for which we sell our journals – we would be fools not to try to safe - guard our cash - cows .
and educate the public about the risks of proposed government interference with the scholarly communication process .
Our current scholarly communication process does n't actually let you ( the public ) read the research that , you , funded through government research grants .
We must educate you about this , so you wo n't want to read our articles in the future .
The Partnership for Research Integrity in Science and Medicine is a coalition launched with developmental support from the Professional & Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers ( AAP ) to alert Congress to the unintended consequences of government interference in scientific and scholarly publishing .
Our business model siphons money from government - funded scientists and sells their research back to them .
The scientists , of course , pays us more money to read our journals from government grants .
Any change in government policy would turn this spigot dry .
The group has launched a website at http://www.prismcoalition.org, where it articulates the PRISM Principles ,
Although we do n't want you to read the science articles that we publish , we want you to read about our efforts to prevent you from doing so .
an affirmation of publishers ' contribution to science , research , and peer review , and an expression of support for continued private sector efforts to expand access to scientific information .
( http://www.prismcoalition.org/prism/about.htm)
When we say " expand access to scientific information " , we certainly do n't want to expand access to you – that would actually be open access publishing .
No , we want to expand our own access to the research that you funded , and wall it off .
We are enthusiastic about this initiative and the potential of our new website
We are scared shitless that the bottom will drop of our market , and this is our last ditch effort to stop you .
to educate policy makers and citizens about our efforts to increase access to information , to alert them to the very real threat to peer review that ill - considered government interference represents , and to explore the ways in which we can safeguard peer review as a critical component of scientific integrity
The idea of losing easy access to government money makes us very , very ill .
" said Patricia Schroeder , president and CEO of AAP .
" Only by preserving the essential integrity of the peer - review process can we ensure that scientific and medical research remains accurate , authoritative , and free from manipulation and censorship and distinguishable from junk science . "
If we try to say that open - access does not involve peer - review often enough , we might even believe it .
Open - access does not involve peer - review .
Open - access does not involve peer - review .
These are not the droids you are looking for .
Move along .
Recently , there have been legislative and regulatory efforts to compel not - for - profit and commercial journals to surrender to the Federal government a large number of published articles that scholarly journals have paid to peer review , publish , promote , archive and distribute .
Mrs. Schroeder stressed that government interference in scientific publishing would force journals to give away their intellectual property and weaken the copyright protections that motivate journal
In many other publishing industries , the author owns the copyright to their work , but in science publishing , we do .
Please do n't take away our rights to your work .
publishers to make the enormous investments in content and infrastructure needed to ensure widespread access to journal articles .
It would jeopardize the financial viability of the journals that conduct peer review , placing the entire scholarly communication process at risk .
We are so incompetent that the technological advances in typesetting , layout and electronic communication has actually made us less efficient , unlike , say , magazine and newspaper publishing .
" Peer review has been the global standard for validating scholarly research for more than 400 years and we want to make sure it remains free of unnecessary government interference , agenda - driven research , and bad science , " said Dr. Brian Crawford , chairman of the executive council of AAP 's Professional & Scholarly Publishing Division .
Considering that the original scientific journal , " The Transactions of the Royal Society " was funded and sanctioned by the English Monarchy , i.e. the English government , we do n't know our history either .
" The free market of scholarly publishing is responsive to the needs of scholars and scientists and balances the interests of all stakeholders . "
If free market means that we charge what the fuck we want without restraint .
Critics argue that peer reviewed articles resulting from government funded research should be available at no cost .
However , the expenses of peer review ,
promotion , distribution and archiving of articles are paid for by private sector publishers , and not with tax dollars .
We really know that the research we get is not free .
It 's already been paid for .
By you .
That 's why it 's valuable .
But let us pretend that it is us , and only us , that add value to the science .
Mrs. Schroeder pointed out that these expenses amount to hundreds of millions of dollars each year for non-profit and commercial publishers .
" Why would a federal agency want to duplicate such expenses instead of putting the money into more research funding ? " she said .
Yes , why would a federal agency want to duplicate expenses by paying us twice for publishing work that they did , so that they can read it ?
A very good question .
Think about this why we 're laughing all the way to the bank .

Six years into the Bush presidency , the administration unveiled its first new upgrade to energy - efficiency standards Friday with all the fanfare of a funeral , burying notice of it in The Federal Register .
But the energy savings accrued under the new standard for electrical transformers – those gray trash - can - like metal cylinders that hang on utility poles from Pasadena , Calif. , to Poughkeepsie , N.Y. – are not insignificant .
Nearly all the electricity in the US moves through those gray boxes , so even a fraction of a percent efficiency gain will save as much electricity over 29 years as 27 million households use annually , reports the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) .
That would eliminate hundreds of millions of tons of carbon - dioxide emissions and the need to build almost five new medium - size coal - fired power plants .
Transformers are just the beginning .
Sued by environmental groups for foot - dragging on efficiency standards , the DOE in 2006 agreed to a five - year timetable for developing new standards on everything from pool heaters to light bulbs .
( By contrast , the Clinton administration had half a dozen new efficiency standards in place after six years in office . )
But energy - efficiency advocates are claiming only a partial victory because , in the words of Steve Nadel of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy , the DOE " left energy gains sitting on the table . "
Many worry that the transformer standards are a sign of things to come .
New efficiency standards are usually welcomed when environmental , efficiency , and industry groups reach a " consensus standard . "
In this case , however , the DOE rejected it and adopted a standard that will yield one - third less energy savings .
" We 're required to balance a number of factors , including what is both technologically feasible and economically justified , " says DOE spokeswoman Megan Barnett .
" We performed substantial analysis and gave extensive attention to comments and proposals .
And we raised the required level of efficiency for distribution transformers . "
In The Federal Register , the DOE cited concerns that the core of the devices may cost more .
But The ABB Group , the biggest transformer manufacturer , endorsed a higher standard , although others did not .
The electric utility industry , too , wanted a tougher standard .
One reason is that better transformers can take the heat .
In July 2006 , nearly 1,400 transformers blew during a heat wave in northern California , leaving more than 1 million people without power , news media reported .
" The new standards are n't as tough as we had hoped , " says Ed Legge of Edison Electric Institute , a Washington advocacy group representing investor - owned utilities that supply electricity to 70 percent of the nation .
" I would n't say it [ the new standard ] is the highest possible .
But it 's better than the initial proposal a year ago .
We would have liked more , and we 'll keep pushing . "
Since the 1970s , efficiency - standard upgrades have been a key to reducing the amount of power needed for US economic growth , says David Goldstein , energy program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
He is n't sure why the DOE opted for lesser standard for new transformers – or what it portends for new appliance standards in the pipeline .
" We thought this was the least this DOE could do , " he says of the rejected consensus standard .
" It turned out it was n't . "
Need some training to go for ramp on stage ..

John Gruber was recently featured for a second time on Dan Benjamin ’s instantly - awesome Hivelogic Podcast .
I ’m glad that Jesper heard and was intrigued by some of the same comments I was , because he reminded me that I wanted to comment on a subtle but worth - repeating impression that I took away .
The comments are those pertaining to the introduction of scripting language bridges as standard developer resources in Leopard OS X 10.5 .
Gruber points out that for developers , the presence of these scripting language bindings will both open up the platform to a wider audience of developers , and enable selective use of scripting languages where the highest performance is not necessary .
He suggests that a typical developer will write everything in Ruby or Python , and then do performance testing .
Anything that needs a speed - up can be redone in Objective - C .
You know , that “ slow ” dynamic variant of C :)
This analysis is foreboding , because it ’s exactly what programmers have always done when they switched to a higher level language .
10 years ago a programmer would be more likely to “ switch to assembly ” for a much - needed performance boost .
Has it come to this ?
Are we moving to a higher plane ?
If you ’re like me , you ’ve probably become quite comfortable in your Objective - C universe , and somewhat dismissive of the scripting languages as they begin to encroach on our holy ground .
But we run the risk of being like those losers who still insist on programming everything in assembly , while the higher - level code would be just as fast and easier to maintain .
Is C the new assembly ?

In most ways my life is close to ideal .
The conditions of my life are excellent .
I am satisfied with my life .
So far I have gotten the important things I want in life .
If I could live my life over , I would change almost nothing .
35 - 31 Highly satisfied People who score in this range love their lives and feel that things are going very well .
Your life is not perfect , but you feel it is about as good as life gets .
Furthermore , just because you are satisfied does not mean you are complacent .
In fact , growth and challenge might be part of the reason you are satisfied .
For most people in this high - scoring range , life is enjoyable , and the major domains of life are going well - work or school , family , friends , leisure , and personal development .
26 - 30 Satisfied People who score in this range like their lives and feel that things are going well .
Of course your life is not perfect , but you feel that things are mostly good .
Furthermore , just because you are satisfied does not mean you are complacent .
In fact , growth and challenge might be part of the reason you are satisfied .
For most people in this high - scoring range , life is enjoyable , and the major domains of life are going well - work or school , family , friends , leisure , and personal development .
You can draw motivation from those areas of your life that you are dissatisfied with .
20 - 25 Slightly satisfied
You have an average score .
The average of life satisfaction in economically developed nations is in this range  the majority of people are generally satisfied , but have some areas where they very much would like some improvement .
Some people score in this range because they are mostly satisfied with most areas of their lives but see the need for some improvement in each area .
Other people score in this range because they are satisfied with most domains of their lives , but have one or two areas where they would like to see large improvements .
Generally people who score in this range have areas of their lives that need improvement , but would usually like to move to a higher level by making some life changes .
15 - 19 Slightly below average in life satisfaction People who score in this range usually have small but significant problems in several areas of their lives , or have many areas that are doing fine but one area that represents a substantial problem for them .
If you have moved temporarily into this level of life satisfaction from a higher level because of some recent event , things will usually improve over time and satisfaction will generally move back up .
On the other hand , if you are continually slightly dissatisfied with many areas of life , some changes might be in order .
Sometimes we are simply expecting too much , and sometimes life changes are needed .
Thus , although temporary dissatisfaction is common and normal , a continual level of dissatisfaction across a number of areas of life calls for reflection .
Some people can gain motivation from a small level of dissatisfaction , but often dissatisfaction across a number of life domains is a distraction , and unpleasant as well .
10 - 14 Dissatisfied People who score in this range are substantially dissatisfied with their lives .
People in this range may have a number of areas that are not going well , or one or two areas that are going very badly .
If life dissatisfaction is a response to a recent event such as bereavement , divorce , or a significant problem at work , you will probably return over time to his or her former level of higher satisfaction .
However , if low levels of life satisfaction have been persisting for some time then some changes might be in order  both in attitudes and patterns of thinking , and probably in life activities as well .
Low levels of life satisfaction in this range , if they persist , can indicate that things are going badly and life alterations are needed .
Furthermore , a person with low life satisfaction in this range is sometimes not functioning well because their unhappiness serves as a distraction .
Talking to a friend , a member of the clergy , a counsellor , or another specialist can often help to get moving in the right direction , although positive change will be up to you .
However , dissatisfaction at this level is often due to dissatisfaction in multiple areas of life .
Whatever the reason for the low level of life satisfaction , it may be that the help of others are needed - a friend or family member , counselling with a member of the clergy , or help from a psychologist or other counsellor .
If the dissatisfaction persists , you need to change , and often others can help .
Talk to your GP or contact a mental health organization . " ;
5 - 9 Extremely dissatisfied People who score in this range are usually extremely unhappy with their current life .
In some cases this is in reaction to some recent bad event such as the death of a loved one or unemployment .
The dissatisfaction can be a response to a continuing problem , such as alcoholism or addiction .
In other cases the extreme dissatisfaction is a reaction due to something bad in life such as recently having lost a loved one .
What makes you makes you happy
To understand life satisfaction scores , it is helpful to understand some of the components that go into most people 's experience of happiness .
One of the most important influences on happiness is social relationships .
Social relationships greatly influence your happiness levels
People who score high on life satisfaction tend to have close and supportive family and friends , whereas those who do not have close friends and family are more likely to be dissatisfied .
Of course the loss of a close friend or family member can cause dissatisfaction with life , and it may take quite a time to bounce back from the loss .
Another factor that influences the life satisfaction of most people is work or school , or performance in an important role such as homemaker or grandparent .
When the person enjoys his or her work , whether it is paid or unpaid work , and feels that it is meaningful and important , this contributes to life satisfaction .
When work is going poorly because of bad circumstances or a poor fit with the person 's strengths , this can lower life satisfaction .
When a person has important goals , and is failing to make adequate progress toward them , this too can lead to life dissatisfaction .
A third factor that influences the life satisfaction of most people is personal - satisfaction with the self , religious or spiritual life , learning and growth , and leisure .
Other sources of happiness
For many people these are sources of satisfaction .
However , when these sources of personal worth are frustrated , they can be powerful sources of dissatisfaction .
Of course there are additional sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction - some that are common to most people such as health , and others that are unique to each individual .
Most people know the factors that lead to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction , although a person 's temperament - a general tendency to be happy or unhappy - can colour their responses .
There is no one key to life satisfaction , but rather a recipe that includes a number of ingredients .
With time and persistent work , people 's life satisfaction usually goes up .
People who have had a loss recover over time .
People who have a dissatisfying relationship or work often make changes over time that will increase their satisfaction .
One key ingredient to happiness is social relationships , and another key ingredient is to have important goals that derive from one 's values , and to make progress toward those goals .
For many people it is important to feel a connection to something larger than oneself .
When a person tends to be chronically dissatisfied , they should look within themselves and ask whether they need to develop more positive attitudes to life and the world .

CREMONA , Italy —
A violin , it turns out , needs to be played , just as a car needs to be driven and a human body shooed off the couch .
In this city that produced the best violins ever made , that job belongs to Andrea Mosconi .
He is 75 , and for the past 30 years , six days a week , he has finger - fed 300 - year - old violins , worth millions , a diet of Bach , Tchaikovsky and Bartok .
It is peaceful where he works , in a chapel - turned - museum here , so it jars when he compares his gentle job to the roar of Formula One racing .
He is nothing but serious about what he does .
“ It is not a matter of habit , ” Mr. Mosconi said .
“ When Schumacher gets to 350 kilometers an hour , do you think he ever loses his concentration ? ” he added , speaking of the retired racing champion Michael Schumacher .
“ In my case , too , I have to pay attention , ” he said .
“ You have to give your best with these instruments .
They make you sweat . ”
In the interview , Mr. Obama , of Illinois , acknowledged that he had held back until now , though he asserted it was a calculated decision to introduce himself in early voting states before engaging opponents .
At times , he said , he has taken lines out of speeches prepared by his campaign that he felt were “ stretching the truth . ”
But Mr. Obama said the plan had always been for him to begin taking on Mrs. Clinton more directly in the fall .
And he glared and said no when asked if he lacked the stomach for confrontational politics .
“ It is absolutely true that we have to make these distinctions clearer , ” he said .
“ And I will not shy away from doing that . ”
A test of just how far Mr. Obama is willing to go should come Tuesday night , when Democrats meet for a nationally televised debate in Philadelphia .
[ In a campaign statement issued Saturday in Iowa , Mr. Obama asserted that Mrs. Clinton had “ repeatedly dodged opportunities to reveal her thinking about the best way to strengthen Social Security . ” ]
The interview came amid growing signs that Mr. Obama was looking for a fresh start for his campaign after nine months in which his aides said they were startled by the effectiveness of Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , and worried that her support was not as brittle as they had once believed .
Mr. Obama has built up his campaign war room , occasionally traveling with a speechwriter — reflecting concern of his aides that his public speeches tend to be long - winded — and begun spending more money on television advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire .
His senior aides said they were now spending much of their days fielding calls from concerned donors and other supporters asking why Mr. Obama was not challenging Mrs. Clinton more forcefully and warning that he could cede the role of the main anti-Clinton candidate to former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina , who is running an aggressive campaign in Iowa .
Typically , one aide said , the supporter asks some version of the same question : “ What happened to the Obama we saw at the 2004 Democratic convention ? ”
At the same time , aides said there was disagreement in the campaign about whether he should now begin investing all his time in Iowa , where polls show him to be running neck - and - neck with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards , hoping that a victory there would give him a lift in New Hampshire , where polls show him trailing .
While working through the problems of SICP section 2 - 2 this week , I had a flash of insight .
Things that had frustrated and stymied me for years were suddenly becoming trivial .
One data structures problem that had particularly bugged me had become pretty easy , too– though I had to apply everything I ’d learned in SICP about recursion , first class functions , and the closure property to do it .
Here ’s a quick tour of my proof of concept from the REPL prompt :
CL - USER > ( setf c ( make - hash - table ) )
# S( HASH - TABLE EQL )
CL - USER > ( create - widget c ‘ division - a ‘ mega - corp ‘( factory - 1 factory - 2 factory - 3 ) )
( DIVISION -A MEGA - CORP ( FACTORY -3 FACTORY - 2 FACTORY -1 ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
CL - USER > ( create - widget c ‘ division - b ‘ mega - corp ‘( dist - 1 dist - 2 dist - 3 main - office ) )
( DIVISION -B MEGA -CORP ( MAIN - OFFICE DIST -3 DIST - 2 DIST - 1 ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
We ’re starting out by defining a hash - table to store all of our work in .
I guess I could have stored everything in a global variable so that I would n’t have to keep referencing the store all of the time , but I figured it was worth it not to have all of my functions hard coded to a particular variable .
With the above code we assigned division - a and division - b to a company we like to call Mega - Corp .
We created some factories , distribution centers , and a main office while we were at it .
CL - USER > ( gethash ‘ mega- corp c )
( MEGA - CORP NIL ( DIVISION -B DIVISION -A ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
CL - USER > ( gethash ‘ division-a c )
( DIVISION -A MEGA - CORP ( FACTORY -3 FACTORY - 2 FACTORY -1 ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
CL - USER > ( gethash ‘ factory - 1 c )
( FACTORY -1 DIVISION -A NIL # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
Here we take a look at what we ’re actually storing in our hash table .
Each item in the hash is a list in the format of ( WidgetName Parent - Widget Children - Widgets - List Properties - Hash - Table ) .
You can see above that Mega - Corp has children , but no parent .
Division - a has both a parent and children .
And Factory - 1 has a parent but no children .
CL - USER > ( create - widget c ‘ office - staff - f1 ‘ factory - 1 ‘( bob fred joe ) )
( OFFICE - STAFF-F1 FACTORY -1 ( JOE FRED BOB ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
CL - USER > ( create - widget c ‘ office - staff - d1 ‘ dist - 1 ‘( james mike sally bert ) )
( OFFICE - STAFF -D1 DIST -1 ( BERT SALLY MIKE JAMES ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
CL - USER > ( gethash ‘ office - staff - f1 c )
( OFFICE - STAFF-F1 FACTORY -1 ( JOE FRED BOB ) # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
CL - USER > ( gethash ‘ bert c )
( BERT OFFICE -STAFF -D1 NIL # S( HASH - TABLE EQL ) )
T
Here we extend our data structure even further by adding some office staff groups .
We can extend the structure as much we want– and in principle , there ’s nothing preventing us from writing procedures to copy and combine such data structures however we choose .
That wide - open combinatorial possibility is what the closure property is all about .
CL - USER > ( setprops c ‘ ( bob fred joe james mike sally bert ) ‘ salary ‘( 40100 55050 50010 35025 33099 75042 20010 ) )
( 40100 55050 50010 35025 33099 75042 20010 )
CL - USER > ( setprops c ‘( factory - 1 factory - 2 factory - 3 dist - 1 dist - 2 dist - 3 main - office ) ‘ assets ‘( 800000 950000 725000 225000 235000 230000 125000 ) )
( 800000 950000 725000 225000 235000 230000 125000 )
CL - USER > ( getprop c ‘ factory - 2 ‘ assets )
950000
T
CL - USER > ( getprop c ‘ sally ‘ salary )
75042
T
These functions use mapcar to set a slew of property values all at once– without having lots of repetitive code .
The getprop procedure allows us to read those settings back out again .
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ sally ‘ salary )
75042
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ office - staff - d1 ‘ salary )
163176
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ office - staff - f1 ‘ salary )
145160
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ mega - corp ‘ salary )
308336
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ mega - corp ‘ assets )
3290000
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ division - a ‘ assets )
2475000
CL - USER > ( getval #’+ 0 c ‘ division - b ‘ assets )
815000
Here we ’re using a recursive procedure to apply the plus function to all of the property values from a certain point in the hierarchy down .
The zero in the s-expressions there is an identity value– just like the ones we coded in SICP section 1 - 3 .
I had to implement that just in case there were all NIL ’s in my hash table for a certain property .
With a careful use of property names , you can get some benefits of stratified design ( covered in SICP section 2 - 2 ) in this kind of data structure .
We can code in all kinds of information about the separate divisions at one level … and way down the hierarchy we can have all kinds of other information stored about the employees .
While working at either end , we can effectively ignore all of the other levels .
At the same time we can “ roll up ” related values however we like at any level we care to focus on .
( There ’s probably a few other things I could have done to make this better , faster , or slicker .
If you ’re working through SICP , too , please check out this complete code file and let me know if you have any tips or suggestions .
I used Common Lisp instead of Scheme , though .
I really needed to stop a while and apply what I was learning in SICP to problems that I ’d developed a personal stake in .
Most people tend to abandon the book by section 2 - 2 , so I better get back to work if I want to finish it ! )
Back in the day , I would have avoided a recursive data structure like this if I was working on a similar task .
I would have ( horrors ! ) hard - coded the hierarchy at maybe 3 or 4 levels deep , coded all my tables as separate entities , and more than likely built in some work - arounds for the places where such choices were inadequate .
( Thinking that OOP was the “ right way , ” I would have coded a class file for companies , divisions , offices , and employees– and then been stuck storing and retrieving data in as many separate RDBMS tables and figuring out how to map them back and forth somehow .
Writing nested hash tables to a file , on the other hand , is trivial in Common Lisp . )
The end result would have been a maintenance nightmare … .
It ’s a good thing I was too lazy to finish any of those pet projects back then !
Funny , I could see clearly the problems of coding 50 slightly different forms when one generic form could be rigged up to do the same thing , but I could n’t break through my mental limitations to think three - dimensionally about data structures .
Thanks to many painful hours spent working through SICP , I can now synthesize recursion , first class functions , and the closure property to make more elegant solutions to things that used to be next - to - impossible for me .
Update 10/26/07 : I did manage to follow this post up here .

ADDIS ABABA ( Reuters ) - Ethiopian scientists said on Tuesday they have discovered hominid fossil fragments dating from between 3.5 million and 3.8 million years ago in what could fill a crucial gap in the understanding of human evolution .
Ethiopian archaeologist Yohannes Haile Selassie said the find included several complete jaws and one partial skeleton and were unearthed in the Afar desert at Woranso - Mille , near where the famous fossil skeleton known as Lucy was found in 1974 .
“ This is a major finding that could fill a gap in human evolution , ” he told a news conference in Addis Ababa .
“ The fossil hominids from the Woranso - Mille area sample a time period that is poorly known in human evolutionary study . ”
Researchers say the area , about 140 miles northeast of Addis , boasts the most continuous record of human evolution .
Last year , an international team of scientists unveiled the discovery of 4.1 million - year - old fossils in the region .
Lucy , the most famous find , lived between 3.3 million and 3.6 million years ago .
But Yohannes said Afar had yielded early hominid fossil remains spanning the last 6 million years .
“ This has placed Ethiopia in the forefront of paleoanthropology , ” he told reporters .
“ Ethiopia is known to the world as the cradle of humankind . ”

30 Worst Atrocities of the 20th Century

30 Worst Atrocities of the 20th Century
The Hemoclysm
" I can picture in my mind a world without war , a world without hate .
And I can picture us attacking that world , because they 'd never expect it . " -- Jack Handy
Year by year death toll of the century 's atrocities :
The 30 or so worst bloodlettings of the Twentieth Century have ( probably ) been ...
The totals here are subject to the usual margins of error .
They also contain all varieties of atrocity : battle deaths , civilian casualties of war , democide , famine caused by the economic disruption , etc .
Although each of these is a distinct event , many are closely inter-related .
Stalin ( #3 ) , Chiang Kai-shek ( # 7 ) and Mao Zedong ( # 2 ) were major players in World War Two ( # 1 ) , which was clearly a sequel to World War One ( # 4 ) .
The Russian Civil War ( # 5 ) , which paved the way for the rise of Stalin , was an integral outgrowth of World War One .
The anarchy that swept China following the overthrow of the monarchy brought Chiang to power , put Mao in conflict with him , and encouraged the Japanese invasion .
The fall of the Japanese Empire following World War Two left Korea up for grabs ( # 8 ) , and Mao 's army was among those who tried to grab it .
It 's very possible , therefore , that future historians will consider these events to be mere episodes of a single massive upheaval -- the " Hemoclysm " , to give it a name ( Greek for " blood flood " ) -- which took the lives of some 155 million people .
All in all , over 80 % of the deaths caused by Twentieth Century atrocities occurred in the Hemoclysm .
It divides neatly into two parts -- Eastern and Western .
The Eastern Hemoclysm began with the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty in China in 1911 leading to 38 years of Civil War and a Japanese invasion .
In 1949 , the bloodbath of the interregnum gave way to a greater bloodbath as the Communists consolidated power under Mao ( who died in 1976 ) .
When seen as a continuum , this phase of Chinese history was a 65 year nightmare which took some 75 million lives .
The first sparks of the Western Hemoclysm were the Balkan Wars ( 1912 - 13 ) which quickly ignited the First World War .
This brought down four of the most powerful monarchies in Europe , leading to a power vacuum which was eventually filled by the Nazis in Germany and the Communists in Russia , who came into conflict during the Second World War .
The death of Stalin in 1953 finally extinguished the Western Hemoclysm after the loss of some 80 million lives .
If it were n't for the fact that the Second World War is considered to be a single event , we could probably consider the Eastern and Western halves of the Hemoclysm to be distinctly unrelated pieces of history .
A series of events which may or may not be related to the Hemoclysm are the wars and massacres which ravaged Indochina from 1945 to 1980 .
The first of these ( 1945 - 54 ) was obviously spawned by the Second World War , and we can easily trace a chain reaction which led from this to the next and the next ( #23-#9-#11 ) ; however , each subsequent war took it farther and farther from the central events of the Hemoclysm , so I have not included the 5 million Indochinese dead in the total .
If we 're going to be pointing fingers of blame for the savageness of the Century -- and you know you want to -- raw numbers are probably not enough .
There have been plenty of episodes of concentrated brutality that do n't show up on the list above simply because the affected population is so small .
Meanwhile , a major reason that Russia and China stand so prominently at the top of the list is that they have so many potential victims to begin with .
Therefore , I 've taken all the episodes of mass killing of the 20th Century and divided them by the population of the country that suffered the losses .
The 25 highest percentages of national populations killed during periods of mass brutality :
If you look carefully at the chart with the intention of determining which race , religion or ideology has been the most brutal , you 'll see a pattern emerge .
It 's quite a startling pattern , so I 'd rather you find it by yourself .
Go back and take a second look .
I 'll meet you at the next paragraph after I explain that , honestly , I did not manipulate the data .
I simply took the most likely death toll ( military and civilian ) among the natives of each country ( such as all the South Vietnamese -- ARVN soldiers , civilians and Viet Cong -- who were killed in the Vietnam War ) , and divided it by the population of that country ( prewar ) .
I did n't take , say , only the military dead , or only the victims of genocide .
I did n't arbitrarily decide to split one horror into two in order to make each seem smaller ( the only borderline case is that I calculated the Russians dead from WW2 and Stalin separately .
A judgement call . ) , or eliminate countries of a certain size .
No , I had no predetermined point to prove .
I did the math and let the chips fall where they would .
( Here are the raw numbers if you want to check behind me . )
That 's why I was so startled to discover that there is absolutely no pattern to the chart .
If I had simply picked 25 countries out of a hat , I could not have gotten a more diverse spread than we 've got here .
We 've got rich countries and poor countries ; industrial and agrarian ; big and small .
We 've got people of all colors -- white , black , yellow and brown -- widely represented among both the slaughterers and the slaughterees .
We 've got Christians , Moslems , Buddhists and Atheists all butchering one another in the name of their various gods or lack thereof .
Among the perpetrators , we 've got political leanings of the left , right and middle ; some are monarchies ; some are dictatorships and some are even democracies .
We 've got innocent victims invaded by big , bad neighbors , and we 've got plenty of countries who brought it on themselves , sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind .
Go on -- take a third look .
Find any type of country that is not represented among the agents of a major blooding , and probably the only reason for that is that there are n't that many countries in that category to begin with ( There are no Hindu or Jewish countries on the chart , but then , there 's only one of each on the whole planet , and they 're both waiting in the wings among the next 25 . ) .
In a way , it 's rather disheartening to realize that we can't smugly blame the brutality of the century on the Communists , or the imperialists , or the Moslem fundamentalists , or the godless .
Every major category of human has done it 's share to boost the body count , so replacing , say , Moslem rulers with Christian rulers , or white rulers with black rulers , is not going to change it at all .

I think there 's a flaw with his reasoning here .
He seems to think that a country with a population of 10 that kills 5 of its own is worse than a country of 100 that kills 49 of its own .
Just because there are more victims is irrelevant ; it 's body count that matters , and the Commies win out , hands down .

I see a pattern in the last chart .
I count 8 of the 25 as African , 6 of the 25 as Eastern European ( 7 if you count Germany ) , 3 Middle Eastern , 3 Asian .
But if you draw a belt from Germany to Vietnam , you get 12 of the 25 .
So seems to me that Africa and this Eurasian belt ( do n't forget China and Russia get up there in raw numbers ) , account for the vast majority of these atrocities .

Oh , if we 're recounting the history of Christian aggression , why stop with the Thirty Years ' War ?
Why not trot out the Inquisition , the Crusades , and the Jesuit " invasion " of the New World ?
All of which 1 ) took place a few hundred years ago , not yesterday ; and 2 ) pale in comparison to the ongoing slaughter sponsored by godless communist regimes and the theocracies of Allah the Red -Handed .

Only a few days left to Double your gift
Paul Sabin is executive director of the Environmental Leadership Program and a lecturer in American history at Yale University .
He is presently completing a book on California oil politics for the University of California Press .
NEW HAVEN , Conn .
I am off to Seattle today for a five - day retreat , and I ’m tingling with anticipation .
I ’ll be joining three classes of fellows in the Environmental Leadership Program .
Each year , we select about 25 extraordinary individuals from across the environmental movement .
Coming from nonprofits , higher education , business , and government , these ELP fellows are “ emerging leaders ” – people with roughly three to 10 years of environmental experience who have begun to establish themselves in their field .
Tomorrow , for the first time , all three of our classes of fellows will gather at the Sleeping Lady Conference Center in Leavenworth , Wash .
I ’m looking forward to this extended chance to build relationships across the environmental field — from environmental justice activism to conservation biology to corporate social responsibility .
I ’m always curious to see what will come out of the mix .
We ’ve seen two ELP fellows begin work on a documentary film about the health effects of hazardous waste on a tribal reservation in California .
I also am interested to see the results of the community - wide conversation about diversity that we have been undertaking for the past year .
Since we met last August , we ’ve been meeting , talking , and thinking about the social dimensions of environmentalism , exploring how differences in race , ethnicity , class , gender , sexual orientation , and faith influence our work as environmental activists and professionals .
And since environmental politics also should be fun , we ’ll host a festive “ no - talent ” show , hike in the nearby mountains , and swing our partners at a contra dance .
I ’ve been working towards this moment in ELP ’s development since I first started envisioning the organization six years ago .
I ca n’t quite believe we ’ve reached this point — or that we ’re ready to pull it off !
When I first dipped my toes in these waters , I was a graduate student in environmental history at Berkeley , just beginning a dissertation about California oil politics .
At the time , I struggled to link my personal commitment to public outreach and social change with my training in American history .
I knew that my study of how politics and public policy had shaped the California oil economy had direct implications for current energy policy .
In the past few years , the California electricity crisis , the Enron debacle , the National Energy Plan , and climate change negotiations have underscored just how intertwined are energy and politics in the United States .
Understanding the history of these politics , and how they helped get us where we are today , will be crucial to dealing with our current predicament .
Despite these clear connections , I did n’t feel trained , as most young academics do n’t , to develop a public voice on pressing environmental issues or to link scholarship to policy .
To the contrary , our relatively cautious academic culture and the tenure system force fledgling professors into a period of relative conformity , public silence , and isolation .
By the time we come up for air post - tenure , many of us have lost social and professional connections to people outside the university and have been socialized to view pragmatic or political activities with great skepticism .
I certainly felt this happening to me .
Nor is it just academics who feel isolated .
My peers at nonprofits and in government complained about burnout , lack of mentoring and connections to people outside their area of expertise , and an absence of opportunities for serious reflection , personal development , and leadership training .
While I struggled personally with these issues in the mid-1990s , on a broader scale progressives and environmentalists had grown increasingly aware of the role that public thinkers play in advancing economic , social and environmental policies .
An influential 1997 report by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy , Moving a Public Policy Agenda : the Strategic Philanthropy of Conservative Foundations , documented how conservative donors had mobilized a powerful network of right - wing thinkers to influence national policy debates .
One of the distinctive attributes of this strategic philanthropy was the long - term investment made in relatively young activists and thinkers .
What were progressives doing to harness this kind of energy for their own causes ?
Progressive politics seemed too issue - based , short - term , and tentative .
With seed funding from the Nathan Cummings Foundation , I worked with 10 colleagues to design a new fellowship program for emerging environmental leaders .
We sought to invest in the future of the environmental movement by training a new generation of leaders to shape the policy debate .
We wanted to foster a community of risk - takers in different fields , people who would cross-fertilize the broader movement and support each other in their efforts to innovate .
In the process , we sought to work with our fellows to develop new models for environmental leadership , ones that would emphasize diversity , collaboration across sectors , personal sustainability , and effective communication .
We also sought to move beyond an elite , Washington , D.C. , focus to develop leaders throughout the nation — people who could speak from a base of expertise , rather than as disconnected talking heads .
The colleagues with whom I launched the Environmental Leadership Program , who now serve mostly on the Board of Trustees or staff , were all in their late twenties or early thirties .
We designed ELP around needs that we felt ourselves , and over the past three years , the staff and board have stayed closely involved .
The retreat this week , when ELP will “ graduate ” its first class of fellows , is also a “ coming of age ” for the entire organization .
And so I fly to Seattle to celebrate the first three years of our work , and to get ready to take the next steps .
The Problem With Friendly Dictators
What is the problem with friendly dictators ?
During a discussion on Fox this week about Musharraf , William Kristol explained :
KRISTOL : They are sending Deputy Secretary Negroponte over there earlier this weekend .
This is the Marcos moment , I think , where we tell our ally , the friendly and decent dictator , that his time has passed .
The problem with these friendly dictators is they end up wanting to hang on , they like being dictators beyond when it is in their country 's national interest , and beyond when it is in our interest .
I think this actually manageable .
I do think Musharraf is going to have to go .
This is why we need experts like William Kristol .
Unsophisticated people might think the problem with friendly dictators is the " dictator " part .
In particular , individuals whose testicles the friendly dictators have hooked up to electrodes often focus on this to the exclusion of what actually matters , which is whether or not the dictators are effectively serving the needs of William Kristol and his friends .
Then there 's the dictators themselves .
They often are concerned with the way the lifespan of ex-dictators tends to be short .
What they do n't understand is that they should be happy to die if that 's convenient for their employer , the United States .
Just as William Kristol does n't worry about what happens to his maids after they 've outlived their usefulness , why should he worry about his dictators ?
( Thanks to Dan for sending me this . )
Oh No! British People !
I did a guest post for The Observer in the UK .
Here ’s the link .
I hope some American servers spring to my defense !
Many thanks to the crew at The Observer for running this article .
It was all in good fun .
Cheerio !
Godfrey left Iraq in February 2005 , frustrated that the waste he ’d encountered seemed uncontrollable .
He had come across officials from the Defense Contract Management Agency , his team leader ’s former billet , and he had little faith that they would succeed where he had failed .
“ The ones I met were pathetic , ” he says .
“ Some had no experience : they ’d just got their degrees .
They did n’t ask questions , and they missed the issues that I brought up .
They had access to me and my memos , and not once did one ever come to me and say , ‘ Can we talk , Barry ? ’ ”
Apart from its connections in Washington , there is something else that protects KBR : the perception , widespread throughout the military , that it has provided generally good - quality services in war - zone conditions .
As Grayson puts it , “ Halliburton ’s philosophy is not to deliver crap .
Halliburton ’s philosophy is to deliver extraordinarily overpriced but adequate services in support of the government . ”
That these have cost billions of dollars more than they should have is an inconvenient detail , and already the Pentagon is moving on .
Officials now accept that the monopoly granted by logcap 3 had its drawbacks , and at the end of June the army announced that the contract will soon be terminated and replaced with a new one , logcap 4 .
Under this , the largesse will be split among three corporations : DynCorp , Fluor , and KBR .
logcap 4 is another cost - plus , indefinite - delivery , indefinite - quantity contract , but at least this time KBR ’s income , as well as DynCorp ’s and Fluor ’s , will be capped .
Over the next 10 years , KBR will have to satisfy itself with charging American taxpayers $ 50 billion for its services under logcap 4 .
These improvements may turn out to be little more than cosmetic .
According to Bowen , what ’s needed is full disclosure of all subcontracting arrangements and a substantial increase in the number of officials who spend their time designing and policing contracts .
With logcap 4 , however , the reverse is about to happen .
The government agencies responsible for oversight will be assisted by Serco , a Virginia - based services company that in February was awarded a “ planning support contract ” worth up to $ 45 million a year .
The Bush administration maintains that hiring Serco to regulate logcap 4 will improve efficiency and counter fraud and waste .
David Walker , of the G.A.O. , fears that the weakened state of oversight is poised to get “ much worse . ”
Not only is there a large “ skills gap , ” but “ a significant percentage of the existing contract workforce is eligible to retire or will be eligible to retire within the next few years . ”
Outsourcing oversight brings still more problems in its wake , he says , starting with conflicts of interest , which arise whenever the company being monitored has other business , existing or potential , with the one doing the monitoring .
False Claims
Act suits could help to remedy these deficiencies , if only the Department of Justice were n’t suppressing them .
One day , though , the seals on the complaints will have to be lifted .
“ I wish I could tell you about the ones that are under seal , ” says Grayson , “ because some of them really are time bombs .
They ’re literally burying these cases to keep the public from finding out about them , and to keep anything from being done on them .
But it is a time bomb , because any normal amount of attention on these cases would result in massive amounts of money being recovered for the taxpayers . ”
There are a few encouraging signs that a day of reckoning is drawing near .
Committees in both the House and the Senate have held hearings on contracting in Iraq , and several plan to hold more .
Patrick Leahy , the Democratic chairman of the Senate judiciary committee , has introduced a War Profiteering Prevention Act , which would make it much easier to investigate corrupt contractors and call them to account .
And in August , the news that tens of thousands of weapons intended for Iraqi security forces had vanished or been stolen prompted the Pentagon to announce that its inspector general , Claude M. Kicklighter , would lead an 18 - person team to investigate “ contracting practices ” in Iraq .
In the more distant future , a Democratic administration might open up the vaults and expose the American public to the scale of what has been looted .
“ What we have seen up to now is the worst of the worst in terms of a deliberate cover - up , ” Grayson says .
But if and when it comes to an end , he thinks it ’s entirely possible that Congress will appoint a special prosecutor — one whose targets might one day reach “ an extremely high level . ”

Doubts over whether intelligence law update was necessary in German arrests Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 11 , 2007
Print This Email This Attempting to convince Congress to make permanent updates to a US surveillance law , the nation 's top intelligence official said the government 's expanded spy powers contributed to German terror arrests this month .
But some doubt whether the investigation hinged on the newly approved warrantless wiretapping authority .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell credited updates to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which were approved by Congress in August , with allowing the United States to obtain information that led to the arrests of three Islamic militants suspected of planning attacks in Germany .
" I am deeply skeptical about anything the DNI asserts these days -- he 's already shown his willingness to manipulate to get what he wants .
And the fact is that under FISA as it existed for more than 30 years , before he gutted it last month , the NSA could monitor calls between two foreigners in foreign countries without warrants , " Lisa Graves , deputy director of the Center for National Security Studies , told RAW STORY via e-mail , noting that the main impact of the expansion was to allow warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' conversations with targets abroad .
" In my view , McConnell has lost substantial credibility - - he 's Dick Cheney 's pointman on rewriting U.S. surveillance laws to the detriment of our constitutional rights . "
A government official who was briefed on the arrests cast doubt on McConnell 's assessment .
The official , who requested anonymity to discuss classified information , told the New York Times that information leading to the arrests was collected last year , before the law was updated .
Until Congress passed a temporary expansion of the FISA law -- just hours before lawmakers went on a month - long recess in early August -- intelligence agencies were required to seek warrants to monitor at least some phone calls and e-mails between foreign suspects when the communications were routed through the United States .
The update expires in five months , and McConnell 's remarks " were an important part of the Bush administration 's intensifying effort to make permanent the new law , " reported Eric Schmitt in the Times .
German officials have backed the US official 's account and said US intercepts of e-mail messages and telephone calls between Germany and Pakistan and Turkey last year tipped them off to the plot , the Times reported .
A German federal prosecutor , Monika Harms , said authorities were involved in an " intense , six - month investigation , " the International Herald Tribune reported when the suspects were arrested .
At a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Monday , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , the committee 's chairman , asked McConnell whether " the newly adopted law facilitated ( surveillance of the German suspects ) during August ? "
" Yes , sir , it did , " McConnell said .
" The connections to al Qaeda , the connections specifically to what 's referred to as IJU , the Islamic Jihad Union , an affiliate of al Qaeda .
Because we could understand it , we could help our partners through a long process of monitoring and observation .
...
And so at the right time , when Americans and German facilities were being targeted , the German authorities decided to move . "
When Congress returned after Labor Day , Democrats pledged to revisit the FISA updates they had passed , and many called for a permanent fix to include extra protections for Americans ' civil liberties .
Privacy and civil liberties advocates have said they fear that Congress will be unable to roll back any of the expanded powers granted to the Bush administration .
In his testimony , McConnell said " 50 percent of our ability to track , understand and know about these terrorists " would be lost without the FISA expansion , and he called for liability protections for telecommunications companies that assist US spying efforts .
On Rebellion By The Majority And Writs Against The People
" An act for the better securing the liberty of the subject , and for prevention of imprisonments beyond the seas . "
Habeas Corpus Act , 1679
" Habeas corpus " shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . "
U.S. Constitution
Regarding Habeas Corpus – i.e. , the body of evidence - it is strange that our Constitution contains the clause that habeas corpus " shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . "
Invasion from an external enemy we can understand , but rebellion ?
Public safety ?
The meanings here are dangerously vague , and too easily abused and applied to situations not warranting the draconian response .
Rebellion by whom ?
For what ?
Is it a rebellion by the vast majority ?
Was not our own rebellion in 1776 the very movement that led to the re-vitalization of habeas corpus and the defeat of the divine right of Kings and the arbitrary power of Regency ?
In effect , does this exception condemn the people from ever re-taking their own government from ruling elites - all due to the fact a very small minority of people currently in power can suspend our rights , imprison us , and defeat reforms supported by the vast majority ?
Is this " rebellion " exception a good idea ?
Did the founders screw up on this one , particularly in view of their own rebellion against the British ?
Did they simply copy the language of the British act without adequate forethought about any applications of the " Great Writ " to future conditions in America ?
" Habeas Corpus is an ancient common law prerogative writ - a legal procedure to which you have an undeniable right .
It is an extraordinary remedy at law .
Upon proper application , or even on naked knowledge alone , a court is empowered , and is duty bound , to issue the Extraordinary Writ of Habeas Corpus commanding one who is restraining liberty to forthwith produce before the court the person who is in custody and to show cause why the liberty of that person is being restrained .
Absent a sufficient showing for a proper restraint of liberty , the court is duty bound to order the restraint eliminated and the person discharged .
Habeas Corpus is fundamental to American and all other English common law derivative systems of jurisprudence .
It is the ultimate lawful and peaceable remedy for adjudicating the providence of liberty ’s restraint .
Since the history of Habeas Corpus is predominately English we must visit that history to gain understanding of American use of Habeas Corpus . "
Joseph Dale Robertson
Habeas corpus is simply a writ issued to bring a party before a court to prevent unlawful restraint .
The premise is that you cannot be held against your will without some just cause .
In short , you can not be jailed if there are no charges against you .
If you are being held , and you demand it , the courts must issue a writ of habeas corpus , which forces those holding you to answer as to why .
If there is no good or compelling reason , the court must set you free .
It is our right , from our Bill of Rights .
The importance of habeas corpus is illustrated by the fact that it was the sole liberty thought important enough to be included in the original text of the Constitution .
This growing advertising business gave Google the confidence to expand its audience .
Most significantly , in 2002 , America Online brought in Google to replace Overture , which provided both search and search ads ; that deal enshrined Google as the premier search engine and ad network .
Google won the deal by guaranteeing AOL a substantial sum , which it would not disclose .
Google was willing to make that bid only because of its confidence in its advertising sales prowess .
" If we were wrong , " Mr. Kordestani said , " there were some scenarios that would bankrupt the company . "
But by that point , Google had figured out that the same sort of computing and engineering skill that it used to find Web pages could also be used to improve the quality and , ultimately , the profitability of advertising .
" Initially , we did n't understand how fundamental the computer science was in advertising , " Mr. Schmidt said .
" We did n't have enough staffing or focus on this area .
I managed to fix that . "
GOOGLE introduced its current system for determining which ad to show on which page late last year .
It is a wonder of technology that rivals its search engine in complexity .
For every page that Google shows , more than 100 computers evaluate more than a million variables to choose the advertisements in its database to display -- and they do it in milliseconds .
The computers look at the amount bid and the budget of the advertiser , but they also consider the user -- such as his or her location , which they try to infer by analyzing the user 's Internet connections -- as well as the time of day and myriad other factors Google has tracked and analyzed from its experience with advertisements .
" If someone is coming from a particular location , a certain ad may be more popular there , " explained Jeff Huber , Google 's vice president for engineering .
" The system can use all the signals available , and the system itself learns the correlations between them . "
This technology is both amazing and potentially frightening .
Google already collects and keeps vast amount of data about what Web pages and advertisements each of its users click on , and it can evaluate that history -- and compare it with that of hundreds of millions of other users -- to select the ad shown on each page .
For now , Google says it identifies users only by a number in a cookie it places on each computer that uses Google .
It says it has not connected the vast dossier of interests and behavior to specific users by name .
But that could change as Google offers more personal services -- like e-mail messages and social networking -- and works more tightly with partners who already have such personal information .
Lauren Weinstein , the founder of the Privacy Forum , said the data that Google collects creates troubling privacy issues , especially because it declines to say what data it keeps or for how long .
" If you start to target people based on a corpus of data , it can be abused in various ways internally and externally by organizations and government agencies , " he said .
Government investigators and lawyers in civil suits regularly get court orders to force Internet companies to reveal e-mail messages and other personal information about users .
Google recently rewrote its privacy policy to make it easier to understand what data it collects , but it did not scale back its data retention .
Nor did it , as Mr. Weinstein and others have demanded , give users the right to see the data collected about them and their computers .
We cannot think first and act afterward .
From the moment of birth we are immersed in action , and can only fitfully guide it by taking thought .
— Alfred North Whitehead
It ’s the starting point for almost every personal development geek :
What do I want to do with my life ?
You ’ve no doubt learned many of the questions you ’re supposed to ask at this point :
What would you do with your life if you had $ 100,000,000 in the bank ?
What would you do even if you were n’t getting paid to do it ?
What would you do if you knew you could n’t fail ?
And the questions get more and more clever :
What would you do if you already had the relationship of your dreams ?
What would you do if retirement were n’t an option ?
What would you do if … zzzZZ…zZzZZ … camel approached you in the desert … zZzZ…z Zz …you had to choose between terminal cancer , dying in a plane crash , or…zZZ…zzz …
Ever notice how you can ask yourself these question for days , weeks , months , even years , and still not arrive at a satisfactory answer ?
It ’s like you ’re training for the Indecision Olympics , and you ’re gunning for the Gold .
The drawback with a question - oriented approach to this problem is that it ’s at best a limited way to attack the issue , and at worst can easily point you in the wrong direction and cost you a lot of time , money , and effort .
To understand why , think of it this way :
If I were to ask you where your ideal place to live would be , what would you say ?
Your range of informed responses would be limited to only those places you ’ve already visited , none of which may actually be ideal for you .
Naming somewhere you had n’t yet been would be just a guess .
Yet for some reason , we think we can ask our way into our ideal life , making key navigational decisions based on limited experiential data or even none at all .
Figuring out what you want in life is not about asking the right questions .
It ’s about taking massive action across a wide variety of domains and determining which activities you enjoy most .
You can ponder all you want , but when it comes to discovering your passions , the only substitute for raw experience tested against the measuring stick of your emotions is , well , nothing .
To figure out what you ’re madly in love with in any aspect of your life , become an experience gourmand .
Try as many things as you can .
Live every day as a taste test and savour the flavours you cook up through trial and error .
Activate your Weird Idea Radar : when you see an opportunity to try something you ’d normally consider off the beaten path , Just Do It .
Not only is an action addiction infinitely more fun than ready - aim - aim - aiming , it will also give you a much more accurate and precise idea of what your true passions are .
For example , a couple of years ago a musically - talented friend of mine proposed the idea of starting a recorder group .
You know , that plastic stick thing that you played in music class in grade three ?
Yep , that ’s the one .
This proposal set my Weird Idea Radar off so loudly that it almost shattered windows .
Which is exactly why I said Yes .
We ended up playing once a week , off and on , for about a year .
It was fun and it certainly paved new neural pathways in my harmonically - challenged brain .
While I never got deeply into it , I did enjoy the social experience of learning and practicing new songs .
I eventually ended up leaving the recorder world behind , but not without first experiencing many moments of musical ecstasy .
Heh .
Asking questions is still useful , of course .
The problem occurs when you start spending all your time asking questions and little time out in the world finding answers .
How long is too long to be stuck in thoughtspace ?
In my experience , the answer is usually a line drawn by frustration .
When you start feeling disappointed with yourself and annoyed that you ’re whittling away in a whirlpool of wondering , it ’s time to shake things up and hitch a ride to anywhere you have n’t been before .

Yesterday morning , Pauline and Vincent Matherick drove their nervous and emotional 11 - year - old foster son 18 miles to his new home .
It was a painful parting .
After two happy years at the Mathericks ' five - bedroom house in Somerset , the boy - who we shall call David - did not want to leave his foster parents and go back into council care .
Nor did the Mathericks want him to go .
Scroll down for more ...
As they packed up his toys , clothes and leaving presents , they were distraught at the prospect of putting him in a residential unit .
" David cried when we told him he could n't stay with us any more , and said : ' I do n't want to go , ' " says 61 - year - old Pauline Matherick .
" But he is trying to be very mature about it for a little fellow .
We 've told him we are getting too old to be foster carers and have to retire , which he understands . "
What the Mathericks have n't told David , however , is that they were effectively forced to retire .
If they had n't , they say , the council would have de-registered them and taken him away anyway , all because the Mathericks refused to sign a new agreement which they claim would have required them to promote homosexuality .
Earlier this year , Somerset County Council 's social services asked the Mathericks to sign a new contract to implement Labour 's new Sexual Orientation Regulations - part of the 2006 Equality Act , which makes discrimination on the grounds of sexuality illegal .
" When we first became foster parents in 2001 we signed a contract agreeing not to discriminate against people on the basis of religion , race or sexuality , " says Pauline , who with her 65 - year - old husband Vincent has fostered 28 vulnerable children in just six years .
" We were happy to sign .
" We 've never discriminated against anyone and never would , but this new agreement seemed to go beyond that .
" Our social worker came to see us at our home , because you have to be passed every year by a panel , and we were totally unprepared for what she had to say .
She was talking about attending sexual orientation seminars and threw hypothetical questions at us , asking how we'd feel if one of our foster children had a gay parent and how we 'd explain same - sex relationships to them .
" We were asked what we would do if a parent and his or her same - sex partner wanted to visit the child at our home .
" There was even talk of taking teenagers to gay association meetings if they expressed an interest in samesex relationships , and explaining about gay dating .
" We were told that failure to accept same - sex relationships could be seen as homophobia .
" I have to admit I lost my cool , and we had quite a heated debate with our social worker .
" We made it quite clear that we could not promote homosexuality , but would be quite prepared to refer the matter back to social services if a child ever brought the issue up .
" We said we were happy for any biological parent to visit the child , regardless of their sexuality , but not necessarily a gay partner who had no direct connection to the child .
" Afterwards , the social worker told us the panel would never approve us to continue as foster parents if we held such views .
We were stunned .
" So , rather than be de-registered , we reluctantly decided to retire .
We did n't want to , but how could we agree to something that goes against everything we believe in as Christians ? "
Mr Matherick adds : " It 's terrible that we have been forced into this action .
There are too few foster carers around anyway without these rules . "
And so the Mathericks found themselves having to break the news to their foster son that they were retiring and could no longer care for him .
They offered to let the boy stay with them until a new foster home could be found , but say social services refused .
And so yesterday , he left the foster parents he adores , to start another new chapter in his already turbulent life .
" Our foster son has had a few months to come to terms with it and is coping very well .
David knows that it is not a rejection , " says Pauline , who has three adult children , six grandchildren and one great - grandchild of her own .
" We 've played up the fact we are getting older , and when my husband plays cricket with him he 'll say : ' Ooh my back .
I 'm getting too old for this . '"
" We do n't want David to feel upset or resentful towards social services and quite frankly he 's too young for a discussion about the more complex issues .
" All we have ever wanted to do is give every foster child who stays with us tender loving care and some happy , fun , childhood memories .
" So this week we had a big family party so that everyone could say goodbye and we took David to his favourite restaurant .
We 've tried to make it as happy as we can .
' " e's a big boy now , but also a little boy at heart .
He still likes his cars , toys and computer games .
" My mind just boggles at how ludicrous the whole situation is , and I feel incredibly sad for him .
" Of all the children we have fostered , not one of them has ever even raised with us the question of their sexuality .
" Not a single child has ever said they thought they might be gay .
" None of their parents , as far as we know , has been gay .
" To promote same - sex relationships when talking to such young children is , to my mind , morally wrong . "
The Mathericks never wanted to air their views publicly .
When they made the decision to retire , Pauline says , they wanted to " go quietly " .
However , increasingly they feel that they are the ones being discriminated against - because of their faith - and are taking legal advice from the Lawyers ' Christian Fellowship with a view to fighting their case in the courts .
Minutes of the meeting they attended with their social worker and a manager , which they claim states they would be expected to promote homosexuality , are in the hands of their barristers .
Why , they ask , should gay rights be placed above religious belief : is it legal , they ask , for these new rules to exclude them as foster carers should they refuse to betray those beliefs ?
Indeed , they constantly wonder at a politically correct world which questions their suitability to foster children because of social services ' terror of " homophobia " .
For this disturbing case must be viewed in the wider context of how fostering is being managed around the country .
Take , for example , the damning independent inquiry which last month revealed that " political correctness " at Wakefield Metropolitan District Council in Yorkshire allowed a pair of homosexual foster carers to abuse children in their care .
Managers and social workers were reluctant to investigate Craig Faunch , 33 , and Ian Wathey , 42 - jailed last year for a string of offences against four boys at their home in Pontefract - for fear of being accused of prejudice .
The Mathericks believe that they too are victims of political correctness and fear of causing offence to just one small section of society .
They are not the first Christians to take a stand over what they regard as discrimination .
Magistrate Andrew McClintock resigned from the family courts in a row over gay adoption .
He claimed he was forced to quit because he was not allowed to opt out of cases where he might have to send a child to live with gay parents .
He lost his tribunal hearing , but is awaiting the results of an appeal .
The Mathericks , who have been married for 43 years , are both ministers at the non-conformist South Chard Christian Church .
Their views on homosexuality , they say , are shaped by the Bible and God 's teachings .
They say without apology that they cannot reconcile those teachings with what they are being asked to do today , and wo n't pretend they can just to please social services .
Given that most of the children they have fostered are of primary school age , their beliefs concerning homosexuality have been completely irrelevant to date .
The Christian tenets concerning love , forgiveness , acceptance , joy and kindness have - as far as they are concerned - been far more important to these damaged young individuals .
Together , the Mathericks have travelled the world working with the poor and children in orphanages , and in Britain ran a travel agency organising tours to the Holy Land .
Their three children , two sons and a daughter , now aged 41 , 40 and 39 , wereall brought up in the Christian faith .
The Mathericks maintain they have never forced their beliefs on their children , but rather allowed them to make their own judgments .
" My younger son is n't a practising Christian , " says Pauline , " but that does n't upset me .
Everyone has to find their own way in life .
" We have never tried to indoctrinate anyone .
We have always taken the younger foster children to church because they enjoy making new friends at Sunday School , but we have always given the older children the choice not to attend . "
It was their love of children which made the Mathericks want to become foster carers , and when they first applied they were welcomed with open arms .
There is a chronic shortage of foster carers in Britain and it is estimated today that 8,000 are needed to plug the gap in services .
" I thought it would be a doddle being a foster parent .
I thought : ' I 've brought up three children and have worked in Sunday School and orphanages , ' " says Pauline , who with her husband underwent social services training and was approved by a panel of childcare professionals .
" But it is incredibly hard .
" It 's very different loving and caring for a child who 's been hurt or emotionally damaged .
Think of the worst things that could happen to a child ; we had foster children who had suffered it all . "
The first placement at the Mathericks ' 700 - year - old thatched Devon long house was a teenage mother and her baby .
It was such a success - they are still in contact - that more children followed .
Some placements , however , were not as successful as others .
" We had another teenage mother and her baby , but it was very difficult , " says Pauline .
" She just could n't cope with the baby at all , and it was not a happy experience for us because the baby was eventually taken away for adoption .
We had children of all ages .
" Some stayed for just a short time , others for a year or so , and with each one we tried to give them some happiness and joy .
" We 'd take them to the beach every weekend , even in winter , or for walks .
Real childhood experiences which many of them had never had before .
" There were a couple of times when we asked for a child to be taken away .
One teenage boy was verbally and physically very abusive towards us , and another used to creep up behind my husband and punch him in the back for no reason at all .
" Vincent has suffered two heart attacks in the past and we realised we were better suited to caring for younger children who needed love and care rather than older , more challenging teenagers who needed a more disciplined approach .
" It was heartbreaking knowing the histories of some of these children , but many flourished , and I will never forget one little girl saying to me : ' I wish you were my mum . '
That made me cry . "
The only sexual issues Pauline ever discussed with her foster children was when they confided in her about being abused before being taken into care .
" These poor children had no self - esteem .
They felt completely worthless , " says Pauline .
" It was so sad .
They could n't see the point of their lives and we'd talk about their feelings and emotions .
" Sometimes all we could do was just provide them with some security for a while , some tender loving care and a few outings to make them smile . "
There will be no more foster children now and the Mathericks admit there will be a huge gap in their lives .
" Although David has gone into a residential unit , we have been told we can stay in touch with him , which we are thrilled about , " says Vincent .
" We have now taken on the role of grandparents .
We will see him every other Sunday because he has asked if he can still go to Sunday School .
" He 's already placed his order for lunch .
But we would much rather he was still with us .
It 's all well and good following rules and regulations to the letter , but what about the children ?
" We 've had many calls from Christians all over the world and foster carers in this country , expressing their concern , and our one piece of advice to them is to read the small print before you agree to sign anything .
" It 's one thing to agree not to discriminate , but quite another to agree to promote something which is in opposition to your religious beliefs . "
Pauline adds : " We have never discriminated against gay people , or anyone else .
" We have stayed with people of different races , religions and beliefs and respected their right to hold their own views even when we did n't agree with them . "
Last night Linda Barnett , head of Somerset County Council 's children 's social care , told the Mail there had been an unfortunate " misunderstanding " between the Mathericks and their social worker during discussions about the new regulations .
" We do not and would never ask foster carers to promote homosexuality , " she said .
" What we ask for is no different from any other authority , in that we ask carers not to discriminate against a child on the basis of race , gender , background , religion , accent or sexuality , among other things .
" The Mathericks were very good foster carers and so I have invited them to meet me next week to see if we can reach some kind of agreement , so they can continue to work with us .
" We did not de-register the Mathericks ; they made the decision to retire based on what I believe to be a misunderstanding . "
As for the refusal to let David stay with them until a new home could be found , she added : " Every decision we make is with the best interests of the child at the forefront . "
Pauline and Vincent Matherick have been heartened by this olive branch - which it must be said only arrived after Somerset County Council received a legal letter from the Mathericks ' lawyers .
" We are hoping that we will be able to continue fostering in some way , " says Pauline .
" All we have ever wanted to do is help these children . "
What a tragedy for this couple and the children who may now never find comfort in their home .
And what an indictment of a system in which ideology seems to have been allowed to trample all over common sense .
Can Religion Offset the Effects of Child Poverty ?
Dubner and Levitt have written quite a bit about parenting , both in Freakonomics and on this blog .
In particular , they ’ve focused on what parents can do to help produce “ successful ” offspring .
The key , they ’ve found , is this : be well - educated and successful yourself , and your children are more likely to follow suit .
But what about children from impoverished backgrounds ?
What steps can poor parents take to counterbalance the effects of poverty ?
According to Rajeev Dehejia , an economics professor at Tufts University , one answer may be to join a church .
Dehejia , along with Thomas DeLeire , an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , and Erzo Luttmer and Josh Mitchell , from the Harvard economics department , have written a new working paper called “ The Role of Religious and Social Organizations in the Lives of Disadvantaged Youth . ”
In it , they test the impact of religion on more than 20,000 children raised by “ disadvantaged ” families , as defined by factors like family income , the parents ’ levels of education , and “ child characteristics including parental assessments of the child . ”
Using the National Survey of Families and Households , they questioned each child on the amount of involvement his or her parent had with a religious organization , then observed the child ’s outcome 13 to 15 years later , as measured by education , income , and levels of health and psychological well - being .
Their findings are summarized as follows :
Overall , we find strong evidence that youth with religiously active parents are less affected later in life by childhood disadvantage than youth whose parents did not frequently attend religious services .
These buffering effects of religious organizations are most pronounced when outcomes are measured by high school graduation or non-smoking and when disadvantage is measured by family resources or maternal education , but we also find buffering effects for a number of other outcome - disadvantage pairs .
We generally find much weaker buffering effects for other social organizations .
Of course , a parent ’s decision to practice a religion may coincide with other traits like self - discipline , community involvement , and mentoring skills , all of which will likely affect a child ’s upbringing .
Not to mention the fact that the authors offer no analysis of whether a parent ’s including the child in the religion has any effect :
Our data do not allow us to determine to what extent the buffering effects are driven by religious organizations actively intervening in the lives of disadvantaged youth ( through tutoring , mentoring , or financial assistance ) as opposed to providing the youth with motivation , values , or attitudes that lead to better outcomes .
Still , it appears that , particularly where education and smoking habits are concerned , a parent ’s heading to a church , synagogue , or mosque might be useful in counteracting the negative effects of child poverty .
Assuming , of course , the parents are n’t also stocking their child ’s bedroom with copies of Richard Dawkins .
Thord ( he of Swedish descent and bearing a reputation for ‘ crack ’ design skills ) writes about the two most important skills a blogger can have .
# 2 is knowing how to blow your own horn ( ‘ toot ’ is so politically correct it gives me a shiver ) .
Thord discusses it in some detail , and I like this part best :
Some of us have some kind of roadblock built in that stops us from promoting ourselves .
Get over it .
Or get run over .
The # 1 skill Thord talks about is knowing how to write good blog posts .
Seeing as how T left the door open there , here ’s my two ( or three ) cents on how one may go about writing ‘ good ’ blog posts .
Like all good 3 step lists , this one is a model of simplicity :
Define what ‘ good ’ is – use concrete measurements instead of an arbitrary feel - good factor Learn how to achieve the results defined above Execute ( and then some ) .
If it was as easy as writing it above , no blog consultant would have a job .
As things stand , there ’s a lot more to it under the surface although as I ’ve discussed below , once you internalise this formula ( or you start writing for a blog that gets tons of traffic ) it becomes effortless .
So let ’s get started with step 1 – defining what a ‘ good ’ blog post is .
Step 1 : Set Standards for ‘ Good ’ Blog Posts
‘ Good ’ is an arbitrary , unclear objective .
One man ’s ‘ good ’ is another man ’s masterpiece , while the rest of the population may consider it absolutely crap .
You need a precise measurement of what a good blog post is , and for this you will need to know your blog ’s key objectives ( and your role in achieving them ) .
Different blogs measure success in different ways .
An established celeb gossip blogger would judge success in terms of sheer traffic / long - term search rankings a post brings .
A budding car blogger could measure success in terms of the links a post gets .
Someone writing on a sports blog geared towards building a strong community could measure success in terms of the # of comments each article generates .
And while we ’re at it , there ’s also a difference in scale – Seth Godin receives a minimum of 10 - 20 links for each post that he writes .
His baseline for a ‘ good ’ post would be far higher than for the owner of a newly - launched blog who ’d consider 5 links to be a home run .
If you own your blog , then you ’re likely to have several different objectives that define success .
Comments , Traffic / Pageviews , Links , RSS Subscriptions and Search Rankings are the most common , but you may have something different based on your specific situation .
It ’s a good thing to have different objectives – it gives you space to write different types of posts and be successful as opposed to doing the same thing over and over again .
If you are blogging for hire / guest blogging , you will most likely have a brief or some instructions on what the blog owner wants from you ( you should ask if you ’re not told ) .
For example , for one of my blogs I tell my writers that they have to meet one of 3 objectives with each post – get X number of comments , Y amount of traffic or Z number of links .
Set out your stall in terms of the objectives you want to reach , and then attach concrete values on them .
You can get a good idea for what values to use if you look at your blog ’s recent history and pick out the most successful posts ( according to different objectives ) .
For a new blog , you ’ll probably have to set a conservative number and then readjust as you go along .
Step 2 : Learn How To Achieve Each Objective
Do you know how to get more comments to your posts ?
Do you know how to write posts that attract links ?
This step is perhaps the easiest of all 3 .
There is tons and TONS of blogging advice on the Internet ( the fastest way to get started is to head over to the Best of Performancing page ) , it ’s only a matter of finding the right information and using it .
Want more RSS subscribers ?
Got them here and here .
Want better search engine rankings ?
Got that too .
For any objective that you set yourself in Step 1 , you ’re likely to find quality , executable advice for achieving that objective on the Internet .
And here ’s an open offer – if you do n’t find it on the Best of Performancing page or by searching through Google , drop a line in the comments and I ’ll hunt it down ( or write it up ) for you .
Step 3 : Follow the Formula
In Step 1 , you defined your goals .
In Step 2 , you figured out how to get there .
Now all you have to do is connect the dots .
It ’s as easy as it sounds , but there are a few things you should be aware of at the start :
A good blog post is mediocre on a poor blog , fabulous on a good blog .
Learn how to build a kick - ass blog .
You ’ll probably need to revise the targets set in Step 1 soon after starting on this path .
That ’s ok , do n’t fret – if you ’re going in the right direction , you ’ll only be revising them upwards .
Being a good blogger means building a skill - set .
Build your skills , and you ’ll have less difficulty in writing good blog posts .
You ’ll probably fail miserably in the beginning , or hit a home run and then tank .
Whenever you hit your first ‘ valley ’ , do n’t give up – that valley is designed by nature to weed out 90 % of the ‘ cant - hack - it ’ folks from the mix .
Once you ’re able to push through and rise again , you ’ll not only be a better blogger but you ’ll also be better than most ( 90 % + ) other bloggers out there .
Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to follow the rules .
In this case , following the formula works for a reason .
Innovate if you have room for error , play it safe when you do n’t ( unless you ’re feeling lucky 🙂 )
So there you have it .
Three simple steps to write ‘ good ’ blog posts .
These require some work at the start but once you ’ve internalised Step 2 ( through practice , experience , research and judicious use of bookmarks ) , it ’s simply a matter of picking a target and applying the formula .
At this stage , you might say :
“ Ok , so I know how to do all this , but what do I write about ? ”
Well , I ’ve got you covered there as well .
What Do I Write About ?
Here are a list of posts that I feel can solve any and all of your blogger ’s block problems .
Seriously .
And since we ’re talking about setting objectives and meeting them , I ’d appreciate it if you guys could bookmark this post in del.icio.us or give it a good Stumble .
Thank you .
A nerd needs a project because a nerd builds stuff .
All the time .
Those lulls in the conversation over dinner ?
That ’s the nerd working on his project in his head .
It ’s unlikely that this project is a nerd ’s day job because his opinion regarding his job is , “ Been there , done that . ”
We ’ll explore the consequences of this seemingly short attention span in a bit , but for now , this project is the other big thing your nerd is building , and I ’ve no idea what is , but you should .
At some point , you , the nerd ’s companion , were the project .
You were showered with the fire hose of attention because you were the bright and shiny new development in your nerd ’s life .
There is also a chance that you ’re lucky and you are currently your nerd ’s project .
Congrats !
Do n’t get too comfortable because he ’ll move on , and , when that happens , you ’ll be wondering what happened to all the attention .
This handbook might help .
Understand your nerd ’s relation to the computer .
It ’s clichéd , but a nerd is defined by her computer , and you need to understand why .
First , a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how a computer works or they look at it and think “ it ’s magic . ”
Nerds know how a computer works .
They intimately know how a computer works .
When you ask a nerd , “ When I click this , it takes awhile for the thing to show up .
Do you know what ’s wrong ? ” they know what ’s wrong .
A nerd has a mental model of the hardware and the software in her head .
While the rest of the world sees magic , your nerd knows how the magic works , she knows the magic is a long series of ones and zeros moving across your screen with impressive speed , and she knows how to make those bits move faster .
The nerd has based her career , maybe her life , on the computer , and as we ’ll see , this intimate relationship has altered her view of the world .
She sees the world as a system which , given enough time and effort , is completely knowable .
This is a fragile illusion that your nerd has adopted , but it ’s a pleasant one that gets your nerd through the day .
When the illusion is broken , you are going to discover that …
Your nerd has control issues .
Your nerd lives in a monospaced typeface world .
Whereas everyone else is traipsing around picking dazzling fonts to describe their world , your nerd has carefully selected a monospace typeface , which he avidly uses to manipulate the world deftly via a command line interface while the rest fumble around with a mouse .
The reason for this typeface selection is , of course , practicality .
Monospace typefaces have a knowable width .
Ten letters on one line are the same width as ten other letters , which puts the world into a pleasant grid construction where X and Y mean something .
These control issues mean your nerd is sensitive to drastic changes in his environment .
Think travel .
Think job changes .
These types of system - redefining events force your nerd to recognize that the world is not always or entirely a knowable place , and until he reconstructs this illusion , he ’s going to be frustrated , and he ’s going to act erratically .
I develop an incredibly short fuse during system - redefining events , and I ’m much more likely to lose it over something trivial and stupid .
This is one of the reasons that …
Your nerd has built himself a cave .
I ’ve written about The Cave elsewhere , but here are the basics .
The Cave is designed to allow your nerd to do his favorite thing , which is working on the project .
If you want to understand your nerd , stare long and hard at his Cave .
How does he have it arranged ?
When does he tend to go there ?
How long does he stay ?
Each object in the Cave has a particular place and purpose .
Even the clutter is well designed .
Do n’t believe me ?
Grab that seemingly discarded Mac Mini which has been sitting on the floor for two months and hide it .
You ’ll have 10 minutes before he ’ll come stomping out of the Cave — “ Where ’s the Mac ? ”
The Cave is also frustrating you because your impression is that it ’s your nerd ’s way of checking out , and you are , unfortunately , completely correct .
A correctly designed Cave removes your nerd from the physical world and plants him firmly in a virtual one complete with all the toys he needs .
Because …
Your nerd loves toys and puzzles .
The joy your nerd finds in his project is one of problem solving and discovery .
As each part of the project is completed , your nerd receives an adrenaline rush that we ’re going to call The High .
Every profession has this — the moment when you ’ve moved significantly closer to done .
In many jobs , it ’s easy to discern when progress is being made : “ Look , now we have a door . ”
But in nerds ’ bit - based work , progress is measured mentally and invisibly in code , algorithms , efficiency , and small mental victories that do n’t exist in a world of atoms .
There are other ways your nerd can create The High , and she does it all the time .
It ’s another juicy cliché to say that nerds love video games , but that ’s not what they love .
A video game is just one more system where your nerd ’s job is to figure out the rules that define it , which will enable her to beat it .
Yeah , we love to stare at games with a bazillion polygons , but we get the same high out of playing Bejeweled , getting our Night Elf to Level 70 , or endlessly tinkering with a Rubik ’s Cube .
This fits nicely with the fact that …
Nerds are fucking funny .
Your nerd spent a lot of his younger life being an outcast because of his strange affinity with the computer .
This created a basic bitterness in his psyche that is the foundation for his humor .
Now , combine this basic distrust of everything with your nerd ’s other natural talents , and you ’ll realize that he sees humor as another game .
Humor is an intellectual puzzle , “ How can this particular set of esoteric trivia be constructed to maximize hilarity as quickly as possible ? ”
Your nerd listens hard to recognize humor potential , and when he hears it , he furiously scours his mind to find relevant content from his experience so he can get the funny out as quickly as possible .
This quick wit is only augmented by the fact that …
Your nerd has an amazing appetite for information .
Many years ago , I dubbed this behavior NADD , and you should read the article to learn more and to understand what mental muscles your nerd has developed .
How does a nerd watch TV ?
Probably one of two ways .
First , there ’s watching TV with you where the two of you sit and watch one show .
Then there ’s how he watches by himself when he watches three shows at once .
It looks insane .
You walk into the room , and you ’re watching your nerd jump between channels every five minutes .
“ How can you keep track of anything ? ”
He keeps track of everything .
See , he ’s already seen all three of these movies … multiple times .
He knows the compelling parts of the arcs and is mentally editing his versions while watching all three .
The basic mental move here is the context switch , and your nerd is the king of the context switch .
The ability to instantly context switch also comes from a life on the computer .
Your nerd ’s mental information model for the world is one contained within well - bounded tidy windows where the most important tool is one that allows your nerd to move swiftly from one window to the next .
It ’s irrelevant that there may be no relationship between these windows .
Your nerd is used to making huge contextual leaps where he ’s talking to a friend in one window , worrying about his 401k in another , and reading about World War II in yet another .
You might suspect that given a world where context is constantly shifting , your nerd ca n’t focus , and you ’d be partially correct .
All that multi-tasking is n’t efficient .
Your nerd knows very little about a lot .
For many topics , his knowledge is an inch deep and four miles wide .
He ’s comfortable with this fact because he knows that deep knowledge about any topic is a clever keystroke away .
See …
Your nerd has built an annoyingly efficient relevancy engine in his head .
It ’s the end of the day , and you and your nerd are hanging out on the couch .
The TV is off .
There is n’t a computer anywhere nearby , and you ’re giving your nerd the daily debrief .
“ Spent an hour at the post office trying to ship that package to your mom , and then I went down to that bistro — you know — the one next to the flower shop , and it ’s closed .
Can you believe that ? ”
And your nerd says , “ Cool . ”
Cool ?
What ’s cool ?
The business closing ?
The package ?
How is any of it cool ?
None of it ’s cool .
All of it might be cool , but your nerd does n’t believe any of what you ’re saying is relevant .
This is what he heard , “ Spent an hour at the post office blah blah blah … ”
You can be rightfully pissed off by this behavior — it ’s simply rude — but seriously , remember that I ’m trying to help here .
Your nerd ’s insatiable quest for information and The High has tweaked her brain in an interesting way .
For any given piece of incoming information , your nerd is making a lightning fast assessment : relevant or not relevant ?
Relevance means that the incoming information fits into the system of things your nerd currently cares about .
Expect active involvement from your nerd when you trip the relevance flag .
If you trip the irrelevance flag , look for verbal punctuation announcing her judgment of irrelevance .
It ’s the word your nerd says when she ’s not listening , and it ’s always the same .
My word is “ Cool , ” and when you hear “ Cool , ” I ’m not listening .
Information that your nerd is exposed to when the irrelevance flag is waving is forgotten almost immediately .
I mean it .
Next time you hear “ Cool , ” I want you to ask , “ What ’d I just say ? ”
That awkward grin on your nerd ’s face is the first step in getting her to acknowledge that she ’s the problem in this particular conversation .
This behavior is one of the reasons that …
Your nerd might come off as not liking people .
Small talk .
Those first awkward five minutes when two people are forced to interact .
Small talk is the bane of the nerd ’s existence because small talk is a combination of aspects of the world that your nerd hates .
When your nerd is staring at a stranger , all he ’s thinking is , “ I have no system for understanding this messy person in front of me . ”
This is where the shy comes from .
This is why nerds hate presenting to crowds .
The skills to interact with other people are there .
They just lack a well - defined system .
Advanced Nerd Tweakage
If you ’re still reading , then I ’m thinking that your nerd is worth keeping .
Even though he ’s apt to vanish for hours , has a strange sense of humor , does n’t like you touching his stuff , and often does n’t listen when you ’re talking directly to him , he ’s a keeper .
Go figure .
My advice :
Map the things he ’s bad at to the things he loves .
You love to travel , but your nerd would prefer to hide in his cave for hours on end chasing The High .
You need to convince him of two things .
First , you need to convince him that you ’re going to do your best to recreate his cave in his new surrounding .
You ’re going to create a quiet , dark place here he can orient himself and figure out which way the water flushes down the toilet .
Traveling internationally ?
Carve out three days somewhere quiet at the beginning of the trip .
Traveling across the US ?
How about letting him chill on the bed for a half - day before you drag him out to see the Golden Gate Bridge ?
Second , and more importantly , you need to remind him about his insatiable appetite for information .
You need to appeal to his deep love of discovering new content and help him understand that there may be no greater content fire hose than waking up in a hotel overlooking the Grand Canal in Venice where you do n’t speak a word of Italian .
Make it a project .
You might ’ve noticed your nerd ’s strange relation to food .
Does she eat fast ?
Like really fast ?
You should know what ’s going on here .
Food is thrown into the irrelevant bucket because it ’s getting in the way of the content .
Exercise , too .
Thing is , you want your nerd to eat healthily so that she ’s here in another thirty years , so how do you change this behavior ?
You make diet and exercise the project .
For me , exercise became the project ten years ago after a horrible break - up .
When the project was no longer the Ex , I dove into exercise every single day of the week .
There were charts tracking my workouts , there were graphs tracking my weight , and there was the exercise .
Every single day for two years until the day I passed out in a McDonald ’s post - workout after not eating for a day .
Ok , so time for a new project .
Yeah , nerds also have moderation issues .
That ’s another essay .
Significant nerd behavioral change is only going to happen if your nerd engages in the project heart and soul .
Otherwise , it ’s just another thought for the irrelevant bucket .
People are the most interesting content out there .
If you ’ve got a seriously shy nerd on your hands , try this :
How many friends does he have in Facebook ?
How many folks are following him on Twitter ?
How many Slacks is he on ?
My guess is that , collectively , your nerd interacts with ten times more people than you think he does .
He can do this because the interaction is via a system he understands — the computer .
Your nerd knows that people are interesting .
Just because he can’t look your best friend straight in the eye does n’t mean he does n’t want to know what makes her tick , but you need to be the social buffer — the translation layer .
You need to find one common thread of interest between your nerd and your friend , and then he ’ll engage because he will have found relevance .
The Next High
As you discovered when you were the project , your nerd ’s focus can be deliciously overwhelming , but it will stop .
Once a nerd believe she fully knows how a system works , the challenge to understand ceases to exist , and she moves on in search of The Next High .
While I do n’t know who you are or why in the world you chose a nerd for your companion , I do know that you are not a knowable system .
I know that you are messy , just like your nerd .
Being your own quirky self will be more than enough to present new and interesting challenges to your nerd .
Besides , it ’s just as much a nerd ’s job to figure you out , and maybe someone somewhere is writing an article about your particular quirks .
Good news , she ’s probably reading it right now .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 9 — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has approved a plan to ease the strain of two wars on the military by increasing the size of the active - duty Army to 547,000 by 2010 , two years sooner than planned , officials said Tuesday .
Mr. Gates approved the accelerated timetable in a Sept. 26 memo that also barred the Army from reaching the goal by lowering its recruiting standards or employing “ stop loss , ” a practice of prohibiting soldiers from retiring .
The memo put the plan ’s cost at $ 2.6 billion over the next five years .
Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , the Army chief of staff , announced the 2010 goal in a speech on Tuesday at the Association of the United States Army convention here .
Army officials had previously said the timeline would be reduced by one year , to 2011 .
Army officials said they could achieve the increase through retention and recruiting , but conceded that achieving the goal in three years , rather than five , was ambitious .
“ Meeting this target will not be easy , ” General Casey said .
WHEN a television station closes down , it is not so unusual for its soap stars and journalists to bid tearful on - screen farewells .
The remarkable thing about the closure of Radio Caracas Televisión ( RCTV ) was that it was also marked by protest demonstrations by tens of thousands of Venezuelans .
That was not just because RCTV is Venezuela 's oldest television company and aired many of its favourite shows .
It was also because the protesters judged , rightly , that in pulling the plug on RCTV Hugo Chávez 's leftist government has taken another big step away from democracy .
After winning 63 % of the vote and another six - year term in a presidential election last December , Mr Chávez announced that RCTV 's broadcasting licence would not be renewed when it expired on May 27th .
The government 's reasons are that the channel acted as an opposition mouthpiece , and that it backed a short - lived coup against Mr Chávez in April 2002 .
His apologists around the world make the claim that , despite RCTV 's closure , Venezuela 's media remain free and plural .
It is true that RCTV 's news coverage was partisan — as is that of the state - owned channels .
It is also true — and reprehensible — that it supported the 2002 coup .
But these are dubious grounds for closing it , and are not Mr Chávez 's real reason for doing so .
After all , when it comes to coups , Mr Chávez has form : as an army officer he led one against a democratic government in 1992 .
This month he renewed the licence of Venevisión , another private channel whose stance was similar to that of RCTV in 2002 but which now refrains from criticising the government .
And if the issue was really that RCTV had broken the terms of its licence , under Venezuelan law that is a matter for the regulator and the courts , not the president .
Coincidentally , Mr Chávez has just merged the supposedly independent regulator with the Communications Ministry .
By closing RCTV Mr Chávez has silenced the most powerful source of media opposition to his “ 21st century socialism ” .
Only one other television station , a mainly - cable channel that can be seen by only 20 % of the population , is critical of the government — and it , too , this week faced threats from Mr Chávez ( see article ) .
The remaining channels all belong to the government or to sympathetic businessmen .
Some newspapers are more independent , but they increasingly now censor themselves in the face of harassment .
The difference between a mandate and a democracy
Mr Chávez remains personally popular , thanks to the massive increase in Venezuela 's oil revenues since he came to office , money that he has showered on social programmes of varying effectiveness .
But polls show that most Venezuelans opposed the closure of RCTV , and are unhappy at the government 's failure to tackle crime and food shortages .
The president 's electoral mandate is not a blank cheque .
Democracy is about much more than just elections — as the left itself has often argued .
It is also about political freedoms , the rule of law and checks on executive power .
Precious little of this still exists in Venezuela .
With television and the press now pretty much under the government 's thumb , how will anyone be able to call the next election free and fair ?
In the bad old days in Latin America , military dictators simply sent troops to close down obstreperous broadcasters and newspapers .
Mr Chávez is more subtle .
He has preserved the forms of democracy while gradually , but inexorably , eviscerating it .
In a continent that not long ago prided itself on its democratisation , that ought to outrage Venezuela 's neighbours .
It is high time they plucked up the courage to tell Mr Chávez that he is going in the wrong direction .
“ With enough inside information and a million dollars you can go broke in a year ” – Warren Buffet on stock tips
Myths , tips , inside information – however you state it , dangerous blanket statements and generalizations increase the learning curve of those practicing Video Game Optimization ( VGO ) .
Optimization myths thrive on complex hardware , legacy implementations , faith , and e-mail lists .
The following is a description of some of the most popular myths that I ’ve heard over the past 7 years of optimizing games .
Myth 1 : Pre-mature Optimization Is The Root Of All Evil
Before accusing me of disagreeing with Stanford ’s legend Donald Knuth [ pictured ] and a knighted programmer ( Sir C.A.R Hoare - quick sort inventor ) , realize that I am planning to agree with what has become the mantra for the reactive optimizer .
Let ’s examine the quote in its entirety .
“ Forget about small efficiencies , say about 97 % of the time : premature optimization is the root of all evil . ” - Donald Knuth .
A statement from a professional that exposes “ the root of all evil ” is very momentous , but when you examine the entire statement , it ’s easier to see the forest –not the tree .
I ’m not ordained to interpret programming scripture , but from this famous statement I infer the following : prematurely optimizing small efficiencies is usually the root of all evil ; prematurely optimizing large efficiencies is a necessity .
There are three levels of VGO , the system level , the application level , and the micro level .
The system level of optimization is where we as programmers examine our architecture and compare it to our system specs .
System level questions include : “ How many cores do we support ? ” , or “ Do we require a minimum level of shader support ? ” .
The application level of optimization is usually implemented at the class level .
Examples include quad trees , occlusion culling , and instancing .
Micro level optimizations , the most tangible and arguable level , are easily recognized since they exist within the domain of several , or single , lines of code .
There are more flavors of PC configurations then there are of Linux operating systems .
System level and application level optimizations are more likely to “ rise the tide ” of frame rates across combinations of AMD , Intel , Nvidia , CPUs and GPUs .
Micro optimizations tend to vary across different configurations more than the system or application levels .
Optimization is a part of design !
System and application levels of optimizations are best implemented during design .
If we miss these opportunities because we feel we are acting prematurely , then only an abundance of flexibility , the level at which few engines provide , will afford us the opportunity to integrate the optimization before shipping .
Pre-mature optimization of system and application optimizations is not the root of all evil .
Pre-mature optimization of the micro level is .
Myth 2 : Less Code Is Faster Than More
There are two polar opinions that dominate game programming personalities .
On the left , a personality I call the LEAN_AND_MEAN programmer .
On the right , is the class heavy abstractionist .
Which one is correct in regards to performance ?
I ’m afraid there is no clear winner , and in - fact , they may both be correct .
The amount of code you write before you compile does not always answer the more important questions about the runtime performance .
The argument against the abstractionist is that the overhead of their design is burdensome ; however , a well designed class hierarchy does not need to travel through many lines of code during execution .
A poorly designed class hierarchy will be the victim of its verbose design .
The argument against the LEAN_AND_MEAN programmer is the lack of flexibility needed reduce superfluous lines of code and rapid refactoring .
The bottom line - sometimes writing more code can reduce superfluous CPU and memory system work and maximize parallelism .
In this , both are taking the correct approach as long as the class heavy abstractionist uses a good design and the LEAN_AND_MEAN programmer manages superfluous execution and flexibility .
Unintuitive hardware can also propagate this myth .
A good example of how more lines of code can be faster than less is evident when using write - combined buffers .
Dynamic vertex buffers , when locked , sometimes use write - combined buffers , a memory type that does not travel through the cache system .
This is done to reduce the management of memory coherency between the GPU and the CPU .
When we use a write - combined buffer , it is important to update all 64 bytes of a write - combined buffer line .
If the entire 64 byte line is not updated , the write - combined buffer writes to system memory in 8 byte increments .
When all 64 bytes are updated , the entire line writes in a single burst .
What does this mean to a game programmer ?
When considering the memory performance of a write - combined buffer , we should update every byte of a vertex , even if position is the only value that changed .
In this example , writing more code , which appears slower on the C++ level , unlocks a latent hardware optimization .
The “ lines of code ” myth survives on the belief that to some , more code , and a larger design , means less performance .
I ’d bet a programmer with this belief would n’t give up their quad tree as a strategy to reduce the number of lines of code .
Krugman : Bush backer banks on Iraq 's failure Nick Juliano

This A Texas oil company whose CEO is a longtime confidant of President Bush with access to the most closely held US intelligence has entered into an agreement to explore for oil in Iraq 's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region .
The agreement shows that Dallas - based Hunt Oil Co. and its chief executive Ray L. Hunt are " effectively betting against the survival of Iraq as a nation , " argues New York Times columnist Paul Krugman .
Hunt raised about $ 100,000 for Bush during the president 's 2000 campaign , and he serves on the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , which gives him access to some of the most exclusive data collected by US spy agencies .
" What 's interesting about this deal is the fact that Hunt , thanks to his policy position , is presumably as well - informed about the actual state of affairs in Iraq as anyone in the business world can be , " Krugman observers .
" By putting his money into a deal with the Kurds , despite Baghdad 's disapproval , he 's essentially betting that the Iraqi government -- which has n't met a single one of the major benchmarks Bush laid out in January -- wo n't get it 's act together . "
Condemnation of the deal between Hunt Oil and the Kurdish provisional government was swiftly condemned by Iraq 's oil minister Hussain al Shahristani , who declared the deal illegal days after it was announced , despite the Kurds ' entreaties to share revenues .
Since Bush announced his surge strategy in January , Iraq has failed to achieve any of the benchmarks for political progress toward reconciliation -- a fact that was conveniently omitted from the president 's prime - time address Thursday .
Indeed , just days after the Hunt - Kurdistan agreement came reports that negotiations over an oil - revenue sharing law -- seen as the primary key to allowing Iraq to reconcile -- have apparently collapsed .
" The smart money , then , knows that the surge has failed , that the war is lost , and that Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia , " Krugman writes .
" And I suspect that most people in the Bush administration -- maybe even Bush himself -- know this , too . "
Oil is Iraq 's primary resource , accounting for two - thirds of its GDP and nearly all of the government 's revenue .
The Bush - backer - backed fractionalization of the country 's oil revenue gives little hope the country can recover from the quagmire and civil war it finds itself in following the US invasion and five - year occupation .
" Oil is perhaps the key incentive warring factions have to stop fighting and take an interest in the stabilization of their country , " says blogger Brian Beutler , a former Raw Story reporter .
" That it was n't enough says something important . "
“ It is fitting that she now stands to lose both her citizenship and her liberty , ” Assistant Attorney General Kenneth L. Wainstein said in an announcing the guilty plea , which was entered in federal district court in Detroit .
Mr. Wainstein , who runs the Justice Department ’s national security division , said that Ms. Proudy “ engaged in a pattern of deceit to secure U.S. citizenship , to gain employment in the intelligence community and to obtain and exploit her access to sensitive counterterrorism intelligence . ”
She pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal conspiracy , which has a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine ; unauthorized computer access , which has a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine , and naturalization fraud , which has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
In her plea agreement , Ms. Proudy , who lived mostly recently in Vienna , Va. , close to C.I.A. headquarters in Langley , Va. , acknowledged that her crimes began shortly after she entered the United States from Lebanon in June 1989 on a one - year student visa .
She acknowledged that after overstaying her visa , she had offered money to an unemployed American man to marry her in 1990 , which allowed her to remain in the United States as his wife , although the couple never lived together .
She then submitted a series of false and forged documents to obtain American citizenship , which she was granted in 1994 .
She obtained a divorce the next year and worked in a series of jobs , including as a waitress and hostess in a chain of restaurants in the Detroit area owned by her brother - in - law , Talal Khalil Chahine , who is a fugitive from federal charges in Michigan of tax evasion in a scheme to funnel millions of dollars from his business to people in Lebanon .
In 1997 , she was hired as a special agent of the F.B.I. , which has been under pressure for years to hire more agents and other employees who speak Arabic for terrorism investigations .
She was assigned to the bureau ’s Washington D.C. field office , given a security clearance and placed in “ an extraterritorial squad investigating crimes against U.S. persons overseas , ” the Justice Department said in a statement to reporters .
It 's an odd experience these days to see a presidential candidate not pander to any particular group , not promise anything or not even go much of out of his way to inspire except through his own example .
It 's an odd experience these days to see a presidential candidate not pander to any particular group , not promise anything or not even go much of out of his way to inspire except through his own example .
Meet Republican presidential hopeful Rep. Ron Paul of Texas who exudes an American - rooted utopianism that appears delivered from another planet — or at least another century .
It 's all the more exotic when compared to the modern corporate political campaign run by armies of experts and advisers who slice and dice the electorate like so many chefs in search of the perfect winning recipe .
With his strict libertarian approach to the federal government ( small to the point of disappearing ) , Paul talks " common - sense , " freedom - fueled rhetoric that crosses enough ideological traffic lines that you suspect the D.C. establishment police will pick him for driving under bad political influence .
What Paul offers is a pure vision of political religion .
What he promises is a constitutional baptism .
A case in point : when I saw Paul recently at the University of New Hampshire , the people who came out to support this soft - spoken 72 - year - old congressman represented a political gathering not unlike the intergalactic bar scene in Star Wars — passionate anti-war doves mingled with passionate anti-abortion activists who mingled with potheads yearning for drug legalization who sat next to budding anarchists and gun lovers and those who think the Federal Reserve is destroying the economy .
The festival mood was punctuated by the signs I saw for Paul around campus — one sign emphasized " Hope for America " and a flier emphasized " Revolution . "
It was n't either / or .
It was very much both , which seems to me a sane response after almost seven years of drunken hubris and systemized incompetence delivered by the Bush gang .
Paul 's message of freedom and liberty resonated well with a predominantly young crowd that can't have enough freedom and liberty — and , of course , has the potential to resonate even more in our first - in - the - solar - system primary state , which has a deep libertarian strain ( just read the license plate ) .
Paul , as you may have heard , has made headlines of late by slowly creeping up the polls and raising loads of dough ( some $ 4.2 million in one day ) from tens of thousands of devoted supporters from one coast to another .
Because he 's stood up in the Republican presidential debates to the war macho boasting of Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani — he was the only Republican in the race to vote against the Iraq war authorization in 2002 and eloquently opposed the Patriot Act — he has carved out a niche for himself in a party not given to much ideological diversity .
Alex Machajewski , an 18 - year - old freshman from Hampstead who looked as though he just attended a Grateful Dead concert circa 1985 , told me he was casting his first vote for Paul .
He was impressed with Paul 's anti-war stance and his views on freedom .
" I think they are interrelated , " he said .
Paul views the war as illegal , unconstitutional and a true danger to national security because it 's bankrupting the nation .
In his eyes , he 's the true conservative who stands for ( really ) free markets and small government .
He does n't view himself as a revolutionary or radical at all , but what he proposes is an extreme makeover for the country .
According to some press reports I 've read , Dr. Paul has delivered some 4,000 babies in his career .
What he has n't delivered to his constituents along the Gulf Coast of Texas — which he has served from 1977 to 1985 and again since 1997 — is political bacon .
He is known as " Dr. No " in the House , which has annoyed his own party to no end and baffled Democrats who can't figure out how he gets away with it .
He told me and other reporters after his UNH appearance at the University of New Hampshire that voters in his district have figured him out .
They know he stands by his principles ( he hates to spend , tax , and recoils from anything he considers anti-constitutional ) .
And he has practiced what he has preached .
As a doctor , he says he did n't accept Medicaid or Medicare payments ( he pro-rated or donated his services ) , and he has declined to take a congressional pension .
Paul , who ran for president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988 , said to me : " I think I was born with " a passion for constitutional freedom and liberty .
Modern American political life with its large federal government presence and its welfare state promises " bangs it out of us , our natural instincts , " as freedom lovers .
" He 's the only guy that makes sense , " said Morgan Binns , a 20 - year - old Vermonter who was traveling around to see and support Paul throughout the state .
Binns talked to me about the importance of " personal liberty " and America getting out of the empire business and getting rid of the Federal Reserve , which " has the power to enslave and debase the economy . "
" That 's too scary , " said Cindy Pulkkinen , a UNH lecturer who lives in Effingham , about Paul 's strict constitutional approach .
A self - described liberal , Pulkinnen said Paul " offers a different voice . "
But she believes Paul is wildly off the mark on how to realistically deal with issues such as foreign policy , the environment and global warming .
Paul believes the country went off the total deep end on Aug. 15 , 1971 , the day that President Richard Nixon took the country off the gold standard and imposed wage and price controls to battle inflation .
Paul has been a gadfly in Congress sponsoring a wide range of legislation , including a human life amendment , scores of bills to gut anti-trust laws , environmental and worker safety protections and voter rights and civil rights .
He 's not convinced global warming exists , and even if it did , he trusts industry and people to do the right thing .
One could go on and on about Paul 's war against what he considers an unconstitutional intrusion of federal power .
" Freedom brings people together , " Paul told the students at UNH .
One could view him as an early 19th - century constitutional warrior walking in the wilderness of a much more complicated America that , for better or worse , already settled the argument .
Purity does have its limits .
There are plenty of historical examples from civil rights to environmental degradation to rampant corporate abuse to labor suppression that show that freedom without restraint can be as equally destructive as freedom denied .
When I mentioned to one student that Paul 's policies would cut off her Pell grants and student loan guarantees , she replied , " Really ? "
Paul views New Hampshire as a key primary state , one receptive to the concept of " personal responsibility . "
He said his recent fund - raising success has given his campaign a boost of credibility — " it was worth $ 10 million in free publicity " — and allowed his small operation to expand to nine staff members working out of one office in Concord ( Kate Rick , his state communications coordinator , works out of her farm home in Wentworth . )
It 's too bad Paul did n't campaign here more , did n't take part in the house parties and town hall meetings and create a grassroots movement on the ground to equal its Internet power .
Paul said he has no plans to run a third party candidacy if he does n't win the Republican nomination .
Perhaps he was just saying that because he's in the middle of a primary election now , but his followers will no doubt be disappointed if he does n't because Paul does n't have a party that will embrace much less tolerate him .
Paul should have a seat at the debate — as much to decide who wins or loses , but who we are as a country .
It 's not either / or .
One can disagree with his diagnosis or his solutions , but be glad he 's asking questions that challenge the status quo and our constitutional complacency .

The stadium will be the showpiece of the Games
Enlarge Image
" No - one can say we 've compromised on design , on sustainability or on the legacy potential , " said Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell MP .
Work on the 80,000 - seater stadium will begin ahead of schedule in April 2008 .
Once the Olympics are over , it will be turned into a 25-000 - seater community venue and could also become home to a lower - league football or rugby club .
Lord Coe , the chairman of the London Organising Committee , told a news conference that the stadium would be a " stadium for a new era " .
" It 's a stadium that delivers on everything we said we would deliver on ; a stadium with track and field as its primary legacy ; a stadium that will be reduced from 80,000 seats in Olympic mode to a 25,000 - seater community base , " he said .
606 : DEBATE
Jowell added : " This is a very important Olympic milestone and this stadium is focused very much on legacy and sustainability .
" Once the Games are over this will then be translated into a stadium that will not only host grand prix athletics events and other national sport events but will also serve the communities of the boroughs . "
She also felt the stadium would be a great addition to the capital 's sporting facilities .
" This augments and complements the other great stadia that London now has - Wembley , the Emirates and the new development at Twickenham , " she said .
The stadium will be the centrepiece for the 2012 Games and will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the athletics events .
The main features of the design are :
a sunken bowl built into the ground for the field of play and lower permanent seating , designed to bring spectators close to the action ;
25,000 permanent seats , 55,000 demountable ;
a cable - supported roof that will stretch 28 metres the whole way around the stadium , providing cover for two - thirds of spectators ;
a fabric curtain will wrap around the stadium structure , acting as additional protection and shelter for spectators ;
facilities such as catering and merchandising will be grouped into self - contained ' pod ' structures .
Chief architect Rod Sheard , of HoK Sport , said the stadium would make a big impact , but not in the same way that previous Olympic stadia had .
" This is not a stadium that 's going to be screaming from the rooftops that it 's bigger and more spectacular , " he said .
" This is just a cleverer building .
This is a cleverer solution . "
The atmosphere inside this bowl , we think , will be pretty special
Chief architect Rod Sheard
He added that the ability to convert the stadium from an 80,000 - seater venue to a 25,000 one once the Olympics and Paralympics had finished was highly innovative and showed great forward thinking .
" We 've ended up with a very tight , very compelling bowl , " said Sheard .
" The atmosphere inside this bowl , we think , will be pretty special . "
HOK Sport is a firm of architects with a proven record for designing sporting venues .
It has been responsible for such projects as Wembley Stadium , the Millennium Stadium , the O2 Arena , the Emirates Stadium and Ascot Racecourse .
Building work on the Olympic Stadium , which will stand at the heart of the Olympic Park , will have to be finished at least six months ahead of the opening ceremony in July 2012 to allow for test events to take place .
The stadium build is being led by construction firm Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd in a partnership including architects HoK Sport and consulting engineers Buro Happold .
An artist 's impression of how the stadium will be pieced together
" It 's absolutely non-negotiable that it has to be ready on time , " said Radio 5 Live sports news correspondent Gordon Farquhar .
" They 've got a large contingency fund if things go wrong but they do n't want to spend more than that .
" If it 's not ready on time , that is probably the greatest shame the nation has faced in years .
But it will be . "
After the Games have finished , the temporary seating will be taken away and the stadium will become a 25,000 - capacity venue with a permanent athletics track .
An anchor tenant such as a lower - league football or rugby club is actively being sought , but one has yet to be found .
London mayor Ken Livingstone said major football clubs such as West Ham would not be able to become tenants .
He said : " We made a commitment there would be a permanent athletics facility and we have honoured that commitment .
" For West Ham , we have identified a site much better - suited to their needs . "
The ODA will be hoping for a positive response to the Olympic Stadium design following the criticism that the official 2012 logo received in June .
The stadium was initially expected to cost £ 280 m but the costs have been revised because of inflation and VAT .
If we 're made in Gods image , God 's made of gag , pol , and env .

Worrying that your employer will force you to stick a small chip beneath your skin ranks low on the list of employee concerns in most parts of the country , but that did n't stop the state of California from passing a bill last week to ban such forced tagging of humans .
The state senator who sponsored the bill called forced RFID tagging the " the ultimate invasion of privacy , " and his bill is now on its way to the governor 's desk for his signature .
Senate Bill 362 " would prohibit a person from requiring , coercing , or compelling any other individual to undergo the subcutaneous implanting of an identification device , " and a similar version has already passed the state Assembly .
Joseph Simitian , who came up with the idea , laments the fact that the RFID industry does not appear to find his idea a good one .
" I think it 's unfortunate and regrettable that the industry has n't come out in support of SB 362 , " he said in a statement after the bill passed the Senate .
" I understand why we 're having a robust debate about the privacy concerns related to RFID , but at the very least , we should be able to agree that the forced implanting of under - the - skin technology into human beings is just plain wrong .
I 'm deeply concerned that this is n't a given for the industry . "
If the bill is signed into law , it would not actually be the first time such a law has been enacted .
Both Wisconsin and North Dakota already have similar laws on the books ( one wonders if those bills also define " subcutaneous , " a word which would seem to define itself ) .
Any employer or individual forces a person to get tagged faces penalties of up to $ 10,000 plus a continuing fine of $ 1,000 per day so long as the violation continues .
The bill has no effect on the ( external ) tagging of prisoners or the ( internal ) tagging of pets .
The California legislature has shown its interest in RFID privacy for several years now , passing several bills that mandate privacy and security requirements for the technology .
And Californians have showed that they can cause a ruckus when RFID tracking is mandated .
Parents revolted back in 2005 , for example , when a school district in Sutter , California , required all students to wear RFID badges at all times .

In 1962 , young Texan housewife Timmie Jean Lindsey was persuaded to become a guinea pig for a new operation .
Millions of women have since done the same , believing a new bust will bring them happiness .
But the chilling story of Timmie Jean 's life with implants is one every woman must read ...
In America 's flashy oil capital , Timmie Jean Lindsey is , by her own admission , a lifelong member of the underclass ; the kind of unassuming woman who does n't get a second glance in a city boasting one of the world 's highest concentrations of millionaires .
At 75 , she still works the night shift at a care home on the Houston outskirts , the latest in a succession of lowly paid jobs she has held down to help support a family that has expanded from ten children to 16 great - grandchildren .
Scroll down for more ...
For 45 years , however , Timmie Jean has been the guinea pig in one of the most contentious - and , many would say , dangerous - experiments in medical history .
As the first woman to receive silicone breast implants , she has paved the way for more than two million women to undergo surgical enhancements .
A small minority , of course , are cancer survivors .
But eight out of ten , like Timmie Jean , were healthy when they underwent a procedure that implanted rubber - encased , gel - filled orbs beneath their skin .
For these women , ranging from film stars to rich housewives and highly paid executives , breast enlargement is now the most popular cosmetic surgery operation in Britain .
Scroll down for more ...
It easily beats nose jobs and liposuction , according to statistics released last week by the first international conference on breast enlargement .
Attended by more than 200 plastic surgeons , the London gathering mulled over such topics as the ' perfect ' shape , said to be exemplified by the model Caprice Bourret , as well as the least popular , Victoria Beckham 's ' unnaturally round ' breasts .
More than 6,000 breast enlargement procedures were performed in Britain last year , a rise of nine per cent , with an astonishing 330,000 carried out in America .
The conference took place , however , amid a growing controversy over the safety of the implants .
Tens of thousands of recipients in Britain and North America have demanded that the procedure be banned , blaming the sacs for everything from disfigurement to serious illnesses , including chronic fatigue and diseases of the auto - immune system .
The hazards have been covered up , they claim , because the operation , which on average costs £ 4,000 , has earned doctors and manufacturers in excess of £ 250 million in profits since Timmie Jean went under the scalpel in 1962 .
At the time she was struggling to bring up her children from an abusive first marriage and was talked into a procedure she neither wanted nor understood .
During appearances on behalf of the doctors and chemical company that pioneered the implants , she has had nothing but praise for them .
However , in her first interview with a British newspaper , Timmie Jean has told The Mail on Sunday she has suffered hardening of the breasts and acute pain as well as other ailments that opponents of the surgery claim are caused by the silicone .
" When I had the implants put in , I would get wolf whistles when I walked down the street , " she said .
" I truly believe women should be free to choose .
But , to be honest , there are times when I think I would like to have mine taken out .
" I started to get pain in the Eighties and sometimes it lasts for five to six weeks .
It feels like I 've broken a rib . "
One of six children of an oil refinery worker , Timmie Jean was 14 when her mother died .
One year later the pretty teenager dropped out of school to marry a carpenter .
After having three boys and three girls in nine years , she says her husband began to squander his meagre pay cheques in bars .
She left him when she was 26 and fell into a new relationship with Fred Reyes , a Mexican immigrant who took her on holiday and , in what would become a life - changing moment , persuaded her to have red roses tattooed on each of her breasts .
Timmie Jean said she was ashamed of her impulsiveness .
Earning £ 19 a week from her job at an electronics factory , she qualified for free treatment at a charity clinic , the Jefferson Davis Hospital , where a friendly young plastic surgeon , Canadian - born Frank Gerow , offered to remove the roses with dermabrasion - a procedure in which the upper layers of the skin are removed .
A plastic surgery professor at Houston 's esteemed Baylor University medical school , Gerow worked at the clinic pro bono , using it as a training facility for his students and , as Timmie Jean soon would learn , a recruiting ground .
When she returned for a check - up in the autumn of 1961 , male medical students joined him as he explained he had been working with a colleague , Dr Thomas Cronin , to develop an implant for women who had sagging breasts following multiple childbirths .
He suggested Timmie Jean should be the test case , the first woman in the world to undergo this delicate procedure .
Scroll down for more ...
The overture surprised her .
" Maybe I had started sagging , but I had not thought it was anything to fret about , " she said .
" When I was growing up we were poor , and we did n't have many mirrors to look in . "
Ironically , if she was asked to find fault with her body , she insists she would have chosen another part entirely .
" It was n't my breasts that bothered me , it was my ears , " she said .
" I was newly divorced ; I had n't had a lot of offers .
So I told Dr Gerow I 'd do the new breasts if he would fix my ears . "
Gerow agreed to pin them back and set about increasing her bust size from a B to a C cup .
But even then , one colleague at Gerow 's medical school harboured doubts about whether he was playing on the vulnerability of Timmie Jean and the other 11 women , including her sister - in - law Barbara , who agreed to take part in the study .
" Frank was a very qualified physician , but he liked big breasts , " said Dr Bernard Patten , a retired Baylor neurologist and former friend of the late Dr Gerow .
" He said he and Cronin wanted to do something with plastic surgery that would match the artificial heart that Dr Michael DeBakey ( a contemporary pioneering cardiovascular surgeon at Baylor ) was working on .
" First they tried direct injections of silicone into women who were , by and large , the wives of medical students .
They had massive inflammatory reactions and it gave them hard , painful , disgusting - looking breasts .
Because of the awful results , he and Cronin decided to enclose the silicone in a bag . "
Timmie Jean 's surgery was performed in the spring of 1962 .
" If Dr Gerow told me there were any risks , I did n't listen , " she said .
" When I came round from the anaesthetic , it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest .
" But when they took off the bandages after ten days , my breasts looked beautiful .
All the young doctors were standing around to look at ' the masterpiece ' . "
Suddenly , Timmie Jean was n't short of male attention .
She tried to convince herself she enjoyed their interest , but when a longtime acquaintance , Bill Lindsey , proposed to her , she accepted .
By New Year 's Eve , she was married to the aircraft mechanic , who had four children from his first marriage .
The new chapter in her life also marked a boom in popularity for plastic surgery , with women on both sides of the Atlantic clamouring for the implants .
Cronin and Gerow sold rights to their invention to Dow Corning , a joint venture between the giant Dow Chemical and Corning Glass companies , in return for royalties .
The two men argued that implants were crucial to the self - esteem of women with " limited development of the breasts ... probably all of them would be happier , " they elaborated in one paper , if " they could have a pleasing enlargement " .
Periodically , Timmie Jean would visit Dr Gerow 's office , where he would photograph her breasts for analysis .
Though he did not discuss safety with her , he assured other patients that the implants were " as harmless as water " .
Timmie Jean said her breasts first began to harden about ten years after the operation .
One in five women suffer similar hardening , according to studies , caused by scar tissue that forms around the implant in what has become known as " capsular contracture " .
Timmie Jean also began to experience shooting pains during an aerobics class in the Eighties .
A local doctor told her he suspected a link to the implants and though Dr Gerow denied this , Dow Corning admits pain can be a side - effect of capsular contracture .
" It is the most common complication with breast implants , " said the company 's associate general counsel Doug Schoettinger .
" Typically it is benign , but in some women the scar tissue contractsfor reasons that are not entirely understood . "
Timmie Jean also suffered from rashes , a dry mouth , dry eyes and chronic fatigue .
" I was hurting everywhere , " she said .
She was referred to various doctors , all of whom assured her the new problems mostly were psychosomatic , caused by depression .
" I started seeing a psychiatrist .
I was also told I had rheumatic fever . " she said .
" When I told Dr Gerow he agreed .
' Silicone does not make you sick , ' he said . "
Opponents of the implants insist Timmie Jean was suffering from classic symptoms of silicone damage .
Dr Patten , who examined 2,000 women suffering from health complications following implants , said : " From documents supplied to me by the FDA ( the American Food And Drug Administration , which regulates implants ) , Dow Corning clearly knew as far back as 1976 that silicone caused inflammation , that in some animal studies resulted in auto - immune diseases . "
The company denied being aware of such studies and insists that subsequent investigations , including one requested by the British Government , has shown no scientific link between the implants and any disease .
It does concede that the implants , which over the years have been made by several different firms , can rupture .
They say this happens to one in every 100 patients .
" Every plastic surgeon knew about this going back to the Seventies , " said Mr Shoettinger .
In Britain , one disturbing case involved Dawn Beaven .
A model who was just beginning an acting career , with parts in The Saint and a television thriller The Echo , she was 24 when she underwent breast enhancement .
After one of her implants burst , she suffered from paralysis , arthritis , ME , migraines and chest pains , which she blames on the silicone .
She founded a support group , Silicone Survivors .
Timmie Jean 's sister - in - law , who died in the Nineties , also claimed to have had an unhappy experience .
" She had to go back several times for the implants to be changed , " Timmie Jean said .
" She had liver problems she blamed on the silicone .
My daughter , Elizabeth had implants in the Eighties .
One of her implants ruptured .
I 'd thought implants lasted for ever . "
Timmie Jean 's sister - in - law and daughter and Dawn Beaven were among nearly 300,000 women who registered for a £ 1.6 billion settlement fund set up by Dow Corning in 1998 after the company was hit by tens of thousands of lawsuits by aggrieved patients .
Timmie Jean 's relatives urged her to join the action but , remarkably , despite her side - effects , she clung to her faith in Gerow .
As the furore intensified , he even asked her to testify before an FDA inquiry panel .
She said she had no complaints about the implants .
Her testimony might seem at odds with the experience she relates today .
Was she paid by Dow Corning ?
" A minimal amount , " she said .
There is no question , however , that until Gerow 's death in 1993 , she felt in the debt of the charismatic surgeon who got rid of her " ugly " ears .
Now widowed , she no longer has anyone to mentor her in the complicated debate that continues to rage , pitting the exponentially growing cosmetic surgery industry against the swelling tide of protesters .
Dow Corning no longer makes the implants , but the manufacturers , who still are in business , claim improved techniques have minimised the risk of ruptures .
Due to the influence of celebrities , bigger breasts have become almost a fashion accessory .
According to industry experts , a woman 's ' ideal ' size has grown from the C cup bestowed on Timmie Jean to a D .
Timmie Jean stumbled into the surgery because , like so many women who would follow in her footsteps , she was vulnerable , insecure and did not know what questions to ask .
She clings to a belief that her implants are safe , even though one of them now has a small tear in the shell .
" I am proud of what I have done .
I pioneered implants that have benefited thousands of women , " she said .
However , despite her frequent pain , the thought of having the implants removed fills her with dread .
And 45 years after going unhesitatingly under the knife , Timmie Jean is no longer so trusting of medical science .
" I'm a cissy now , " she said .
" I 'm afraid of what might happen if I go under . "
Weighing the risks of death from anaesthesia - not inconsiderable in her eighth decade - against the agony , she has decided to endure the pain to the end .
Call me superficial , but I love cute haircuts , hot make - up , and creative tattoos , but lately I 've wondered , if you 're blind , can you enjoy these very visual things .
Well one student has thought up a way where the visually impaired can express themselves through tattoos that can be read .
The Braille Tattoo , designed by Klara Jirkova ( a student at the University of the Arts Berlin ) , is a series of implantable surgical steel , titanium , or medical plastic that 's placed under the skin .
The tattoo can then be read via touch .
Subdermal implants are nothing new , but using them to create body art for the visually impaired is an interesting idea .
Jirkova thinks the implants could be used in the divet between thumb and pointer finger , so when people shake hands they can " read " each other 's names and info .

Political Leanings May Be in Your Head Scientists report differences in brain function between libs and cons .
Sept. 10 , 2007  --
Ever wonder why Democrats and Republicans can never agree ?
The answer may lie in the brain .
Liberals and conservatives think in fundamentally different ways , researchers reported in a study published Sunday in the journal Nature Neuroscience .
The study , conducted at New York University , suggested that while conservatives are known to be more structured and persistent when making decisions , liberals are more open to new experiences .
Researchers have traced these stereotypes to differences in brain activity .
" Political orientation is based on the fundamental way our brains process information , " said lead study author David Amodio , assistant professor of psychology at NYU .
" There is a range of ways that people process information .
Some people are more comfortable seeing the pros and cons of a situation .
Others are more comfortable to see the situation in only one way . "
Conservatives Stay the Course
In the study , participants were seated in front of a computer screen while electrodes recorded electrical activity in their brains .
Two different letters were flashed on the screen for only a few milliseconds .
If an M appeared , participants had to press a button in front of them .
If a W appeared , participants were told to remain still .
" Eighty percent of the time , the letter M appeared , " Amodio said .
" The stimulus was so frequent that individuals were just sitting there pressing a button .
This behavior became habitual . "
Because the letter W appeared only sporadically , it was unexpected and surprised the participants .
It took a great deal of mental effort to not press the button — allowing researchers to look at how well the subjects dealt with conflicting information and how quickly they could switch their response patterns .
What researchers found was that liberals were better at processing this conflicting information .
The liberals were about 10 percent more likely to hold back from an incorrect response than their conservative counterparts .
Conservatives , on the other hand , were more likely to stay the course .
They kept pressing the button even when the letter W flashed on the screen .
A Biological Basis ?
More importantly , by using an electroencephalogram , or EEG , during the test , researchers found a fundamental difference in brain activity between liberals and conservatives .
Liberals showed much more brain activity in the anterior cingulate , a region of the brain that processes conflicting information .
Increased brain activity in this region might explain why liberals were more accurate on the test .
Researchers not affiliated with the study said perhaps the most fascinating part was that the study showed that conservatives and liberals think differently when they are dealing with an abstract laboratory task — one that has nothing to do with politics .
" The fact that this difference between conservatives and liberals emerges in such a task demonstrates that the attitudes of conservatives and liberals are entrenched , " said Dr. Marco Iacoboni , director of the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Lab at UCLA .
But psychologist and lawyer Bryant Welch disagreed with the idea that attitudes are entrenched based on political affiliation .
Welch , who is writing a book on the subject of brain function and politics titled " State of Confusion , " said that despite the study 's findings , people with either political belief can be swayed based on experience .
" It simply means they will approach that issue with varying degrees of flexibility or rigidity , " he said .
" For example , if one has a loved one who has died from poor health care in an HMO and is traditionally conservative , they may support health - care reforms . …
What I think the study suggests is that individuals will differ in their predisposition . "
Where Differing Minds May Meet
Although the study reveals fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives , it does not solve which came first : political orientation or different methods of thinking .
" Are conservatives and liberals born with these quite opposite cognitive styles , or do they acquire these opposite cognitive styles because of their political beliefs ? "
Iacoboni asked .
So will Democrats and Republicans ever agree ?
Maybe not .
But " knowing how entrenched the attitudes of ' the other side ' are can only help , " Iacoboni said .
" It can provide a framework for ' making sense ' of how people with opposite political attitudes think .
And this is obviously a great starting point for a true , and possibly constructive , dialogue . "
Here 's the comic .
See you Monday !
EIA data show a small decline in world net oil exports from 2005 to 2006 , led by a 3.3 % per year decline rate in net exports from the top three net oil exporters -- Saudi Arabia , Russia and Norway .
Furthermore , recent data suggest that the net export decline is continuing , and probably accelerating .
To answer the question in the title of this paper , we believe , for reasons outlined below , that the current decline in world net oil exports is probably the start of a long term trend , as a result of declining production and / or increasing consumption in key exporting countries .
This is a post coauthored by myself and by Friend of TOD Jeffrey J. Brown ( westexas ) , an independent petroleum geologist in the Dallas , Texas area .
The Export Land Model and Two Case Histories
In previous articles posted on The Oil Drum we outlined a simplistic export model for a hypothetical country with Ultimate Recoverable Reserves ( URR ) of about 38 billion barrels ( Gb ) , labeled the Export Land Model ( ELM ) .
The model showed the effect on net exports of a country that hit peak production and started declining at 5 % per year .
The exporting country consumes 50 % of its production , and that consumption is increasing by 2.5 % per year .
The 5 % decline rate is loosely based on the post - peak Texas decline rate of about 4 % per year .
The ELM is shown graphically below , Figure One .
Figure 1
First , assuming ultimate recoverable reserves of 38 Gb , and assuming that Export Land peaked when it was about 55 % depleted , Export Land would have about 17 Gb of remaining recoverable reserves , after peaking .
The model shows that only about 1.7 Gb , or 10 % , of remaining post - peak recoverable reserves would be exported .
Second , the overall exponential net export decline rate , about 29 % per year over the eight year net export decline period , is much more rapid than the production decline rate of 5 % per year , because net exports in a given year are the net difference between two exponential functions : exponentially declining production and ( generally ) exponentially increasing consumption .
Third , the net export decline rate in a given year accelerates with time , from an initial year over year change in net exports of - 12.5 % to a final year over year change in net exports of - 47.6 % ( last year of net exports ) .
So , how does the simplistic ELM compare to real world case histories ?
Actually , two recent case histories , Indonesia and the UK , showed sharper net export declines than the ELM .
Figure
Two , shows the year - over - year changes in net exports , from the start of the most recent production declines to the ( apparent ) final year of net exports ( EIA , Total Liquids ) .
Figure 2
Region Production Decline Net Exports Decline Rate ELM - 5%/ year - 28.8 % / year Indonesia - 3.9 % / year - 28.9 % / year UK - 7.8 % / year - 55.7 %/ year
It 's also interesting that the UK and Indonesian net export declines were so similar , given the radical differences between the two regions .
The UK is characterized by high per capita income , high energy taxes and a minimal increase in consumption ( +0.2 % / year over the net export decline period ) .
In contrast , Indonesia is characterized by low per capita income , energy consumption subsidies and a fairly rapid increase in consumption ( +4.1 % / year over the net export decline period ) .
Note that once production in a given exporting country starts declining , the net export decline rate is a function of : ( 1 ) consumption as a percentage of production at peak production ; ( 2 ) The production decline rate and ( 3 ) The rate of change in domestic consumption .
The UK and Indonesia net export declines were similar to the ELM because of their relatively high consumption as a percentage of production at the most recent peak , in the 50 % to 60 % range .
However , regions with lower percentages of consumption , relative to production , will almost certainly also show accelerating net export decline rates , once production starts declining .
The Top Five Net Oil Exporters
The current top five net oil exporters -- Saudi Arabia , Russia , Norway , Iran and the UAE - - account for about half of world net oil exports .
From 2000 to 2005 , they showed a combined 3.7 % per year increase in consumption .
From 2005 to 2006 , their combined consumption showed an accelerating rate of increase , to +5.3 % per year .
From 2005 to 2006 , the top five showed a net export decline rate of - 3.3 % per year .
Based on year to date data , it is a near certainty that this net export decline rate will accelerate from 2006 to 2007 .
We are presently working on generating a range of projected future production curves for the top five , using the logistic method , and consumption curves , using a Monte Carlo analysis based on observed growth rates .
This will result in a range of nine points at which production = consumption for each country , in terms of time and production rate , with eight points centered on the middle cases for both production and consumption .
We will then plot predicted total net exports for the top five , showing the worst case , middle case and best case in terms of the time at which production = consumption .
We also plan to show , for the sake of argument , a plot showing indefinite flat production , versus increasing consumption .
In aggregate , the net export decline rates will not be as severe as the UK and Indonesian case histories discussed above ; however , the models will show that the net export decline rate accelerates with time .
While some smaller exporters are increasing their production and their net exports , once the large net exporters start showing an accelerating rate of decline net exports , it is very doubtful that smaller exporters can offset the decline from the larger exporters .
While overall world oil production is important , oil importers are focused on two things : their domestic production and world net oil export capacity .
In our opinion , we should base our plans on the very real possibility of a rapid decline in world net oil exports .
While this is a simplistic model , it has some important lessons for us .
Note the differences between the overall production decline rates and net export decline rates for the three regions :
Iranian Navy receives stealth - capable submarine - national TV
RIA Novosti
28/11/2007 17:31 TEHRAN , November 28 ( RIA Novosti ) - Iran 's Navy commissioned Wednesday a domestically designed and produced light submarine featuring extended stealth capability and strong firepower , state television reported .
The submarine , dubbed Ghadir , is reportedly fitted with noise - reduction features and is capable of firing missiles and torpedoes simultaneously .
" This submarine is equipped with advanced weapons and electronics systems .
It has been developed in the last decade by [ Iranian ] scientists and engineers , " a TV program quoted Navy commander , Admiral Habib Sayyari , as saying .
The admiral also said the Navy commissioned a destroyer and a missile boat .
According to various intelligence reports , Iran has been spending a considerable share of its defense budget on modernizing its naval forces over the last decade .
" The Iranian Navy - surface ships , submarines and naval bases - is equipped with all the necessary modern weaponry , including missiles , " Sayyari said .
" Their [ the missiles ] range is sufficient to protect effectively our southern flank in the Persian Gulf . "
In a separate development , Iran , which received no invitation to the Mideast peace conference in Annapolis , announced on Tuesday that it had produced a ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers ( 1,240 miles ) .
The missile 's range would allow it to reach Israel , as well as United States military bases in the Middle East .

Of all the world 's great writers , Petrarch is the best known for losing his head .
On Good Friday in 1327 , the then 23 - year - old writer and scholar fell madly - and forlornly - in love with a woman he saw in a church congregation .
His bad luck , to become enamoured of a woman who did not return his affections , was the rest of humanity 's good fortune .
For , in seeking to express his feelings for the woman he called Laura , Francesco Petrarch gave definitive form to the sonnet and established himself as the first modern , western poet .
Now , it seems , he has lost his head for a second time .
Scientists who have been examining what they thought were Petrarch 's remains have discovered that the skull belongs to someone else .
And they suspect it could be that of a woman .
Professor Vito Terribile Wiel Marin of Padua University , who is heading the investigation , told the Guardian yesterday : " This must have been robbery .
It is not , frankly , a nice business . "
The suspects in a literary whodunnit spanning almost 700 years include a bibulously larcenous 17th century friar and a supposedly clumsy 19th century anatomist .
Death has put both beyond the reach of indictment , but if Petrarch 's skull were to be traced as a result of the latest discovery it could lead to charges of receiving stolen goods , an offence for which , under Italian law , there is no statute of limitations .
The seeds of the mystery were sown last November when a crane lifted the lid from Petrarch 's pink marble tomb at Arquà Petrarca , the town where he died in 1374 .
It was the latest in a series of exhumations in Italy of famous historical figures .
Prof Terribile Wiel Marin helped to set the vogue when he examined the remains of St Anthony of Padua in 1981 .
One of the main reasons for picking over Petrarch 's remains was to reconstruct his face and create a definitive portrait in time for the 700th anniversary of the poet 's birth on July 20 .
" Since we now do n't even have his skull , that is absolutely impossible , " Prof Terribile Wiel Marin lamented .
The bones of what was thought to be Petrarch 's venerable head were in fragments when they were removed from his tomb .
In 1873 , it had been opened by an investigator , Professor Giovanni Canestrini , also at Padua University .
" He claimed Petrarch 's skull disintegrated on contact with the air , " said Prof Terribile Wiel Marin .
" Since none of us has ever come across an instance of this happening , we can only conclude he dropped it . "
Or might he have made up the whole story , putting back a damaged substitute and keeping for himself the head of a man revered as one of the fathers of the Renaissance ?
It was when the skull 's fragments found in Petrarch 's tomb were reassembled that doubts surfaced about their true nature .
Prof Terribile Wiel Marin said one of his team , Dr Maria Antonia Capitanio , noted the contours in two areas - above the eyes and below the ears - were more typical of a woman .
Samples from a tooth and a rib were sent for analysis by Dr David Caramelli , a molecular anthropologist at Florence University who compared fragments of their DNA .
Last Friday , he reported back his sensational findings .
" I am sure that the two samples are from different people , " Dr Caramelli said yesterday .
But could the tooth belong to Petrarch and the rib to someone else ?
Not a chance , said Prof Terribile Wiel Marin , the rest of the reassembled skeleton bore evidence of injuries mentioned by Petrarch during his lifetime , including one received from the kick of a horse on his way to Rome in 1350 .
" There 's no doubt about the body , " Dr Caramelli said .
Although Prof Canestrini and his 19th century assistants are clearly in the frame , this is a crime with many possible suspects .
Petrarch has been quite as much troubled in death as he was in life .
Before his body reached his tomb it spent six years interred in the cathedral at Arquà .
In 1630 , a drunken friar called Tommaso Martinelli , helped by four accomplices , broke in through a corner of the tomb and took some bones , apparently for resale .
Martinelli and his confederates were arrested , tried and exiled .
But the missing remains were never recovered .
Could they have included the skull ?
Perhaps .
But would someone cunning enough to have returned a phoney skull not have put back the other missing bones too ?
At least two other small - scale robberies appear on the records .
And , as Prof Terribile Wiel Marin noted , those are only the ones that are known about .
" Arquà is a pretty quiet place , " he said .
Extracting a skull would require either the creation of a sizeable hole in the side of the tomb or the lifting of its two - tonne lid , both operations that would generate a suspicious amount of noise .
To narrow the field of suspects , Prof Terribile Wiel Marin said he had sent samples of the skull for radio carbon dating at the University of Arizona .
" If we find out that the skull dates from , say , 1720 , then we know to exclude everyone who died before that , " he said .
From this investigation , it would seem , no one should expect swift results .

I was looking in the past ( and some more ) at various solutions for efficient hardware - aided curve rasterization methods .
Those ideas mostly focused on using the graphical hardware for accelerating the geometry generation process .
But what happens , when we completely skip the geometry generation step ?
Even more blazing performance and totally resolution - independent rendering .
Thanks to some tips by Jon and interesting math discussions I had in the past weeks , I 'm glad to present my current thinking .
Quadratic curves
Quadratic curves ( second - degree polynomials ) consist of a starting point , an end point and one control point .
Such curves cannot self - intersect nor inflect .
The representation of a quadratic curve is a parabola , a straight line or ( a degenerate case ) — a point .
Quadratic curves are not the most popular ones in modern graphical packages .
Cubic types ( more about them later ) are the basic unit of notation .
In example , cairo does n’t provide direct quadratic API .
It ’s understandable as any quadratic can be trivially represented in a cubic form .
However , since ( due to their limited properties ) quadratics are usually much faster to process it makes sense to look at them separately .
Quadratics are part of the SVG standard and have some interesting uses — including TrueType fonts ( which are represented only with 2nd degree curves ) and Flash ( which uses quadratics as the native curve representation and represents cubics by subdividing them into quadratics ) .
Few examples of quadratic curves :
Now , let ’s look at how we can hook up the programmable GPU hardware to rasterize quadratics .
The first observation is that the three points describing the curve form a triangle and this triangle covers the whole area of the curve .
Triangle is the most basicrasterization primitive in modern graphics hardware .
Let ’s assign two texture coordinates ( v and w ) for each of the three points .
We ’re going to use [ 0.0 ; 0.5 ] , [ 0.0 ; 1.0 ] and [ 1.0 ; 1.0 ] for , respectively — the start point , the control point and the end point .
As the triangle is being rendered the hardware will interpolate v and w across the three vertices .
For each pixel belonging to the triangle we get a unique , interpolated v and w texture coords pair .
And here comes the crucial part — as the actual “ texture ” for this triangle we use a dynamic fragment program that evaluates the following expression :
If the expression evaluates to true , we pass the pixel .
If not , we discard it .
What we get is :
Here is a shader implementation that does this operation .
As we see , the rastered picture represents the curve we ’re trying to visualize .
To be precise , we get the fill for the curve .
If we replaced the < sign with = sign we would get the actual stroke ( the green line ) .
As we zoom towards the curve , the shader generates more pixels giving a more accurate representation .
A true resolution - independent rendering .
I 'm going to come back to why this is so fundamentally amazing later on , but now let ’s move on to the cubics .
Cubic curves
Cubics ( third - degree polynomials , the bezier - curves ) are a bit more complex .
They consist of two arbitrary control points plus start / end points .
As a result a cubic can self - intersect , loop , inflect or cusp .
Beziers are the thing in vector drawing and most of the data we get to render these days ( icons , buttons , UI elements … ) are sets of shapes defined by cubic curves .
For blazing - fast rendering of cubics we ’re going to use a similar approach that we used for quadratics .
Since cubics consist of four points we need more than a single triangle .
Actually , depending on the control points set we ’re dealing with , we need 2 or 3 triangles .
In other words — we need to triangulate the points .
In this case ( very fixed ) triangulation is trivial and essentially we can discover the case we have by doing a few dot products between the vectors of the control points .
Since we ’re dealing with a cubic equation , we need three texture coordinates per point ( that ’s perfectly fine with the OpenGL API ) .
Let ’s call those three coords : v , w and t .
In our fragment shader ( implementation here ) we ’re going to evaluate the following expression :
And the last hard part — unlike quadratics , for cubics there are no static texture coords to use .
We need to calculate them separately for each curve .
The method to do that is a subject for a separate article , but it ’s enough to say that it ’s a fast fixed - time operation that involves few matrix multiplications .
Essentially we need to put the control point coordinates in a matrix , move it to power basis and analyze the determinants .
Depending on the number of square roots , we have one of the few distinct cubic - cases which further dictate which v , w , t coords to use .
Those computations could be put in hardware - accelerated matrix pipeline but I have n’t found that to be critical enough to do so .
In the end we end up with :
Using this technique we can render any cubic at any resolution in a fixed time .
Practical results
Two following screenshots ( click for bigger versions ) show sample renderings ( a font glyph and a mono - project logo ) obtained using this method .
Shapes consist of roughly 30 cubics / lines .
The first figure represents the inner-mesh hardware - accelerated triangulation .
The second one — a rendering of the curve data .
By combining the two we end up with a final mask for the shape .
This method works for any polygon including complex self - intersecting concave / convex shapes .
Why it ’s cool
Traditional approaches to curve rasterization usually require recursive subdividing of the curve towards a certain level of line - approximation or reaching a pixel - precision .
The complexity / processing time grows exponentially and the result might be not correct .
With the approach presented above we achieve high quality by keeping the mathematically - correct ( not compromised ) information about the curve till the very last step — the rasterization .
The precision of the final image ( output ) is only limited by the resolution of the display system , not the implementation .
The complexity of the algorithm is linear and the processing time is only constrained by the pixel fill rate of the GPU board ( that value approaching hundreds of millions for modern equipment ) .
From my experiments , attaching the ( presented ) fragment shaders to the triangle rasterization process has no any impact on the performance .
In other words , it seems that on modern hardware rendering a solid - filled triangle is equally fast as rendering a triangle with a simple shader .
As we ’re not generating / storing any extra geometry data and just using two ( max three ) triangles per curve , the memory requirements are minimal — even for extremally complex shapes .
By using some additional extensions ( such as a compiled vertex array ) after the initial pre-calculation step we can completely move the geometry data to the GPU unit and render by just invoking display lists .
In this case the expose events theoretically come cost - free for the CPU .
Smart curve rasterization is the first step towards efficient drawing API implementation .
By combining the solution with additional dynamical GPU - programmable pipeline elements ( gradients , triangulation , anti-aliasing , multi- sample rendering ) we can achieve blazing - fast vector - based drawing tool .
This is my current approach towards building a new OpenGL - based cairo backend .
World domination follows .
Obviously .

It ’s a good starting point even though it ’s not complete and has certain mistakes ( check comments ) .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street expects a two - day Federal Reserve meeting next week to end with another cut in interest rates as financial firms struggle with losses tied to subprime mortgages and related securities .
Trading in November fed funds futures show a 25 - basis - point cut in the benchmark rate to 4.5 percent is fully priced in , with only a small chance that there will be a bigger cut to 4.25 percent .
Should the Fed decide to leave rates unchanged , clearly there will be disappointed investors when the announcement comes on Wednesday , which happens to be Halloween .
At the last meeting , on September 18 , the Fed cut the fed funds rate 50 basis points to 4.75 percent and also lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5.25 percent .
It was a bigger cut than the market expected , and stock prices rocketed higher with the Dow industrials gaining 2.5 percent .
Michael Cuggino , president and portfolio manager of the Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco , said the Fed ’s decision next week “ could go either way ” -- a 25 - basis - point cut -- or no cut at all .
He said some argue that an October cut would provide insurance that the economy will avoid recession .
But others say standing pat gives the Fed time to analyze the effects of the September cut .
When the announcement does come , he said , “ What they say is going to be as important as what action they take . ”
Although the Fed meeting looms large , Wall Street also has to contend with corporate earnings , which are not as robust as in previous quarters , oil prices at record highs and the crucial monthly jobs report at the end of the week .
At Friday ’s close , stocks wrapped up the week with gains .
For the week , the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 2.11 percent , the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX added 2.31 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 2.90 percent .
The market 's gains came even as the subprime credit crisis continued to play out among financial firms .
Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N shocked Wall Street with an $ 8.4 billion write - down , which resulted in the biggest quarterly loss in the firm 's history .

For the year so far , the blue - chip Dow average is up 10.78 percent , while the S&P 500 is up 8.25 percent and the Nasdaq is up 16.10 percent .
CONFIDENCE MAY SLIP MORE
On the data front , Tuesday brings the Conference Board ’s survey on consumer confidence for October .
According to a Reuters poll of economists , the median forecast anticipates a drop in the index of consumer confidence to 99.0 in October from 99.8 in September .
The September reading was not only worse than expected , but it left the index at its lowest level in nearly two years .
“ We would anticipate it would be a little soft , ” said William Dwyer , chief investment officer of MTB Investment Advisors in Baltimore , referring to the consumer confidence data .
Dwyer noted that oil is approaching $ 95 per barrel at the same time there are concerns about a possible recession , which makes people worry about employment .
On Wednesday , in addition to the Fed news , there is a string of economic data , including the first estimate of gross domestic product for the third quarter .
The median forecast is that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.0 percent , which would be slower than the 3.8 percent in the second quarter .
Thursday data includes a report on personal income and spending .
The consensus forecast is that personal income rose
0.4 percent in September , a bit more than the 0.3 percent rise in August .
Consumer spending is expected to show a similar 0.4 percent rise , less than the 0.6 percent increase in August .
Also due on Thursday is the latest index of national factory activity from the Institute for Supply Management .
The forecast is for an October reading of 51.5 , which would be down from 52.0 in September .
If the forecast is correct , it would be the fourth consecutive monthly decline .
Automakers report domestic car and truck sales for October on Thursday .
Economists expect slower sales than in September .
OCTOBER JOBS AND EARNINGS GALORE
Friday brings the monthly payroll data , one of the most closely watched numbers on Wall Street .
The consensus view is that 80,000 jobs were added in October , fewer than September ’s increase of 110,000 .
The jobless rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.7 percent .
Friday ’s data includes a report on factory orders in September .
A decline of 0.5 percent is forecast .
The corporate earnings season continues with about 100 Standard & Poor ’s 500 companies scheduled to report quarterly results and hundreds more from mid-sized and smaller companies .
Among those reporting are Kellogg Co K.N on Monday , Procter & Gamble Co PG.N and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N on Tuesday , life insurer MetLife Inc MET.N on Wednesday , Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Thursday and International Paper Co IP.N on Friday .
According to Reuters Estimates , of 299 companies that have reported results for the third calendar quarter of 2007 , 196 , or 65.6 percent , beat consensus forecasts , while 67 companies , or 22.4 percent , missed .
Another 36 companies , or 12 percent were in line .
However when all the results for the 299 companies are combined , there is an average shortfall of 0.32 percent compared with the consensus .
A year ago , based on results from 490 companies , the average result was 5.8 percent better than the consensus .
Drew Kanaly , chairman of Kanaly Trust Co. in Houston , expects energy stocks to be actively traded next week when several companies in addition to Exxon Mobil , are expected to release results .
As for stock performance , he expects energy and technology stocks to be market leaders while financial stocks “ are just going to continue to get beaten up . ”
Today , the Supreme Court upheld a nationwide ban on the controversial abortion procedure that has come to be called “ partial birth ” abortion :
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on a controversial abortion procedure Wednesday , handing abortion opponents the long - awaited victory they expected from a more conservative bench .
The 5 - 4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed into law in 2003 does not violate a woman ’s constitutional right to an abortion .
The opponents of the act “ have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases , ” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion .
The ruling is narrow , and it is significant in that it is the first Supreme Court ruling that deviated significantly from the precedent set in Roe v. Wade .
Now , I ’m not writing here to debate whether the Court was right or not , or whether this particular abortion procedure is right or now .
What I find interesting is the one question that the Court did not touch on — what authority does the United States Congress have to regulate a medical procedure ?
If a woman has an unplanned pregnancy then she should have every right to decide if she wants to have an abortion or not , as it is her body , no one else ’s .
There is plenty of guidance around abortion as well ( just check out something like this Portland abortion clinic information here ) .
So it ’s not exactly hard for women to find what they are looking for .
But going back to my original question , what authority does the United States Congress have to regulate a medical procedure ?
Congressional authority derives solely from the power granted by Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution .
Nowhere in there , of course , will you find a provision that gives Congress the authority to regulate the practice of medicine .
So where , you might ask , does Congress claim the authority to regulate an abortion procedure ?
From these words :
To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian Tribes ;
Yes , the Commerce Clause , which the Supreme Court has interpreted so loosely that it has gone far beyond the point where it actually imposed any limits on Congressional authority .
For example , in 1942 , in Wickard v. Filburn , the Supreme Court ruled that a farmer who grew wheat on his own land for his own consumption affected interstate commerce and was therefore subject to the regulations of Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 .
Once that happened , the door was open to allow Congress to use the Commerce Clause to justify extensions of Federal power into areas that the Founding Fathers would never have conceived it would be exercised .
The post -Wickard history of the Commerce Clause has been one of expanding federal power and increasing regulation of activities that have only a tangential relationship to interstate commerce .
But there have been some bright spots recently .
In 1995 , the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Lopez that the commerce clause could not be used to justify a Federal Law that made it a crime to carry a gun with a certain distance from a school .
In 1996 , it ruled in Seminole Tribe v. Florida , that the Commerce Clause did not give the Federal Government the right to abrogate the soverign immunity of the state .
And , most notably , in a dissent in Gonzalez v. Raich , the 2005 case that upheld the supremacy of Federal drug laws over state medical marijuana laws , Justice Thomas said the following :
Respondent ’s local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not “ Commerce … among the several States . ”
Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that “ commerce ” included the mere possession of a good or some personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value .
In the early days of the Republic , it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation , possession , and consumption of marijuana .
The Commerce clause issue was not before the Court today , but Justice Thomas , joined by Justice Scalia , did have this to say in a concurring opinion :
I join the Court s opinion because it accurately applies current jurisprudence , including Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 ( 1992 ) .
I write separately to reiterate my view that the Court s abortion jurisprudence , including Casey and Roe v. Wade , 410 U. S. 113 ( 1973 ) , has no basis in the Constitution .
See Casey , supra , at 979 ( SCALIA , J. , concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part ) ; Stenberg v. Carhart , 530 U. S.914 , 980 983 ( 2000 ) ( THOMAS , J. , dissenting ) .
I also note that whether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court .
The parties did not raise or brief that issue ; it is outside the question presented ; and the lower courts did not address it .
See Cutter v. Wilkinson , 544 U. S. 709 , 727 , n. 2 ( 2005 ) ( THOMAS , J. , concurring ) .
Basically , Thomas is hinting that the door is open to a challenge to the law on Commerce Clause grounds .
Interestingly enough , Thomas would probably vote to strike down the law on those grounds .
What would be interesting to see is how the four Justices who dissented today , all of whom have traditionally held an expansive view of the Commerce Clause , would vote .
The problem with the partial birth abortion law has nothing to do with abortion .
It has everything to do with a Congress that has assumed for itself powers that it was never intended to have .
Man dies after phone explodes in his pocket
by Dhiram Shah
A 33 - year - old excavator driver was found dead on Wednesday in Cheongwon , North Chungcheong Province in Korea .
The man , identified only with his surname Seo , was found lying dead beside his excavator in a stone quarry in Cheongwon at 8:40 a.m. by his colleagues .
His cell phone was found in his shirt pocket with its battery severely melted and his chest burned and fractured , the police said .
The company who made the phone has been kept a secret however by looking at the picture it looks like a Samsung .
Doctors said that the explosion killed the man and was declared dead on arrival .
A similar accident killed a welder in June in China ’s Gansu Province .
( Check out what the company has to say after the jump )
Update –
The phone was manufactured by LG Electronics and not Samsung Mobile
“ We will fully cooperate with the police investigation , ” an official of the electronics company said .
“ But we believe that the battery was very unlikely to explode .
Our battery is wrapped in aluminum foil , so when there is an external shock , it should just melt , not explode . ”

Haskellから任意の機械語のコードを実行するにはどうすればよいのだろう。
Foreign .
PtrにFunPtrという型が定義してあり、これは機械語コードの入っているメモリへのポインタを示す。
さらに、
type IntFunction = CInt -> IO ( ) foreign import ccall " dynamic " mkFun :: FunPtr IntFunction -> IntFunction
などとすることによりFunPtrの指すコードを呼び出すためのラッパを生成できる。
型ごとに別個のラッパが必要になり、必要に応じて自動的に定義されるわけでもないので、必要なものは個別に書いてやる必要がある。
これらを用いれば、Haskellからmallocを用いてメモリを確保し、そこにデータを書き込み、それをラッパにかけてやることによって、Haskellから任意の機械語コードを実行することができるだろう。
まず、利便性のために、ラッパを自動的に選択できるよう、FunPtr a から a に変換できる型のクラスを作っておく 。
class MkFun a where mkFun :: FunPtr a -> a foreign import ccall " dynamic " mkFunInt :: FunPtr ( IO Int ) ->
IO
Int foreign import ccall " dynamic " mkFunInt2Int :: FunPtr ( Int -> IO Int ) -> ( Int -> IO Int ) instance MkFun ( IO Int ) where mkFun = mkFunInt instance MkFun ( Int -> IO Int ) where mkFun = mkFunInt2Int
当面 はIntを返す関数 とIntを取ってIntを返す関数のみをサポートしておく。
機械語列からはその関数の型を推論することなどできないので、関数の型はこちらが与えてやる。その際に、コードに対して型が付与できるように型を作る。
newtype CodeBlock a = CodeBlock ( Ptr Word8 )
newtypeでなくtypeでやると、typeは単なるエイリアスになるため、うまく型が付かない。
メモリを確保してコードを書き込むのと機械語列を実行する関数を作る。
writeCode :: [ Word8 ] ->
CodeBlock a writeCode code = unsafePerformIO $ do let len = length code q <- mallocArray len pokeArray q code return $ CodeBlock q exec :: MkFun a => CodeBlock a -> a exec ( CodeBlock p ) = mkFun $ castPtrToFunPtr p
これで次のようにして望みのコードを実行させることができる。
foo :: CodeBlock ( IO Int ) foo = writeCode [ 0xb8 , 0x09 , 0x03 , 0x00 , 0x00 -- mov eax,777 , 0xc3 -- ret ] main = do ret <- exec foo print ret
fooは 単に777を返す関数で、mainはそれを呼び出してprintしている。
$ ghc -- make AsmTest.hs
$ ./AsmTest
777
さて、これでインラインアセンブリの可能性が見えてきた。当然のことながら次は機械語列をHaskellから生成したいという要求が出てくるので、そちら方面に話を進めることにする。
Today we embark on a vigorous defense of our nation , reclaiming our constitution and reasserting the authority of Congress in our tripartite system of government .
Our hearing today is on presidential signing statements .
So far , the Bush White House has issued nearly 150 signing statements challenging over 1,100 provisions of law .
More than all previous presidents combined .
What does this mean ?
We do n’t know .
When the White House issues a signing statement indicating they do not feel bound by an Act of Congress , we do n’t know if they have actually acted to violate that law .
The signing statement surely indicates intent to ignore laws and contempt for Congress and the constitution , but the administration has never had to explain the extent to which it has acted upon these signing statements .
Our hearing this morning will ask these questions and convey forcefully the message from Congress that we no longer give license to the Bush White House to ignore the constitution and govern in secret .
Starting at 10:15 this morning , we will be webcasting today ’s hearing .
Please feel free to join us here .
Ralph Nader criticizes ' spineless , gutless ' Democrats for not impeaching Bush Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano

Consumer advocate Ralph Nader , who mounted failed bids for the White House in 2000 and 2004 , excoriated the Bush administration for its post - 9/11 policies that critics say trample on civil liberties and for its pursuit of war in Iraq , which he said distracts from fighting Osama bin Laden .
The onetime Green Party candidate appeared at an anti-war rally in Washington Saturday , where he chastised " spineless , gutless " Democrats in Congress for failing to boot Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney from office .
" The impeachable offenses of Bush outnumber any other list of impeachable offenses of any US president , " Nader said .
" Not only did he and Cheney violate their oath of office to uphold the constitution and the laws of the land , but they proceeded to impose a practice of torture , to arrest thousands of Americans without charges and throw them in prisons without lawyers ....
They spied on millions of Americans randomly without judicial approval .
How many more impeachable offenses do those spineless , gutless , hapless Democrats need in the Congress . "
Nader , who encouraged attendees to visit the anti-war Web site DemocracyRising.us , said the presidential elections in 2000 and 2004 were " stolen " from Democrats , but he did not mention his own candidacy in either of those races .
Because Democrats control Congress -- after a power shift following the 2006 midterm elections -- they can cut off funding for the war , hold hearings on Bush administration policies and begin impeachment proceedings .
Beyond failing to do any of that , though , there have not been vocal calls for Bush 's resignation , Nader said , which makes Democrats now weaker than those in Congress when former - President Richard Nixon was forced to resign in the wake of Watergate .
Speaking about the Iraq war , Nader mentioned Gen. David Petraeus 's testimony on Capitol Hill last week , during which he was asked whether the war in Iraq was making America safer .
" I do n't know , " was the US troop commander 's reply , and that was unacceptable , Nader said .
" It 's making the oil companies richer , " he said .
" It 's making the corporations more profiteering .
It 's making our domination of the Middle East more likely to boomerang against our national security , is n't it ? "

LLVM Overview
The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies .
Despite its name , LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines .
The name " LLVM " itself is not an acronym ; it is the full name of the project .
LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois , with the goal of providing a modern , SSA - based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages .
Since then , LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects , many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research .
Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the " Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions "
The primary sub-projects of LLVM are :
In addition to official subprojects of LLVM , there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks .
Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby , Python , Haskell , Rust , D , PHP , Pure , Lua , and a number of other languages .
A major strength of LLVM is its versatility , flexibility , and reusability , which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks : everything from doing light - weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers .
As much as everything else , LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low - level tools .
If you are interested in getting involved , a good first place is to skim the LLVM Blog and to sign up for the LLVM Developer mailing list .

SAN FRANCISCO , Nov 1 ( Reuters ) - A fox - like alien and his robot sidekick on a mission to save the galaxy could also help save sales of Sony ’s PlayStation 3 , which has struggled to find a game so good that it gives people reason to buy the pricey console .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 has had several , including this year ’s “ Halo 3 ” , but Sony is still trying to find a megahit of its own as games like “ Heavenly Sword ” and “ Folklore ” have failed to make the kind of splash needed to convince holdouts .
Now comes “ Ratchet & Clank Future : Tools of Destruction ” , a beautifully crafted game that is being compared to Pixar animated films and touted as a must - have for Sony fans .
“ We ’re using lots of the same techniques that would be used in a Pixar film , ” said Brian Allgeier , creative director on the “ Ratchet ” titles at developer Insomniac Games .
Seasoned video game fans can be forgiven for rolling their eyes -- claims by industry executives over the years that their games are “ Pixar quality ” have turned out to be just so much marketing bluster .
But the “ Ratchet & Clank ” that hit stores last week comes closest to delivering on that promise .
“ The new ‘ Ratchet ’ is a watershed for gaming because it provides the first interactive entertainment experience that truly feels like inhabiting a world - class animated film , ” the New York Times gushed this week .
The game is also evidence that Sony ’s bet on its powerful new Cell processor is starting to pay off as developers get the hang of tapping its capabilities .
“ We never could have had this level of action on the screen before , ” Allgeier said in praise of the PS3 hardware .
Metacritic.com , which combines ratings from review sites and magazines , has given the new “ Ratchet ” a score of 90 , the highest so far for any game exclusive to the PS3 .
“ ‘ Tools of Destruction ’ is an amazing PS3 game that fully leverages the power of the console .
It sets the bar high for not only the series but for all PS3 games to come .
It is , without a doubt , reason enough to buy the system , ” GamePro.com said in its review .
Sony badly needs a hit for the PS3 , which has lagged the Xbox 360 and Nintendo ’s Wii .
By the end of September , the PS3 had sold about 5.6 million units , compared to more than 13 million each for the Xbox 360 and Wii .
The game , the seventh for the franchise since 2002 , stars the fox - like Ratchet and his robot sidekick Clank as they try to defeat the evil Emperor Tachyon .
Their adventures lead through 15 locations and involve space combat , skydiving and railgrinding sequences .
“ All along we ’ve gone in more of a shooter direction and we ’ve decided to go back to our roots with a platformer , with more exploration , more adventure , ” Allgeier said .
The game levels are stitched together with short animated clips that elaborate on the story and amount to about half the length of a feature film .
With an industry rating of E 10 + , the game should be suitable for everyone but small children .
“ This is one of the few epic adventure games this holiday that will make people laugh , ” Allgeier said .
“ It ’s kind of a bright spot amid a lot of darker - themed games . ”
Do features you do not use confer benefits ?
A baroque language
Common Lisp has some abstruse features that are rarely used .
DEFINE - METHOD -COMBINATION
allows the programmer to create his own method combinations .
The condition system has RESTART - BIND in addition to RESTART - CASE .
This leads to the criticism that Common Lisp is a baroque language with too many features .
Part of the logic of the critique is that programmers gain no benefit from the features that they do not use .
This is too glib .
Large programs need planning , which introduces subtle complications .
Why plan ?
Why not plunge right in and get on with coding ?
At the heart of planning computer programs lies the idea of a contrast between some bits of code that are routine and other bits that are tricky .
Coding the routine bits always goes smoothly .
Coding the tricky bits sometimes ends in tears ; the code cannot be written as originally designed and the work done on the tricky bit and on many routine parts of the program feeding in to it must be scrapped .
When we plan , we lightly sketch in the routine parts of the program , concentrating our efforts on anticipating the problems in the tricky bits .
The benefit we obtain from planning is a reduction in the costs imposed upon us by the the discovery of show - stopping problems in the tricky bits .
We lose the work we did implementing the tricky bit .
That is unavoidable .
We lose the work we did on the routine parts of the program feeding into the tricky bit , but we only sketched those parts , so the loss is greatly reduced compared to plunging into coding without looking ahead .
The effectiveness of planning
The benefit of planning flows from the routine parts of the code being mere sketches .
The more that we can classify as routine , the more effective the the planning process will be at eliminating wasted effort .
When we plan we make two kinds of mistake .
Sometimes we think that a part of the program is tricky when it is actually routine .
This causes us to spend effort filling in the details earlier than we should .
If these details survive into the final program , the mistake costs us nothing .
If this detailed worked is discarded later in the planning process we pay a price for the mistake .
Had we seen that the work was routine we would only have sketched and only discarded a sketch .
Sometimes we think that a part of the program is routine when it is actually tricky .
When we come to code it we may succeed , in which case our mistake has cost us nothing , or we may encounter a show - stopping problem and fail .
Now we must discard much detailed work before trying again .
This kind of mistake can be very expensive , emerging late in the project and impacting much detailed work
Language features and planning
Now that we are clear about how planning delivers its benefits we can look at how this interacts with the features present in or absent from our programming language .
For example , we may be called upon to decide whether a mildly ambitious plan , based around an unusual method combination is routine or tricky .
We need to think ahead .
A bug may show us that the method combination we had planned on is not in fact quite suitable .
If the project is coded in a language with custom method combinations we may be able to anticipate that the code is routine .
If problems arise , we can code our way out of trouble .
If the project is coded in a language with a fixed set of method combinations we may call the code tricky and feel obliged to nail down the details early on .
The interest arises from the fact that planning needs to be fairly conservative .
As we explained earlier the costs of the two kinds of error are different .
We only call code routine if we have some notion of Plan B , which we have in reserve if things do n't go smoothly .
We are only justified in calling it Plan B if Plan A usually works .
Sometimes Plan B is to use the advanced version of a language feature .
In this case we gain an advantage , in the planning stage , from a feature that we do n't actually get round to using .
That seems paradoxical .
What are the ingredients that make this happen ?
There seem to be two .
The feature has to be never used in the ordinary sense that actually Fred used it a couple of months ago , but that does n't count because it was a special case .
If it is genuinely never used it can hardly be counted on as Plan B and does n't help at the planning stage .
It seems most likely to happen with features that offer a more general version of a commonly used built - in feature or some way of brute forcing past rare problems .
DEFINE -MODIFY -MACRO has limitations .
As Graham explains on page 169 of ANSI Common Lisp neither PUSH nor POP can be defined as modify - macros .
The reason that you can plan with confidence is that you have DEFINE - SETF - EXPANDER available as Plan B .
You might never use DEFINE - SETF - EXPANDER , but you benefit from it anyway because you can plan on the basis that code that is going to use DEFINE - MODIFY - MACRO is routine and leave the details until other parts of your plan are firmed up .
Ghost benefits are real !
Software projects require planning .
Planning gains in effectiveness the more often you can declare " This bit of code is routine , we can fill in the details later . "
The right kind of advanced programming language feature helps with this , allowing you to plan with confidence .
In this way programmers benefit from features that they do n't use .

North Korea is providing evidence to the United States aimed at proving that it never intended to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons , undermining a key U.S. intelligence finding , South Korean and U.S. officials said .
In closely held talks , the North Korean government has given U.S. experts access to equipment and documents to make its case , in preparation for declaring the extent of its nuclear activities before the end of the year .
North Korean officials hope the United States will simultaneously lift sanctions against Pyongyang when the declaration is made .
If North Korea were to successfully demonstrate that U.S. accusations about the uranium - enrichment program have been wrong , it would be a blow to U.S. intelligence and the Bush administration ’s credibility .
The U.S. allegations of a large - scale uranium program led to the collapse of a Clinton - era agreement under which North Korea had frozen a reactor that produced a different nuclear substance -- plutonium .
The move freed North Korea to use the plutonium route toward gathering the material needed for a nuclear weapon .
Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test last year , detonating a plutonium - based device , and has built a plutonium stockpile that experts estimate could yield eight to 10 nuclear weapons .

“ They have shown us some things , and we are working it through , ” a senior U.S. official said Friday , speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential .
“ Some explanations make sense ; some are a bit of a stretch . ”
A senior South Korean official said North Korea was attempting to show that the materials it imported were intended for conventional weapons programs and other dual - use projects , not for atomic bombs .
U.S. intelligence first concluded in July 2002 that North Korea had embarked on a large - scale program to produce highly enriched uranium for use in weapons , saying it was constructing a facility that would be fully operational by 2005 .
“ We discovered that , contrary to an agreement they had with the United States , they ’re enriching uranium , with a desire of developing a weapon , ” President Bush said in a November 2002 news conference .
Repossessions are up but mortgage arrears are down
An estimated 14,000 properties were repossessed in the first six months of the year , a 30 % increase on the same time last year .
But while the number of people losing their homes rose , the number of mortgages in arrears came in at 125,000 - 3 % down on the same period last year .
Official figures also show the number of mortgage debt court cases falling .
The greater risks inherent in sub - prime lending are resulting in significantly higher levels of repossession in that part of the market compared to mainstream experience
Michael Coogan , CML
Number of people going bust in surprise fall
The Ministry of Justice said that 32,922 mortgage possession claims were issued by the courts - the first stage of the repossession process - during the second quarter of 2007 .
This is 0.2 % lower than during the same period last year .
Most mortgage possession claims do not end with a property being repossessed , mainly because the borrower presents the court with a case for not proceeding or the lender comes to an arrangement with the borrower .
Calculations changed
Meanwhile , the CML said that it had changed the way it calculated repossession , to take greater account of sub - prime mortgage providers .
This may have boosted the CML 's estimate of the number of repossessions .
But according to CML director Michael Coogan , higher UK interest rates and the expanding sub - prime mortgage market are key factors in more people losing their homes .
" Interest rates are clearly higher than many were expecting , and are set to remain so , " Mr Coogan said .
" The greater risks inherent in sub - prime lending are resulting in significantly higher levels of repossession in that part of the market compared to mainstream experience . "
However , Mr Coogan added that repossessions were still relatively low by historical standards ..
" Overall , the vast majority of mortgage borrowers will continue to cope , even in a market where affordability is stretched , " he added .
Sub - prime mortgages are targeted at people with poor credit histories .
In the US , a high number of people defaulting on sub - prime loans has led to falling confidence in the housing market .
Insolvency
Meanwhile , the UK government 's Insolvency Service has said that the number of people going bust actually fell 8 % in the second quarter of the year when compared to the first three months of the year .
Between April and June of 2007 , 26,956 people became insolvent .
Experts say the fall may be due to lenders becoming less keen to accept Individual Voluntary Arrangements ( IVAs ) , a type of insolvency .
In total , the number of IVAs fell 15 % between the first and second quarters .
ADHD is characterized by hyperactivity , impulsive behavior and an inability to pay attention to tasks ; the condition affects social behaviors and achievement at school and work .
A new study says an estimated 8.7 percent of U.S. children age 8 to 15 meet the diagnostic criteria for attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Less than half of that are being treated for it .
Is ADHD really on the rise or are the criteria too broad ?
It depends on who you ask because it does n't follow any particular medical pattern .
Boys have it more than girls and hispanics less than whites .
The poorest one - fifth of children were more likely than the wealthiest one - fifth of children to have it .
A disorder that primarily impacts poor white American children ?
“ Reasons for the increased likelihood of ADHD in poorer children may include the elevated prevalence of ADHD risk factors ( i.e. , premature birth and in utero or childhood exposures to toxic substances ) in this group , ” the authors write .
“ In addition , given the high heritability of ADHD and its negative impact on social , academic and career outcomes , it is plausible that families with ADHD may cluster within the lower socioeconomic strata . ”
Yes , ADHD families often move to be near each other , they wrote .
To conduct the study , Tanya E. Froehlich , M.D. , of Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center , and colleagues studied a group of 3,082 children designed to represent the entire population of 8 - to 15 - year - olds in the United States .
Between 2001 and 2004 , children ’s parents or other caregivers were interviewed by phone and provided information about each child ’s ADHD symptoms , including when they first appeared and any impairment they caused during the previous year .
They also reported whether their child had ever been diagnosed with ADHD or taken medicine to treat it , in addition to providing sociodemographic details .
Based on standard diagnostic criteria , 8.7 percent of the children ( equivalent to 2.4 million children nationwide ) fulfilled criteria for ADHD in the year prior to the survey .
Hispanics were less likely than whites to have ADHD and boys were more likely than girls to meet criteria , although girls who did have ADHD were less likely to have their condition recognized .
A total of 47.9 percent of the children who met ADHD criteria had previously been diagnosed with the condition .
Among children meeting criteria for ADHD , 39 percent had received some medication treatment and 32 percent were treated consistently with ADHD medications during the previous year .
Despite the prevalence of ADHD in poorer children , they were least likely to receive medications consistently .
This finding “ warrants further investigation and possible intervention to ensure that all children with ADHD have equitable access to treatment when appropriate , ” the authors conclude .
Overdiagnosed or a modern epidemic ?
It 's hard to say but there are n't many disorders that impact a gender , a race , a nation and an economic class specifically so some skepticism is warranted .
