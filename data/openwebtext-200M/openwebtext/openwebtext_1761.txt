Quick : Name someone whose body of work is a testament to the indomitability of the human spirit ; whose strength and moral guidance informs your every decision ; and who starred in one of the Police Academy movies .
Okay , and who is n't Steve Gutenberg .
Or the guy who fooled crooks into thinking he was a police car by making police car noises .
Okay , now go !
Did you guess Hightower ?
Oh thank God , because that 's what we called our new Payload map , and it is way too late to change it to Sweetchuck .
Even though , now that we think about it , that 's a much better name that you should seriously consider just calling it anyhow .
Way to name maps , Brandon .
Also : wrenches !
Hey , everybody remember those ?
Because Day Three of the Engineer Update has a whole new batch of them plus a community - made surprise * .
* This is n't the only melee slot item the Engineer 's getting ... just a bonus !
For - profit colleges are booming as the unemployed turn to education , but some members of Congress and Obama administration officials say they are growing at the expense of taxpayers and that students are often exploited .
The average profit among such publicly traded higher education companies soared to $ 229 million in 2009 , up from $ 150 million the year before , with the lion ’s share of their revenue coming from federal student aid .
For example , federal dollars accounted for 86 % of revenue at the University of Phoenix , which has more than 458,000 students .
But according to a recent report issued by the Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions , the public ’s money is often not well spent on the schools .
The colleges cater to low - income and minority students often working online with little supervision , yet they charge on average twice as much as public universities charge in - state students .

Investigators believe a high proportion of students drop out , and those who do graduate find their money wasted because their programs are not accredited .
Students at for - profit colleges borrow more and are more likely to default on their loans , furthering taxpayer losses .
According to the Chronicle of Higher Education , 30 % of students who borrowed from the federal government to attend four - year for - profit institutions have defaulted since 1995 .
Roughly 15 % of students at public four - year colleges and 13.6 % at private nonprofit four - year colleges have defaulted since then , the Chronicle reported .
The Department of Education on Friday moved to rein in some for - profit firms with a proposal that would cut off federal student aid to individual programs within colleges that have a high proportion of students who cannot repay their loans after leaving .
“ Some proprietary schools have profited and prospered , but their students haven’t , ” Education Secretary Arne Duncan said .
“ These schools -- and their investors -- benefit from billions of dollars in subsidies from taxpayers , and in return taxpayers have a right to know that these programs are providing solid preparation for a job . ”
The proposed regulation , less stringent than originally expected , could put out of business 5 % of for - profit programs , a number that critics of the colleges said was not high enough .

“ At first glance , the regulation appears to set a low bar , ” Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , chairman of the Senate panel that issued the report , said in a statement .
“ I will be looking closely at this rule to ensure that it goes far enough to protect the $ 23 billion in federal aid to for - profit schools each year . ”
Harkin and a chorus of Senate Democrats are leading the call for government to step up regulation of for - profit colleges , saying it must ensure that tax dollars are not wasted and students are not cheated .
But Harris Miller , president of the Career College Assn. , which represents for - profit schools , said the schools have a special challenge .
“ We have millions of students who are not even in the educational system who have been told , ‘ You ’re not college material , ’ ” Miller said .
“ Somebody has to reach out to those people . ”

Corinthian Colleges spokesman Kent Jenkins said the disproportionate default rate was a consequence of the large number of low - income students in the programs .
Reaching low - income students requires the schools to run high advertising budgets , he added .
The Senate panel report noted that the schools devote about a third of their budgets to advertising .
The report acknowledges that President Obama ’s goal of doubling the number of U.S. college graduates by 2020 may hinge on for - profit colleges , which are able to expand faster than public institutions .
After a series of painful cuts to the University of California and California State University systems last summer , enrollment at for - profit colleges in California shot up 20 % .
Stephen Burd , an education policy expert at the New America Foundation , said the scrutiny is long overdue , but lawmakers will have to contend with the industry ’s “ Teflon lobby . ”
Many concerns have been raised about for - profit colleges , but nothing has stuck , he said .
“ For - profit college lobbyists are accustomed to flexing their muscles on Capitol Hill and getting their way -- no matter how much controversy is swirling around their schools , ” he said .

Although for - profit colleges were once mom-and - pop operations , the 14 publicly traded institutions enroll 1.4 million students , up from fewer than 200,000 in 1998 , according to the Senate committee report .
Kathleen
Tighe , inspector general for the Department of Education , testified at the panel ’s June 24 hearing that 70 % of the department ’s investigations involve for - profit colleges , many of which have been found guilty of falsifying student information to obtain more federal funds .
Tighe also testified that she is concerned about the rapid expansion of online programs because students are eligible for the same amount of federal aid but it is more difficult to track their progress -- a potential recipe for fraud .

The tape shows Officer David London beating 28 - year - old Walter Harvin with his baton even after he had fallen to the floor and been subdued .
Harvin and partner Mohammed Khan stopped the recently returned Iraq
War vet after he entered his mother 's West 93d Street housing project without a key .
The tape shows Harvin and London arguing off and on , with Harvin occasionally shoving the officer .
After Harvin attempts to enter the building elevator , he exits the elevator to address London again ; after what appears to be another shove from Harvin , London starts beating him repeatedly with his baton .
A switch in camera angles at this point reveals London continued to beat Harvin after he had apparently ceased to offer resistance of any kind .
In testimony yesterday , however , Khan said that Harvin was needlessly aggressive before , during and after the incident , yelling " I 'll kill you motherf - - - er " and " I 'm gonna f--- you up " as London beat him .
Khan said Harvin also kicked London repeatedly after falling to the floor .
London is on trial facing police brutality charges in the incident .

During the last 38 years , cancer treatment has improved greatly , and today , many cancers can be completely cured when they are discovered early , in stages 0 or 1 .
The problem is that , regardless of where the primary cancer occurs in our bodies – lungs , prostate gland , bladder , breasts , etc. – early stage cancers are so small that they produce no symptoms and cannot be seen by X - rays .
In view of this fact , you may be surprised to learn that when your blood and urine are tested during annual physical exams , no tests for cancer are performed . *
So we only rarely detect cancer at its earliest stages , when it can be most easily cured .
This research focuses on solving this problem .
What if you could test yourself for cancer ?
Professors Penner and Weiss are developing a new technology for making cheap , disposable , and highly sensitive biosensors capable of detecting cancer in urine and blood .
One goal of their research is to develop a version of this biosensor that resembles a home pregnancy test .
You buy this “ wand ” over - the - counter in a drug store , pee on it , and it indicates immediately whether you could have early stage cancer of the prostate , bladder , kidneys or perhaps just a urinary tract infection ( the symptoms for these are indistinguishable ) .
Believe it or not – the key to this technology are benevolent viruses that are engineered to capture specific molecules in your blood or urine that are flags for cancer .
Why viruses ?
Well , it ’s a long story that Drs. Penner and Weiss would like to share with you in this lecture

Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak arrives in Washington , D.C. , next week .
And he ’s coming with a list of demands for U.S. defense officials .
Topping that list : Israel wants money to build - out its multi-layered missile and rocket defense shield and it wants to get its hands on advanced technology from the Joint Strike Fighter program .
If it gets what it wants , Barak suggested Israel would n’t oppose the proposed U.S. sale of F - 15s to Saudi Arabia ; although perhaps not in the numbers being discussed .
In an interview with the Washington Post last week , Barak evoked Israel ’s qualitative military edge ( QME ) , suggesting that Saudi Arabia ’s acquisition of dozens of brand new F - 15 fighters could tilt the regional military balance .
“ [ W]e would appreciate it if we could be compensated and the qualitative edge will be assured as well as certain aspects of the quantity .
Beyond certain point , quantity turns into quality especially when the planes themselves are extremely sophisticated one . ”
Israel is n’t in a position to dictate who the U.S. sells advanced weaponry to , Barak said ; although it really is .
If Israel so desires , it can mobilize its powerful allies in Congress to hold up arms sales to Arab nations , especially when it ’s something as big as the sale of 84 F - 15s .
So what does Israel want for compensation ?
Barak said he wants money to erect a multi- layered rocket and missile defense shield over Israel , which has been his “ vision from day one ” in office .
Hostile non-state actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas have turned to the poor man ’s strategic bomber , the rocket , to menace Israeli cities .
Israel ’s in - development , multi- layered defensive shield includes Iron Dome ( which we wrote about here ) to catch short ranged rockets and artillery rounds and David ’s Sling , intended to intercept larger Scud sized missiles .
The top layer of the shield , the Arrow and Super Arrow interceptors , are designed to protect against possible ballistic missiles launched from Syria and Iran , Barak said .
“ And that kind of system that combined together will cost , in order to be fully deployed and fully protect Israel ; we need tens of thousands of the short - range interceptors , thousands of the David Slings interceptors and many hundreds of the upper layers .
That ’s a big package .
It ’s extremely successful science and technology being put together , extremely short R&D schedule .
But in order to fully deploy we need some $ 7 - 8 billion and expect that in the framework of making peace with our neighbors we will be able to give this answer to make Israelis feel secure . ”
As for the JSF , Barak said Israel ultimately wants “ several dozen ” of the advanced aircraft , although the buys would be stretched out over time .
Israel wants to be able to put its own electronics warfare package in the JSF , he said , but also :
“ We need of course to be able to participate in production of some parts in our industry as well as making sure that we can continue keeping our real edge which stems out from Israeli electronics and from our weapons ’ systems to find the balance , an agreed upon balance between our needs and the American readiness to give us access to these advanced planes . ”
It sure sounds like Israel wants some kind of technology transfer in the deal .
Considering how desperately the JSF program needs an Israeli buy , I ’m guessing Barak wo n’t leave Washington empty handed .

While it comes as no surprise that the Utah Supreme Court has overturned the convictions against polygamist Warren Jeffs today , the outrage is no less palpable for feminists watching around the world .
Jeffs , the so - called prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( FLDS ) , was convicted as an accomplice to rape in 2007 because he forced a 14 - year - old girl , Elissa Wall , to marry her 19 - year - old cousin .
What Wall endured is not uncommon in Utah and 32 other states where Mormon and Christian fundamentalist polygamy thrive .
FLDS communities , under Jeffs ’ direction , can be found in Utah , Arizona , Colorado , South Dakota , Idaho , Texas , Canada and Mexico .
The trafficking and forced marriages of underaged girls to men–usually much older and often a relative–occur with regularity in this belief system .
The Utah court ’s decision , which they said was because of an error in the original judge ’s jury instructions , is not a surprise because the mostly - Mormon justices come from a background of acceptance and belief in polygamy themselves .
Though Mormons disavowed the practice in favor of statehood in the 1800s , the law of “ patriarchal marriage ” is still in Mormon scripture .
Getting a conviction for this illegal behavior is rare in Utah , and when legal punishment occurs it is barely a slight tap on the wrist .
The cozy relationship between the Church and the Utah legal system is one Utah Sen.
Orrin Hatch should be taken to task for .
Assistant Utah Attorney General Laura Dupaix told KSTU in Salt Lake City that the opinion is “ … going to make it difficult , I think , for us to do future prosecutions in cases where some of these men in positions of power–almost complete power , like Warren Jeffs … forc[ e ] young girls into these marriages .
I think that ’s really the part of this opinion that is most disappointing for us . ”
Feminists are used to disappointment .
But disappointment lasts only until we rise up and make change .
The institutionalized trafficking and forced marriages of thousands of girls in polygamy is a change waiting to happen .

Rachel Maddow does an excellent job laying out just how badly Republicans hate the unemployed and she summed it up pretty nicely at the end of the segment .
But in the past , the measure has always been saved at the last minute .
That did n't happen this time .
Senate Republicans and Ben Nelson really are cutting off the benefits for 1.2 million unemployed people and probably tossing at least some of them out on the street .
And as an added bonus , they 're giving up the opportunity to stimulate the economy in the most efficient way we know how .
Ta da .
And as a result , starting tomorrow , more than a million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits .
This might sound like something you 've heard before .
This is the sort of thing that 's been knocking around in and out of the headlines for months now .
And it 's true .
It ’s because Republicans have blocked extensions of unemployment benefits before .
It ’s kind of been a Republican hobbyhorse lately .
MADDOW : We 've got the worst long - term unemployment since the Great Depression .
This is going to have repercussions in our country and in our culture for generations .
The political leadership we ’re seeing on the right in response to that called the unemployed animals , drug test them , call them bums , say they 're only out of jobs because they 're lazy and want to be .
Insult , insult , insult .
To add real injury to all of that insult today every Republican in the Senate plus our friend Ben Nelson , blocked a vote on a bill to provide badly needed help to the long - term unemployed in this country .
We 'll see how they behave once they start hearing from their constituents now that the Republicans have actually followed through and stopped the benefits .
I 'm sure they 're counting on as Debbie Stabenow noted voters blaming the party in power for their economic woes and hoping they benefit politically from this , which is truly disgusting .
I hope they 're wrong because although voters do n't always pay a lot of attention to politics , they do tend to pay attention when something directly affects them , and this is going to affect a whole lot of people , both directly and indirectly .
All of those people 's friends and families are going to feel the brunt of this decision as well .
Time will tell if this costs them at the voting booth .
This is class warfare and the have - nots are losing it , badly .
Full transcript below the fold .
MADDOW : In 1935 , President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law , which among other things created the bones of unemployment insurance for us as a nation .
The idea was you pay into it while you 're employed so if you lose your job , there will be money available to help you out .
It ’s not a coincidence that unemployment insurance was created in 1935 .
The people who created it and folded it into the Social Security Act and got it passed and signed into law , they knew a thing or two about unemployment .
The backdrop for the creation of unemployment insurance was the Great Depression .
unemployment insurance was created not just because the people waiting in the soup lines at the time thought it would be awesome to have some walking - around money .
It was created because it was sound economic policy .
Obviously having a system of unemployment insurance is in the best interest of anyone who might ever for any reason lose their job .
It ’s also in the best interest of the country , of our entire economy .
For one thing it ’s better for everyone if we do n't have people who lose their jobs immediately falling off a financial cliff , ending up on the street after their last paycheck .
That ’s just not good for society , even if you 're not personally the person who's on the street .
But unemployment insurance is also a way to stimulate the economy .
In the kind of economic situation that we have been in since the deep recession that started in George W. Bush 's second term , in which there is n't enough demand in the economy in which there are n't enough people buying things , the government is looking for ways to stimulate economy , to stimulate demand , for ways to get more money into the economy to keep businesses open , to sustain and create jobs , to generate growth .
And one of the most efficient , most effective ways to do that talking in economic terms , regardless of your politics , one of the most effective ways to do that , to stimulate the economy , is to put money in the hands of people who need money really badly and who will therefore spend it right away , which is what unemployment benefits do .
Because of the crisis that was caused by the financial collapse , we have the highest rate of unemployment in this country since when we first got unemployment insurance , since the Great Depression , since the '30s .
There are nearly six job seekers for every available job in America right now .
One of the most surprising things about politics since the crash happened and since unemployment spiked is how many politicians apparently hate people for being unemployed , hate the unemployed ; hate the unemployed , or at least they ’re willing to voice that for political reasons .
After you pay for unemployment insurance when you have a job , a bunch of politicians apparently think that you are a leech and a bad person for taking those benefits when you need them .
ANGLE : That 's what 's happened to us , is that we have put in so much entitlement into our government that we really have spoiled our citizenry and said you do n't want the jobs that are available .
MADDOW : That 's Sharron Angle , the republican running to place Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada .
She thinks people on unemployment , as you just heard , are spoiled .
KYL : And that it does n't create new jobs , in fact , if anything , continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work .
MADDOW : That 's Republican Senator John Kyl of Arizona , who thinks people are unemployed because of unemployment insurance .
Same reason I burn down my own house regularly , ever since I got the fire insurance .
Republican Congressman Steve King of Iowa has a similar take about being jobless .
He offered up this warning about unemployment benefits in February .
“ We should n't turn the safety net into a hammock .
It should actually be a safety net . ”
Republican Congressman Dean Heller of Nevada had a take on unemployment benefits that ’s twice as derogatory and 17 times as bizarre as that .
Here ’s how a local newspaper reported on Dean Heller ’s position .
Heller said the current economic downturn in policies may bring back the hobos of the Great Depression , people who wandered the country taking on odd jobs …
“ I believe there should be a federal safety net , ” Heller said but he questioned the wisdom of extending unemployment benefits yet again to a total of 24 months , which Congress is doing .
“ Is the government now creating hobos ? ” he asked .
If you 're out of a job Congressman Heller thinks you may be a hobo .
Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah thinks you 're even worse than that .
HATCH : You know , we should be giving people cash who… who basically are just going to blow it on drugs .
MADDOW : Senator Hatch actually proposed an amendment to the jobs bill earlier this month , to force anyone getting unemployment benefits to submit to a drug test , because , you know , land of the free and all that .
Now pee in this cup .
Andre Bauer the Republican Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina , compared people on assistance famously earlier this year to stray animals .
BAUER : My grandmother was not a highly educated woman but she told me as a small child to quit feeding stray animals .
You know why ?
Because they breed .
You ’re facilitating the problem if you give an animal or person ample food supply .
They will reproduce , especially ones that do n't think too of further than that .
And so what you ’ve got to do is you ’ve got to curtail that type of behavior .
They do n't know any better .
MADDOW : We 've got the worst long - term unemployment since the Great Depression .
This is going to have repercussions in our country and in our culture for generations .
The political leadership we ’re seeing on the right in response to that called the unemployed animals , drug test them , call them bums , say they 're only out of jobs because they 're lazy and want to be .
Insult , insult , insult .
To add real injury to all of that insult today every Republican in the Senate plus our friend Ben Nelson , blocked a vote on a bill to provide badly needed help to the long - term unemployed in this country .
And as a result , starting tomorrow , more than a million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits .

Dist :: Zilla ( dzil , for short ) has been a fabulous addition to my Perl toolbox .
I ’ve seen some blog posts and IRC comments that have a range of reactions along with some general confusion over what the big deal is , so I ’m adding my own thoughts to the debate .
Dist :: Zilla is modular , not monolithic 🔗︎
Part of the confusion about dzil is that it can do a lot of different things and not everyone likes everything it can do .
At its core , dzil is just a CPAN distribution release manager :
Collect distribution files into a distribution directory
Create a tarball of the directory
This is no big deal – it duplicates the functionality of ExtUtils : : MakeMaker , Module : : Build and Module : : Install .
The difference is that it does n’t require running Makefile .
PL or Build .
PL to work .
What does this do for us ?
How does this help a Perl programmer release stuff to CPAN ?
( Hi , TIOBE ! )
With dzil , a developer can customize the release process outside Makefile .
PL or Build .
PL , which means that end - users never need to know about it .
They do n’t need prerequisites just to run the PL file , they do n’t need things tucked away in inc / , they do n’t need to write Makefile snippets , and so on .
Instead , developers can extend dzil with plugins that stay on their development machine .
Almost everything in dzil is a plugin – there is no distinction between “ core ” behavior and “ add - ons ” .
Unlike Module : : Build , which is easy to subclass once but makes it hard to “ mix - in ” subclass functionality , dzil is built from the ground up to coordinate the behavior of multiple plugins .
This lets a developer mix and match useful functions whenever desired .
For example , it ’s easy to add a plugin to upload things to CPAN automatically .
Once added , here ’s what dzil does for me :
Collect distribution files into a distribution directory
Create a tarball of the directory
Upload the tarball to CPAN
Replacing existing release scripts with Dist :: Zilla 🔗︎
Before dzil , I already had some personal scripts that I wrote years ago to manage my uploads .
They worked , but were hard to extend and customize to do different things for different distributions .
I used them to do some useful sanity checks on my distributions before uploading .
But dzil can provide the same functionality through yet more plugins , which lets dzil manage my distributions like this :
Collect distribution files into a distribution directory
Make sure everything is checked into git
Make sure distribution tests pass
Tag the release with git
Push the tag to my git repo
Create a tarball of the directory
Upload the tarball to CPAN
If I find that someone has already written other useful pre-release plugins , I can just drop them in :
Make sure additional tests in the xt / directory pass
Make sure I ’ve written something in the Changes file
One of the knocks on dzil is that the files in your repository are n’t the same as the final release but note that in the examples above no files have been modified before release .
dzil can do that – and I ’ll show how and why I use it that way – but that ’s a choice that every developer can make .
Even without it , I can benefit from all the release management plugins that people write – something that I never could do with my homegrown release scripts .
Cool !
Letting Dist :: Zilla automate busywork 🔗︎
If you ’re ready to take the next step with dzil , you can have it produce boilerplate files in your distribution – things that ought to be there , but that you do n’t really need in the repository or that should be generated on the fly .
This can include simple text files like LICENSE , but when you realize that you no longer need your Makefile .
PL or Build .
PL file to build your distribution , you can let dzil fill in the blanks of a generic template for those , too !
You can even let it take a guess at your prerequisites , eliminating one more thing to remember to update before release .
Now my release process in dzil might look like this :
Collect distribution files into a distribution directory
Examine the code to find prerequisites ( including minimum versions )
Generate a Makefile .PL ( or Build .
PL )
Generate a MANIFEST
Generate a META.yml and / or META.json files
Generate a LICENSE file
Generate a README file from the main module ’s Pod
* Generate some generic .t files
Make sure everything is checked into git
Make sure distribution tests pass
Make sure additional tests in the xt / directory pass
Make sure I ’ve written something in the Changes file
Tag the release with git
Create a tarball of the directory
Upload the tarball to CPAN
And I still have n’t modified any files – I ’m only adding files in the distribution directory so I do n’t have to generate them in the first place or maintain them by hand anymore .
But wait !
Without a Makefile .
PL or a Build .
PL , how do you test the distribution ?
You can do it one of two ways :
$ prove -l t $ dzil test
The first will just run your tests using the files in lib / under prove ( add the - v flag if you want , or specify a particular file to test ) .
The second will go through all the steps of building the distribution directory and generating files and then will run Makefile .
PL ( or Build .
PL ) and “ make test ” ( “ Build test ” ) within the generated distribution .
If you ’re willing to take the next step and let dzil modify your files as it puts them into the distribution directory , you can start leaving out boilerplate from your files and have dzil add it automatically .
It can also figure out easily computed things – like the next version number to use – and add those too .
Here are some of the things I let it do for me :
Calculate the next version and write $ VERSION into my files
Find an abstract and write a NAME section in the Pod for every module
Write the $ VERSION into the Pod for every module
Add AUTHORS and COPYRIGHT sections to the Pod for every module
Add a formal copyright and license statement to every file
Translate the WikiDoc Pod dialect I prefer into regular Pod
Add the $ VERSION and timestamp to my Changes file
That ’s a lot of busy - work I no longer have to think about .
I can just focus on code and tests and leave all the scaffolding to dzil .
As the number of distributions I maintain grows , that ’s a huge time savings and it enforces rigor and consistency to my releases .
I will never again forget to timestamp a Changes file , or rather , I can now always forget and just let dzil do it for me .
It does mean that sometimes I ’ll get a bug report or a patch against the release and I have to do a little extra work to translate it back to a fix in the repository when line numbers do n’t quite match .
This is a cost that I ’m willing to bear in exchange for the productivity boost I get the rest of the time .
Whether to use Dist : : Zilla and how you can get started 🔗︎
Hopefully , I ’ve shown how dzil is useful and how you can choose to use as much or as little as you ’d like .
Nevertheless , here are some reasons why you might not want to use it , or at least not yet :
There is limited support ( so far ) for customizing the build process , supporting dynamic ( e.g. OS - specific ) prerequisites and building XS modules .
This is getting better as authors write new plugins – see Dist : : Zilla : : Plugin :: MakeMaker :: Awesome as an example .
There are lots of plugins to keep track of and configuring them manually in each distribution can feel a bit tedious .
Some authors have been writing PluginBundles to encapsulate their default configuration .
Will every author need one of these or will some sort of global configuration be possible ?
These are questions still being worked out .
Collaboration is a bit harder .
Ideally , any collaborators will install the same set of dzil plugins that you have and can work with dzil the same way you do , but that ’s still extra work that you ’re asking of contributors , particularly if they are n’t already fans of dzil .
dzil is still evolving rapidly and over the last few months , it ’s not been uncommon to have some upgrade of dzil break a bunch of plugins .
Hopefully this will be less common as the API stabilizes and the pace of core dzil development slows .
Because of the pace of development , documentation has also lagged a bit .
If you do want to give it a try , my advice on getting up the learning curve is to start with a very simple dzil dist.ini file that you maintain by hand .
Do n’t use dzil PluginBundles until you ’re more familiar with the action of each plugin .
The dzil tutorial is a great reference for getting started .
See the section on converting an existing distribution for some good starter examples .
Alternatively , if you want to see an example dist.ini that does all the things I mention above in this article , see Dist : : Zilla : : PluginBundle :: DAGOLDEN .
In the documentation for the PluginBundle , I show the equivalent dist.ini .
You can comment out parts you do n’t understand and then selectively re-enable them to see what they do .
See Walking through a real dist.ini for another good example .
Important :
While you ’re playing around learning dzil , replace the “ UploadToCPAN ” plugin with “ FakeRelease ” in your dist.ini .
This will simulate a release without actually uploading to CPAN , which could save you some potential embarrassment .

Suicide bomb blasts tore through a busy market in a volatile tribal region along the Afghan border Friday , killing more than 55 people in an attack that illustrated the Taliban insurgency ’s potency despite several recent offensives carried out by Pakistani troops against militants in the country ’s tribal belt .
The explosions took place in the village of Yaka Ghund in the Mohmand tribal region , outside the offices of a senior Mohmand administrator , police said .
More than 100 people were injured .
Authorities said one of the bombers was on a motorcycle , while the other detonated a car or pickup filled with explosives .
The intended target remained unclear .
A large crowd lining up for new national identity cards had gathered at government offices located in Yaka Ghund ’s main bazaar , and the bazaar itself was filled with midmorning customers .
Government offices and bustling markets have often been targeted in Taliban suicide bomb attacks .
However , Pakistani television channels reported that members of a local lashkar , or anti-Taliban tribal militia , had been meeting in the vicinity when the blast occurred and may have been the intended target .
Munir Khan , a shopkeeper at the market , said his store was just a few yards from the blast site .
“ It was a huge blast , and there was total destruction everywhere , ” Khan said .
“ I saw injured people on the ground and dead bodies burned beyond recognition . ”
Television footage of the blast site showed villagers with shovels scouring for survivors and remains amid a wide swath of destroyed storefronts and offices .
The explosion left a 5 - foot wide , 4 - foot deep crater in the road .
Rasool Khan , the Mohmand administrator , said authorities were expecting the death toll to rise as rescue workers continued to sift through the rubble .
Mohmand is one of several tribal regions along the Afghan border where Taliban and Al Qaeda militants continue to seek sanctuary .
The Pakistani army has launched offensives in several parts of northwest Pakistan -- including the Swat Valley , South Waziristan , Bajaur , Orakzai and Khyber -- in an attempt to uproot the insurgency and put an end to a wave of Taliban - engineered suicide bomb attacks and other terror acts that have ravaged the country in recent years .
The offensives , however , have failed to dismantle the insurgency .
Their top leaders remain active , and many militants were able to flee the military offensives well in advance and find refuge in other parts of the tribal belt .
Los Angeles Times staff writer Alex Rodriguez reported from Islamabad , and special correspondent Zulfiqar Ali reported from Peshawar , Pakistan .
Special correspondent Nasir Khan contributed to this report from Islamabad .

Okay before any of you start crying about omg it's not broken I was going to upload more replays but I kept getting errors on half of them so watch these two and try not to claw your eyes out .
Okay moving on , terran mech in the lategame once they get full upgrades and sieged up and fully 200/200 with ravens and energy for spells you CAN NOT beat it .
Now the thing is there should be no unbeatable strategy there should be no point at which you have to GG without fighting because you can't win .
There needs to be a way to break a strategy with good control or good macro and after Sheth wound up suiciding a combined total of almost 20 k minerals and 10 k gas it 's clear that macro is n't the way to go .
Okay anyways I do n't want this to be an argument on if terran mech is broken or not but obviously it probably will so I 'm going to move on to my possible fix .
I think one of the major factors is not the stats on the terran mech as it works quite well against protoss and if there is an actual nerf to mech then it breaks tvp mech viability and a buff to zerg ground breaks zvp .
This is the dilemma people facing this have had to think about for quite a while .
The solution is actually amazingly simple once I thought of it .

Siege tanks have a smart AI that refuses to overkill targets , it sounds good it seems like a great idea at first because oh tanks wound up wasting a lot of shots vs fast units like speedlings in broodwar .
But the problem is without the tanks wasting shots it 's not possible for a zerg ground army to get into position to kill anything more than just a few tanks .
Again watch the replays if you disagree , I think that if the smart AI is removed so that tanks waste shots a zerg will still take HEAVY losses but if they 're in a situation that Sheth was in where he was ridiculously far ahead in macro able to rebuild 200/200 armies in less than a minute it would then be possible to break the mech .
TL ;DR remove the smart targetting on siege tanks so that they are forced to waste shots on the first wave of zerg units and maybe a zerg in dominant macro position can break mech without actual balance changes .
edit :
As for zerg being more mobile and having to abuse the immobility of Mech watch this replay
MoMaN did an excellent job of abusing Lz and playing mind games sniping expansions and doing a great job of using drops fake drops nydus worm everything people are always saying the zerg has to do to beat mech and he STILL lost ...
Going to update this list here in the OP as we get more

I think it would be a much bigger change then you think , and mech would go to be being awful without any other changs , I would how ever like to see this done , because it increases micro options , I do think the stats would need a buff if they did this , but who knows http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=306479
billyX333 Profile Blog Joined January 2008 United States 1360 Posts # 3 I 've been whining about this for awhile
I love seeing games where zerg thoroughly outplays the terran in every phase of the game yet the terran can sit on 2 - 3 bases , wait until hes near maxed , push out , and kill every single zerg unit ( maxed army vs maxed army ) while not losing any casualties
Its hard to foresee when the terran is going to push out so I suppose I should cut all unit production to leave supply room for corruptors / broodlords like every single person seems to suggest as a response to terran mech ..?

The problem is a zerg army could take out a large portion of the terran mech but unless they 're in a good position to replenish with great macro then they will lose anyway .
But as it stands right now if you watch those replays
Sheth isnt even able to get into position for ultras to melee or the roaches to fire .
Hydras are even worse as they 're squishy as hell .
I think changing stats on mech makes things worse so other changes need to be made .
And it 's either this or add something to zerg so they have a specifically anti mech unit and that 's less viable imo so I 'm pitching this .

Its the same in SC1 , if zerg lets terran get 200/200 mech zerg will lose .
I do n't think its really imbalanced , zerg needs to start using mech 's immobility against them with nydus / doom drop play .
Also your ' fix ' would be awful :l

lol what ?
I seem to recall plague / swarm / ultralings easily dominating the largest of armies in BW
If terran doesnt kill zerg and lets zerg sit on 4 + gas and hive tech then GG for terran imo lol what ?

I have a replay for you hang on where MoMaN completely abused LzGamer with great mind games outmaneuvered him and still lost .
I 'm tired of this mech is immobile it's not broken cuz even before the game LzGamer said the same thing on the stream and he still won .
Let me upload it and I 'll edit it in .

This idea is amazingly broken , unbeatable not the way to fix it these need to be subtle changes at this point in the game as anything overt like that will break the game .

The problem is n't really the tanks being too smart , their faster firing rates is what really allows them to be less akin to crucial mistakes once they reach critical mass .
In BW you could time pincer attacks to strike between two volleys , in SC2 the shot cooldown will already be over when you 'd send the second wave in to flank them .
ZvT right now pretty much revolves around broodlords / baneling drops because they are the two only units that are able to exploit the rapid splash damage of the tanks , and quite frankly I do n't have any thoughts on how to prevent this .
Critical mass will always feel imbalanced while playing .

Hmmm , if you removed smart targeting would that nerf it enough though ?
Sure it would hurt it some , but how much overkill is there actually ?
Tanks fire faster than they did in broodwar , and besides that , if tanks are sieged in a ball , suppose a roach army is charging them or something .
The tanks in the front will fire before the tanks in the back when the roaches get in range , causing the rounds to be staggered , and the tanks to not waste many rounds on overkill anyways .
It might work though , but I think they might need another change too .
say you were born into a jungle indian tribe where food was scarce ... would you run around from teepee to teepee stealing meat scraps after a day lazying around doing nothing except warming urself by a fire that you did n't even make yourself ?

The thing is that if this was changed zerg could do similar things to what protoss did in starcraft 1 speedlings become viable late in the game to make the tanks waste the first volley on the small fast cheap units .
You 'd still have to fight it a bit differently but it would open up a way to kill the terran mech ball , it would n't be easy but that 's good it shouldnt be faceroll lololol I win it should be a subtle change .

I 'm totally serious .
Sure , thors would roflstomp half of them , but with a little micro and a crap ton of them , you could easily swarm them , then land , sort of like vikings .
this would circumvent the imbatanks and pwnzerhellionz .
this would n't really hurt pvz , since it would be hive tech and collussus would own them , since they wo n't be able to attack in the air and collossus does n't hurt friendly units .

So you 're saying you want a zerg army to be able to beat a 200/200 of slow moving units that have to spend time sieging to fire their greatest weapon ?
Because thats what your change would do .

Im honestly not sure what is worse , the tank queing , the ability of thor to completely shit on anything that flies , or the fact that the only damage absorbing unit we can get before the ultralisk is 2 supply .

The mobility , or lack thereof , of mech is completely offset by the myriad of sensor towers that terran can put up to easily predict everything zerg is doing .
The only time moman worked LZ over was with the fake drop .
It 's pretty sad that zerg has to resort to some insane micro and psyops to win over an a moving 1 button clicking mech terran .

Okay think about it , 3 - 3 tanks kill roaches in two shots so large amounts of roaches get melted , ultralisks are still too slow and die easily to focus fire so that they 're not viable against tanks but they 're quite good against masses of warpgate units for toss so you can't buff ultras anymore .
If you nerf tanks it breaks the tvp matchup .
Tanks would still kill a 200/200 army in good position but it would be weakened to the point where an instant macro refresh by a zerg that is WAY ahead like in the first two games would be able to run in a second army to finish it off .
Because Sheth was n't able to do enough if any damage to the tank blob to finish it off , and in steppes of war watch it carefully qxc even had HALF his tanks sitting idle in his base .
So he was suiciding 200/200 armies on about a 150 supply army by qxc .

BELEAGUERED energy giant BP was hit with further bad news this morning as it emerged dangerous arsenic levels have been found in seawater around the Gulf of Mexico .
British scientists warned that the oil spill is increasing the level of arsenic in the ocean , and could further add to the devastating impact on the already sensitive environment .
BP ’s Deepwater Horizon rig has been spilling between 3,681,500 litres and 911,454,000 litres of oil into the sea per day since it exploded on April 22 .
The spill is already being labeled as America 's worst environmental disaster and has turned into a economic and PR nightmare for the British company .
Seventy - five days into the spill , the oil has fouled some 715 km of shoreline in four southeastern US states , killed wildlife and put a massive dent in the region 's multi-billion - dollar fishing industry .
The clean - up operation , which has already cost , $ US3.12 billion ( $ 3.7 billion ) , is expected to rise even further after efforts were hampered by technical setbacks to cap the leak and adverse weather conditions .
In a further blow , an operation to permanently cap the ruptured well on the seafloor far below the surface cannot begin until engineers finish drilling relief wells , in mid-August at the earliest .
Imperial College London researchers warned the effect on the environment could worsen unless clean up efforts were hastened .
Researchers published a study which found oil stops the ocean ’s natural filtering process of arsenic .
They said the arsenic then gets “ magnified ” up the food chain , as fish eat small amounts of the deadly poison and may eventually impact humans , researchers said .
Professor Mark Sephton said arsenic , which is found in seawater , was normally filtered out of the ocean when it combined with sediment on the sea floor .
“ But oil spills stop the normal process because the oil combines with sediment and it leads to an accumulation of arsenic in the water over time , " he said .
" Arsenic only needs to be a 10th of a part per billion to cause problems . ”
He added : “ Our study is a timely reminder that oil spills could create a toxic ticking time bomb , which could threaten the fabric of the marine ecosystem in the future . ”
Prof Sephton called for a comprehensive mapping of arsenic levels around the world which would allow authorities to consider banning oil drilling in areas with dangerous levels of arsenic .
The findings were published this month in the journal Water Research .
The warnings come after Hurricane Alex sparked a five - day shutdown , raising new questions over how BP would pay for the mounting costs .
Meanwhile , cleanup workers arrived back on Grand Isle , Louisiana by the hundreds , spilling off school buses that shuttled them in from around the state with one worker claiming it 's the most oil he had seen so far .
However , while skimming operations resumed in Louisiana , rough seas kept vessels tied up in harbour in three other southeastern US states and no controlled burns were being carried out .
Skimming was suspended last week as Tropical Storm Alex , which later became the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2010 season , entered the Gulf .
BP is now pinning its hopes on the giant Taiwanese supertanker A
Whale exponentially boosting the amount of oil and water mix being scooped up from the surface of the gulf .
The tanker should be able to vacuum up 78.75 m litres of oily water a day , separate it and spit the seawater back out .
Tests on the 275 - metre tanker - turned - skimmer were expected to be completed by Monday before officials decide whether to deploy it .
It also emerged last night that BP is now turning to rival oil groups and sovereign wealth funds to fend off a possible hostile takeover bid .
The National , an Emirati newspaper based in Abu Dhabi , reported that sovereign wealth funds in the oil - rich Middle East have proposed making a strategic investment in BP , which has pledged to place $ US20 billion ( $ A23.74 billion ) in an escrow account to pay for the cleanup in the Gulf .
The firms were also allegedly mulling buying key assets from BP and financially backing any capital the oil company might plan to raise after the British energy giant lost over half of its stock market value and saw its shares plunge in the wake of the disaster .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meanwhile expanded the area closed to fishing in the Gulf beyond the current northwestern boundary off Louisiana , bringing to the closure to 210,258 square kilometres or 33.5 per cent of the Gulf 's federal waters .

The massive dump of U.S. military records relating to the war in Afghanistan confirms prior knowledge in some areas and shines light to other grim realities of aggressive war and occupation .
26 July 2010 | InfoShop News
It ’s being compared to the 1971 leak of the Pentagon Papers by Daniel Ellsburg .
Sunday evening , the London Guardian , The New York Times ( NYT ) and German weekly Der Spiegel revealed WikiLeaks granted them access to over 90,000 U.S. military records spanning from 2004 - 09 .
The records were previously confidential and detail specific operations of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) — the U.S. - led coalition with NATO occupying Afghanistan .
“ The flurry of hastily written documents provide a disturbing , disorienting and often incoherent history of the U.S. war effort from 2004 through last December , when Obama announced his new strategy for the country , ” Greg Jaffe and Peter Finn reported today at The Washington Post ( WaPo ) , later adding : “ In the near term , the Obama administration seems intent on casting the voluminous leak as old news and ignoring it .
The Pentagon similarly played down the need for safeguards to prevent future leaks of classified material . ”
The “ Afghan War Diary ” details the military whitewashing war crimes — some not previously reported — a recognition by the U.S. military of a Pakistan government element guiding the insurgency , extrajudicial assassination and kidnapping operations outside of ISAF command or legislative accountability , blatant disregards for human life by ISAF troops , an illegitimate Afghan government and insurgent deployment of weaponry possibly provided by the U.S. government when it created the Afghan mujahideen and Al Qaeda to combat the Soviet invasion during the 1980s .
It ’s premature to determine the full extent of the logs ’ contents or of any potential political fallout toward stimulating a change in public sentiment or war policy .
The war and occupation has cost the lives of an estimated 2,400 civilians in 2009 — according to the U.N. , up from 2,118 in 2008 — and almost 1,100 in the first six months of 2010 , according to the Afghanistan Rights Monitor , the BBC reported earlier this month .
Almost 2,000 coalition troops have died , according to iCasualties , and $ 321bn has been spent by the U.S. government since 2001 .
“ Afghanistan costs as much as 134 American Revolutions ( inflation - adjusted ) , ” Gus Lubin and Isabelle Schafer reported today at Business Insider .
“ But here ’s the thing , as NYT points out : war costs as a fraction of [ gross domestic product ] have generally decreased , ” they added .
“ Therefore modern Americans are relatively indifferent to the military cash burn . ”
Julian Assange , founder of WikiLeaks , responded to scrutiny yesterday , “ Well , it ’s a matter about whether the coercive power of the State should be used to stop people sharing information , who have no direct connection to the source of the information . ”
‘ Kill or capture ’ ops
Most striking is the confirmation that covert ‘ kill or capture ’ operations have been a dominating tactic of the war and are escalating into the darkness , Rick Rowley of Big Noise Films highlighted yesterday at Democracy Now !
after returning from a trip to Afghanistan , embedded with a division in the extended Marja Surge .
Task Force 373 ( TF 373 ) is described by Spiegel as “ a troop of U.S. elite soldiers that includes Navy Seals and members of the Delta Force , receive their orders directly from the Pentagon and are independent of the chain of command of the international ISAF Afghanistan security forces ” .
One U.S. military record tell of five missiles fired at a school , killing seven children , in a failed assassination attempt of one suspected militant , Abu Laith al - Libi .
Another incident , David Leigh reported Sunday evening at the Guardian , was of a March 2007 attack by “ a heavily armed squad from the C.I.A. ” where agents raided a village and shot Shum Khan as he “ ran at the sight of the approaching coalition forces … out of fear and confusion ” .
Mr. Khan is deaf and unable to speak .
He survived the shooting , but the Agency said the shooting was justified by the U.S. rules of engagement .
The report logs 144 incidents of violence against civilians in ISAF or “ other government agency ” attacks , including “ a relentless catalogue of civilian shootings on nearly 100 occasions by jumpy troops at checkpoints ” .
None are recognized as abusive uses of force in the records .
Whitewashing war crimes
“ The leaked records support Amnesty International ’s concerns about improper reporting of civilian casualties , a lack of investigations into casualties that are recorded , and poor coordination between different national forces about incidents and even over investigations that do take place , ” the human rights group said in a press release on its site .
Of the recorded murders by the U.S. - NATO coalition was a September 2009 airstrike in the Kunduz province that followed the hijacking of two fuel tankers .
The strike was called by the German military and has sparked protests in Germany against its involvement in the occupation following the blowback that resulted .
The U.S. military recorded 56 civilian casualties , though “ NATO ’s investigation could not verify the exact number of casualties ” , Amnesty reported German officials said , adding that its own survey of village elders concluded at 83 of the 142 killed were civilians .
What “ could also prove embarrassing for the German government ” , according to Spiegel , is the stationing of “ roughly 300 ” members of TF 373 “ on the grounds of Camp Marmal , the German field base in Mazar - e - Sharif , since the summer of 2009 ” .
Declan Walsh reported Monday at the Guardian that , on 4 March 2007 , the U.S. Marines recklessly murdered 19 civilians and wounded dozens on a six - mile stretch of highway opening fire on unarmed civilians while fleeing the site of a suicide bombing , “ hitting almost anyone in their way — teenage girls in fields , motorists in their cars , old men as they walked along the road ” .
An inquiry followed that whitewashed the incident and soldiers returned hours later to coerce journalists from covering the story , adding they threatened a photographer from the Associated Press with lethal force if he did n’t delete the pictures he recorded :
None of this , however , was captured in the initial military account , written by the Marines themselves .
It simply says that , simultaneous to the suicide explosion , “ the patrol received small arms fire from three directions ” .
And the subsequent rampage as they drove away — which would later be the subject of a 17 - day military inquiry and a 12,000 - page report — is captured in five words :
“ The patrol returned to JAF [ Jalalabad air field ] . ”
The soldiers ’ initial concern , it appears , was a wounded marine — their only casualty .
Forty - nine minutes after the initial bombing , they requested a “ routine medevac ” for a private with “ shrapnel wounds to the arm ” .
He was evacuated to safety .
An hour later came the first news of the trail of blood they left behind .
A local government official told the marines there were “ 28 LN WIA ” , which in layman ’s terms means 28 Afghan civilians had been wounded .
This later transpired to be a gross underestimate .
It was not the last one .
Two hours later Americans returned to the scene of the bombing to conduct an “ exploitation of the blast site with pictures / grid cords as well as debriefing [ Afghan National Police ] leadership on scene ” .
Journalists on the spot gave a more detailed account .
They said angry Marines tore their cameras from their hands , insisting they delete the pictures they had taken of bullet - pocked vehicles on the roadside .
Rahmat Gul , a freelance photographer working for the Associated Press , said two soldiers and a translator came up to him and asked : “ Why are you taking pictures ?
You do n’t have permission . ”
Then they deleted his photographs .
Later , Gul said , one of the soldiers came up to him and raised his arm , as if to hit him .
Taqiullah Taqi , a reporter for the private Tolo TV channel , said the Americans told him through a translator : “ Delete them , or we will delete you . ”
No charges were ever brought against any officers and the families of the victims were paid $ 2,000 after protests erupted and a damning report by the Afghan Human Rights Commission was released .
As of Sunday evening , the Guardian had identified 21 incidents where the U.K. military fired on civilians killing 26 – including 16 children — and wounding at least 20 , representing “ a small fraction of the 369 civilian casualties listed in the logs as due to coalition — mostly U.S.— action in total ” , Mr. Leigh and Rob Evans reported .
The Guardian posted several reports of civilian casualties ( h/t : Justin Raimondo ) chronicled by the U.S. military , including :
Since employing them in June 2008 , the U.K. has flown Reaper drones for 11,500 hours , firing 97 $ 100,000 missiles .
The Ministry of Defence has not reported any civilian casualties as a result of these drone strikes , Mr. Evans and Richard Norton - Taylor reported Sunday evening .
The U.S. has launched “ at least 87 such attacks between President Obama taking office on 20 January 2009 and the end of June 2010 ” , killing well over 700 compared with “ slightly fewer than 200 ” killed in 25 drone strikes by the Bush Administration in 2008 , the BBC reported late last week , fueling “ militant backlash ” .
Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation ( N.A.F. ) have estimated 691 - 1,174 deaths from 103 documented U.S. drone strikes over the last 18 + months , including already in 2010 through last weekend ’s strike that —
Afghan officials report — killed 52 civilians .
The N.A.F. conservatively estimates one in every three killed are civilians .
Pakistan media reports estimate 50 civilians are killed for every militant leader .
Counterinsurgency doctrine architects Andrew Exum and Australian Lt. Col.
David Kilcullen wrote at the NYT in May 2009 : “ Nevertheless , every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family , a new desire for revenge , and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes have increased . ”
Former ISAF commander General Stanley McChrystal recently said ten enemies are created with every civilian death .
He called it “ insurgent math “ .
The global drone market is expected to reach $ 55 bn by 2018 , Boeing officials have said , according to Bloomberg News .
The insurgency
The leaked records also tell of cross- border “ clashes ” between the Afghan and Pakistani militaries , but most notably the confirmation of — what ’s long been accepted as fact by everyone but the U.S. government in public — Pakistani intelligence aiding , abetting and planning with networks referred to as the ‘ Afghan Taliban ’ .
Gareth Porter , investigative journalist at Inter Press Services and scholar on geopolitics , yesterday highlighted this as “ the most politically salient issue ” .
The Guardian has mapped an estimated 16,000 uses of improvised explosive devices against ISAF troops , “ rising from 308 in 2004 to 7,155 in 2009 ” , showing an escalation of resistance with the escalation of coalition force and the records publicly show for the first time insurgent usage of heat - seeking surface - to - air missiles .
“ The Taliban have used portable heat - seeking missiles against allied aircraft , a fact that has not been publicly disclosed by the military , ” , the NYT reported Sunday evening .
“ This type of weapon helped the Afghan mujahideen defeat the Soviet occupation in the 1980s . ”
The missiles have been used repeatedly — on an occasion that killed five U.S. troops , one British and a Candian military photographer .
“ The war logs detail at least 10 near - misses by missiles in four years against coalition aircraft , one while refuelling at 11,000ft and another involving a suspected Stinger missile of the kind supplied by the CIA to Afghan rebels in the 1980s , ” Mr. Walsh reported Sunday evening .
“ One internal report in September 2005 warned that Taliban commanders in Zabul and Kandahar provinces had acquired missiles they called ‘ number two Stinger ’ , for about $ 1,000 ( £ 650 ) each , ” he added , including that the U.S. military suspects Iran and Pakistan as possible missile or training sources . ” Nine months later came the first of at least 10 near - miss reports . ”
More striking is the confirmation that ISAF is further enabling a corrupt “ mafialike ” regime in Kabul and provincial governments .
One log detailed concern of a police chief who was a known “ notorious criminal ” and former spy in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and others where the U.S. and U.K. governments expressed the widespread corruption throughout the Afghanistan Eradication Forces executing counter - narco operations , Mr. Norton - Taylor reported Monday .
Crucial to this point is that the insurgency is a reaction to the illegitimacy of the Afghan government and the ISAF coalition propping it up .
The counterinsurgency doctrine is based on the theory that it ’s imperative the occupying force ‘ win hearts and minds ’ .
In practice , “ counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never - ending demand for the primary product supplied by the military : perpetual war ” , Michael Hastings wrote at Rolling Stone in a recent exposé that led to the forced resignation of then - ISAF commander Gen. McChrystal .
Political reaction
The political reaction has been fairly uniform — that ‘ WikiLeaks was wrong to leak the records , but they are insignificant , yet leaking government secrets threaten national security ’ .
Seriously , that ’s the reaction .
“ While I ’m concerned about the disclosure of sensitive information from the battlefield that could potentially jeopardize individuals or operations , the fact is these documents do n’t reveal any issues that have n’t already informed our public debate on Afghanistan , ” President Barack Obama said today to reporters after his national security said the Administration “ strongly condemns ” the leak .
The NYT has been the most sensitive of the three media organizations granted first access to the document dump , consulting with the Administration , which Press Secretary Robert Gibbs singled out saying it “ handled this story in a responsible way ” , only condemning WikiLeaks , Dana Milibank reported in a WaPo article highlighting “ that Obama was being brought down by the same medium that made him ” .
Party leaders on Capitol Hill , Carl Hulse and Jackie Calmes reported today at the NYT “ At War ” blog , “ said that they still believe they will have the votes ” to approve a $ 59bn supplemental to support escalating the occupation of Afghanistan , later adding :
Under expedited rules , debate on the measure Tuesday morning was sharply limited and the bill was brought up before noon , not a time when major legislation is usually debated .
By using the process , the leadership will need nearly 290 votes to pass the measure depending on how many representatives vote .
Democrats are counting on nearly all 178 Republicans and up to 125 Democrats backing the money , meaning another 130 Democrats would oppose the legislation .
Reps .
Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) and Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) countered today introduced House Concurrent Resolution 301 pushing for U.S. withdrawal from Pakistan .
“ By invoking the 1973 War Powers Act in the privileged resolution , the duo plan to force a debate and vote on the subject , ” Yani Kunichoff reported today at Truthout , adding :
Kucinich and Paul argue that the 200 military personnel in Pakistan , some of which are training the Pakistani military in the volatile tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan , were stationed without congressional oversight or approval and must therefore be removed .
Dr. Paul stated that it ’s U.S. occupation that escalates violence .
Mr. Kucinich said on the House floor : “ Wake Up America .
WikiLeaks ’ release of secret war documents gave us 92,000 reasons to end the wars .
Pick one . ”
The Pentagon has launched an investigation into who and how the documents were leaked to WikiLeaks , adding that PFC Bradley Manning is a suspect , a spokesperson said , Kim Zetter and Kevin Poulsen reported yesterday at Wired .
“ He is certainly one person that we would be looking at in terms of this leak , ” said Col. Dave Lapan .
“ He ’s not the only person .
We ’ve neither ruled in or ruled out PFC Manning .
We ’re still assessing the documents to see if we can determine the source of the leak . ”
PFC Manning is a U.S. Army intelligence officer who was kidnapped by the U.S. government for allegedly leaking confidential video depicting U.S. troops in 2007 gunning down unarmed civilians in Iraq from a helicopter and over a quarter - million diplomatic cables .
He was recently charged for “ wrongfully adding unauthorized software to a Secret Internet Protocol Router network computer ” and violating the Espionage Act .
In early June , Philip Shenon at The Daily Beast reported the Pentagon was conducting a “ manhunt ” for Mr. Assange “ for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified State Department cables ” .
EDIT : As expected the House passed the war - funding bill 308 - 114 , appropriating $ 37bn more for the occupation of Afghanistan , and quashed the bill introduced by Mr. Kucinich and Dr. Paul 38-372 .
Greenfoot is a beginner ’s programming environment for ages 13 upwards .
It is a programming framework and IDE for Java targeted towards games and simulations : anything where the main output is 2D graphics and sound .
Here ’s some screenshots :
Greenfoot has several nice aspects ( disclaimer : I ’m a developer on the Greenfoot project ) .
One is that the visual setting allows instant feedback on what your code is doing .
You write a line of code to get your crab moving across the screen , and two clicks later your code is running and the crab is moving around .
This sort of instant and obvious feedback is very useful when you are beginning programming .
( Actually , it ’s always useful — but we have to learn to do without as we progress to programming more complicated systems ! )
You can invoke methods on objects by right - clicking on the object and selecting the method from a pop-up menu , which is a little bit like a graphical version of a REPL .
So if you are given a scenario with some pre-coded behaviour , you can interact with the objects before even getting to the code .
Another nice aspect of Greenfoot is that it embodies object - orientation well .
Not everyone ( and probably especially not Haskell programmers ) is sold on OOP , but set that aside for this post .
The object / class divide is immediately present : Wombat is a class , you can create many Wombat objects in the world that have the same fields and same behaviour , but different state .
This is obvious from them running around separately : the concept comes across implicitly rather than having to be taught too explicitly , because of the design of the system .
A while ago people used to scoff at Java , declaring “ public static void main ( String [ ] args ) ” as a reason to stay away : too much is revealed upfront before the students can start programming .
Incidentally , one could equally apply the same criticism to Haskell : the monadic type of the main function forces beginners to confront monads immediately .
Greenfoot and other frameworks have shown this is easily dealt with .
You will never see the main method in Greenfoot , and care is taken to steer beginners away from blank screens or from having to learn too much before they can get going .
Writing Hello
World starting with a blank file takes at least seven lines of Java code to print out a line of text , but adding one line of Java code in your first part - filled Greenfoot scenario makes a crab run across the screen .
It is n’t the language that makes the difference for how hard it is to get started , it ’s the framework .
The original designers of Greenfoot wanted to teach OOP to beginners , so they found a way to get across the key concepts of OOP easily , put it in a setting ( interactive games ) that can attract young beginners and produced the software ( and supporting teaching material ) .
Idea times execution .
What about Haskell ?
This leads to my question : if a beginner ’s environment can be produced for OOP and Java , surely it can be done for functional programming : specifically , Haskell .
( The same question applies to the process - oriented programming model that CHP espouses — I believe the answer there is a clear yes , with a relatively close correspondence to the OOP design of Greenfoot , so it ’s a bit less interesting to discuss . )
Let ’s toy with a potential design for a Greenfoot - like system in Haskell : that is , an interactive , graphics - based environment for beginner Haskell programmers .
I ’ll give our hypothetical system the name StartHaskell , just to make referring to it easier for the rest of the post .
First of all , what are the key concepts we would like people to learn in Haskell at the beginning ?
Function calls are central : without understanding functions and function calls , you ca n’t do anything in Haskell .
Types are quite important , too — especially since they are bound to be the second class of error you encounter ( your first will be a syntax error ) .
These are very obvious : functions are as fundamental to functional programming as variables are to imperative programming , and types are very important in functional programming .
A key and distinguishing feature of Haskell is the notion of a monad .
Different people have different opinions on monads .
Is it best to introduce them via a simple monad like Maybe or State , or is it better to use the IO monad ?
A myriad of monad tutorials on the Internet provide all the different answers you can imagine .
The IO monad is the one that does tend to push monads in the programmer ’s path sooner rather than later : the main function has a monadic IO type .
Should this be hidden by providing a main function that calls the programmer ’s pure functions , or should it just be exposed straight away ?
Whether or not you expose monads is closely tied to the API design of StartHaskell .
API Designs
The notion of API in a programming environment like Greenfoot or StartHaskell actually swings both ways .
There is the API that the StartHaskell system provides to the programmer , which will include things like functions dealing with images .
But there is also the API that the programmer implements for the StartHaskell system — which is mainly what I want to discuss ( and which has a heavy influence on the first kind , the system - provided API ) .
In Greenfoot , every active thing in the world inherits from an Actor super - class , which has an act ( ) method that the programmer implements to provide the functionality of that actor .
These act ( ) methods are called once each frame by the Greenfoot system : this is the API that the programmer implements .
Since our hypothetical StartHaskell system will be functional rather than object - oriented , we will likely have one function to provide the functionality for the whole system ( called once per frame ) rather than bundling the functionality with individual objects .
So let ’s explore some different designs .
Option # 1 : Avoid monads entirely
We could focus entirely on pure functions .
Conal Elliott ’s picture work comes to my mind — and Simon Thompson ’s Haskell book uses pure picture - based examples from the outset ( using lists of lists of pixels , rather than Conal ’s more abstract approach ) .
You could conceive of a graphical framework that perhaps used a function from input - set to output - picture , i.e. step :: ( KeyboardInput , MouseInput ) ->
Picture that would then be called each frame to produce an output picture given the input .
Persistent state — that is , state that persists between frames , such as the position of the player in the world — is needed , so you might allow state to be returned as a result and passed to the next invocation , i.e. step :: ( KeyboardInput , MouseInput ) -> a -> ( Picture , a ) .
You could then provide various combinators for composing pictures that the programmer can use .
( An approach based on Functional Reactive Programming , aka FRP , might also be possible — I do n’t know enough FRP to talk about this , but feel free to write your own blog post explaining how FRP is the way to go ! )
Option # 2 : Have a pure / monad split
Kodu is a new , very polished system for young programmers that uses a visual approach based around “ when / do ” rules .
The “ when ” part specifies a condition that constrains when the rule is run , and the “ do ” aspect specifies the actions to take when the condition is satisfied .
This easily translates into an API such as : rule :: ( Environment -> Bool , SomeMonad ( ) ) .
Different rules could be combined via combinators , or by changing that API into a list of rules .
( One problem I have with lists of these rule - based interfaces is precedence : when one rule fires , does that preclude all other eligible rules firing ?
Or do they all fire together — and if so , in what order ? )
The system could then provide functions for accessing the environment data - type , and various monadic actions for affecting the system , such as drawing .
Persistent state would probably be handled by making the SomeMonad a state monad .
Option # 3 : Introduce monads immediately , using do - notation
A lot of people try to understand monads by looking at the type signatures and going from there .
If you completely ignore how monads are implemented , and just look at do - notation , many monads ( especially the IO monad ) are very close to imperative programming , and thus this is one way to introduce them .
Haskell is a very nice imperative language !
In this case we might require the user to provide an API like step :: SomeMonad ( ) , or to make persistent state more apparent , step :: a -> SomeMonad a .
The system would then provide an API with monadic functions to ask about the world , and to affect the world .
Option # 4 : Do n’t Call Me , I ’ll Call You
In all my options above I have assumed that the StartHaskell system will call the programmer ’s function each frame .
This design is taken from Greenfoot , and has various benefits .
One is that if the programmer ’s function is empty , the surrounding system will still be rendering frames and receiving input .
The interact function in Haskell has this same flavour : here ’s a function that contains my desired behaviour , you handle the heavy lifting of doing the IO and call me at the appropriate point .
One problem with being called by the system is state .
A graphical interactive program such as those in Greenfoot ( e.g. games ) will tend to maintain state : the positions of things in the world and the state of the player .
I mainly dealt with that above by allowing the programmer to return some state that will be passed back in next frame .
I ’ve waved my hand slightly over the type of the state : each program will have a different type for the state , but that should n’t be hard to deal with in the environment .
An alternative approach is to take control : I ’ll write my own code to drive the program and will call you at the appropriate points .
There could be a single call into the framework , like next Frame :: SomeMonad ( ) , that does everything necessary : waits until the next frame is due , renders it , reads all the input devices and so on .
So the most basic program would be forever next Frame .
Not too heavy to get started .
Then you could pass state around yourself more easily instead of having to return it to the StartHaskell environment to be passed back to you later .
API Summary
I do n’t know which of the above options is best — there may be other better options that I have n’t considered .
What I do know is that it is surprisingly important .
What kind of API you ask the programmer to implement will have a big effect on the style of programming that they learn , and on the concepts that they will have to master .
This is particularly true in languages where multiple styles of programming are supported , like Haskell or C++ , whereas Java only really has one main style of programming .
Environment
Greenfoot is not just a software library / framework for graphics .
It is a complete programming environment , including interactive invocation , debugging , buttons for compiling and running the program ( with no build scripts in sight ) , and a source code editor .
Having a complete environment helps beginners a lot .
You do not want beginners who you are teaching any programming language to learn the compiler command and flags on day one : that can come later , the point is to teach them programming !
It is also important to offer a simple environment : giving Eclipse to someone who has n’t programmed before is just unnecessarily complicating their learning process .
A beginner ’s environment should be simpler than that of a professional programmer .
Editor / Compiler
I think one major obstacle in Haskell is likely to be its error messages , particularly those for types .
( Is every error message in Haskell one of : a syntax error , a type error , or an unknown identifier ? )
There has been work done before , for example in Helium , to try to improve this for Haskell .
A better approach to teaching functional programming as a whole might be to use a language with a less powerful type system that allows for simpler errors , but I ’m constraining myself to use Haskell for this post .
So if you do have to teach Haskell , how can you best help with type errors ?
Here is a mock - up of something that I always thought would be useful for type errors :
The idea being that those call - outs appear one - by - one as you move through the source .
I like it because it visualises the process that I go through in my head when I encounter a type error , and the computer can doubtless do it faster than me .
However , it is always worth bearing in my mind that what is helpful for an expert ( as I guess I am in Haskell ) is not necessarily helpful for a beginner .
You need some level of understanding of type inference to work with that representation , and if a beginner does n’t have that understanding then the interface may only serve to confuse .
Thoughts on Teaching Programming
I am a beginner when it comes to teaching and educational research , but here ’s a few thoughts I ’ve picked up so far :
Consider the following as a guiding principle .
There are only two reasons that things are hard to teach : what you are trying to teach needs to be improved ( e.g. it needs more research ) , or you have n’t found a good way to present it .
( Warning : this is an unfalsifiable statement ! )
Recursion is meant to be hard , but there are many who believe recursion ( particularly structural recursion ) is easy when taught right .
Objects were meant to be hard , but I think objects - first works quite well at getting OO concepts across .
Concurrency can be taught to beginners when it ’s a good model ( occam in combination with robotics has proved easy to teach to beginners ) .
And so on and so on .
Beginners can benefit from tools that are specialised to beginners .
It is helpful if both beginners and experts realise this !
Beginners should n’t start with Eclipse because they ’ve heard that ’s what Real Developers ( TM ) use , and experts should not pour scorn on beginners ’ tools because they are too simple or hide intricate detail — that ’s the point !
None of what I have said here about teaching is new , and much of the advice here is already followed on many courses .
Most teachers give out partially - complete code to avoid students beginning with a blank screen , and it ’s well - known that the key to teaching is to find good examples and present the concepts in the right way : it ’s much easier said than done !
My main intention was to think about what an equivalent to Greenfoot for functional programming would be like .
It may be that an interactive graphics - based setting is not a good fit for a first functional programming environment .
Perhaps there are other alternative settings that could be used — but it I think it should be something with a more widely appealing end result than calculating the fibonacci numbers !
And because there 's a convincing case that PBS no longer needs to act as a counterweight to three dominant privately - held networks , why should n't that makeover be fun ?
Instead of grinding out high - minded educational fare , PBS should hold on to its excellent children 's programming , keep doing news work , and devote the rest of its programming to intelligent fictional series , much like BBC One does .
It says a lot about the Public Broadcasting Service that at the top of its programming page , the shows the network touts include Antiques Roadshow , Masterpiece , and PBS NewsHour .
There 's nothing wrong with liking non-partisan news , wondering if you could make a little money off things you 've got sitting around , or giving the kids a half - hour in front of Arthur ( though I draw the line at Barney and Friends , and mourn the late , great Ghostwriter ) .
But speaking bluntly , PBS has become a network to distract the very young and entertain older folks .
It 's time to revitalize American public broadcasting .
Making smart , captivating shows with shorter runs than the standard 22 - episode network order would be great for PBS for several reasons .
First , it would give the network relevance and cachet among smart young audiences who are far too old for playtime , but not yet ready to settle down and fill a house with antiques .
Much as National Public Radio shook up its brand by aggressively covering and streaming music from indie bands , and Public Radio International drew in young , discerning audiences with This American Life , even just a few smart shows could lure a new generation of viewers towards PBS .
Second , the audience for British - style fictional programming already exists on PBS .
Doctor Who , Red Dwarf , and Monty Python 's Flying Circus have all aired on the network .
Those audiences could be enticed into watching original shows with similarly creative worldviews and executions ( and lower production budgets ) if PBS created them .
In a world where millions of people ironically tune in to SyFy Saturday Night creature features , there 's a definite market for smart .
PBS should step in , and step up their game .
Premium cable companies have raised standards for television programming by making intelligent , challenging short - season shows -- but those channels require viewers to pay for them .
PBS could put additional pressure on the basic cable networks by making sure that even folks who can't spring for cable have the option of consistently excellent fictional programming .
That would be a real public service .
London based photographer Edward Horsford photographs balloons in a very unique way .
He freezes them as the leave his hands to explode .
The pictures are taken with a “ high tech ” DIYed sound trigger , Strobes , and one rusty stick .
The following post which bounces from interview to tech details outlines the way to take such photographs .
DIYP : Can you tell DIYP readers a little bit more about yourself ?
Edward : Myself – ha !
– I live in London , and work in service design / informatics for an energy company .
I previously studied industrial design , so the electronics / build involved in making a trigger is n’t an issue .
Photography is usually just a hobby , though I have done the odd bit of commission work .
I ’m very interested in capturing shots that are unique and not the run of the mill .
My high speed trigger was just one way of achieving this .
DIYP : Exploding balloons are kind of an odd object to photograph , can you tell how you started ?
Edward : I ’ve always been interested in high speed photography , in capturing a moment rarely seen and almost never captured .
After being on my to - do list for far too long , I decided to have a go myself .
I wanted to build the right bit of kit , so spent several months working out how I wanted it to work .
I ’m trying to create works that are interesting and highly unique .
Whilst I ’m doing it just for the enjoyment , I really appreciate the comments from people on flickr .
I ’m not shooting with any commercial aims , though would be interested in licensing some of them .
I think my work with the trigger has vastly improved since my first shoot .
There ’s hundreds of water - balloon bursting photos on flickr , but far fewer that are actually interesting .
I did n’t want to take a shot that a hundred people before me have taken , I wanted to shoot it in a new way .
Thus with each shoot I challenge myself both artistically and technically .
I do get some dud shots ( and ideas that do n’t work ) , but have been equally thrilled with the shots that have come out .
With each shoot I ’ve had wonderful comments on flickr which have helped encourage me to keep going .
So thanks to everyone who ’s commended or suggested new ideas .
It ’s nice to know that running around in the dark and getting wet is worth it .
DIYP : What equipment are you using ?
Edward :
You quickly discover that SLR shutters are far to variable and slow to be triggered for high speed shots .
Thus you have to trigger the lighting , and have flashes that can be bright enough yet also have the smallest duration .
The SB600 at 1/64 is * just * ok for this , but the SB800 at 1/128 is much better .
People doing even more high speed stuff like bullets will have custom - made flashes .
I ’m using a custom made trigger that I designed myself .
I spent much time researching the available triggers , and found none that offered anything more than something I could build myself .
It was a good challenge to build , and means that I can be far more adaptable with features and functionality down the line .
I found the CameraAXE a great inspiration , both for features and example code .
It was n’t for sale when I built my trigger , but we have similar feature sets ( I wanted mine to be more adaptable and smaller ) .
I built it over several months last autumn .
The strobes are on lightstands , SLR on tripod .
They all get very wet
General specs of my trigger :
Arduino based ( easy code upload and modification ) : 5 inputs / outputs , Settable trigger delay , 2 line LCD display for setting adjustment , Hardwired trigger button ( can be used as wired camera remote , including pre-focus )
Connection is all through 3.5 mm audio jacks .
All sensor electronics are kept in remote sensor ‘ modules ’ , powered from the main device :
I am shooting in the dark .
I try to set up as the sun goes down , so that I ’m not up too late .
I wear a lightweight jacket with many pockets , and have a flashlight to move around .
I use mount the flashlight shining on me to pre-focus the shots .
London has a fair amount of light pollution , so I tend not to trip up too much .
When I get my wireless flash system working , I plan to make a wireless torch for use in pre-focusing , etc .
DIYP : How are you popping the balloons ?
Edward :
The balloons are popped differently for each shoot .
Generally I use smallish balloons so that when filled the rubber is very taught ( it ’s actually quite a challenge to find balloons of the right size ) .
I have a long piece of sharpened steel rod that I use to do the popping .
I can mount it on a stand or in the air .
DIYP : How do you get them to explode so nicely ?
Edward :
Most of my shots have the balloons filled with water ( and some dye usually ) .
I have tried spraying them and various other ideas , but have yet to get something I ’m happy posting .
Popping 30 - 50 filled water balloons with dye means that at the end of a shoot I tend to look like a Jackson Pollock painting .
Most amusing , except that it ’s pitch black so no - one can see .
DIYP : What advice can you give to some who want to pop balloons and photograph them ?
Edward : Planning – I spend several hours planning each shoot and what I want to achieve
Think of new angles that have n’t been shot before – I specifically avoid presenting the regular balloon shape .
Take many test shots – check focus , exposure , timing .
Much easier to check BEFORE you ’re soaking wet .
Experiment – even with all my planning , I ’ll still try different timings and positions .
Who knows what will work .
Sometimes a mistake in timing has created my best shot .
Post production – even the perfect shot will have some blemishes .
I will correct exposure and contrast , remove unwanted elements , rotate and crop , etc .
A little work can go a long way to making an image special .
DIYP : Can you share some setup and images ?
Edward : sure ( Diagrams courtesy of Sylights )
Floating Upwards
This shoot was all about experimenting with extremes of colour .
I set up my lighting to let me have a coloured background ( only limited by the gel colours I have ) .
The balloons had varied mixes of dye , selected to compliment or contras the background .
Because of the coloured light on the background , it was extra crucial that none of it spill on to the subject .
Even though this shot has a yellow balloon with yellow background , it would look awful if the yellow light had spilt – akin to shooting with a clear balloon on white background , and using ‘ colorize ’ in photoshop .
The working area was extremely tight , and meant that getting the balloon in to position without blocking one of the flashes was particularly challenging .

One speedlight used to illuminate subject , gobo’d to prevent any spill on to the background .
The Other speedlight with coloured gel directed at backgrop – as front - on as possible to get the most even illumination , with gobo to prevent spill on to subject .
Small working area ( in red ) from which to launch water balloon .
Suddenly Bright :
For this shot I was looking for the ‘ instantness ’ of the balloon popping .
Where my previous shots had had the balloon in mid-air , this is one of the few were I ’ve actually been holding the balloon .
So many of the existing shots on flickr are of water balloons in hand , so this had to be technically perfect .
The lighting must be very precise to prevent any spill on me ( I ’m entirely in frame ) .
It took many takes to get the timing just right to have no trace of the balloon rubber visible , yet still a solid body of water with minimal spray .
In post I ’ve lightened the body of the water slightly , and adjusted the yellow to be warmer ( my food yellow dye has a slight greenish tinge ) .

NEXT , I scoured its listings .
There was a luxury apartment in north London owned by an information technology professional who rents it out for £ 65 a night when he ’s out of town .
In Bloomsbury , an American social worker had a room for £ 35 a night .
But my dash across Europe necessitated a bed near St. Pancras International train station , so I opted for a “ clean simple room with a chrome silver double bed ” in the once - seedy district of Kings Cross for £ 50 , owned by a 39 - year - old vintage - clothing buyer .
Once you ’ve found your room on Crashpadder , you can interact with the host through the internal messaging system and ask any questions you might have .
( Do I need to bring towels ?
Do you have cats ? )
Hosts can ask for the money either up front or upon arrival .
A week after booking my room , I rolled my bag through the back streets of Kings Cross , aiming for a 1920s red - brick council building , where my host , Rachelle Hungerford - Boyle , lives on the third floor .
It was the kind of unspectacular housing block that makes up vast swaths of the city , scattered in between the genteel stucco mansions that make it into the films .
I was buzzed through an electronic gate , and found Ms. Hungerford - Boyle hanging over the balcony , beckoning me up .
I maneuvered my way through a soccer game among 8 - year - olds and marched up to meet her .
Inside her small apartment , the living room was dotted with extravagant secondhand dresses she had picked up in markets around the world .
She ’d sell her prize possession , a fluffy ball gown dangling from the window , only to Lady Gaga , she said .
My room , just over 10 by 10 feet , with a double bed and a door that locked , was good enough as a base .
There was also a kitchen I was free to use , and a bathroom and shower .
As this was my first social B&B experience , it was also immediately clear what I was n’t getting .
I could n’t walk around naked , for example , and there was n’t a concierge who could make a dinner reservation for me .
But there was Ms. Hungerford - Boyle , who , while making her temporary bed in the living room ( where she sleeps when she has guests ) , told me how quickly the area was gentrifying , and suggested I visit Simmons , a trendy bar around the corner .
At Simmons later that evening , I thought about the £ 50 I had paid for Ms. Hungerford - Boyle ’s spare room .
Founded in 2008 , Crashpadder has n’t expanded as much as AirBnB ( in early July it had listings in 898 cities compared with AirBnB ’s 5,378 ) .
I had a feeling that prices were somewhat scattershot , freed from the self - regulating bonds of a more mature marketplace .
At my next stop , I wanted more .
The next morning I caught a Eurostar train to Paris , where my social B&B was booked through AirBnB.com .
The site , which is based in San Francisco , was started by Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky , roommates who decided to rent out their spare bedroom to people visiting the city for a design conference .
An idea was born .

Courses and Papers at Siggraph
There will be three courses offered at SIGGRAPH this year that touch on OpenGL .
Details of each course are below , and complete schedules are available on the SIGGRAPH website .
Build Your Own 3D Display
SUNDAY , 25 JULY | 3:45 PM - 5:15 PM | ROOM 403 AB
Film studios are now routinely producing live - action and animated 3D content for theatrical release .
This advance is primarily enabled by widespread adoption of digital projection , which allows accurate view synchronization , but the underlying 3D display technologies have changed little in the last few decades .
Theatrical systems rely on stereoscopic display : projecting unique images for the right and left eyes and separating the images with various filters in viewing glasses .
But now several LCD manufacturers are introducing auto - multiscopic displays , which allow view - dependent imagery to be perceived without special glasses .
3D display is poised for another resurgence .
This course provides attendees with the mathematics , software , and practical details they need to build their own low - cost stereoscopic displays .
Each new concept is illustrated using a practical 3D display implemented with off - the - shelf parts .
First , the course explains glasses - bound stereoscopic displays and provides detailed plans for attendees to construct their own LCD shutter glasses .
Then the course explains unencumbered auto - multiscopic displays , including step - by - step directions to construct lenticular and parallax - barrier designs using modified LCDs .
All the necessary software , including algorithms for rendering and calibration , is provided for each example , so attendees can quickly construct 3D displays for their own educational , amusement , and research purposes .
The course concludes by describing various methods for capturing , rendering , and viewing various multi-view imagery sources : stereoscopic OpenGL support , methods for ray - tracing multi-view imagery with POV - Ray , and techniques for capturing live - action light fields .

First up , SOE !
After setting up an appointment , we got one - on - one demos of DC Universe Online and Magic : The Gathering Tactics .
First on our list was DC Universe Online .
This game looks like a more action - intense version of City of Heroes , complete with the ability to use the environment to beat the living daylights out of your opponents .
The above image is not of the “ main ” game , but is instead an instanced “ versus mode ” that allows players to play as iconic characters , complete with their unique powers and abilities .
Players can also remember what tactics work against these iconic characters when taking them down as their heroes ( or villains ) in the main game .
“ If you want to be a legend , you have to learn from the legends , ” producer Wes Yanagi says as he flies through the air as a jetpack - wearing Joker , firing dual pistols at anybody within range .
Players begin with access to only Harley Quinn and Robin , but as they progress through this mode and rise through the ranks , more characters become available .
After a brief look at the new Clone Wars Adventures game ( it actually looks decent , surprisingly enough ) while waiting for a kiosk of Magic : The Gathering Tactics to open up , we were treated to a hands - on demo of the new turn - based strategy .
That right there is the Serra Angel , getting ready to kick some serious ass .
And believe me , she does .
Speaking of , while the content is indeed drawn from the popular trading card game , the grid - based gameplay is almost nothing like what Magic fans are used to .
It ’s turn - based , creature - summoning , spellcasting strategy at its best , with players building a set list of creatures and spells rather than drawing cards from a deck .
While Magic fans have been generally supportive , the particularly rabid ones may be turned off .
Still , SOE does n’t seem to be worried .
“ The diehard fans have a game , ” Blaine Loder , the QA lead for SOE Denver says .
“ It ’s called Magic . ”
It seems that this game is definitely charting its own course , and to me , that looks like a good thing .
Look for both of these titles to hopefully come out before the end of 2010 .
Before the Biros left the Tate , they say , they walked through a gallery that had several Turner paintings on display .
Peter Paul paused in front of Turner ’s “ Chichester Canal , ” peering at the pale - blue sky reflecting off the waterway , which made it seem as if the earth had been turned upside down .
In the foliage of several trees , he says , he noticed tiny swirls in the paint .
He looked more closely .
They were from a partial fingerprint .
He felt a jolt : he had noticed partial fingerprints embedded in the potential Turner painting as well .
In both pictures , he says , the ridges were deep enough in the original dried paint that they could not have been left by the hands of an owner or a restorer ; rather , they were a by - product of Turner ’s technique of modelling paint with his fingertips .
Indeed , Biro says , he subsequently found fingerprints in hundreds of Turner ’s works , and wondered :
Why not compare the fingerprint in an undisputed Turner painting like “ Chichester Canal ” with the one in his own painting , and see if they matched ?
The desire to transform the authentication process through science — to supplant a subjective eye with objective tools — was not new .
During the late nineteenth century , the Italian art critic Giovanni Morelli , dismissing many traditional connoisseurs as “ charlatans , ” proposed a new “ scientific ” method based on “ indisputable and practical facts . ”
Rather than search a painting for its creator ’s intangible essence , he argued , connoisseurs should focus on minor details such as fingernails , toes , and earlobes , which an artist tended to render almost unconsciously .
“ Just as most men , both speakers and writers , make use of habitual modes of expression , favorite words or sayings , that they employ involuntarily , even inappropriately , so too every painter has his own peculiarities that escape him without his being aware , ” Morelli wrote .
He believed that not only did an Old Master expose his identity with these “ material trifles ” ; forgers and imitators were also less likely to pay sufficient attention to them , and thus betray themselves .
Morelli became known as the Sherlock Holmes of the art world .
To many connoisseurs , however , the nature of art was antithetical to cold science .
Worse , Morelli made his own share of false attributions , prompting one art historian to dismiss him as a “ quack doctor . ”
In the early twentieth century , as J. P. Morgan , Henry Clay Frick , and other wealthy Americans bid up prices of Old Masters , the search for a foolproof system of connoisseurship intensified .
At the same time , the flood of money into the art market led to widespread corruption , with dealers often paying off connoisseurs to validate paintings .
In 1928 , the art dealer René Gimpel complained , “ The American collector is prey to the greatest swindle the world has ever seen : the certified swindle . ”
The public has long been suspicious of connoisseurship .
As John Brewer recounts in his recent book “ The American Leonardo , ” about a Kansas City couple ’s battle , in the nineteen - twenties , to authenticate a potential Leonardo , this distrust had to do with more than the system ’s reliability ; it also had to do with doubts about the authenticity of the art world itself , with its cult of prized artists , its exorbitant trafficking in aesthetic pleasure , and an élite that seemed even more rarefied than most .
In 1920 , the Kansas couple , Harry and Andrée Hahn , sued the powerful art dealer Joseph Duveen for half a million dollars after he told a reporter that a portrait they owned could not possibly be a Leonardo .
The Hahns argued that connoisseurs offered only “ air - spun abstractions and nebulous mumbo- jumbos , ” and that “ smart and tricky art dealers ” ran a “ racket . ”
Even the judge in the case warned jurors to be wary of experts who relied on means “ too introspective and subjective . ”
( Though none of the leading connoisseurs considered the painting a Leonardo , and later technical evaluations confirmed their judgment , the trial ended in a hung jury , and Duveen paid the Hahns sixty thousand dollars to settle the case . )
The desire to “ scientificize ” connoisseurship was therefore as much about the desire to democratize it , to wrest it out of the hands of art experts .
Before the Hahn trial , rumors surfaced that there was a thumbprint in the paint .
One newspaper asked , “ WILL THUMBPRINT MADE 400 YEARS AGO PROVE PAINTING IS LEONARDO DA VINCI ’S ORIGINAL ? ”
But identifying the author of a painting through fingerprints still seemed far beyond the reach of science , and the process of authentication remained largely unchanged until Biro came up with his radical idea .
After returning from London , Biro studied books on fingerprinting and conferred with a retired fingerprint examiner .
He learned the difference between a latent print — which is transferred with sweat and often needs to be dusted or processed with chemical agents in order to be detected — and a visible print , which is either impressed in a substance or left by touching a surface with something on one ’s fingertips , such as ink .
He learned fingerprint patterns , including loops , whorls , and tented arches .
And he learned how to tell whether two fingerprints had enough overlapping characteristics to be deemed a match .
“ He basically trained himself , ” Laszlo recalls .
“ He read and studied everything . ”
Biro asked the conservation department at the Tate for images of “ Chichester Canal ” that were sufficiently high in resolution to show the fingerprint .
For days , Biro says , he compared enhanced images of the fingerprint with the one on the rainbow painting ; he felt certain that they came from the same person .
Yet the art establishment refused to recognize the painting based on his approach .
( As Laszlo puts it , the art world is “ very jealous and sinister . ” )
In 1994 , after years of frustration , the Biros took the painting to a Turner scholar , David Hill , at the University of Leeds .
He thought that the composition and coloring strongly pointed to the hand of Turner , and he enlisted John Manners , a fingerprint examiner with the West Yorkshire Police , to verify Biro ’s conclusions .
“ Not my cup of tea , really , ” Manners said of the painting at the time .
“ Of course , some Turner canvases are magnificent .
Not this one , in my opinion . ”
Still , he said , the fingerprints definitely matched : “ It is a Turner . ”
Hill called the fingerprints the “ clinching piece of evidence . ”
The story of the fingerprints circulated around the world — “ BURIED TREASURE VERIFIED BY SCIENCE , ” the Toronto Globe and Mail declared — and many Turner scholars relented on the question of attribution .
“ It was the pressure of the media , ” Biro said .
“ They were beginning to look foolish . ”
In 1995 , the painting , called “ Landscape with a Rainbow , ” was sold as a Turner at the Phillips auction house in London .
An undisclosed bidder bought it for more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars — a sum that would have been even higher had the painting been in better condition .
It was the first art work officially authenticated based on fingerprint identification .
Biro asserted that he had uncovered the painting ’s “ forensic provenance , ” telling a reporter , “ The science of fingerprint identification is a true science .
There are no gray areas . ”
Having developed what he advertised as a “ rigorous methodology ” that followed “ accepted police standards , ” he began to devote part of the family business to authenticating works of art with fingerprints — or , as he liked to say , to “ placing an artist at the scene of the creation of a work . ”
In 2000 , Biro took on an even more spectacular case .
A retired truck driver named Teri Horton hired Biro to examine a large drip canvas , painted in the kinetic style of Jackson Pollock , that she had bought for five dollars at a thrift shop in San Bernardino , California .
After inspecting the work , Biro announced that he had found a partial fingerprint on the back of the canvas , and had matched it to a fingerprint on a paint can that is displayed in Pollock ’s old studio , in East Hampton .
André Turcotte , a retired fingerprint examiner with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , supported the results .
But the International Foundation for Art Research , a nonprofit organization that is the primary authenticator of Pollock ’s works , balked , saying that Biro ’s method was not yet “ universally ” accepted .
Biro , in a report on Horton ’s painting , wrote that he had been warned that “ science prying into the closed world of connoisseurship is likely to make me many enemies . ”
Horton , meanwhile , became a modern - day Harry and Andrée Hahn , dismissing the method of traditional connoisseurs as “ bullshit , ” and the whole art world as a “ fraud . ”
Biro told me that he maintains a firewall between his research and the sale of a painting , and that he receives the same fee — two thousand dollars a day — regardless of the outcome of his investigation .
“ If I stopped being disinterested , my credibility will be gone , ” he said .
But he felt “ morally obliged ” to stand behind his findings .
The effort to authenticate the painting became a crusade .
Horton went on “ The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , ” and her struggle was valorized in a 2006 documentary called “ Who the # $& % Is Jackson Pollock ? ”
In the film , Biro is depicted as a champion of science and of a woman with an eighth - grade education battling an autocratic establishment .
The main antagonist — “ the effete , nose - in - the - air art expert , ” as he later quipped of his role — is Thomas Hoving .
He is shown , in a suit and tie , sitting before Horton ’s picture and declaring , “ Dead on arrival . ”
Later , offering a rationale for his response , he noted that Horton ’s picture featured acrylic paint , which had not previously been documented in Pollock ’s drip paintings .
Biro , undaunted , visited Pollock ’s old studio and extracted pigment samples from the floor , where the artist had once spread his canvases and applied paint .
In a report , Biro wrote that he had used a “ microchemistry test ” — a method of mixing a paint sample with other chemicals to analyze its characteristics .
“ The very first sample of paint I tested , ” he said , “ turned out to be acrylic . ”
He also revealed that gold paint from a matchstick embedded in the floor was the same as gold paint found in Horton ’s picture .
Hoving remained unmoved .
He dismissed the fingerprints , and said of Horton , “ She knows nothing .
. . .
I ’m an expert , she ’s not . ”
In reviews of the film , Hoving was denounced as a “ pompous fool ” and a “ villain ” ; Biro was called a “ hero . ”
Based on Biro ’s findings , Horton was offered two million dollars for her painting , but she held out for more .
Biro assured her that the art world could not continue to resist a forensic method that had been used to convict criminals for more than a century .
And though many connoisseurs and collectors opposed his technique , more and more accepted it .
He told me that he had authenticated two Picassos , half a dozen Turners , a Thomas Hart Benton , and close to a dozen other Pollocks .
Several of the world ’s top connoisseurs sought Biro ’s expertise .
Three years ago , two leading Pollock scholars , Claude Cernuschi and Ellen G. Landau , cited Biro ’s evaluation of a suspected Pollock , saying , “ Artists ’ fingerprints do not show up just anywhere .
Their presence cannot be dismissed or simply explained away . ”
Around this time , Biro helped Martin Kemp attribute a painting , partly on the basis of fingerprints , to one of Leonardo ’s assistants .
In an earlier e-mail to a client , Biro wrote , “ The world is changing .
Not as fast as one would hope but it is changing nevertheless . ”
In 2009 , Biro and Nicholas Eastaugh , a scientist known for his expertise on pigments , formed a company , Art Access and Research , which analyzes and authenticates paintings .
Biro is its director of forensic studies .
Clients include museums , private galleries , corporations , dealers , and major auction houses such as Sotheby ’s .
Biro was also enlisted by the Pigmentum Project , which is affiliated with Oxford University .
His work is published in museum catalogues and in scientific publications , including Antiquity and the official journal of the Royal Microscopical Society .
In the media , he has become one of the most prominent art experts , featured in documentaries and news reports .
( He was once mentioned in this magazine , in The Talk of the Town . )
He even has a cameo — as the man who “ pioneered the whole technique ” of fingerprint authentications — in Peter Robinson ’s popular detective novel “ Playing with Fire ” ; the story is about a charming , “ chameleonlike ” con man who runs an art - forgery ring .
On his Web site , Biro notes that law enforcement has adopted his approach : “ My analytical techniques were presented internally at a training course at the F.B.I .
I am not permitted to go beyond that . ”
Biro told me that the divide between connoisseurs and scientists was finally eroding .
The best demonstration of this change , he added , was the fact that he had been commissioned to examine “ La Bella Principessa ” and , possibly , help make one of the greatest discoveries in the history of art .
During one of the visits I made to Biro ’s home , he offered to share with me what he had learned about “ La Bella Principessa . ”
We were in the living room , and the sweet scent of his wife ’s French cooking kept wafting in from the kitchen .
“ You ’ve never tasted anything so good , ” Biro said .
He went over to a varnished desk , where there was a computer , and clicked on an icon .
An image of the drawing appeared on the screen .
He zoomed in on the upper - left edge of the parchment , and pointed to a small mark on the surface : a fingerprint .
It looked like little more than a smudge , and I squinted at the blurry lines .
Even in a high - resolution photograph , the fingerprint was unreadable ; Biro called it “ complete visual confusion . ”
Many fingerprint examiners , he said , would have been stymied .
Then , as if he were lining up a row of mug shots , he called up a series of photographs from a multispectral - imaging camera .
Because the images had been made with different wavelengths of light , none of them looked exactly the same .
In some photographs , the texture of the parchment — the background “ noise , ” as Biro put it — was pronounced .
In others , the ridge patterns in the fingerprint were accentuated and the parchment all but faded away .
From one photograph to the next , Biro said , “ the smudge becomes clearer . ”
Still , it was not clear enough .
His next step , he said , was “ proprietary . ”
Using advanced image - processing software , he subtracted the background noise from each image , until only the clearest parts of the fingerprint remained .
Finally , he said , clicking on another icon , “ You get this . ”
The smudge had been transformed into a more legible print : now , at least , there were the outlines of ridges and bumps .
When I asked Biro if he worried that his method might be flawed , he said that during nearly two decades of fingerprint examinations he had “ not made one mistake . ”
He added , “ I take a long time and I do n’t allow myself to be rushed . ”
Thousands of devoted Apple customers have already purchased the light - weight 3GI .
SAN FRANCISCO —
In a move expected to revolutionize the mobile device industry , Apple launched its fastest and most powerful iPhone to date Tuesday , an innovative new model that can only be seen by the company 's hippest and most dedicated customers .

" I am proud today to introduce to those who really , truly deserve it , our most incredible iPhone yet , " announced Apple CEO Steve Jobs , extending his seemingly empty left palm toward the eagerly awaiting crowd .
" Not only is this our lightest and slimmest model ever , but as any truly savvy Apple customer can clearly see , it 's also the most handsome product we 've ever designed . "
The packed auditorium , which had been listening to Jobs in hushed reverence for several minutes , then erupted into applause , with hundreds of men and women suddenly jumping to their feet and shouting , " I can see it ! "
" Look , there it is ! " and " God , it 's so beautiful ! "

Steve Jobs unveils the updated iPhone exclusively to those who really , really want to see it .
Screams of " Of course , yes , I too can see the phone , " were also heard at this time .

According to Apple , the new iPhone 3GI boasts significant hardware and software upgrades , superior processing speeds , and a multi - touch interface that provides those who are " cool enough " with a rich user experience .
The wide - screen display reportedly also features the most brilliant colors and finest resolution ever imagined .
" The new 3GI is as light as air , " said Apple senior vice president Philip Schiller , reaching inside an empty display case , apparently to remove the mobile device .
" See how thin that is ?
It 's like it 's not even there . "

" Those who really understand what we do here at Apple are going to love this new product , " Schiller continued .
" Unless , you know , they happen to be totally lame . "
Retailing for $ 599 , the iPhone 3GI offers only the most special Apple consumers — the ones who believe in the company more than anything else in the world , and who would never , ever dream of questioning it — the ability to open dozens of powerful applications at once .
In addition , the new multimedia device will provide true Apple fans with a high - definition video camera , one - tap editing with Final Cut Pro , and cut and paste .

Like thousands of others , New York resident Kelly Delaney called in sick to work so that she could join the line outside the Apple Store 's trendy SoHo location days before the 3GI went on sale .

" Oh my God , I can't believe how much faster you can get online with this , " said Delaney , who exited the store holding a cupped hand up to her ear and yelling into her wrist about how wonderful the new phone was .
" The reception is so clear , and you can pretty much get a signal no matter where you go . "
" Hold on a sec , " continued Delaney , suddenly shaking her hand up and down .
" I think my battery is dying . "

According to Apple , the new iPhone launched in 22 countries and sold a record - breaking 8 million units on its first day .
" The selection of colors is amazing , " said Paul Conrad , a Fairfield , VA native who purchased phones in black , white , and silver .
" Not only does it look awesome , but it can do pretty much anything you want as long as you believe in it . "

" The AppleCare Plan does n't cover dropping your phone , though , so I 'd recommend buying one of these designer protective cases , " Conrad added .
While the new iPhone has been greatly admired and widely touted for its impressive voice and data communication capabilities , some Americans remain skeptical .

" Daddy is n't talking into anything at all , " said 4 - year - old Ella Conrad , pointing at her father , Paul , who has been obsessively staring at , playing with , and customizing the invisible phone since purchasing it Monday .
" Daddy 's pretending to be on hold with an operator . "

How to submit a column Efforts to abolish the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and instead allow open homosexual behavior in the military have left the U.S. armed forces in a strange state of limbo .
NO : The mission is to serve all troops
One of the most obvious disruptions on the horizon : the uncertain impact to the chaplaincy and the increasing concern about the effect on religious liberty if the policy is dismantled .
More than 40 high - ranking and distinguished veteran chaplains signed a letter to the president and senior military officials in April outlining how the suggested changes would likely harm the ability of the chaplaincy to do its job .
This harm includes limitations on the right of chaplains to preach , counsel , or teach according to their faith when doing so requires identifying homosexual behavior as sinful or detrimental .
The harm also includes restrictions on the ability of chaplains to freely conduct religious services without being forced to allow people who engage in homosexual behavior to take positions of leadership or receive sacraments , for example .
And it would include forcing chaplain - administered programs , such as the Army 's " Strong Bonds " marriage - building program , to modify their teaching if same - sex couples participate .
Chaplains are committed to ministering to everyone but cannot allow the government to dictate how religious ministry takes place .
These concerns are not mere speculation but are based in both the practical realities of everyday chaplaincy life and numerous precedents showing that the danger to religious liberty is real .
Cause for concern
In the late 1990s , for instance , the Clinton administration tried to silence military chaplains from speaking out against " partial - birth " abortion , even banning speech in the pulpit .
Similarly , chaplains who oppose the normalization of homosexual behavior in the military will likely face direct orders — potentially in the form of non-discrimination laws — and subtle pressure to keep their opposition silent , while chaplains who support the change will be free from such limitations .
Another case particularly illustrates the effect on the chaplaincy .
In 2002 , prison chaplain William Akridge was punished by Ohio prison officials for denying an inmate the privilege to lead chapel worship services because he actively participated in homosexual behavior .
Federal courts later denied Akridge 's argument that the First Amendment should give him the freedom to hold religious services according to the dictates of his faith .
If that could happen in a prison in Ohio , what should we expect in a politicized military ?
An increasing number of religious bodies — including organizations that directly supply the military 's chaplains — have been raising this concern .
These groups include the Southern Baptist Convention , the Roman Catholic Church and more than 800 Orthodox Jewish rabbis .
In addition , Professor John Martin at the Army War College has identified the religious liberty concern as one of several " significant issues " raised by the tearing down of the military 's existing policy .
Quieting dissent Already , constitutional rights are taking a beating .
When Lt. Gen. Benjamin Mixon recommended that servicemembers speak out to Congress regarding the dismantling of " do n't ask , do n't tell , " he was swiftly rebuked by Adm.
Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Unsurprisingly , some active - duty chaplains are mum against this censorial backdrop .
Why risk such censure ?
Even lawmakers on Capitol Hill have dismissed the concerns of the chiefs of the Army , Air Force , Navy and Marines , who pleaded that any changes wait until a comprehensive review is completed so that we can ensure that our military 's ability to fight and win wars — its primary duty — is not undermined .
Congress has refused to even consider adopting statutory language that would provide some protection for religious liberty .
At best , then , Congress is risking the rights of our servicemembers .
At worse , they 're sacrificing them for a partisan political agenda .
These political efforts have already disrupted the military mission by placing the military in a state of limbo .
They should not also destroy the free religious exercise rights of those who fight and die to protect our own right to worship .
Daniel Blomberg serves as litigation counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund , a legal alliance seeking to protect and preserve religious liberty , the sanctity of life , marriage and the family .

ASCAP Boss Refuses To Debate Lessig ; Claims That It 's An Attempt To ' Silence ' ASCAP
from the you - and - me - against - the - world dept
Anti-copyright crusaders are currently engaged in a publicity campaign to discredit ASCAP 's efforts to defend the copyrights of our professional songwriter and composer members .
The copyleft movement has encouraged a culture of disrespect for copyright by defending corporate and individual infringers ; undermining every effort to provide more effective protection , no matter how limited or reasonable ; promoting a reduction in copyright protection ; supporting the dismantling of our rights through the courts ; and questioning the basic premise that the tidal wave of infringements and unlicensed uses online hurts creators .
I am well aware of those " copyleft " mouthpieces who take a highly critical view of ASCAP 's efforts to protect our members ' rights .
That will not change ASCAP 's commitment to doing so .
ASCAP exists for one purpose -- fair payment to music creators for the use of their music by businesses and others who seek to attract viewers and customers .
ASCAP has long welcomed and licensed new technological means of performing its members works , seeking only reasonable fees for those performances .
Our members have every right to give their music away for free if they choose , but they should not be forced to do so .
What I find most fascinating is that those who purport to support a climate of free culture work so hard to silence opposing points of view .
They will not silence me .

We were among those who were amazed at ASCAP 's misguided and factually incorrect attack on EFF , Public Knowledge and Creative Commons .
ASCAP 's Paul Williams falsely made the claim that those three groups were against copyright and against compensating content creators .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
All three groups responded politely to the bizarre and factually incorrect attack , and many ASCAP members who support these groups and use Creative Commons licenses expressed their displeasure with ASCAP for such a blatantly misleading letter .
Larry Lessig responded with a blog post , again pointing out the blatant errors in ASCAP 's attack , noting that these groups actually look to help content creators by providing them tools to better exercise their rights .
In that blog post , Lessig also challenged Williams to a debate so they could iron out their differences and ASCAP could ( hopefully ) retract their false attacks on these groups , and focus on helping artists again .
Hephaestus points out that Williams and ASCAP have refused to debate Lessig , with an open letter that is so bizarre that I keep rereading it to make sure it 's not a joke .
But , apparently , it 's no joke , and it gets more and more bizarre the further you read , down to the point where Williams suggests Lessig 's request for a debate is really an attempt to " silence " him .
But , let 's start at the beginning : Again , the groups that Williams mentioned ( though , amusingly , he does not rename them here ) are not anti-copyright .
And the statement is wrong as well .
The only thing people are trying to " discredit , " are the blatantly false claims that EFF , Public Knowledge and Creative Commons are trying to undermine copyright or that " their mission is to spread the word that our music should be free . "
None of those groups makes any such claim .
Well , that 's one way of looking at things .
Even if it 's wrong .
First of all , Creative Commons has done no such thing in " defending " infringers .
That 's just false .
EFF and Public Knowledge do n't defend infringement , either .
They defend consumer rights , and advocate balance in how copyright law treats consumers .
Copyright law in the US was always supposed to be about providing more benefit to society as a whole , not about protectionism of artists .
That EFF and Public Knowledge get attacked for simply reminding people of that fact seems like a travesty .
As for the final point : " questioning the basic premise that the tidal wave of infringements and unlicensed uses online hurts creators . "
How does asking whether or not a claim made by certain organizations isorundermine copyright ?
Has ASCAP really sunk so low that simply looking to see if something is factual is somehow " undermining " copyright ?
Really ?
Then , in responding directly to Lessig 's debate challenge , Williams spends a few paragraphs talking about his own success as a songwriter , and how he now spends all of his time fighting for the right of songwriters to make a living .
And , because of that , he does n't have time to debate Lessig , because he does n't see how it will " help " in this neverending fight .
Of course , this is ridiculous .
Everyone wants content creators to be fairly compensated and to earn a good living .
The EFF has even put together a proposal ( which I do n't agree with ) to create an ASCAP - like setup for digital music .
Creative Commons gives content creators more options in easily licensing their music , to make it easier for them to get heard and to use within a business model .
As for Public Knowledge , just a few months ago I was at an event they put on , which celebrated various content creators and their success stories in figuring out smart ways to earn a living .
And , of course , many others who are regularly derided as being a part of the " copyleft " are successful content creators ourselves , and regularly highlight smart ways for content creators to earn a living .
Suggesting that any of us are against helping content creators earn a living is both false and extremely disingenuous .
And then it gets bizarre .
Williams simply repeats the false claims that were clearly debunked by tons of people in responding to his original letter : People are n't upset that ASCAP is trying to protect members ' rights .
They 're upset that ( 1 ) ASCAP seems to stretch the legal boundaries to do so -- such as claiming that ringtones or the 30 - second " previews " on iTunes are " public performances " that require a separate licensing fee and ( 2 ) that you falsely claimed any of these groups were somehow seeking to " force " musicians to give away their music for free .
No one has ever suggested that at all .
That 's what got everyone upset .
For Wiliams ' response to simply repeat that blatantly false claim is strange .
And then there 's this :
Huh ?!?
No one has tried , at all , to silence Williams .
In fact , people seem to have done the exact opposite .
They 've asked you to come out and talk about stuff in a public debate .
That 's the opposite of trying to silence you .
No one has any interest in silencing Williams at all .
We just want him to stop making totally false claims and attacking groups who have worked hard to support artists as well by falsely suggesting they seek to undermine artists .

A muse on a hot day .
I was having a drink at a swell bar in the city the other night .
The place was packed .
My friend and I had a laugh about an old story that crossed our lives many years ago .
The story of Red Money .
Some time later , as we were leaving , a well - healed guy comes to me and says a bit conspiratorially , “ I believe in Red Money too ” .
I am not sure where this story originated .
It has been around forever .
The reason it has stood the rumor mill test of time is that it is so fundamentally believable .
It goes like this .
One morning we wake up and the Treasury has made an announcement that it is going to convert all US currency from green to red .
The process will commence immediately and continue for a period not to exceed four months .
Very few would be impacted .
If you had money in a bank , money fund or brokerage account it would make no difference .
If you had some green cash you would either spend it or deposit it into your account .
It would not influence the value of the holdings of foreign reserves .
That is all “ electronic ” money .
Red money would only impact cash money .
The Federal Reserve reports that there is approximately $ 1 trillion of US coinage outstanding currently .
That number is up from $ 570 b in 2000 and $ 260 b in 1990 .
As a percentage of economic activity it has risen from 4.5 % of GDP in 1990 to 7 % today .
For as long as I can remember the Federal Reserve has always had this disclaimer on the Coinage Outstanding line in the reported balance sheet :
16 . Estimated .
In this case “ estimated ” could mean anything .
It might be something reasonable like +/- 10 % .
But if you are inclined to believe in Red Money you might also be inclined to believe that this estimate could be off by 100 % .
What might happen if we woke up to a red money world ?
- Again , for all electric money and most of the actual cash holders this would mean nothing .
The next time you went to an ATM it would come out red .
The new and old would be equally acceptable .
As old is spent it would work its way through retailers and Banks with no problem .
After the four months money could still be changed .
But it would require disclosure .
- US money is in every corner of the world .
When the word gets out that it ca n’t be used after a given period of time it too will be exchanged back through the banks .
The moneychangers around the world would have a field day for a while .
- There are many groups out there that are holding onto cash money for reasons that go in color from grey to black .
You have the husband who tries to hide money from his wife .
You have a million small retailers who skim cash every week to hide from the IRS .
Illegal aliens in the US all have cash money .
There is a ton of gambling money .
On the completely illegal side we go from bad to worse .
Drug dealers , drug cartels , organized crime , bank robbers and all manner of burglars .
Throw in the pirates , gunrunners , crooked politicians and very bad boys that I put in the Jihadists camp .
How much of the money outstanding is in these hands ?
More than we want to believe .
$ 300 - 500 billion would be my guess .
- You ca n’t deposit more than $ 10 k into a bank and not have a “ flag item ” requiring disclosure and identification .
While some black money will get back into the banking system the bulk of it will be stuck .
This will be a global phenomenon .
- If you had a million or so in hundred dollar bills that were going to be toilet paper in a few months and the “ teller window ” was closed , what would you do ?
Spend it as fast as you could .
What might you buy ?
Anything , including : Jewelry , uncut diamonds , gold and silver , big boats , as many cars as you could find , houses , raw land , cases of wine , art works .
Anything that had a chance to hold value .
Fur coats and expensive clothes would be flying off the shelf .
Restaurants would be full and travel / leisure would explode .
- Red Money would have to be done with a wink and a nod .
It would be understood in advance that a consequence would be that Bergdorf Goodman , Saks and Macy ’s would quadrupled their cash sales overnight .
That would be the intended consequence .
So long as the money was going into consumption they would look the other way .
But at the same time some very big ( and smart ) eyes and ears would be looking at the money flow .
This would be a good way to flush some of those bad boys into the open .
- Counterfeit money would be burned .
- The Fed sends billions of new money out every day .
This would be a massive ramp up .
If you believe in this concept it is no stretch to assume that the contingency plans for how this would get done are already in a book .
It would be expensive .
But the jolt to the economy and the associated increase in tax receipts would offset it .
How much would we pay to get a “ follow the money ” lead to Bin Laden ?
How much have we already spent ?
- The most desperate characters would face the biggest risks of disclosure .
They might just let the money they are sitting on turn to dust .
That would not be a bad outcome either .
- This could backfire on the Fed .
What would be the consequence of this if we went into it assuming there was a trillion out there and after a few months we find it is actually 2 or 3 trillion ?
A very big credibility problem .
Economists would have to burn the mid-night oil trying to re-figure the connections between monetary grown and GDP .
The old ratios would be worthless .
If the number were much bigger than we are guessing at then it would be a big slap in the face of the Keynesians .
Money does not multiply as fast as we thought .
- On the flip side we could get an unanticipated result .
Only $ 500 b could show up .
The rest would be smoke and off the balance sheet .
It would be quickly replaced by the Fed .
They would love that opportunity .
- I have seen several reports of big ticket missing cash in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
How much of this has not been reported ?
Who has this money ?
What are they doing with it ?
- If one wanted to give the global economy a ~ $ 300 billion of “ instant demand stimulus ” this would be on the list .
It would be a micro burst of activity that would support another ( longer ) inventory cycle .
Yes , a lot of this money would be re-channeled into useless things like a packet of diamonds , a Corvette or a condo in Miami .
But that is what we have been doing for the past twenty years .
This just picks up the pace a few notches .
There is next to no cost to this .
We might just catch a bad guy .
- For some this would destroy the dollar bill as a store of wealth and a medium of exchange .
Roubles , Yuan , Euro’s , Yen , Aussies , Loonies and Kiwis would fill the void .
That would not be a bad result either .
Who does n’t want a weaker dollar ?
* Tough state immigration crackdown starts on Thursday
* Boom in yard sales as migrants sell off belongings
* Legal residents , US - born children join scramble to leave
PHOENIX , July 25 ( Reuters ) - Nicaraguan mother Lorena Aguilar hawks a television set and a few clothes on the baking sidewalk outside her west Phoenix apartment block .
A few paces up the street , her undocumented Mexican neighbor Wendi Villasenor touts a kitchen table , some chairs and a few dishes as her family scrambles to get out of Arizona ahead of a looming crackdown on illegal immigrants .
“ Everyone is selling up the little they have and leaving , ” said Villasenor , 31 , who is headed for Pennsylvania .
“ We have no alternative .
They have us cornered . ”
The two women are among scores of illegal immigrant families across Phoenix hauling the contents of their homes into the yard this weekend as they rush to sell up and get out before the state law takes effect on Thursday .
The law , the toughest imposed by any U.S. state to curb illegal immigration , seeks to drive more than 400,000 undocumented day laborers , landscapers , house cleaners , chambermaids and other workers out of Arizona , which borders Mexico .
It makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires state and local police , during lawful contact , to investigate the status of anyone they reasonably suspect of being an illegal immigrant .
The U.S. government estimates 100,000 unauthorized migrants left Arizona after the state passed an employer sanctions law three years ago requiring companies to verify workers ’ status using a federal computer system .
There are no figures for the number who have left since the new law passed in April .
Some are heading back to Mexico or to neighboring states .
Others are staying put and taking their chances .
In a sign of a gathering exodus , Mexican businesses from grocers and butcher shops to diners and beauty salons have shut their doors in recent weeks as their owners and clients leave .
On Saturday and Sunday , Reuters counted dozens of impromptu yard sales in Latino neighborhoods in central and west Phoenix /
“ They wanted to drive Hispanics out of Arizona and they have succeeded even before the law even comes into effect , ” said Aguilar , 28 , a mother of three young children who was also offering a few cherished pictures and a stereo at one of five sales on the same block .
She said she had taken in just $ 20 as “ everyone is selling and nobody wants to buy . ”
LEGAL RESIDENTS FLEE
Arizona straddles the principal highway for human and drug smugglers heading into the United States from Mexico .
The state ’s Republican governor , Jan Brewer , signed the law in April in a bid to curb violence and cut crime stemming from illegal immigration .
Polls show the measure is backed by a solid majority of Americans and by 65 percent of Arizona voters in this election year for some state governors , all of the U.S. House of Representatives and about a third of the 100 - seat Senate .
Opponents say the law is unconstitutional and a recipe for racial profiling .
It is being challenged in seven lawsuits , including one filed by President Barack Obama ’s administration , which wants a preliminary injunction to block the law .
A federal judge heard arguments from the lawyers for the Justice Department and Arizona on Thursday and could rule at any time .
The fight over the Arizona law has complicated the White House ’s effort to break the deadlock with Republicans in Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration law , an already difficult task before November ’s elections .
While the law targets undocumented migrants , legal residents and their U.S. - born children are getting caught up in the rush to leave Arizona .
Mexican housewife Gabriela Jaquez , 37 , said she is selling up and leaving for New Mexico with her husband , who is a legal resident , and two children born in Phoenix .
“ Under the law , if you transport an illegal immigrant , you are committing a crime , ” she said as she sold children ’s clothes at a yard sale with three other families .
“ They could arrest him for driving me to the shops . ”
Lunaly Bustillos , a legal resident from Mexico , hoped to sell some clothes , dumbbells and an ornamental statue on Sunday before her family heads for Albuquerque , New Mexico , on Monday .
“ It makes me sad and angry too because I feel I have the right to be here , ” said Bustillos , 17 , who recently graduated from high school in Phoenix .

The claim of this largely conservative body is that they are bringing “ balance ” to the public school curriculum .
If by “ balance ” they mean giving equal weight to science and superstition , to fact and to wishful thinking , then yes , they are bringing balance .
They say the current text books have a left - wing tilt , an unintended admission that facts are left - wing , or in the words of Stephen Colbert , that “ reality has a well - known liberal bias . ”
And what do you do when you find the facts unpalatable ?
You re-write them , wish them away , ignore them , or redefine them out of existence .
The Bush Administration successfully engaged these processes for eight years ; why should n’t the former president ’s home state ?
Troubling as this is , we should not get ahead of ourselves .
This is hardly the first time history has fallen prey to special interests or to extreme nationalist ideology :
Advertisements
• Hitler ’s Aryan Jesus is just an extension of the old Christian ideology that takes Jesus out of his Jewish context and makes him more palatable and relatable to Gentiles .
• Nationalist Scandinavian scholars in the 19th century invented the Viking Age .
Now we all talk about the Viking Age as if such a thing actually existed .
It could just as easily have been the Magyar Age , that nomadic people who terrorized Europe just as thoroughly as the Vikings and at the same point in history .
• And everybody in the Balkans seems to want to lay claim to the heritage of Macedon and Alexander .
This would come as a surprise to Alexander himself , for in his day , all anyone heard from the Greeks was that the Macedonians were NOT Greeks , that they were barbarians .
They even spoke a different language , as history makes very clear .
Do n’t try telling that to Greece today .
Today , the Macedonians are and always have been Greeks .
• And perhaps most memorably , Marxism has re-written the entirety of history to be a chronicle of class struggle , imposing some very modern concepts on ancient civilizations completely unaware of and untouched by the peculiar and unique circumstances of the industrialized mid-19th century .
History , you see , is a valuable commodity , and not just to those of us who have studied it , and who treasure it as a thing in itself .
As more than one historian has noted , the enemy is national mythology , but also popular history .
In both realms we see the influence of pernicious ideology , and not just the commonplace ideologies we all adhere to , but ( to use the words of archaeologist William G. Dever ) ideology as based on the illusions required to sustain themselves and to order and control society .
History is also a fragile thing ; it does not long survive contact with ideologies , be they political or religious .
And in the case of Texas , history is assailed by both .
That is not to say that history is correctly portrayed in every textbook in every other part of the country .
Far from it .
Everyone has a point of view , an agenda , an ideology ; true objectivity is impossible .
Anyone who has gone on to study history in college understands the various ways in which the historical record has been doctored , not only here in the United States but in other nations .
We all value our national myths , and we all mythologize our heroes , whether it is as innocuous as Washington chopping down a cherry tree or a coon-skin capped Davey Crocket swinging a musket for freedom at the Alamo .
It is a simple fact that people do n’t like to have their belief ’s challenged .
And the situation in Texas epitomizes this contest and puts it in context .
Modern Fundamentalist conservatism of the sort that increasingly drives the GOP has found fault with the facts as they are ; these facts impinge upon their need for a mythic America , a nation not only founded by Christians but for Christians , a nation whose principles are based on the Bible .
Obviously , historical facts militate against this vision , and the only solution then is to re-write the history books , to produce monstrosities like the “ Historically Incorrect Guide to American History , ” which make absurd but conservative - friendly claims about America ’s past , that enshrine lies in place of fact , that raise myth - making above historiography .
What results is not history , but apologia .
Facts ought to count for something .
Our interpretation of history , our conclusions , ought to derive not from wishful thinking but from documented and verifiable evidence .
An argument based upon false premises counts for nothing .
And when history loses , we all lose .
We can find comfort in an invented past but we can’t learn anything from something that has no connection to the journey we have taken as a people .
Texas may cherish its memories of the struggle at the Alamo , and of the character of the men who fought there , but however Texas wishes to remember them , we must not permit such parochialism to lift these men and events to the same level as the patriots who fought for America ’s independence , and who established our Nation .
The Battle of San Jacinto does not have , and can never have , the stature of Bunker Hill .
The surrender of Santa Ana cemented the theft by a few Anglo - Saxons of a predominantly and historically Hispanic Mexican province ; the surrender of Cornwallis cemented the independence of long - settled colonies of Europeans from an abusive mother country which shared with them both religion and ethnicity .
Texas can fool itself but America and the world must not let themselves be fooled by this nationalistic abuse of the historical record .
If Texas wants to return to the 13th century , I suppose we have to let them .
We do n’t have much choice , after all .
People have a right to be blindingly stupid .
But we must not follow them .
We must resist the temptation to make history say what we want it to say to support our current political and religious agendas .
History is what it is , a record of the past .
But it is also the interpretation of that past , and that interpretation should , to the extent it is possible , adhere to one agenda only , that of impartiality , for only then can we learn from our past what we need to know to journey into our future .
True objectivity may be impossible ; that does not mean we should not attempt to set aside our blinkers and see the facts for what they are , whether we like them or not .
Historical events , like current events , are ugly ; they have warts .
That is simply how the world is , an imperfect place guided by imperfect people .
Our mistakes have meaning ; we cannot wish them away or with 20 /20 hindsight pretend they never happened .
Scholars and educators , at least , should know better .
Texas , to its shame , by rewriting textbooks , might embrace a mythic America , but that America never existed , and it does not exist , and cannot exist as long as there are people who value our history for what it is , a record not of wishful thinking , but of the past .
In the end , what Texas has done does not balance the past ; it steals it .
In a new directive geared towards fighting obesity , San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom is banning the sale of Coke , Pepsi , and Fanta Orange in vending machines on city property .
From SFGate :
Newsom 's directive , issued in April but whose practical impacts are starting to be felt now , bars calorically sweetened beverages from vending machines on city property .
That includes non -diet sodas , sports drinks and artificially sweetened water .
Juice must be 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice with no added sweeteners .
Diet sodas can be no more than 25 percent of the items offered , the directive says .
There should be " ample choices " of water , " soy milk , rice milk and other similar dairy or non dairy milk , " says the directive , which also covers fat and sugar content in vending machine snacks .

In the start of a home business many people as well as my wife and I are strapped with cash problems .
In starting any new home business we all find that in most cases we are in debt to others first before we see any true profit .
Being in debt or owing the business before it takes off can be a disparaging aspect on all fronts some times it may seem that the whole idea of ever finding your new business ever breaking even is impossibility .
Many new businesses fail for this one reason people see the debt they owe as a noose around their necks and they do not allow the right amount of time to see that business become a something that can take the debt away .
People get in a hurry and live with fear that they are not following the right steps or that their business should be moving a lot faster than it is .
They see the start up cost as something that will never go away .
The fact is most new home businesses start out in the red they are known as investments in ones self and do eventually pay back the people who have stayed positive and stuck with it through the fears .
However those that fail are those businesses that become bogged down by fear as to time and peoples lack of jumping on the band wagon that places them in your down line .
People who start a new business want it to go very fast they want it to make them rich over night .
Some business out there do promise the sun and the moon and say that in twenty four hours you could be making thousands of dollars the thing is these business opportunities have this little thing called a failure rate .
It is so high that people who join these ventures end up questioning why they started in the first place .
If you have committed yourself to a business the first thing is to be all in to that commitment .
Do not let worry or debt as to the cost to start over power your will to succeed .
In the beginning many things that you pay for to get your new home business up and running will seem like it costs a mint however if you look at it as to how much money was wasted on things through out your life that have had nothing to do with bettering yourself or your future you will find that most of the money you have spent was wasted .
Do not look at your new business as an expense you can not afford look at it as an expense you can not afford not to do .
Ask yourself are you worth the time and effort and cost to become successful ?
If the answer is yes than give the business a little growing room and nurture it in to a flourishing successful venture that can stop the debt .
Many people say I am afraid I will owe someone or will have debt .
If you really look at those statements you will see how silly they are and what a crock of butter they are .
Those thoughts are an excuse that people make to convince themselves they are not worthy or do not want to work to be a success .
The fact is till the day we die in some form or another we owe someone for something .
Paying out money and time from our lives for others .
When starting a new business we must say I am paying myself the money and time that if I do not will be wasted on someone else who is less deserving than myself .
We all start our businesses with one goal in mind that is to see ourselves become more than what others are who have settled with life as to what is placed in front of them .
I watched a movie once called Oliver Twist in it there was one seen that always sticks in my mind all the poor orphans were given some kind of porridge .
The lot of them settled with what they got because they did not have the carriage or the desire to ask for more .
Little Oliver
Twist however did he walked up bold as you please and said more please .
We have to be the same way with our idea ’s and or lives our spirituality and above all will to succeed in the promises we make to ourselves and to those we work with .
When starting a business we can easily give up on the idea of getting more out of it and be like so many others with wishes and dreams unfulfilled or we can pull up our boot straps and demand more out of life and out of the business we started by giving it time to pay us back .
Please check out our links to the right .

The similarities between the Roman Empire and America today are fascinating to me .
There was a great article recently that discussed this connection and I ’d like to comment on some of the points made in it .
You can read the article here .
First , the article starts off with an important question :
When do you suppose the citizens of imperial Rome first realized that their way of life had tipped into inexorable decline ?
It ’s important question because I would submit that we should ask the same thing of us today here in America .
For more evidence on WHY we should be asking this question , read the following article entitledhow to tell if you ’re in a depression .
I would suggest that most Americans are in denial about the direction of America .
As I ’ve discussed many times , there is a rebalancing that is starting that will be unavoidable .
Standard of livings have to decline in America .
We ’ll do what we can to fight it , but it will be futile .
The author of the source article compares America to Rome in the following way :
A few foresaw the impact of Caesar ’s usurpation of the rule of law , marking his ascension as the beginning of the end .
Many more sounded the alarm when Rome ’s fiscal balance spiraled out of control , debts multiplying faster than the ability to extract taxes from a dwindling base of productive citizens .
The plebeian masses , accustomed to bread and circuses , were probably oblivious until Rome was finally sacked .
Everything was fine yesterday , how did these barbarians arrive at our gates ?
A strange sign of the times has begun traversing America ’s rural byways .
The sole purpose of this giant machine is to grind up paved roads leaving behind a trail of chopped asphalt and gravel .
Strapped county administrators are throwing in the towel , unable to maintain their road systems absent the flow of largess cut off from near bankrupt state and federal agencies .
Instead of reducing their carbon footprint by driving ecologically friendly electric cars these people will soon be riding horses .
The Sierra Club must be thrilled .
Large parts of Detroit are returning to the wild as abandoned sections of the city succumb to bulldozers .
Homes whose purchases were made possible by an unsustainable conflux of bloated union wages , liar ’s loan mortgages , and easy Federal money are disappearing faster than Barney Frank can say “ roll the dice . ”
The response to these signs of decline ?
Our own aspiring Caesar and his phalanx of facilitators promise more , not less .
Free healthcare for all !
Free cash for not working !
Buy a car , buy a house , get a check !
Bottomless subsidies are being shoveled at environmental impresarios promising to save us from invisible gas by covering the land with windmills and algae farms .
Court economists scream that things will keep getting worse unless we tax , borrow , and spend our way back to prosperity .
Whether you buy in to the connection here or not , you have to admit , we ’re living in very , very interesting times for Americans .
A time where economic expansion has clearly peaked a few years ago at the height of the expansion of the credit bubble .
Contraction is mandatory , whether its in the form of deleveraging , bulldozing Detroit , or closing of thousands of retail centers & malls .
Side note :
A mall near me which is n’t the nicest mall , but is by no means a dump , has turned into a disaster .
Probably 20 % of the stores are vacant , and the shopping mall now has a tattoo parlor and a “ We Buy Gold ” store — hardly world class tenants .
The mall will go under in the near future .
As we mentioned in previous post entitled the US is collapsing , but who cares because Lebron James is going to Miami , arguably the biggest problem is the ignorant masses who have their heads in the sand or are too busy worshiping celebrities .
The author agrees , saying :
What will it take to make most people realize that the grand American experiment is tottering on the brink ?
The destruction of their life savings ?
The nationalization of vast industries ?
The high seas teaming with pirates ?
A humiliating military defeat at the hands of primitives in a far off land ?
A society that consumes more than it produces , rewarding the former and punishing the latter , is not sustainable .
A society that feels entitled to the good life without understanding where it comes from is delusional , rendering itself incapable of solving problems .
Thoughts ?
It happens all too often .
TV shows seems to be very well received by critics but go on to end up getting cancelled after only a season or two .
Some of the best shows on television never really had a chance to gain an audience because they were cancelled after such a short run .
Here is a list of five shows that should have never been cancelled .
1. Arrested Development Easily the biggest mistake FOX ever made was cancelling probably the single funniest show to ever air on television .
Arrested Development was brilliant .
From the quirky characters , to the absurd script , everything about this show was genius .
The show was critically acclaimed by almost everyone .
Take a look at some of the comments below .
“ As Hollywood agents worry about the demise of the town ’s lowing cash cow , the multi-camera , staged sitcom , here to save the day is Arrested Development , a farce of such blazing wit and originality , that it must surely usher in a new era in comedy . ” – Alison Powell , The Guardian ( UK )
“ If you ’re not watching this series on Fox , the least you can do is buy it on DVD .
You ’ll love it , and it ’s such a dense show ( in the best sense of the word ) that it rewards repeated viewing .
Like Scrubs and the British version of The Office , it ’s the sort of show that truly deserves to be seen uninterrupted , several episodes at a time , for maximum enjoyment .
The laughs - per - minute quotient here is insanely high , making it great value as a home library purchase . ”
– David Bianculli , New York Daily News
Arrested Development won five Emmy awards in its first season .
In its second season it earned eleven Emmy nominations and one win .
In its third and final season it earned four nominations .
If that was n’t enough , TIME also named it as one of the top 100 TV shows of all time .
People have said that the reason behind the cancellation , aside from low ratings , was that the show was too hard to follow or find enjoyable unless you watched from the start .
There were too many jokes or gags that you would only find funny if you followed from the start .
While this is true , the same can be said for many other shows .
A feature film is being planned for Arrested Development and while I ’m sure it will turn out great , nothing can beat the original three seasons of Arrested Development .
It was undeniably hilarious , genuinely genius , wildly entertaining and still the funniest show to ever land on television .
2. Twin Peaks
Another show that made it onto TIME ’s Top 100 TV Shows of All Time only to end up being cancelled .
When Twin Peaks started , not only was it one of the top rated shows on TV but it was incredibly successful with critics and audiences .
It spawned a huge cult following and integrated itself into popular culture almost instantly .
It became something of a phenomenon .
The show was referenced in video games , songs , books , films etc .
Despite all this , the show only lasted for two seasons .
Being the brainchild of famed director David Lynch , the show was a complete mindbender .
Intriuging , odd , engaging and original , Twin Peaks was a great show .
It earned thirteen Emmy nominations in its first season and four in its second season , it was also named in the Top 25 Cult Shows and Top 50 TV Shows Of All Time by TV Guide .
The problem with Twin Peaks came when Laura Palmer ’s murder , which was the big mystery of the show , was resolved midway through season two .
After seeing resolution to the main storyline , people started to lose interest and did n’t care about the other storylines .
The show took a huge hit in ratings and ABC put the show on indefinite hiatus .
This was a year after Twin Peak ’s first season became one of the most watched shows in America .
Fans petitioned and got ABC to bring the show back from hiatus and a handful of episodes were done to complete the second season .
None of this helped though as the show got the axe at the end of the second season .
Creator David Lynch blames ABC .
The studio made Lynch reveal the mystery behind the murder way too early and Lynch wanted to wait a few more seasons .
There was a film adaptation , Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me , although it was poorly received by critics and fans .
Twin Peaks is still quite well known in pop culture and has a very loyal following .
It was and still reamains to this day , one of the best mystery shows on TV .
3. Deadwood
The HBO show Deadwood was a great show and lived far too short a life .
After only three , 12 episode seasons the show was cancelled .
Taking home 8 Emmys from 28 Emmy nominations in just three years , I still ca n’t see why this one was cancelled .
The critical acclaim and praise for the show was near universal and the show took home numerous awards from various award cermonies .
When HBO announced in May 2006 that they would not pick up the options of the actors , most saw the axe coming .
Talk of a 2 hour television film in place of a fourth season was thrown around but nothing came of it .
Although the show was n’t OFFCIALLY cancelled , the fact that HBO did n’t pick up the options of the actors means that even if new episodes of the show were to be made , most of the actors would n’t be able to return .
With creator David Milch working on John From Cincinatti for HBO , the studio was n’t sure when he could return to Deadwood .
Delaying the fourth season of Deadwood would be costly for HBO and many assume this is why they decided not to pick up the options of the actors .
Deadwood was a great show , boasting acting and writing equal to that of The Sopranos in my opinion .
It helped launch Timothy Olyphant ’s career and was easily the best Western TV show to ever air .
Fun fact , the show dropped the F - bomb almost 3,000 times in just three , 12 episode seasons .
That ’s about 1.56 F - bombs per minute of footage .
4. Freaks and Geeks
Freaks and Geeks is one of Judd Apatow ’s productions .
Apatow is responsible for some of the funniest films in recent years ( Funny People , Knocked Up , The 40 Year Old Virgin ) .
The show was incredibly funny and starred alot of actors and actresses who went on to become pretty well known .
When the show was created back in 1999 , most of the stars were n’t well known .
James Franco , Seth Rogen and Jason Segel are among many other actors who were featured in Freaks and Geeks .
Named as one of the top 100 television shows of all time by TIME and earning 3
Emmy nominations and one win , the show only survived one season .
Many people just did n’t get the humor .
EW named it the 13th best series of the past 25 years and the show did develop a large cult following but it just never caught on with the mainstream audience .
The constant changing of the timeslot did n’t help and in reality , not many people watched it .
Advertisers started to bail and show became financially unviable .
This eventually led to the cancellation .
5. Jericho
This is a show that not many people saw as it never recieved the high ratings it deserved .
The show , revolving around the fictional town of Jericho in the aftermath of 23 nuclear attacks across the US , was actually cancelled twice .
It initially got cancelled after the first season due to the fact that it just did n’t catch on with audiences .
Despite this , fans were able to convince the studio to bring it back for a second season .
After only seven episodes it received the axe again and this time for good .
A six part comic series was implemented in place of a third season and a motion picture is in the works but Jericho wo n’t be gracing our television sets ever again .
It ’s a shame because although the show started off slow , when it did pick up it got really good .
The premise was intriguing and the characters were great .
I ’m not sure why it did n’t catch on with viewers .
Many people suspect that the real reason the show was cancelled was due to the subject matter .
Perhaps a show dealing with false flag attacks hit a bit too close to home for the US government ?
We ’ll never know the truth but either way , Jericho did not deserved to be cancelled .
So there you have it , five shows that were wrongfully cancelled .
What do you think ?
Did you enjoy any of these shows ?
Did they deserve to be cancelled ?
Firefox 4 is rapidly approaching release and there are numerous interface enhancements already included in the current nightlies .
One is the addition of AppTabs ; sticky tabs that remain at the left of your tab bar that are meant to serve as a place to keep your web “ applications ” like GMail or Twitter .
There ’s still a lot that has n’t yet determined about AppTabs yet , like how navigation is handled , when a link will open in the AppTab and when in a new tab and so on , but that it will only display the favicons with no title is reasonably certain .
Since all your user will see of your website is a favicon it ’s important to keep the user up - to - date using only this limited space , for example by showing the number of unread mails as part of the favicon .
This may seem like a difficult task , but thanks to Canvas it ’s actually very simple .
Assuming you already have a function somewhere in your code that gets notified when the number of new events changes , all you have to do is add code to that function that will create a Canvas , draw the number to it , remove the old favicon , create a new one and finally set it to the url you get from Canvas ’ toDataURL .
One by one :
assuming you have a function onNewEvent ( newEvents ) {} that is called with the number of events
function onNewEvent( newEvents ) { /* Create a canvas to draw the icon */ var c=document.createElement (" canvas " ) ; c.height=c.width=16 ; var cx=c.getContext ( " 2d " ) ; /* Formatting */ cx.font = " 18px bold Calibri " ; cx.fillStyle= " #000 " ; /*
Draw nothing if number is 0 , " 9 + " for 10 or more , otherwise the number */ if( newEvents ) cx.fillText(newEvents >9 ?
" 9+" :newEvents,0,16,16 ) ; }
This will create a Canvas with the content we want ( you ’ll probably want to draw your usual favicon in the background as well and make the text a bit prettier , but this works for now ) .
Now we need to assign it
For some reason setting the href value on an existing link [ rel= ” icon ” ] element does n’t have any effect , so we have to create a new one to replace the existing one .
First , let ’s remove the old one (s ) :
var oldicons=document.querySelectorAll( ' link [ rel= " icon " ] , link [ rel= " shortcut icon " ] ' ) ; for ( var i=0;i<oldicons.length;i++ ) oldicons[i].parentNode.removeChild(oldicons [i ] ) ;
And finally we create a new one and attach it to the head .
var newicon=document.createElement (" link " ) ; newicon.setAttribute( " rel " , " icon " ) ; newicon.setAttribute ( " href " , c.toDataURL ( ) ) ; document.querySelector ( " head " ) .appendChild( newicon ) ;
The whole function now looks like this :
function onNewEvent( newEvents ) { /* Create a canvas to draw the icon */ var c=document.createElement (" canvas " ) ; c.height=c.width=16 ; var cx=c.getContext ( " 2d " ) ; /* Formatting */ cx.font = " 18px bold Calibri " ; cx.fillStyle= " #000 " ; /*
Draw nothing if number is 0 , " 9 + " for 10 or more , otherwise the number */ if( newEvents ) cx.fillText(newEvents >9 ?
" 9+ " :newEvents,0,16,16 ) ; /* Remove old icons and add node for new one ( just setting the href wo n't work ) */ var oldicons=document.querySelectorAll( ' link [ rel= " icon " ] , link [ rel= " shortcut icon " ] ' ) ; for ( var i=0;i<oldicons.length;i++ ) oldicons[i].parentNode.removeChild(oldicons[i ] ) ; var newicon=document.createElement ( " link " ) ; newicon.setAttribute( " rel " , " icon " ) ; newicon.setAttribute ( " href " , c.toDataURL ( ) ) ; document.querySelector ( " head " ) .appendChild ( newicon ) ; }

Were it not for Mohammed Abu Tir 's red beard , this would perhaps be only a marginal news item : Israel is working to expel four Palestinian residents of Jerusalem affiliated with Hamas from the city of their birth .
There are those who see this expulsion as demonstrating a proud national stance , but it is already turning out to be a political boomerang .
Abu
Tir is under arrest , because he did not leave Jerusalem on June 19 .
His colleagues - Khaled Abu Arafa , formerly the Jerusalem affairs minister in Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh 's government , and Ahmed Atun and Mohammed Totah , both members of the Palestinian Legislative Council on behalf of an Islamic list identified with Hamas - have moved into the Red Cross office in East Jerusalem .
Four years ago , then - interior minister Roni Bar - On ( Kadima ) revoked their status as Jerusalem residents on the grounds that they had violated their minimal obligation of loyalty to the state of Israel , its citizens and its residents .
After that , they were arrested , released and defined as illegals obligated to depart from " Israel 's borders . "
Since the end of 1995 , the Interior Ministry - headed first by Haim Ramon ( Labor ) and subsequently by Eliyahu Suissa ( Shas ) - has pursued a policy of mass revocation of residency ( with a brief hiatus under Natan Sharansky of Yisrael B'Aliyah , and even that only after an intense public struggle ) .
The record was set in 2008 , when 4,577 men and women were stripped of their right to reside in their own city by the Interior Ministry , then headed by Meir Sheetrit ( Kadima ) .
Nevertheless , by revoking the residency of these three parliamentarians and one former cabinet minister , Israel has set a record of a new sort : Until now , Jerusalem residency had been revoked exclusively on the basis of administrative pretexts , such as prolonged stays outside the city .
These wicked pretexts derive from the liberty Israel has taken of applying the Entry to Israel Law - used primarily to grant residency permits to non-Jewish immigrants - to residents of occupied and annexed East Jerusalem .
But the inhabitants of East Jerusalem did not decide to " come " to Israel ; it is Israel that " came " to them .
The current case , however , is the first time Israel has denied Jerusalem residency on political grounds .
The United States and Europe urged Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections in 2006 .
The participation of an Islamic list affiliated with Hamas was a well - known condition for enabling these elections to take place , including in Jerusalem .
Yet the moment that list won a sweeping victory , Israel embarked on a campaign of punishment against its members , and especially the Jerusalemites among them , for " serving " in the Palestinian Authority .
This , in and of itself , represented a new peak of political cynicism ( and another slap in the face to PA President Mahmoud Abbas ) .
It has been exceeded in its cynicism only by Israel 's demand that the occupied evince loyalty to the occupier , lest he be banished .
With this expulsion order , Israel has managed to unite the entire Palestinian arena .
The protest tent the three men set up in the courtyard of the Red Cross office has become a pilgrimage site .
And Abbas has met twice with those slated for banishment .
Time will tell whether his promise to have the decree rescinded can be kept .
In the meantime , however , the political movement that is his main rival is again becoming the symbol of the national struggle and of steadfastness in waging it .
Even those who , for political and cultural reasons , are sworn opponents of the Palestinian Islamic movement know that Israel is setting a precedent .
Today , people affiliated with Hamas are being expelled from Jerusalem .
Tomorrow , if the PA falls apart or dares to reject Israel 's dictates , it will be known Fatah activists who will be stripped of their residency due to " disloyalty to the occupation . "
Following the flotilla raid , the expulsions from Sheikh Jarrah and the royal plans for Silwan , this is yet another match that Israel is tossing into the tinderbox .
And it is one that even its friends will find it hard to ignore .
( CNN ) --
The standoff
The standoff between North and South Korea over a s
U.S .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday that North Korea must faces consequences after a report that it fired a torpedo that sank a South Korean warship in March .
" I think it 's important to send a clear message to North Korea that provocative actions have consequences , " she said amid heightened tensions and a diplomatic war of words between Seoul and Pyongyang over the incident .
" We cannot allow the attack on South Korea to go unanswered by the international community . "
Clinton was speaking in Tokyo , Japan , for the first leg of her week - long tour in Asia .
She said she was consulting with international allies to find the appropriate reaction .
North Korea threatened to back out of a nonaggression pact between the nations , while the South Korean president accused its northern neighbor of engaging in military provocation , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported on Friday .
" Firstly , from now on ( North Korea ) will regard the present situation as the phase of a war ... " , the North 's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Friday , according to Yonhap .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , meanwhile , said that North Korea 's alleged torpedo attack on a South Korean warship was tantamount to a military provocation and that it violates the armistice agreement between the nations , Yonhap reported .
South Korean military officials on Thursday announced the results of an official investigation into the sinking of the ship , the Cheonan , which concluded that North Korea fired a torpedo that cut the vessel in half .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak vowed Thursday to take " resolute countermeasures " against North Korea for its alleged attack , according to his office .
On Friday , North Korea said it would scrap its nonaggression pact with South Korea if Seoul attempts to punish it for the sinking of the warship , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported .
Should South Korea take steps to retaliate , North Korea will " strongly react to them with such merciless punishment as the total freeze of the inter-Korean relations , the complete abrogation of the north - south agreement on nonaggression and a total halt to the inter-Korean cooperation undertakings , " the committee 's statement said , Yonhap reported .
North Korea denied Thursday that it sunk the warship , which went down on March 26 , killing 46 sailors .
" We had already warned the South Korean group of traitors not to make reckless remarks concerning the sinking of warship Cheonan of the puppet navy , " North Korea 's national defense commission said in a statement Thursday responding to the investigators ' report , according to the Korean Central News Agency .
" Nevertheless , the group of traitors had far - fetchedly tried to link the case with us without offering any material evidence , " the statement said .
The South Korean military group that presented its report on the ship 's sinking Thursday comprises experts from South Korea , Australia , Sweden , the United Kingdom and the United States .
" The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine , " said Dr. Yoon Duk - yong , the group 's co-chair .
" There is no other plausible explanation , " he said .
China asked both sides to stay calm to avoid an " escalation of the situation , " said the country 's foreign affairs ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu .
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm . Mike Mullen said the status of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea has not changed because of the findings .
" They are on their normal state of readiness .
They are engaged very routinely out there , " Mullen said .
The United States is bound by treaty to assist South Korea if it goes to war .
Japan said it stands behind South Korea .
" We had received extensive explanation from the ROK [ Republic of Korea ] side prior to today 's announcement , " Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said in a statement .
" On this basis , Japan strongly supports the ROK .
North Korea 's action cannot be condoned by any means , and Japan together with the international community strongly condemns North Korea , " the prime minister said .
" In handling this matter , Japan will continue its close coordination and cooperation for regional peace and stability with the countries concerned , including the ROK and the United States . "
Military and civilian briefers said that damage to the Cheonan 's hulk and injuries on the bodies of the sailors were consistent with the kind of " shock - wave and bubble effect " produced by a homing torpedo attack .
Seismic data , witness statements and computer modeling provided further corroboration , Yoon said .
Briefers displayed torpedo parts recovered from the Cheonan wreck site : part of a motor , a shaft and parts of the propeller .
Korean writing , with the words " Number 1 " were inscribed on fragments of the weapon .
The parts displayed in a glass case were compared and shown to be identical to the blueprint of a 7.35 meter torpedo , obtained from a North Korean weapons export brochure .
General Han Won-dong , director of South Korea 's Defense Intelligence Agency , declined to state how or where South Korea had obtained the brochure , citing security sensitivities .
International members of the investigative team agreed with the conclusions .
" We worked closely and collaboratively , using separate tools and methods , " said Adm .
Thomas Eccles of the U.S. Navy , adding that all members of the international team were in agreement .
Military officials also identified what they believe to be the type of vessel responsible .
" A few small submarines and a mother ship supporting them left a North Korea naval base in the West Sea [ Yellow Sea ] two - three days prior to the attack , " Yoon said , citing information gathered by a multinational task force made up of Australia , Canada , South Korea , the UK and the U.S .
The likely culprit was a midget submarine of the Yeono ( " Salmon " ) , a vessel equipped with night vision equipment , Han said .
This is not the first clash the two Koreas have had near the maritime border .
In 1999 and 2002 , there were fatal naval clashes between surface patrol boats near the inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea .
A November shooting incident also may have killed North Korean sailors .
However , the use of a submarine is a significant escalation in terms of weapons used .
It 's also the deadliest North Korean attack since the bombing of a South Korean airliner killed 115 people in 1987 .
Gen . Park Jung-i , who co-chaired the investigative committee , said that South Korea would give the evidence to the Armistice Commission that oversees the ceasefire that ended the 1950 - 1953 on the Korean peninsula .
The commission would make the findings available to North Korea , he said .
Asked what defensive moves the South Korean navy is taking to prevent a recurrence , Han said that that the navy would establish anti-submarine detection measures , but admitted the difficulty of detecting an underwater submarine once it has left its base .
Journalist Andrew Salmon , CNN's Mike Mount and CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report .
Thought Children Of Earth was as dark as you wanted Torchwood to get , what with the death of ... well ... you know who .
According to series creator and producer Russell T. Davies , that 's just the beginning of the darkness we 're going to see as Torchwood gets ready for its fourth season .
In response to an interviewer 's question in SFX about the " darkness " of Children Of Earth , Davies responded that [ spoilers ahead ] :
Actually , this story is also very dark .
I think with that , Torchwood found its feet .
People found something very compelling and very chilling about it .
I love the way people got on their high horse saying , ' Oh , he killed his grandson ! '
Hello !
He saved every single child in the world !
If you would fail to do that then you 're the monster , frankly .
It 's this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get You find that .
If ever a word is said out of place by the Doctor or Captain Jack , or even by Sarah Jane sometimes , people throw their hands up in horror , whereas in any other drama any character is capable of any thing at any time .
That 's the only way to write , and it's the same for these people as well .
I thought it was fascinating and challenging what he did there , but hard — it was so hard .
I do think with the whole of Children Of Earth we found a new heartland for Torchwood .
I do n't know about you , but if Torchwood gets any darker , we 're going to end up as a puddle on the floor .
We 'll certainly be there when the new season premieres , but ... what do you think about what Davies had to say ?

Same - sex couples will be able to avail of legally - binding civil partnerships for the first time from next year .
The Dáil last night completed its work on the Civil Partnership Bill , which is expected to be signed into law in the autumn .
The Bill passed all stages in the Dáil shortly after 8.40 pm , without the need for a vote , and will be sent to the Seanad .
There was applause from the public gallery .
Under the terms of the Bill , marriage - like benefits will be extended to gay and lesbian couples across a range of areas such as property , social welfare , succession , maintenance , pensions and tax .
Once the Civil Partnership legislation is fully enacted and implemented , gay and lesbian couples will be able to register their relationship before a registrar , as long as the partners are over 18 and not involved in any other unions .
Couples will be required to provide registrars with three months ’ notice of a planned civil partnership , as is the case with civil or religious weddings .
Any registrars who refuse to officiate may be prosecuted .
As with divorce laws , courts will be able to dissolve relationships as long as the partners have lived apart for two of the previous three years .
The legislation also provides for the legal recognition of civil partnerships , or their equivalent , obtained in other jurisdictions .
In addition , a court - administered redress scheme is due to be established for both straight and gay unmarried cohabiting couples who have been living together for five years or more .
At present , cohabiting couples – who account for one in 12 of all family units – have few rights under our family laws .
Government officials say no formal date for the beginning of civil partnerships has been agreed , as the legislation has yet to be finalised by the Seanad .
This is expected to occur within the next fortnight and the legislation is due to be signed into law in the autumn .
In addition , two more pieces of related legislation – covering social welfare and tax changes – must be enacted before civil partnerships are made available .
These changes are expected to be signed into law either late this year or early next year .
Officials expect civil partnerships will be available shortly afterwards .
The emergency decree has been in force since April , giving security forces broad powers to deal with anti-government protests which spiralled into the worst political violence in modern
Thai history when demonstrators clashed with troops in April and May , leaving 90 people dead and at least 1,800 wounded .
BitTorrent search engine isoHunt is the first foreign website to partner with New York Attorney General Cuomo in an effort to keep the Internet clean from child pornography .
By using the Attorney General 's hash value database to filter its search results , isoHunt will prevent thousands of images from spreading on BitTorrent .
To combat the distribution of child pornography on the Internet , New York Attorney General Cuomo has started a hash value database .
Site owners can use the database to voluntarily prevent thousands of illegal files from being shared via links posted from their websites .
The database is in use by many large social networking sites such as Facebook , Friendster and MySpace and the Attorney General is continuously looking for new partners to join .
One of the latest websites to be approached by the Attorney General ’s office is the BitTorrent site isoHunt , whose owner immediately said yes to the invitation .
“ Users of isoHunt have often notified us of illegal child content in the past .
We are pleased to expand this effort in working with Attorney General Cuomo in a collaborative database in stopping such appalling files from being spread on BitTorrent , ” commented is oHunt owner Gary Fung on the collaboration .
Canada - based IsoHunt is not only the first BitTorrent site to join the program , it is also the first website outside the United States to cooperate with the initiative .
This decision was praised by Attorney General Cuomo .
“ The profound impact of this groundbreaking initiative will reverberate not only in New York , but across the country and around the world , ” said Cuomo as he welcomed is oHunt to the program .
“ This is all about protecting kids , and the same way child pornographers use technology to distribute these disturbing images , we are using technology to shut off their digital pipeline . ”
IsoHunt ’s collaboration with the Attorney General sheds an interesting light on the lawsuit against the MPAA its currently involved with .
In this case , a court ordered isoHunt to implement a keyword filter based on film titles provided by the MPAA .
IsoHunt appealed this decision , claiming that a keyword filter would result in too much collateral damage and instead suggesting that a filter based on unique and confirmed fingerprints ( hashed ) would be more effective .
Supporting the Motion For Stay , Gary Fung informed ( pdf ) the Ninth Circuit Appeal Court about his new partnership and why that is more effective .
“ … isoHunt is the only international participant in the Attorney General ’s program .
This program is efficient and workable because the Attorney General provides hashes , names and file sizes of content files ( child pornography ) in their possession . ”
“ With those three pieces of metadata , they can be used to narrow down content files , download , and then do a hash comparison for verification .
Thus , using their data on content files , we can make a BitTorrent - compatible info_hash database for automated takedown in association . ”
Instead of a keyword filter , Fung and his legal team suggest that a hash filter will prove more accurate and effective .
Thus far , the Court has not asked the MPAA to provide torrent hashes , just keywords .
“ The key to the system with the Attorney General ’s office is access and ‘ knowledge ’ of content files , which Plaintiffs are not providing , have never provided and are not required to provide under the current Permanent Injunction in this case , insofar as identifying Plaintiffs ’ content files with reasonable accuracy . ”
“ If Plaintiffs would provide the metadata for the content files for which they allegedly have copyrights , we could then perform a hash verification as we are doing with the Attorney General ’s office , ” Fung concluded .
It would be interesting to see what the Court does with this new information .
Previously , Mininova implemented a similar hash filter for copyright holders but it was ordered to implement a more general keyword filter by a Dutch court nonetheless .
Despite the legal implications , it ’s good to see that the New York Attorney General prefers to collaborate with a BitTorrent site instead of trying to take it offline because if could be used for nefarious purposes .

The Ariane 5 is regarded as reliable but is expensive to operate
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) has asked a consortium led by EADS Astrium to investigate what sort of rocket should succeed the Ariane 5 .
The new vehicle , dubbed simply the Next Generation Launcher ( NGL ) , would not come into service before 2025 - if ever it were developed .
Although highly regarded for accuracy and reliability , the Ariane 5 is expensive to operate .
Lower costs will be critical in maintaining a competitive position .
The 15 - month study will report in time for Esa 's next ministerial council in 2012 .
If member states were to approve a successor , its development would cost them many hundreds of millions of euros , quite probably billions .
" The development of a new launcher involves creating the technologies of tomorrow , whilst minimising development costs and ultimately operating costs , " said Astrium Space Transportation CEO , Alain Charmeau .
" It 's the adventure of a lifetime . "
EADS Astrium is the current prime contractor on the Ariane 5 .
Introduced in 1996 , the European workhorse has now flown more than 50 missions .
Year on year , it launches about half the world 's large telecoms satellites .
Current concepts for a successor point to a more modular design .
It might have two or three stages and be capable of launching a range of payloads , from three tonnes to eight tonnes , into a geosynchronous orbit some 36,000 km above the Earth .
But the NGL would also have to fly a range of different missions , including low - Earth polar orbits favoured by many environmental monitoring spacecraft .
Because of its design , the Ariane 5 has to launch two medium - sized satellites or one giant platform to make best use of its performance .
The NGL on the other hand would be capable of launching a single medium - sized satellite in its simplest configuration , or could sport additional strap - on boosters if required to loft a larger platform .
The Astrium study will consider various design options , covering the different types of propulsion , materials , structures , avionics , etc that might be incorporated into the NGL .
The director general of Esa , Jean - Jacques Dordain , said recently that Europe needed to " reflect on " , and " learn lessons " from , the maiden launch of the US Falcon 9 rocket developed by the SpaceX company .
The total development costs of the Falcon 9 to its first flight in June were about half a billion dollars , SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has claimed .
The California company is currently advertising launch prices that dramatically undercut those of its competitors , including Arianespace , the firm which markets the Ariane 5 .

Bin Laden among latest Wikileaks Afghan revelations Published duration 27 July 2010
image caption Nato mistook civilians for insurgents when it bombed a fuel convoy in Kunduz in September 2009
New details , including reports on Osama Bin Laden dating from 2006 , have emerged from 90,000 US military files leaked to the Wikileaks website .
Several files track Bin Laden , although the US has said it had received no reliable information on him " in years " .
The details come as the Pentagon investigates who leaked the classified documents , in an act the White House says could harm national security .
Wikileaks describes the documents as battlefield and intelligence reports .
It says they were compiled by a variety of military units between 2004 and 2009 .
In August 2006 , a US intelligence report placed Bin Laden at a meeting in Quetta , over the border in Pakistan .
It said he and others - including the Taliban leader , Mullah Omar - were organising suicide attacks in Afghanistan .
The targets were unknown , the report said , but the bombers were carrying explosives from Pakistan .
Nearly 200 files concern Task Force 373 , a US special forces unit whose job was to kill or capture Taliban or al - Qaeda commanders .
The records log 144 incidents involving Afghan civilian casualties , including 195 fatalities , the UK's Guardian newspaper reports .
' Damaging details '
The Wikileaks dossier includes an incident in June 2007 when the unit engaged in a firefight with what were believed to be insurgents .
An airstrike was called in .
Seven of those killed were Afghan police officers .
A further four were injured .
The incident was labelled a misunderstanding .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the leak did not divulge anything new about the nature of the war in Afghanistan but said the details revealed could be damaging .
A business journalists ’ group has condemned an overlooked clause in the new financial reform law that allows the SEC to deny information on companies to reporters and the public .
The Society of American Business Writers and Editors says this change may mean the financial regulators charged with preventing future economic collapses will be able to avoid public accountability .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Securities and Exchange Commission , the federal agency primarily in charge of overseeing the US ’s financial system , has said that , thanks to the Dodd - Frank financial reform law , it no longer has to provide information gathered from corporations to reporters or members of the public under freedom of information laws .
It appears the media covering the fight over the financial reform bill overlooked that clause in the law until the SEC contacted Fox Business to tell the news network it will not get a response to a request for information filed this spring .
The relevant clause in the new law states that the SEC “ shall not be compelled to disclose records or information ” if that information was obtained for the purposes of “ surveillance , risk assessments , or other regulatory and oversight activities . ”
Fox Business described that as amounting to “ almost every action by the agency . ”
That may be something of an overstatement .
Reuters reported Thursday that the restrictions apply only to information gathered about companies the SEC is investigating ; the public can still request data about the SEC ’s own operations .
Yet it ’s the SEC ’s investigations of possible wrongdoing in corporate entities that are generally of interest when it comes to the SEC ’s activities .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rob Reuteman , president of the SABEW , said in a statement Wednesday that his organization ’s membership was “ appalled ” by the change to the law , which “ appears to roll back 43 years of transparency in government under the Freedom of Information Act . ”
Thanks to freedom - of - information requests , “ we now know that the SEC itself botched investigations of Bernie Madoff , who fleeced investors of tens of billions of dollars and now sits in prison , ” Reuteman said .
“ The SEC has been forced to institute internal reforms as a result of its own investigative shortcomings that came to light . …
But under the provisions in this new law , the SEC no longer has to comply with such requests for information . ”
Reuteman said that the SEC has argued that it needs to be exempt from FOIA requests because it will be easier to obtain documents needed to prosecute financial criminals .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Do n’t fall for that line of reasoning , ” Reuteman said .
“ Government agencies have always been able to censor the documents they are forced to release , in order to withhold such sensitive information . ”
Critics of the Obama administration have wasted no time in criticizing the White House over the provision .
Aaron Gee at American
Thinker notes that President Obama sold the bill to the public by saying it “ will finally bring transparency to the kind of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis . ”

“ The stunningly bad idea of providing legal cover for a regulating body that has a history of getting it wrong is par for the course when it comes to ‘ financial reform ’ , ” Gee writes .

Considering the new site is being launched amid a crackdown on intellectual property violations in the U.S. and Canada , that particular feature is certain to draw ire from legislators .
Though nearly every one of the site ’s beta- testers ( fully 98 % of 620 participants ) found the no-DRM feature to be a “ strongly appreciated special feature to the site . ”
As major record labels begin to remove digital locks in response to consumer demand , some sites like iTunes Plus have started to offer DRM - free downloads as well .
“ I ’m not certain we had the [ no - DRM ] feature in mind within the context of where copyright legislation might be going in Canada , it was just something that consumers for years have been saying they do n’t want their digital music in locked form , ” Mr. Kadaner told the Financial Post on Monday .
“ I ca n’t imagine that the government would have any issue , because all [ copyright legislation ] is saying is if there are locks then do n’t circumvent the locks and if there are no locks then great . ”
In a sign of true Canadian style , the site will be accessible in both English and French .
It also claims to be Canada ’s only web - based music store to accept Interac ( R ) debit cards as a form of online payment , which the company is offering in order to “ simplify purchasing for HMV ’s core young shoppers , many of whom are too young to qualify for a credit card . ”
The launch of the digital music store comes just a few weeks after HMV unveiled pureHMV.ca , a customer loyalty site that lets those who register on the site collect points for each purchase .
Customers can then later redeem their points for “ money ca n’t buy rewards ” such as artist - autographed CDs and accessories .

There are some annoying issues and crashes in KDE 4 ( and particularly in KRunner and Nepomuk ) that are related to the thread - safety ( or , rather , thread - non - safety ) of libdbus - 1. kde - core - devel has seen some discussion about this recently .
There is a patch that fixes the issue , but it wo n’t make it into D - Bus before dbus - 1.4 , due to the fact that it changes the library behaviour and could potentially break bindings .
Thiago has confirmed that the change does n’t break the Qt bindings , and ( from the bug report ) , no - one has found any other bindings it breaks .
This is all just background on why , if you are running Arch Linux , you might want to check out the dbus - core - mt package on the AUR .
It ’s dbus - core - 1.2.24 , as found in core , but with the afformentioned patch applied .
Note , however , that you use it at your own risk – it should improve KDE , but it may well break other stuff .

My friend Ben sent me an article about this story .
The article is about a new rule for an Ottawa youth soccer league which stipulates that if a team leads by five goals , they automatically lose !
The league previously had a “ mercy rule ” which sought to prevent humiliation by calling the game when a team led by 5 and awarding that team with the victory .
There is at least some sense in this type of rule–there is definitely an argument against making kids feeling bad about themselves by allowing a team to lose by 10 , 20 , or 30 goals .
When I played baseball , there was a sort of mercy rule : no team could score more than 10 runs in an inning .
But even so , scoring a lot of runs didnt cause a team to lose–it didnt even cause the game to be called ( I remember beating the Spartans 28 - 3 ) .
But , this new rule is just plain wrong .
It uses perverse incentives to send children the wrong message , punishing good teams and rewarding bad teams .
Under this rule , a team that is winning 4 - 0 is in the lead , but if they score one more goal , they are losers .
But , what about that poor child who excitedly charges down the field and scores the fifth goal for the team .
By doing what he has been taught by his coach , he has just cost his team their victory .
Surely , his friends will give him hell after the game and make him feel bad for scoring .
Even worse : under this rule , a team that was down by 4 goals could easily kick the ball into their OWN goal –AND GIVE THEIR TEAM AN EASY WIN !
This isnt what youth sports are about .
Youth sports are about teaching children to work with others , as a team towards a common goal .
What kind of message does it send to children to award the team with the fewest points the victory and turn the team with the most points into losers ?
We can compare sports to economics in one important regard .
Wins and losses are little different from profits and losses .
Just as a profit is a signal to a company that it is succeeding and doing things right , a win is a signal to a team that it is succeeding and doing things right .
The opposite is true for losses .
People take actions that tend to offer them the most rewards ; a profitable company will repeat the actions that brought it these profits , and similarly , a victorious team will repeat the actions that made it victorious .
I repeat :
What kind of message does it send to children to award the team with the fewest points the victory and turn the team with the most points into losers ?

Galt commented to me about this issue : “ Today , the message from the youth sports egalitarians is that winning and losing is everything – only that any drive for winning should be replaced with a feeling of shame for making someone else lose .
These bastardizers of morals want everyone to feel the benefits of an unearned effect while completely dismissing its relationship to any real cause .
As a both a former player and coach of youth baseball , I can promise that a day later kids do n’t remember that they lost 11 - 5 .
But , the lessons you learn from preparing for competition , laying it on the line during the game , and even the lessons you learn from losing badly ….. these lessons last a lifetime . ”
This rule sends the wrong message .
It turns losers into winners and makes winners into losers .
Imagine if a similar rule was used in other sports .
A similar rule in baseball might cause a child to get booed by his own teammates after he hit a grand slam ( which cost the team the game ) .
A similar rule in basketball could cause a child who mistakenly stepped behind the 3 point to cost his team the game .
This is insanity .
I am glad to report that the entire world hasnt gone completely stupid , however .
When I spoke with former New Mexico State QB , Carl Scaffidi about this rule , he told me “ if I was a coach , I would strive to go 0 - 20 with 100 goals . ”

A new " anti-boycott bill " , the third in a series of proposed laws that aim to curtail the ability of civil society to criticise Israeli government policy , will punish Israelis or foreign nationals who initiate or promote a boycott of Israel .
The bill not only prohibits boycotts of legal Israeli institutions , but also of settlement activities and products .
It seeks to impose fines on Israelis who " promote boycotts " and transfer the fines to boycotted organisations .
It will impose a 10 - year entry ban on foreign residents engaging in boycotts , and forbid them to carry out any economic activities in Israel .
Heavy sanctions will also be imposed on " foreign political entities " engaging in boycotts .
Any government promoting a boycott will be " prohibited from carrying out any action in Israeli bank accounts , in shares traded in Israel , in land or in any other property requiring registration of transfer " , and no money or property will be transferred from Israel to that government .
Since the Palestinian Authority is defined by Israel as a " foreign political entity " , its recent decision to end its economic dependence on settlements for products , jobs and services will lead to punitive measures .
According to the bill , even money or property due to Palestinians and to the PA by virtue of previous " laws , agreements or governmental decisions " will not be transferred to them .
The geographical application of the anti-boycott bill to the West Bank ( " Judea and Samaria " ) and the potential annulment of prior agreements will signal a de jure annexation of the West Bank to Israel and a final demise of the Oslo accords signed by the PA and Israel in the mid-1990s .
This bill , like others recently tabled , comes against the backdrop of recent analysis by the current Israeli government and its advocates , who have sought to draw a distinction between " legitimate criticism of Israel " and criticism or campaigning that " delegitimises Israel " and is therefore beyond the pale .
Alan Dershowitz has called this approach " the 80 % case for Israel " – that is , the possibility of criticising specific Israeli policies , such as the settlement project , while emphatically supporting Israel as a Jewish state .
Examples of " illegitimate " activities include universal jurisdiction ( the prosecution of officials suspected of war crimes overseas ) , BDS ( boycott , divestment and sanctions ) , and questioning the definition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state .
The recent series of proposed bills in Israel echoes each of these categories by seeking to prohibit them through law and to criminalise human rights activists who engage in such activities .
This approach is deeply flawed .
There is a difference between disagreeing with criticism and seeking to silence it through law .
If Israel is a democracy , its activists must be allowed to voice criticism and engage in protest , however unpopular .
By failing to distinguish between a boycott of settlements and that of Israel itself , the initiators of the bill are demonstrating that they are not " protectors of Israel " but promoters of a " Greater Israel " .
For them , a boycott of all Israeli products , as such , is no longer distinguishable from alternative , more limited options : the decision of Israeli or international activists to boycott settlement products in order to end the occupation , or the decision of the Palestinians themselves to stop supporting the very settlements that are denying them their sustenance .
The settlers and their supporters thus expect Palestinians not only to accept the divestment of their land and resources , but also to support those who have robbed them by buying their produce and working ( for sub - minimum wages ) on the very building sites that are encroaching on their lands .
The EU , also a " foreign political entity " under the Israeli definition , is likely to disagree strongly with this bill .
The EU association agreements with Israel ( 1995 ) and with the PLO ( 1997 ) have a mutually exclusive territorial scope : the EC - Israel agreement applies to the territory of the state of Israel , whereas the EC - PLO agreement applies to the territory of the West Bank and Gaza .
When challenged on the issue of settlement products from the West Bank , the European court of justice recently ruled that only the Palestinian Authority can issue origin certificates for goods originating in the West Bank .
In court , the EU advocate - general was even clearer .
He said that as a matter of international law , the borders of Israel are defined by the 1947 partition plan for Palestine , and any territories outside the 1947 borders do not form part of the territory of Israel for purposes of the association agreement .
If the bill passes into law , the EU would qualify as a " promoter of boycott " , whereas Israel could be seen to be breaking the terms of the association agreement .
The implications of this could be explosive .

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP )  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shrank its second - quarter loss on reviving sales of computers that use its chips and a wrenching years - long effort to shed costs .
A.M.D. would have made money were it not for a loss related to its investment in factories it spun off a year ago into a separate company , according to results released Thursday .
Two days earlier , A.M.D. ’s rival , Intel , reported the highest revenue and profit margins in the company ’s 42 - year history .
A.M.D. ’s chips are inside 20 percent of the world ’s personal computers and servers .
Intel supplies nearly all the rest .
Intel cited bigger corporate spending on PCs and servers that use expensive chips  an encouraging sign for the semiconductor industry that shows technology budgets are being reinflated .
A.M.D. said it notched record shipments of laptop chips in the latest period .
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Tuesday called a six - month halt on deepwater drilling " needed , appropriate and within our authorities " in announcing he will issue a new order on a moratorium just hours after a federal judge blocked such a mandate .
" We see clear evidence every day , as oil spills from BP 's well , of the need for a pause on deepwater drilling , " Salazar said in a statement .
" That evidence mounts as BP continues to be unable to stop its blowout , notwithstanding the huge efforts and help from the federal scientific team and most major oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico . "
Salazar 's statement did not give an exact date for when the new order would be imposed , saying only " in the coming days . "
He promised that the new order will include evidence that " eliminates any doubt that a moratorium is needed , appropriate , and within our authorities . "
U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans , Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday against the ban , which halted all drilling in more than 500 feet of water and prevented new permits from being issued .
The White House said it would appeal the ruling .
President Barack Obama ordered the moratorium after the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon , an oil rig off Louisiana .
Eleven people died in the blast , which triggered an underwater oil gusher .
Brian Collins , an attorney for the Justice Department , insisted Monday that the suspension is necessary while officials conduct a safety review .
But a group of companies that provides boats and equipment to the offshore drilling industry filed a lawsuit claiming the government has no evidence that existing operations pose a threat to the Gulf of Mexico and asked the court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable .
Feldman agreed , writing in his ruling , " an invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of wells in depths of over 500
feet simply cannot justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs , the local economy , the Gulf region , and the critical present - day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the government will immediately appeal the ruling to the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals .
" The president strongly believes , as the Department of Interior and Department of Justice argued yesterday , that continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened does not make any sense , " Gibbs said .
Such drilling " puts the safety of those involved , potentially puts safety of those on the rigs and the safety of the environment and the Gulf at a danger that the president does not believe we can afford right now . "
In issuing the ruling , Feldman said , " the court is unable to divine or fathom a relationship between the findings ( of the government ) and the immense scope of the moratorium .
The plaintiffs assert that they have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of the moratorium .
The court agrees . "
Transocean President Steve Newman , whose company owned the Deepwater Horizon , said Tuesday that he supported ending the moratorium , and the office of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal filed a brief in support of blocking the moratorium .
Jindal and Sen. Mary Landrieu , D- Louisiana , were among those asking the Obama administration Tuesday not to appeal the ruling .
" I 'm going to strongly urge the administration not to appeal this ruling , but to try to find a way forward that would achieve the president 's goals for safety and responsibility , but at the same time would not jeopardize and threaten a very vibrant and necessary industry for decades , " Landrieu told reporters during a conference call .

Legendary Texas oil and gas executive T. Boone Pickens also said such a ban is not needed .
" The accident that BP has had could be likened to qualified pilots in an airliner and they have pilot error , " he told CNN's " Campbell Brown " program Tuesday night .
" ( An ) airliner crashes , starts a 50,000 - acre forest fire and we shut down all flying ?
No more airlines until we have six months to see what happened ? "
Ken Wells , the president of the Offshore Marine Service Association , said Tuesday that while the ruling is positive for his group -- which represents many of the ships that service oil rigs -- the decision is " tempered by the realization this is a big , strong government .
And if they want to keep fighting on this , they will keep fighting . "
Wells told CNN that many of the small business owners and workers who support the rigs felt " like innocent bystanders in all this , " adding that many of them are losing their jobs left and right .
He said Feldman 's decision " may help our industry survive . "
Government estimates indicate as much as 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons ) of oil may be flowing into the Gulf every day , and the gusher has already taken a serious toll on tourism and the fishing industry in Gulf Coast states .
BP said Tuesday it had collected 25,830 barrels -- 1.08 million gallons -- of oil from the gushing undersea well over the past 24 hours .
The amount is the most ever collected ; the previous record was set Thursday when 25,290 barrels were collected .
The company announced Tuesday that it will donate net revenues it receives from the sale of oil recovered from the spill to the National Fish and Wildlife Federation .
Also Tuesday , protesters in London , England , briefly disrupted an oil conference that BP CEO Tony Hayward pulled out of a day earlier .
Just before the welcoming speech by BP chief of staff Steve Westwell , who was standing in for Hayward at the World National Oil Companies Congress , a woman got on stage and started shouting .
Security quickly removed her .
The woman was Greenpeace campaigner Emma Gibson , who told the crowd that " because BP is incapable of telling you the truth , I 'm going to tell you what you need to know . "
Hayward decided not to attend the conference because of his " commitment to the Gulf of Mexico relief effort , " a BP spokesman said Monday .
Westwell started his speech by apologizing on Hayward 's behalf for him not being at the conference .
He said the past few weeks have been " extremely difficult for BP . "
" It has been hugely shocking for us , for America , and for the rest of the world , " Westwell said .
" Everyone at BP is devastated , and we deeply regret what 's happened .
Our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones .
And we are profoundly aware of our responsibilities to those people whose livelihoods and neighborhoods have suffered . "
Kenneth Feinberg , who is overseeing BP's $ 20 billion escrow claims fund , met with Alabama Gov. Bob Riley on Tuesday in what Riley described as a " very , very productive meeting " to discuss ways to accelerate the claims payment process .
" I will be back quickly to spend as much time as it takes to make sure that this program is designed and implemented in an expeditious manner , " Feinberg said .
BP said in a statement Monday that costs from the disaster now total about $ 2 billion , including the cost of the response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to Gulf states , claims paid and federal costs .
To date , more than 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments totaling more than $ 105 million have been made , the company said .
Elsewhere , a spokesman for Iran 's foreign ministry said the Islamic republic , which has chilly relations with the United States , would consider helping America with the oil spill if asked , according to the Iranian Labour News Agency .
" The difficult solution of an oil spill , from the standpoint that it's a humanitarian problem , persuades all countries to offer help , " ILNA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast as saying .
CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Eric Marrapodi , Chris Lawrence , Alan Silverleib , Matthew Chance , Vivian Kuo and Ethan Harp contributed to this report .
A Gunner in the world cup final : Robin van Persie – the inside story .
By Walter Broeckx
When Robin Van Persie got his very bad injury last season when he played with Holland against Italy it was clear that he would miss the biggest part of the season for Arsenal .
I then wrote that probably Robin would be fit for the world cup and have a big impact .
Well he is fit but his impact has n’t been that big when you only look at goals scored .
But you can see that he is growing in the last games and against Spain I think he could explode in that game .
It is very similar to his beginning of last season when at first he mostly created goals for others with his movements and then suddenly started scoring himself .
I think many people in Holland would love to see him repeating his strong start of last season for Arsenal but now for Holland .
As I have followed football in Holland a bit during the years I knew Robin Van Persie before he joined Arsenal .
So I will just try to give a short summary of Robin ’s live from the start .
Robin ’s parents were both artists and it is fair to say that you can see this in his game .
He always is trying to create things and do special things .
So both parents will have some genetic influence on him and on his play .
His parents divorced when he was still a very little boy and he was mostly raised by his father .
He also did stay with his mother – but most of the time he was with his father .
He also has two sisters .
When Robin was 5 years old , his father took him to the football club where his father was a youth coach .
And from the moment the other coaches saw him play they knew they had a special kid .
His first club was Excelsior Rotterdam , the third club in Rotterdam after Feyenoord and Sparta Rotterdam .
He played there in the youth teams and when he was 13 years old Feyenoord came to get him .
And he made his debut in the season 2001 - 2002 .
A very successful season for Feyenoord and Robin at Feyenoord won the Uefa cup and was voted as talent of the season .
But it was not all rosy and shining after that .
Robin was not the kind of player who just did what the coaches told him to do .
No , he was a very confident young man , some say over confident , and he knew what he wanted .
And he told the world what he wanted and told the coaches what he was thinking .
This honesty that brought him many troubles in those first years .
I remember him in those first years at Feyenoord and you could see the talent but you could also see the rushes of blood to his head every now and then .
Moments of brilliance mixed up with moments that you wondered what on earth is he doing out there .
He got in a lot of trouble because of Robin always telling what he had in his mind .
He played a very individual game in a team sport and was not the most popular guy with his coach in those days .
And that coach was Bert Van Marwijck , the same coach that is taking Holland , with Robin Van Persie , to the finals of the world cup .
The problems they had in those days have been put aside .
I remember Robin Van Persie once looking back at the situation and saying : “ If we would have met in a later stage of our careers it would have been different .
It was his first time at a ( Dutch ) top club and it was difficult for him and I was young and impulsive so we both had a difficult time ” .
The problems have been set aside so it seems and under Van Marwijk now Robin has been one of the most important players in the Dutch team .
When I look back at those days Robin looked like an angry young man .
Wanting to take on the whole world at once and not willing to wait .
He wanted to do it in his way , on his terms .
When I looked at him in those days I had the feeling that he was one of those players that were at an important cross roads in life : talented but like some other brilliant players something was missing and he could risk of ending with a team in the lower leagues just because of his character .
He did n’t make any progress in the next years at Feyenoord .

At first there was the rumour that he was wanted by PSV .
I thought this to be okay for him as it would be a step forward to another big club in Holland and a new environment .
And then suddenly out of the blue the rumour came out that Wenger wanted him to come to Arsenal .
Now this was something for me .
A player from the team I had a soft spot for in Holland coming to Arsenal my favourite team .
A player I liked a lot for his talent .
But then I have to admit that my first thought was totally wrong .
The way I knew Robin , from a distance off course , I thought that he would never make it at Arsenal .
In my mind I saw him arguing with Wenger , with Rice , with Vieira , with Henry , with the groundsman , with the coffee lady …
I was convinced of his talent on the field but I really thought he would only run with his head against the wall and kill his own career .
But luckily Robin proved me wrong .
I have seen the angry young man turn in to the footballer he has become in the last seasons .
His skill , his technique , his vision on the field and the eye for a team mate has grown .
Also as a human being he has changed .
The impatient and always arguing person he looked has now gone and a very relaxed and mature person has come to the surface .
In the Dutch language we have an idiom that goes ( translated ) like this “ the understanding comes with age ” and this certainly is the case for Robin .
So Robin has changed since his arrival at Arsenal and I really wonder how much this has to do with Wenger .
I really wonder what Wenger did to turn that “ kicking against everybody ’s legs angry young man from Rotterdam ” in to the player he is today .
On Sunday we will see what will happen .
If Holland wins the world cup it would be the first time in modern history that a small sized country wins the world cup .
Will Robin be the man who makes history on Sunday ?
As an Arsenal fan and a long time admirer of Robin Van Persie I really hope he puts himself and Holland in the history books .

An audience with the “ Iron Man 2 ” crowd
So , a couple of weeks back , a volcano went off in Iceland .
That meant that planes in Europe could n’t fly for several days , which meant that suddenly a London press junket was canceled and rescheduled in Los Angeles , which meant that , one recent Thursday night , I wound up seeing “ Iron Man 2 ” at the AMC Theater in Century City instead of “ A Star is Born ” at Grauman ’s Chinese for the TCM Classic Film Festival .
( The world is getting much smaller … )
Moreover , thanks to the volcano , the next morning , instead of my Crunchy Raisin Bran and 1 % milk , I was instead being buttered up by with French toast and applewood - smoked bacon buffet at the Four Seasons , a free Iron Man action figure , and a theoretical chance to ask a question of the all - star cast of “ Iron Man 2 ” — i.e. , Robert Downey , Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow , Scarlett Johansson , Don Cheadle , and soon to be super - villain of the year Mickey Rourke — not to mention director / co- star Jon Favreau , writer Justin Thoreaux , and producer Kevin Feige .
Of course , considering the 150 or so people in the room , I was n’t surprised that I did n’t get to ask any questions , but it was a pretty entertaining event .
Robert Downey may have famously given up a number of vices , but being a perpetual class clown does not seem to be one of them , and it was n’t like he was the only interesting person in the room .
The first question , about whether Favreau or he felt any pressure in terms of living up to the success of the first “ Iron Man , ” set the tone .
Favreau admitted he had never been involved with a sequel before , unless you count his “ under five ” bit part as “ Assistant ” in Joel Schumacher ’s notorious “ Batman Forever . ”
It certainly is a change from small independent films like Favreau ’s career - making acting and writing debut , “ Swingers , ” which he compared to throwing a party and hoping people would come .
“ … [ On ‘ Iron Man 2 ’ ] we knew that people were going to show up , ” Favreau said .
“ We just wanted to make sure that everyone who showed up had a good time and that this was going to be as fun or more fun than the last party .
So it ’s a different kind of pressure . ”
Downey then felt the need to start listing sequels others on the panel had been involved in , real and fictional .
“ Scarlet Johansson was in ‘ Home Alone 3 . ’ Don Cheadle , 11 , 12 and 13 . ”
That led to a question that was geeky in a way that anyone whose ever been a superhero comics fan will recognize , and which wound up being answered by producer Kevin Feige .
It was about the “ time - line ” of the film .
It turns out that , if viewers pay close attention , they can figure out that “ Iron Man 2 ” actually takes place before 2008 ’s “ The Incredible Hulk . ”
( Having seen both movies , I have no freakin’ clue how you ’d deduce that . )
The next question was about something pretty much all of us online geeks have already noticed about the movie .
It ’s the absence in the release version of “ Iron Man 2 ” of a brief moment in the trailer involving Pepper Potts / Gwyneth Paltrow assisting Iron Man / Tony Stark ( Downey ) as he gets ready to fly down into an adoring stadium crowd as part of the massively glitzy intro for his Stark Expo .
“ We had two different versions of it , ‘ said Jon Favreau .
“ But , because of the pacing and the way we [ wanted ] to reveal Tony Stark , it felt really good to flow into the drop down and reveal him for the first time on the stage .
For those of you who have n’t seen the movie , this does n’t make any sense , but oftentimes in the editing room we figure out what combinations of … ”
“ Gwen is just finding out this scene was cut , Jon .
You might be a little more tactful , ” interrupted Downey , generating a laugh .
Speaking of Gwyneth Paltrow , the next question was for the two women on the panel , Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson .
How would the movie ’s two decidedly powerful women handle having to “ save the world ” in contrast to the male characters ?
Who would be better at it ?
“ If Scarlet and I were doing it , the body count would be different , ” said Paltrow .
“ Less bloody . ”
“ More organized , ” added Johansson .
Then a journo dared to go a bit off - topic and asked Downey about whether he would be taking a rumored gig as the title role in the long , long delayed film of Anne Rice ’s The Vampire Lestat .
“ Yeah .
In anything that ’s going on , just imagine it ’s been offered to me , ” said Downey .
“ Precious 2 , ” offered Don Cheadle , the new James “ Rhodey ” Rhodes and eventual War Machine of this sequel .
Another writer asked Mickey Rourke how much fun he had in his “ electrifying performance ” as the vengeance driven , Russian - accented super - villain , Whiplash , aka Ivan Vanko .
“ I had a lot of fun , ” Rourke answered , keeping it simple .
Asked to elaborate , he continued .
“ It was great .
I worked with some great people .
This one here [ Jon Favreau ] is really easy to work with .
He makes it fun .
It was nice .
I just came off working on a film where there was no budget ; I did n’t have a chair .
The first day , I asked for cappuccino and they said ‘ what kind would you like . ' ”
Then a reporter asked Downey if , growing up , he ever dressed up as a superhero for Halloween .
“ Growing up , no , but in my mid-thirties in Palm Springs right before an arrest , yes . ”
Then there was a question asking if the rather large amount of improvisation employed on the original “ Iron Man ” continued on “ Iron Man 2 . ”
How much of what was seen in the film was part of the original screenplay ?
Justin Thoreaux answered .
“ It ’s a heavily improvisational set .
Everyone gets to sort of chime in .
My job as the writer is really just to stay on the dance shoes of Robert and Jon and Gwyneth and everybody and just sort of try and rewrite things on the fly . ”
“ The story is very well fleshed out , ” added Jon Favreau .
” What has to happen in each scene , we understand .
We leave a lot of room within those scenes .
We try and do multiple cameras , sometimes , or stay up and rewrite .
Justin was doing multiple passes , sometimes double - digit passes , on scenes because we learn things from each scene that we shoot .
We try and shoot pretty much in order . ”
” What ’s nice about having the actors you see up here is they ’re all very sure of their characters emotionally , ” Favreau continued .
“ They ’re used to being in films where you do n’t have the safety net of all the high - technology and the explosions .
So , if they have an issue with something we ’re asking the character to do for the story , we discuss it and we figure out a way it can work for them as a performer . ”
The next question that came up was for Don Cheadle , who is stepping in for Terrence Howard as James “ Rhodey ” Rhodes , who becomes War Machine , a sort of co -Iron Man .
What was it like replacing the respected actor , who left the franchise for reasons that remain vague and somewhat contentious .
What was it like wearing the suit ?
“ I do n’t know why the War Machine suit is actually made of metal and his [ Downey ’s ] is made of light , fiberglass material .
It ’s an initiation .
But I felt very fortunate to have the opportunity to work in a film like this . ”
“ Terrence is a friend ; I ’ve known him for a long time , ” Cheadle continued , referring to their work together in the Oscar - winning “ Crash , ” which Cheadle produced .
“ It was good to also kind of see him and put anything to bed that people might think there was a problem .
There was n’t .
We ’re cool , ” he said , moving on to mention the childlike fun of playing with “ the best toys ” and pretending to be a superhero .
“ The reason Don ’s suit was heavier is that it ’s almost impossible to get that mirror - like look of polished metal look with CGI , ” said Downey .
“ I would not wish that on an enemy . ”
Then there was some discussion of the casting of Mickey Rourke as Whiplash , a more flamboyant character in the original comics which , according to Favreau , the “ Iron Man 2 ” team decided to turn into something a bit grittier for the Russian baddie , somewhat inspired by the tattooed gangster character portrayed by Viggo Mortenson in “ Eastern Promises . ”
Moreover , with Rourke ’s success in ” The Wrestler ” and , before that , as Marv in “ Sin City , ” there was a growing acknowledgment that , for the second time in his life , Rourke was a major star .
“ Between the fanboys and the independent film community , he was back with a vengeance , and it was , like , ‘ My God , there ’s a lot of people , we ’re not going to have a tremendous amount of screen time , who ’s going to be able to be there and be able to make an impression where you feel like this guy is in trouble ? ’
So Mickey brought a lot of intensity to both of those roles . ”
Also , apparently Downey was involved in recruiting Rourke while they were both touring the award - show circuit — Rourke for “ The Wrestler ” and Downey for his ethnicity - bending turn in “ Tropic Thunder . ”
“ I really worked you like a rib , did n’t I ? ” Downey admitted to Rourke .
“ It was embarrassing .
I was literally begging you in public . ”
Another question about how Downey felt working with new cast members segued into a discussion of writer Justin Thoreaux ’s contribution and how he worked through a “ horrible ” neck problem .
“ These guys had a really good rapport from ‘ Tropic Thunder ’ and he understood his voice and how to weave in and out of Robert ’s creative process very effectively .
And to jump on board a franchise , it was probably the sharpest learning curve for Justin than all of us and he really did a fantastic job , ” said Jon Favreau .
Then came a question about the film ’s numerous characters and plot threads , including Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury starting to pull together a superhero “ boy band ” called the Avengers , not to mention the introduction of Scarlett Johansson ’s Black Widow , aka Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff , as well as multiple villains — or as Favreau terms it , “ villianitis . ”
“ We really tried to keep the narrative flows going so as to not make it too convoluted , ” Favreau said .
“ I lose track of that stuff .
Especially in sequels as the franchises get more complex , I ca n’t always remember what happened in the last movie .
Not for nothing , I like to watch the stuff blow up , but I ’m not going to do homework before I go see a sequel… . ”
That segued into praise for Sam Rockwell , who steals several scenes as Tony Stark ’s unctuous business adversary , Justin Hammer , and a discussion about the parrots used in the film as pets for Mickey Rourke ’s character .
A suggestion made by Rourke to help humanize his bad - guy to some degree .
One of the birds apparently belongs to the pet - loving actor .
“ Marvel likes to cut costs , ” Favreau said .
“ You guys cut costs so much , you guys ate the second bird , ” added Don Cheadle .
After some frivolity involving Gwyneth Paltrow ’s definition of heroism somehow being related to the Goop newsletter , the conversation turned to the “ Moonlighting ” - esque romance between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts and the “ highly anticipated ” kiss that finally occurs between Downey and Paltrow ’s character in the new film .
How did the actors feel about it ?
“ I could n’t get her off me .
It was embarrassing , ” Downey offered .
“ It was great because both my husband and his wife were right there , ” Paltrow offered , more believably .
Downey could not let the matter slide .
“ Yeah .
She said to me that I did n’t know what I was doing , like it did n’t feel good and I was like , ‘ You know what , first of all , we ’re all friends so what would be creepy was if I was coming off all sexy to you . ’
And , by the way , I ’ve done that in movies and it creeps them out .
So what am I going to creep you out for ?
… Despite what she said on set , she still thinks about it . ”
The next writer lucky enough to be acknowleded got two questions off .
He asked Downey about working with his wife , Susan Downey , as one of the films executive producers .
Jon Favreau was , in turn , asked about the fact that his portrayal of Happy Hogan was far more prominent in the sequel and even involved some rather humorous and deftly handled action moments .
Downey , apparently afraid of too much tidiness , suggested he and Favreau swap questions .
Favreau praised Susan Downey ’s organizational skills and experience .
“ It ’s just like one of those shows where they ’re going to organize all of their closets for you and make you throw out the clothes that you do n’t need anymore .
But it takes somebody to go , ‘ You ’re never going to wear that again !
You ’re never going to fit in that … ' ”
“ On a certain level they might ’ve thought she was going to come in and tame me or put me in check — but I was completely out of my mind , power hungry , ” Downey interupted .
Then , turning his sites on Favreau , the teasing began .
” He was boxing everyday in pre-production .
and made it into the ring for the scene where he gets his ass handed to him by Scarlett .
That was originally a longer scene and maybe he was just too emasculated to actually let it be in the movie but , I think , [ Scarlett ] laid the boots to him quite severely . ”
And so it went , as Downey could not be stopped .
“ Then about midway he ’s struggling with the Medifast , but occasionally binging on pizza and then saying , ‘ This is crazy .
I have to get back in the gym . ' ”
“ Can I have my question back ? ” asked Favreau .
And so it went , until a high - flying journalist seemed to think he ’d get the scoop of the century .
He started out by praising the film , the better to soften the blow he apparently hoped to land .
There had already been some brief joking around about Sam Rockwell ’s character not being on the movie ’s poster .
The “ Iron Man ” team had therefore “ sidestepped ” the question of Rockwell earlier , which Favreau joked made him feel like Alan Greenspan .
Going for the kill , the reporter asked : was Rockwell ’s lack of a major presence on promotional materials and being “ noticeably absent ” this morning evidence of some kind of falling out on set ?
( Note the noticeably present picture of Rockwell above from Marvel ’s publicity materials . )
Downey sarcastically obliged the aggressive journo .
“ Yes .
You hit the mother load . ”
Favreau responded predictably that , in fact , there had not been a falling out and Rockwell was busy on the opposite coast doing a play .
He further praised his acting and called Rockwell , a “ fun , funny guy ” and “ inspiring and inspired . ”
He particularly cited Rockwell ’s work as a “ gender unspecific concierge ” in Favreau ’s 2001 feature directing debut , “ Made . ” Prompted by the passive - aggressive questioner , he also admitted that Rockwell had actually been considered for the role of Tony Stark , even before Downey .
“ That ’s enough .
You ’re embarrassing yourself , ” Downey said , presumably joking with Favreau .
But Favreau would not stop praising Rockwell ’s ability or gameness “ Justin Hammer wishes that he was Tony Stark and he really embraced that aspect of the character .
I think it ’s really fun for that and he has a ball with it . ”
The would be Helen Thomas of entertainment journalism tried for one last , more positive , scoop .
He commented that Scarlet Johansson was “ fantastic ” as the Black Widow .
Was there likely to be a Black Widow spin - off movie ?
Again , what was Favreau supposed to say ?
“ I would love to see that .
Hell , yes , ” said Favreau .
When prompted by Scarlett Johansson , who obviously has an interest in the matter , producer Kevin Feige said , “ Definitely possible . ”
At last , the movie scoop of the century .
That was followed by a much less aggressive question about DVD extras .
The short version is that there ’ll be many and they ’ll be largely for the very geeky .
“ We did overkill on this one , ” Favreau admitted .
Then came a question for Johansson and Paltrow on the fact that the Black Widow and Pepper Potts are not quite your usual stock comic book movie females .
“ I think it ’s a very smart decision actually to have women who are capable and intelligent because it appeals to women , ” said Paltrow .
“ So it ’s not only a film for fifteen year old boys .
It ’s a film that can relate to a lot of people on a lot of levels and a lot of my girlfriends like it because of the romance .
Scarlett in the trailer — it ’s appealing , like , ‘ Who is she ? ’
It does n’t look gratuitous . ”
“ It ’s oddly kind of old fashioned actually in the best sense of the word , ” said Johansson , who got her start in some very high quality indie hits .
“ These characters are like those fabulous femme fatales of the golden age of Hollywood , Bette Davis more than Jane Mansfield , which I think is so much more dynamic to watch . ”
Then came a relatively serious question about the physical and mental challenges of the role for Downey and Paltrow .
After both of them briefly hesitated about who would answer first , Downey stepped in after Paltrow said he should go first .
“ Yeah , they probably want to hear me first , ” he agreed .
Continuing .
“ Physically , I feel like Don and Scarlett and Mickey actually had a heavier load this time as far as just armature … ”
“ He made them do it all in CGI , like , ‘ Get it in CGI .
I ’m walking off , ' ” said Paltrow .
That was followed by a rather serious discussion from Downey in which he contemplated the emotional journey of Tony Stark ’s character vis-à- vis Whiplash , Rhodey / War Machine , Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow , and Pepper .
Just as he reached a sort of intellectual crescendo , the giant poster for “ Iron Man 2 ” behind him fell down , leaving an empty frame behind the speakers ’ table .
“ Ladies and gentlemen , Sam Rockwell ! ” said Downey , leaving his chair for a vain attempt to rehang the poster .
After that , things just got kind of silly .

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak discussed efforts to lift the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday , at a meeting with his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas .

Egypt reopened its border with the Gaza Strip following the deadly raid on a flotilla of Gaza - bound aid boats by Israeli forces in May .
Mubarak 's government on Tuesday rejected an Israeli proposal that would leave Gaza entirely dependent on Egypt for goods and access .
The rejection came in response to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's decision on Sunday to let Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz to come up with a proposal for complete Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip .
" This kind of talk confirms what we have been saying for years , which is that there is official Israeli thought which aims to evade responsibility for the Gaza Strip and dump it on Egypt , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Cairo said .
Under the proposal , Israel would close all of its land crossings into Gaza , leaving the blockaded enclave completely dependent on Egypt for the movement of people and goods .
" Egypt confirms that Gaza is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territories , and of the future Palestinian state .
There is no room to talk or think of it as anything else , " the spokesperson added .
However , Cairo had faced criticism prior to that for the secretive construction of a steel barrier underground beneath the border , aimed at curtailing smuggling tunnels .
Mubarak also discussed Abbas ' recent tour that took him to Turkey , the United States , Spain and France .
Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Abul - Gheit , Yasser Abd-Rabo , of the Palestinian Liberation Organization , and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat also attended the meeting held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh .
Abbas met with Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa late on Monday , following Moussa 's first visit to the Gaza Strip since he took the post , where he met with Hamas officials .
Moussa entered the enclave via the Rafah crossing point , which Egypt reopened on June 1 , after Israel 's seizure of the six - vessel aid flotilla .
Around 10,000 Palestinians have crossed the border and tons of medical and humanitarian aid have also been driven into the enclave .
Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade on the Gaza Strip since Hamas took control of the area in 2007 .
Occasionally , Egypt has opened the Rafah border for three or four - day periods .
But this is the first time that the border has been opened for an indefinite period of time .
( h/t GottaLaff at Political Carnival )
By now , unless you 've been living under a rock , or below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , you know that Glenn Beck is about the lowest common denominator when it comes to corporate teevee and radio .
Despite his ratings dive and a lack of sponsors , he still considers himself to be a winner .
Well , he 's really stepping in it this time .
He 's asking his fans to make donations to a military charity to fund a rally in Washington D.C. - the only problem is that the rally is nothing more than a release party for his new book and well ... I 'll let GottaLaff tell the rest of the story , keying off this audio report from Bill Press :
Yes , you heard right .
Beck does n’t even have a permit for The Big Rally yet .
They ’ve applied , but they ’re still in negotiations .
Yet , they ’re selling merchandise as if it ’s a done deal .
He ’s selling stuff for an event that may never take place .
It ’s also not being held at the Lincoln Memorial , but at the reflecting pool , across the street .
Glenn
Beck is lying about the location of the rally .
And finally , he ’s exploiting a charity by soliciting contributions to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation .
But see , the fine print says all contributions will first be applied to the rally , the one with Sarah Palin .
All contributions in excess of the costs will go to the troops .
Let ’s recap :
– He ’s desecrating the memory of Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln ;
– He ’s lying to the ( gullible ) American people who still choose to give him an ounce of credibility , and
– He ’s using a charity set up to raise money for members of the military , and then stealing the money he raises to pay for his little get together .
Read on ...
I am flabbergasted that Glenn Beck would try to freeload like that !
/ snark WTF is wrong with pukes like Beck and Hannity , who claim to be sooo patriotic , yet use military charities to enrich themselves ?
Oh wait ... they 're Republicans ....
Boston Globe : Pentagon workers tied to child porn
Updated 11:30 a.m .
The Boston Globe 's Bryan Bender reported Friday that federal investigators " have identified several dozen Pentagon officials and contractors with high - level security clearances who allegedly purchased and downloaded child pornography , including an undisclosed number who used their government computers to obtain the illegal material . "
Employees under investigation have included individuals from " the National Security Agency , the National Reconnaissance Office , and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- which deal with some of the most sensitive work in intelligence and defense -- among other organizations within the Defense Department , " the Globe reported , citing investigative reports .
Many of the cases date back several years .
Some of them remain open .
" The fact that offenders include people with access to government secrets puts national security agencies 'at risk of blackmail , bribery , and threats , especially since these individuals typically have access to military installations , ' according to one report by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service from late 2009 , " the Globe wrote .
The Department of Defense inspector general 's office publicly released the DCIS report and posted it online late Friday morning .
It takes a lot to get me to link to noted shitrag The Daily Mirror .
One of my favorite musical artists and Highly Eccentric Persons declaring the entirety of networked communication " over " ?
Fine .
I 'll take the bait .
Snip :
" You must come and listen to the album , " he says .
" I hope you like it .
It 's great that it will be free to readers of your newspaper .
I really believe in finding new ways to distribute my music . "
He explains that he decided the album will be released in CD format only in the Mirror .
There 'll be no downloads anywhere in the world because of his ongoing battles against internet abuses .
Unlike most other rock stars , he has banned YouTube and iTunes from using any of his music and has even closed down his own official website .
He says : " The internet 's completely over .
I do n't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else .
They wo n't pay me an advance for it and then they get angry when they can't get it .
The internet 's like MTV .
At one time MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated .
Anyway , all these computers and digital gadgets are no good .
They just fill your head with numbers and that can't be good for you . "
By now , you probably think your opinion of Goldman Sachs and its swarm of Wall Street allies has rock - bottomed at raw loathing .
You 're wrong .
There 's more .
It turns out that the most destructive of all their recent acts has barely been discussed at all .
Here 's the rest .
This is the story of how some of the richest people in the world – Goldman , Deutsche Bank , the traders at Merrill Lynch , and more – have caused the starvation of some of the poorest people in the world .
It starts with an apparent mystery .
At the end of 2006 , food prices across the world started to rise , suddenly and stratospherically .
Within a year , the price of wheat had shot up by 80 per cent , maize by 90 per cent , rice by 320 per cent .
In a global jolt of hunger , 200 million people – mostly children – could n't afford to get food any more , and sank into malnutrition or starvation .
There were riots in more than 30 countries , and at least one government was violently overthrown .
Then , in spring 2008 , prices just as mysteriously fell back to their previous level .
Jean Ziegler , the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food , calls it " a silent mass murder " , entirely due to " man-made actions . "
Earlier this year I was in Ethiopia , one of the worst - hit countries , and people there remember the food crisis as if they had been struck by a tsunami .
" My children stopped growing , " a woman my age called Abiba Getaneh , told me .
" I felt like battery acid had been poured into my stomach as I starved .
I took my two daughters out of school and got into debt .
If it had gone on much longer , I think my baby would have died . "
Most of the explanations we were given at the time have turned out to be false .
It did n't happen because supply fell : the International Grain Council says global production of wheat actually increased during that period , for example .
It is n't because demand grew either : as Professor Jayati Ghosh of the Centre for Economic Studies in New Delhi has shown , demand actually fell by 3 per cent .
Other factors – like the rise of biofuels , and the spike in the oil price – made a contribution , but they are n't enough on their own to explain such a violent shift .
To understand the biggest cause , you have to plough through some concepts that will make your head ache – but not half as much as they made the poor world 's stomachs ache .
For over a century , farmers in wealthy countries have been able to engage in a process where they protect themselves against risk .
Farmer Giles can agree in January to sell his crop to a trader in August at a fixed price .
If he has a great summer , he 'll lose some cash , but if there 's a lousy summer or the global price collapses , he 'll do well from the deal .
When this process was tightly regulated and only companies with a direct interest in the field could get involved , it worked .
Then , through the 1990s , Goldman Sachs and others lobbied hard and the regulations were abolished .
Suddenly , these contracts were turned into " derivatives " that could be bought and sold among traders who had nothing to do with agriculture .
A market in " food speculation " was born .
So Farmer Giles still agrees to sell his crop in advance to a trader for £ 10,000 .
But now , that contract can be sold on to speculators , who treat the contract itself as an object of potential wealth .
Goldman Sachs can buy it and sell it on for £ 20,000 to Deutsche Bank , who sell it on for £ 30,000 to Merrill Lynch – and on and on until it seems to bear almost no relationship to Farmer Giles 's crop at all .
If this seems mystifying , it is .
John Lanchester , in his superb guide to the world of finance , Whoops !
Why Everybody Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay , explains : " Finance , like other forms of human behaviour , underwent a change in the 20th century , a shift equivalent to the emergence of modernism in the arts – a break with common sense , a turn towards self - referentiality and abstraction and notions that could n't be explained in workaday English . "
Poetry found its break with realism when T S Eliot wrote " The Wasteland " .
Finance found its Wasteland moment in the 1970s , when it began to be dominated by complex financial instruments that even the people selling them did n't fully understand .
So what has this got to do with the bread on Abiba 's plate ?
Until deregulation , the price for food was set by the forces of supply and demand for food itself .
( This was already deeply imperfect : it left a billion people hungry . )
But after deregulation , it was no longer just a market in food .
It became , at the same time , a market in food contracts based on theoretical future crops – and the speculators drove the price through the roof .
Here 's how it happened .
In 2006 , financial speculators like Goldmans pulled out of the collapsing US real estate market .
They reckoned food prices would stay steady or rise while the rest of the economy tanked , so they switched their funds there .
Suddenly , the world 's frightened investors stampeded on to this ground .
So while the supply and demand of food stayed pretty much the same , the supply and demand for derivatives based on food massively rose – which meant the all - rolled - into - one price shot up , and the starvation began .
The bubble only burst in March 2008 when the situation got so bad in the US that the speculators had to slash their spending to cover their losses back home .
When I asked Merrill Lynch 's spokesman to comment on the charge of causing mass hunger , he said : " Huh .
I did n't know about that . "
He later emailed to say : " I am going to decline comment . "
Deutsche Bank also refused to comment .
Goldman
Sachs were more detailed , saying they sold their index in early 2007 and pointing out that " serious analyses ... have concluded index funds did not cause a bubble in commodity futures prices " , offering as evidence a statement by the OECD .
How do we know this is wrong ?
As Professor Ghosh points out , some vital crops are not traded on the futures markets , including millet , cassava , and potatoes .
Their price rose a little during this period – but only a fraction as much as the ones affected by speculation .
Her research shows that speculation was " the main cause " of the rise .
So it has come to this .
The world 's wealthiest speculators set up a casino where the chips were the stomachs of hundreds of millions of innocent people .
They gambled on increasing starvation , and won .
Their Wasteland moment created a real wasteland .
What does it say about our political and economic system that we can so casually inflict so much pain ?
If we do n't re-regulate , it is only a matter of time before this all happens again .
How many people would it kill next time ?
The moves to restore the pre-1990s rules on commodities trading have been stunningly sluggish .
In the US , the House has passed some regulation , but there are fears that the Senate – drenched in speculator - donations – may dilute it into meaninglessness .
The EU is lagging far behind even this , while in Britain , where most of this " trade " takes place , advocacy groups are worried that David Cameron 's government will block reform entirely to please his own friends and donors in the City .
Only one force can stop another speculation - starvation - bubble .
The decent people in developed countries need to shout louder than the lobbyists from Goldman Sachs .

Osama Bin Laden is the world 's most wanted terrorist
British Airways has apologised after a photograph in a staff magazine showed a frequent flyer boarding pass in the name of Osama Bin Laden .
The image appeared on the front page of LHR News and was meant to promote the benefits of online check - in .
It showed a passenger holding up an iPhone displaying a boarding pass in the name Bin Laden / Osama , seat 07-C .
A BA spokesman apologised and said : " A mistake was made and we are working to find out how this occurred . "
LHR News is a magazine for BA employees at London 's Heathrow airport .
The latest front page shows a happy passenger arriving at check - in while another holds up his iPhone showing a virtual boarding pass bearing Osama Bin Laden 's name .
It classes the world 's most wanted terrorist and leader of al - Qaeda as a " frequent flyer " , and his seat number places him at the front of the plane .
The pass has him flying on 26 October 2010 to an unspecified destination .
BA apologised for the error on its Twitter feed after being alerted to the image by other users of the social networking site .
The airline is currently embroiled in a long - running dispute with cabin crew over pay , conditions and staff travel perks .
The latest in a series of five - day walkouts is due to end on Thursday , with another set to begin on Saturday unless a deal can be reached between BA and unions .

One by one , soldiers just arriving in Baghdad were taken into a room and questioned by their commanding officers .
" All questions led up to the big question , " explains former Army Spc. Josh Stieber .
" If someone were to pull out a weapon in a marketplace full of unarmed civilians , would you open fire on that person , even if you knew you would hurt a lot of innocent people in the process ? "
Ad Policy
It was a trick question .
" Not only did you have to say yes , but you had to say yes without hesitating , " explains Stieber .
" In refusing to go along with the crowd , it was not irregular for somebody to get beat up , " he adds .
" They ’ll take you in a room , close the door and knock you around if they did n’t like your answer , " says former Army Spc. Ray Corcoles , who deployed with Stieber .
According to these former soldiers , this was a typical moment of training for Bravo Company 2 - 16 ( 2nd Battalion , 16th Infantry Regiment ) , the ground unit involved in the infamous " Collateral Murder " video , which captured global headlines when it was released in April by WikiLeaks , the online clearinghouse for anonymous leaks .
( In late July WikiLeaks dropped another bombshell with its release of more than 90,000 secret US military documents from the war in Afghanistan , including detailed reports on Pakistani collusion with the insurgents — who have successfully used heat - seeking missiles against allied forces — US assassination teams , widespread civilian casualties from US attacks and staggering Afghan government incompetence and corruption . )
The graphic video from Baghdad shows a July 2007 attack in which US forces , firing from helicopter gunships , wounded two children and killed more than a dozen Iraqis , including two Reuters employees and the father of those children .
The video quickly became an international symbol of the brutality and callousness of the US military in Iraq .
What the world did not see is the months of training that led up to the incident , in which soldiers were taught to respond to threats with a barrage of fire — a " wall of steel , " in Army parlance — even if it put civilians at risk .
Now three former soldiers from this unit have come forward to make the case that the incident is not a matter of a few bad - apple soldiers but rather just one example of US military protocol in the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , where excessive acts of violence often stem from the chain of command .
This comes at a time when the top brass in Afghanistan are speaking openly of relaxing the rules of engagement .
After Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s recent ouster for publicly criticizing the Obama administration , his successor , Gen. David Petraeus , has asserted that military protocol in Afghanistan should be adjusted because of " concerns " about " the application of our rules of engagement , " a move that critics fear will cause civilian deaths to skyrocket .
The story that Stieber , Corcoles and former Army Spc. Ethan McCord tell provides crucial background for the incident that WikiLeaks made famous .
Bravo Company 2 -16 deployed to Iraq in February 2007 during the " surge " ordered by George W. Bush .
Their spring arrival in New Baghdad , a dangerous neighborhood in eastern Baghdad bordering Sadr City , coincided with the start of the deadliest three - month period for US forces during the Iraq War .
" I had the idea that I was going over there to help the Iraqi people — you know , freedom and democracy , " says McCord , an expectation that Stieber and Corcoles say they shared .
They learned quickly that the reality was very different .
All three of these former soldiers describe a general policy of , in McCord ’s words , trying to " out - terrorize the terrorists " in order to establish power in a neighborhood that clearly did not want US troops there .
The next months would be spent raiding houses , responding to sniper fire and IEDs , and , as Corcoles says , " driving around just waiting to get shot at . "
All of them would witness the abuse , displacement and killing of Iraqi civilians .
When Bravo Company 2 - 16 arrived in New Baghdad to establish its Combat Outpost ( COP ) in an old factory , hundreds of angry residents gathered in protest .
In grainy video footage brought back by McCord , residents can be seen converging around the soldiers and chanting , and McCord is seen standing in front of the crowd with his weapon drawn .
Corcoles , behind the camera , was guarding the gate of the new post .
" The first sergeant told me to shoot anyone who tried to rush the soldiers outside the gate , " he says .
Some Iraqis were then dragged inside , beaten and questioned .
When the crowds dispersed , construction crews came in to begin building a wall around the new post .
To clear the area , the military forced people to leave .
" We were kicking people out of their homes , " says McCord .
" People who did n’t want to move , we would basically force them to move … pretty much making them leave at gunpoint . "
From then on the violence escalated .
Corcoles describes the first IED death his unit suffered .
" We did a mission that night till like midnight , and we were actually just sitting down … .
I had n’t even got three or four drags off my cigarette and an IED went off … .
We watched the Humvee burn , but we did n’t realize [ someone ] was still in it . "
The IED attacks left the soldiers angry and scared .
McCord recalls one mission to impose curfews .
Earlier that day , a popular soldier had died in an IED attack , and the troops took it out on the Iraqis .
" There were a lot of people who got beat up that night , " he says bluntly .
This anger was turned into policy by the chain of command .
" We had just lost three guys to an IED when the battalion commander came out to the COP , " says McCord .
He went on to explain that the commander gave orders to shoot indiscriminately after IED attacks .
" He said , ‘ Fuck it , this is what I want … anytime someone in your line gets hit by an IED … you kill every motherfucker in the street , ’" McCord testifies .
" When one [ IED ] went off , you were supposed to open fire on anybody , " says Stieber .
" At first I would just fire into a field .
Then I would n’t fire at all . "
He describes an IED that went off near a crowd of teenagers .
" I said I would n’t fire , " even though " other people were firing , " he recalls .
Like Stieber , Corcoles describes incidents in which he purposely aimed his gun away from people .
" You do n’t even know if somebody ’s shooting at you , " he says .
" It ’s just insanity to just start shooting people . "
Stieber pointed out that in incidents like these , it was very rare for US military vehicles to stop to help the wounded or assess how many people had been injured or killed .
Stieber was intimidated and reprimanded by his command for refusing orders to shoot .
" One time when I did n’t fire , people in my truck were yelling at me for the rest of the mission .
When we got back , one or two leaders got up in my face and kept yelling at me and stuff , " he says .
The command eventually stopped sending him on missions as a gunner , and Stieber says he " faced a lot of criticism for it . "
Corcoles saw this too .
" One night our truck got hit by an IED and Josh did n’t fire , and another soldier did n’t fire , " he says .
" And they were getting yelled at : ‘ Why are n’t you firing ? ’
And they said , ‘ There ’s nobody to fire at . ’ "
Corcoles recalls another " wall of steel " incident : " Our first sergeant was with us , and after we got hit by an IED , people started shooting everywhere , and they were also actually shooting at him . "
He explains that his sergeant happened to be within range of indiscriminate fire coming from US soldiers .
After almost getting shot by the soldiers , " our first sergeant told us not to do this anymore , " says Corcoles .
Excessive acts of violence were woven into daily missions , house searches and prisoner detention , says McCord .
" This one time , in the summer of 2007 , we were in a barbershop and my platoon leader was asking the barbershop owner about the local militia , " he says .
" The interpreter kept saying the owner did n’t know anything .
The platoon leader said , ‘ He is fucking lying , ’ " says McCord , explaining that it was always assumed that Iraqis who said they did n’t know anything were lying .
" I remember my platoon leader punching him in the face .
When [ the barbershop owner ] went to ground , he was kicked by others in the platoon .
Many other Iraqis were in there to get their hair cut .
They were up against the wall watching him get kicked . "
McCord says that when others in his unit saw this kind of behavior condoned by the leadership , they followed suit .
He describes multiple instances in which soldiers abused detainees or beat people up in their houses .
In one case , he says , someone was taken from his house , beaten up and then left on the side of the road , bloodied and still handcuffed .
In this setting , the " Collateral Murder " incident does not stand out as a drastic departure from the norm .
That morning , Corcoles and McCord prepared for a " Ranger dominance " mission , " a clearing mission to basically go through every house , top to bottom , from one end of town to the next , " says Corcoles .
Stieber , who had been pulled off these missions because of his refusal to fire at crowds , was not with them this time .
For the rest of the unit , what started as another day of house searches became a four - hour battle with militia members , say Corcoles and McCord .
McCord was searching houses near Corcoles when he heard two Apache helicopters open fire nearby .
He knew these helicopters were assigned to guard forces on the ground , so he knew something serious was occurring .
" I heard over the net that we needed to move to that position , " he recalls .
He ran four or five blocks to the scene .
" I was one of the first six dismounted soldiers to arrive there . "
" It seemed unreal , " says McCord , who describes running up and " seeing the carnage of what used to be human beings on the corner . "
A passenger van sat nearby , pocked with bullet holes and littered with bodies .
Corcoles arrived on the scene shortly after McCord , who soon discovered two critically wounded children in the van and was able to pull them to safety .
These moments would later be broadcast around the world in harrowing detail .
McCord is seen in the video rushing wounded children away from the van .
Photos that McCord took at the scene show mangled corpses lying in the road and one of the children , crouched in the front seat of the van next to a dead body .
Immediately following the incident , McCord was threatened and mocked by his commanding officer for pulling the children from the van .
He says his platoon leader " yelled at me that I need to quit worrying about these ‘ motherfucking kids ’ and pull security . "
McCord later approached a staff sergeant and told him he needed mental healthcare after the incident .
" He told me to stop being a pussy … to get the sand out of my vagina , " he says .
" I was told there would be repercussions . "
Fearing punishment , McCord did not ask again .
After conducting an internal investigation , the military cleared the unit of any wrongdoing .
An " Investigation into Civilian Casualties Resulting from an Engagement on 12 July 2007 in the New Baghdad District of Baghdad , Iraq " found that " the proceedings comply with legal requirements " and " contain no material errors or violate any individual ’s substantial rights . "
The US Central Command refused several requests for an interview .
And now Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning , who is accused of leaking the video to WikiLeaks , is facing heavy charges punishable under the Espionage Act .
The 22 - year - old was transferred to Kuwait for a military trial that could lock him away in prison for decades .
In the months following the July 12 events , violence in the eastern Baghdad neighborhood subsided as the political winds shifted .
After Shiite leader Muqtada al - Sadr declared a cease - fire and the United States moved toward a strategy of alliance with the Sunni Awakening Councils and some Shiite militia members , the soldiers began working with the very people they had once been told to fight , Stieber explains .
" Things were pretty calm for most of the rest of the time , until like the last couple weeks that we were there , " he says .
As the troops finished their tour , some factions broke with Sadr ’s cease - fire and resumed fighting , and Bravo Company 2 - 16 ’s COP was burned to the ground .
" All hell broke loose , " says Stieber .
" The quick surge in violence at the end of our tour , when peace treaties were broken … show [s ] that any progress that was made was [ made ] through negotiation as opposed to brute force . "
He says he found it contradictory that soldiers would end up legitimizing the people they had once fought .
McCord would return home early , suffering long - term injury from IED attacks that left him with a shattered lower spine and traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
He says the military at first tried to deny him treatment but eventually agreed to grant him back surgery after civilian tests showed serious injury .
Despite TBI and severe post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , McCord says the military refused to grant him a medical discharge and instead discharged him with a pre-existing personality disorder , a distinction that precludes him from receiving disability benefits from the military [ see Joshua Kors , " Disposable Soldiers , " April 26 ] .
The three soldiers returned to the United States disillusioned with the war they had once volunteered to fight .
" From my experiences in Iraq , we should n’t even be in these countries fighting wars .
This is a war of aggression , of occupation .
There is nothing justifiable to me about this war , " says McCord .
" And this is n’t someone sitting back saying ‘ I think ’ or ‘ I believe . ’
This is from someone who was there . "
Three years after their deployment to Iraq , these former soldiers were forced to confront that war when the WikiLeaks video was thrust into the limelight .
They watched as the familiar scene became a media sensation , making international headlines and raising the ire and disgust of people around the world .
By this point , Stieber , now 22 , had become an outspoken peace activist .
When he heard about the video , he was in the midst of planning a speaking tour with a man from Iraq with the goal of " showing that we have more in common with the people we ’re told are our enemies than those telling us who our enemies are , " he says .
After WikiLeaks posted the video , Stieber e-mailed several people from his former unit explaining that he was going to speak out about the incident .
McCord , now 34 and raising two children , and Corcoles , 35 and raising a child , have both decided to join Stieber ’s effort .
The three have decided to go public to let the world know the context behind the acts caught on film .
" If people do n’t like that video , then the entire system needs to be re-examined , and I think it illustrates why we should n’t put soldiers in that situation , " insists Stieber .
Corcoles , now suffering from severe PTSD , says he wants the public to understand that " war kills civilians first . "
He says , " I think Americans …need to take responsibility .
If you pay taxes , you pay for that soldier ’s wage .
You ’re just as guilty as the soldier pulling the trigger . "
" What was shown in the Wikileaks video only begins to depict the suffering we have created , " reads an open letter from McCord and Stieber to the Iraqis who were injured or lost loved ones in the July 2007 attack .
" From our own experiences , and the experiences of other veterans we have talked to , we know that the acts depicted in this video are everyday occurrences of this war : this is the nature of how U.S. - led wars are carried out in this region . "
Of course , these three are not the first soldiers to break the silence about the rules of engagement in the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
At the March 2008 Winter Soldier hearings in Maryland , more than fifty veterans and active - duty service members publicly testified about the orders they were told to carry out in these countries , sharing stories of excessive violence , as well as of abusive and threatening treatment they endured from their superiors [ see Laila Al - Arian , " Winter Soldiers Speak , " April 7 , 2008 ; and Chris Hedges and Laila Al - Arian , " The Other War , " July 30 / August 6 , 2007 ] .
The three former soldiers say they support the decision to leak these videos to the public .
" Avoiding talking about what ’s going on is going to make us continue making the same mistakes and not learning our lesson , " insists Stieber .
About the most recent WikiLeaks revelations , Stieber says , " People all over the world have been confronted once again with the realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " adding that the latest release " confirms what veterans like Ethan , Ray and I , and so many other veteran witnesses , have been talking about . "
But the occupations drag on , with President Obama continuing a Bush - era plan that will leave 50,000 " noncombat " troops in Iraq until at least the end of 2011 .
And top military brass have suggested that the August 31 deadline for withdrawal of " combat " troops may be extended .
Meanwhile , Obama is sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan , bringing the total force there to more than 100,000 , in what is now the longest war in US history .
June was the deadliest month for NATO forces in Afghanistan , with 102 deaths , and as of press time July had become the second deadliest , with seventy - eight deaths .
All three soldiers say they hope Americans will learn the right lessons from the WikiLeaks video .
" We acknowledge our part in the deaths and injuries of your loved ones as we tell Americans what we were trained to do and what we carried out in the name of ‘ god and country , ’ " write McCord and Stieber in their open letter .
" The soldier in the video said that your husband should n’t have brought your children to battle , but we are acknowledging our responsibility for bringing the battle to your neighborhood , and to your family .
We did unto you what we would not want done to us . "
" Our heavy hearts still hold hope that we can restore inside our country the acknowledgment of your humanity , that we were taught to deny . "
You might remember reading in Predictably Irrational that it turns out that when we are choosing between two or more very similar options , we tend NOT to take into account the consequences of not deciding .
For example , in the parable of the donkey , the unfortunate creature is placed in the middle of two identical stacks of hay .
Unable to decide which stack to go for , the donkey starves and dies .
In another example , a friend of mine spent three months choosing between two different cameras , only to miss countless photo opportunities that he will never get back .
And given how similar the two cameras were , he might have been better off simply flipping a coin .
To remedy this situation , I had the idea of creating Procrastinator for iPhone .
This application allows you to set deadlines for your hard decisions so that when time is up , if you have n’t chosen an option , Procrastinator chooses for you .
Thus , no more endless deciding back and forth , and no more lost time .
Procrastinator is really easy to use , and you can have as many decisions as you would like running at the same time .
You can find Procrastinator here .
p.s this app costs $ 1.99 , and the money goes to to pay the nice and hardworking undergraduate students that created this app , and hopefully will continue to create other ones as well .

Brown fat - the calorie - burning , " good fat " that is plentiful in babies – has been shown to also be present in adults , and scientists are now working on harnessing its mysterious powers to help people lose weight .
Brown fat 's usefulness has been emerging over the past decade .
Studies have shown exactly where it 's located in the body , how it is stored and what activates it to torch calories while keeping us warm .
Now , as the surprising functions of brown fat just keep piling up , researchers are investigating its possible future uses as an alternative to surgical weight loss .
Quickly becoming known as the " good fat , " brown fat is proving that not all fat is created equal .
Fat - burning furnace
Brown fat first began mystifying scientists three decades ago , when it was determined to act as a calorie - burning heat source .
It looks brown because it contains huge numbers of mitochondria , which are tiny organelles inside cells that contain iron , giving the fat tissue a rusty tinge .
Mitochondria are found in smaller numbers in most body cells , and are the cells ' " powerhouses " – their job is to convert the energy from sugars into a form of energy that cells can use .
Therefore , tissues that are loaded with mitochondria , such as brown fat and muscle , act as calorie furnaces .
" This is a fascinating area that is opening up rapidly following the identification of functioning brown fat in humans , " said Tom E. Hughes , CEO of Zafgen , Inc. , a biotech firm based in Cambridge , Mass .
Hughes ' company is running the first clinical trial testing the effects of drugs called MetAP2 inhibitors , which putatively work by improving the way fat is processed by obese people 's metabolism .
Not just baby fat
Plentiful in babies and small rodents because of their lack of an efficient shivering mechanism in their bodies , brown fat kicks into calorie - burning , heat - generating action when a person becomes cold .
Scientists previously theorized that once babies ' muscular and nervous systems have developed enough for them to shiver , brown fat is no longer needed and is converted into regular white fat .
But a landmark 2009 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that some adults do indeed retain deposits of this baby fat – typically between their shoulder blades .
In fact , the researchers also found that thinner people are more likely to have brown fat , suggesting that it may play a role in regulating body weight .
Boosting growth of this fat could potentially become a new way to treat obesity , the researchers said .
Later in 2009 , other scientists conducted PET - CT scans on 1,972 people and found that adults also have brown fat deposits on the side of the neck , in the nook between the collarbone and shoulder and along the spine , as well as in the upper back .
" There is a lot more interest in trying to figure out how brown fat can be induced , " said that study 's senior author , Ronald Kahn , head of the section on obesity and hormone action at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston .
Activating brown fat
But making more brown fat cells would have no effect on calorie burning or on weight loss if those cells are not activated , Hughes said .
This would lead to an " all dressed up with nowhere to go " situation , with brown fat lying dormant in the body instead of scorching calories .
So how can brown fat be activated ?
Brown fat is normally activated by adrenaline or thyroid hormones , both of which are released when the body is exposed to cold temperatures .
That 's why infants have a sheet of brown fat cells covering their backs ; because it is vital for their tiny bodies to stay warm , Mother Nature has rigged the brown cells to raise their body temperature as soon as they feel a chill .
Cold temperatures may have a similar effect on adults .
In one experiment , researchers at the Maastricht University in the Netherlands were almost able to watch the emergence of brown fat .
They took scans of 24 men , 14 of whom were overweight or obese , before and after they were asked to sit in a chilly room for two hours .
Scans done prior to the experiment showed no brown fat activity , while scans taken after they were exposed to cold temperatures showed brown fat activity in all but one subject , who was obese .
Obese people have less active brown fat , according to Kahn .
Because there is a difference between having less brown fat and having brown fat that is not activated , researchers have been experimenting with ways to measure , as well as activate , brown fat amounts .
Researchers are now looking for ways to increase the amount and activity of brown fat , especially in obese people .
The search is on to find drugs that could activate the fat , without unsafe side effects .
But not much is known about how these drugs might work , Hughes said .
" As far as we know , if one could increase the amount of brown fat and activate it , the result might be to increase energy expenditure and increase food intake , " Hughes said .
" This might have a net zero effect on body weight . "
JavaScript needs macros
JavaScript needs modules ?
No .
JavaScript needs a macro compiler companion to extend the language with new statements :
defs export( VarDecleration v ) { this.{{v.varName}} = {{v.initValue}} ; } defs module ( VarName n , Block b) { var {{n}} = new function ( ) {{b}} ; } defs import ( VarName module , Period p , VarName vName ) { var {{vName}} = {{module}} .{{ vName}} ; }
So ( ~> pronounced “ compiles to ” ) :
>>> export var foo = 3 ; ~> this .foo = 3 ; >>> module X { ... } ; ~> var X = new function ( ) { ... } >>> import A.B ; ~> var B = A.B ;
And there are your modules , compatible with every browser instantaneously , without having to wait for IE12 to implement any JS dialects .
It has been more then 6 years since I was at the sanatorium but I have never forgotten it .
It was winter time and being from the South I was not used to all of the gloomy snow , which really just set the mood .
This friend I was visiting suggested that if I really wanted to see something of a local legend we could go to what he said was an old abandoned " Mental Hospital " .
The original plan was to go at night because me being brave , informed my friend that I did not believe in ghosts or any other such nonsense and this place could not possibly be as creepy as he described it .
I was all for a nighttime rendezvous with the sanatorium .
Due to heavy snow we could not go on the night planned and I was leaving the following evening .
The only option was to go the next day , weather permitting .
The following morning the snow had let up and we drove to the point where we had to get out and start walking , the snow was almost knee deep .
I was starting to get a little apprehensive just on the walk up there .
From viewing your pictures I believe I was headed to the administration building .

Feb. 17 , 2010  --
Amid questions about the sustainability of jobs created or saved by the stimulus , President Obama today praised the recovery act for helping to prevent the economy from falling into a depression .
" One year later , it is largely thanks to the recovery act that a second depression is no longer a possibility , " the president said on the one - year anniversary of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
" It 's laying out the foundation for where we need to go . "
Obama acknowledged that passing the $ 787 billion package " was n't a politically easy decision to make , " but he also criticized opponents of the plan , especially those who were taking aim at the bill even as " many of them showed up for ribbon - cutting ceremonies for projects in their districts . "
Hundreds of thousands of Americans have found jobs in projects funded by the stimulus program , but one year later , it 's unclear what the future holds for some of these workers .
Vice President Biden today delivered a report to the president about the progress of the stimulus .
The report states that $ 453 billion , about 57 percent of the money has been used , but questions remain as to whether that funding has been used wisely .
The Obama administration credits the stimulus with saving or creating two million jobs .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office puts that figure between 800,000 and 2.4 million .
Obama today projected that the stimulus funding will save or create another 1.5 to 2 million jobs this year .
But a New York Times / CBS
News poll out today shows that only 6 percent of Americans believe the plan has created any jobs , with 48 percent thinking it wo n't , a number higher than late last year .
Christina Romer , chair of President 's Council of Economic Advisors , says employment will grow over time and that the state fiscal relief program in the stimulus has been effective in keeping thousands of teachers and firefighters on the job .
" Right now , the employment numbers look basically stable , " she said on " Good Morning America " today .
" We think we 're going to see positive job growth by spring . "
The 586 - square - mile Hanford nuclear site in Washington state received nearly $ 2 billion from the stimulus package for environmental cleanup work .
As of January , about $ 367 million had been spent and the money was credited with creating and saving 1,538 full - time jobs .
At the Utica City school district in New York , close to $ 12 million in stimulus helped keep jobs and make new hires .
Before the stimulus money came through , " we were actually looking at cutting about 61 jobs , and that 's not just teaching jobs -- that 's teaching staff , support staff and administrators , " said Superintendent Jim Willis .
The money from the federal government , Willis said , helped keep those 61 jobs and add more and expand programs .
" It saved 61 jobs , it created another 73 positions , it saved a lot of programs that we were going to cut , " he said .
But with the funding only going up to 2011 , the district 's clock is now ticking .
New hires signed a document stating , " I am fully aware that the funding for this position will be eliminated in two ( 2 ) years .
Therefore this position will end on June 30 , 2011 . "
Schools Concerned About Jobs When Stimulus Funding Ends
Willis said his new hires realized that their jobs would be temporary but with New York slashing state funding and stimulus money drying up by 2011 , that means all the jobs saved and / or created could be on the chopping block .
" Looking ahead [ to ] 2010 and 2011 , not only do we lose these positions that we created and those that we saved but we are probably looking at another 30 or 40 teaching positions alone that we will probably have to cut , " Willis said .
" In many school districts , the stimulus has sort of prevented layoffs up until a certain point , and now states are sort of looking at , well now what do we do without the stimulus money , " said Michael Grabell , a reporter at ProPublica , a public interest group that tracks stimulus spending .
Obama today acknowledged that the current economic climate " does n't yet feel like much of a recovery " to those who are still unemployed .
The president said layoffs could even increase this year because of the dire economic situation states are facing , but he added that the stimulus would help lay the foundations for future growth .
" The recovery act was never meant to ... restore our economy to full strength , " he said .
" It 's laying out the foundation for where we need to go . "
Romer says that the bang from the stimulus is not in the past , and that the administration is reviewing other ways to expand job growth .
" We have certainly seen productivity surge , and that , at one level , is a good sign about the economy .
But absolutely , we 've got to translate that GDP growth [ in the last quarter ] into employment growth , " she said on " GMA . "
That 's why again , the president has said , as good as the recovery act is , we should n't stop there . "
A senior administration official said Tuesday that the state fiscal relief program will continue to help stave off layoffs of public sector workers like teachers , police personnel and firefighters .
But as project investment increases , there will be a shift toward job creation in the private sector in what another official called " transformative industries " like clean energy technology .
" I think there is a bipartisan realization of just how much states are still suffering , " Romer said .
There is also the issue of questionable stimulus spending , according to the administration 's own inspector general .
Twenty community agencies that are slated to receive $ 45 million are " at risk for fraud , waste and abuse . "
One example -- Illinois received $ 242 million to weatherize 27,000 homes , but the Department of Energy found " significant internal control deficiencies , " including one instance with a " furnace gas leak that could have resulted in serious injury to the occupants . "
Investigators at ProPublica , which launched a new " Stimulus Investigations " page today , found that billions in stimulus money could be lost to fraud .
" The biggest problem we 're seeing is with questionable contractors who are receiving stimulus funds despite being under criminal investigation , " Grabell said .
" We 've seen several examples of this where a contractor may be banned from getting federal contracts but still is finding a way to get stimulus money . "
For example , an Oklahoma highway contractor who was suspended after being accused of conspiring to use unsuitable asphalt material within months formed a new company and began receiving stimulus contracts again .
Fraud Concerns in Stimulus
Tax credits are another area where fraud is likely .
The Recovery Act has thus far provided $ 119 billion in tax relief , according to the administration 's one - year progress report .
" I 've talked to a lot of investigators on this and in one report , for example , the inspector general found that half a billion dollars of claims for new home buyer tax credit could be ineligible , " Grabell said .
Then there is also the issue of questionable projects and whether they really deserve to receive the stimulus money .
" We 've gone through records that said they spent money on lion and tiger dens at the National Zoo in D.C. , stopped modified funding for fish sperm , resetting headstones at cemeteries , cleaning bird droppings , " said Grabell .
Obama administration officials say that it is easy to overstate mishandling in stimulus projects .
The money , officials told ABC News , is unfolded with great transparency .
It does n't mean there are mistakes but when they are discovered , they are fixed .
" This program has run cleanly , smoothly and transparently , " Obama said today while explaining the challenges of implementing a large bill .
The administration is also working to convince Americans that the stimulus is indeed helping them , including their own supporters .
On Tuesday evening , former Obama for America campaign manager David Plouffe sent an e-mail to supporters of what 's now called Organizing for America , asking them if they 're " wondering what ... President Obama 's stimulus bill -- has accomplished ? "
If so , he tells them to look a chart showing how job losses have steadily become less horrible .
Plouffe says " while this anniversary is n't a cause for celebration , there is reason to be optimistic .
This chart makes it clear :
We 're on the road to recovery . "
Wenn von Wasserkraft an Flüssen und Seen die Rede ist , denkt man normalerweise an großtechnische Anlagen mit mehreren Staustufen , riesigen Turbinen und enormer Durchflussleistung , die ganze Regionen versorgen können .
Es geht aber auch deutlich kleiner : Mit Hilfe der Wasserwirbeltechnik lassen sich in Staubecken , durch die Teile des Flusswassers umgeleitet werden , auch minimale Fallhöhen ausnutzen , um Strom zu erzeugen .
In der Schweiz will nun die Genossenschaft Wasserwirbelkraftwerke , kurz GWWK , die Nutzung der Technologie vorantreiben – sie möchte dazu überall im Land umweltbewegte Menschen zusammenführen , die gemeinsam Anlagen finanzieren und aufbauen .
Das scheint anzukommen : Nach sieben Monaten waren 100 private Geldgeber für ein erstes Kraftwerk im Kanton Aargau gefunden , 300.000 Franken kostete die nach dem Solar - Flugzeug - Pionier Dr. Bertrand Piccard benannte Anlage , die in diesem Sommer in Betrieb geht .
Im Interview mit Technology Review erläutert GWWK - Sprecher Daniel Styger die Idee der dezentralen Energieversorgung : " Wir haben errechnet , dass wir in der Schweiz das Potenzial haben , ein komplettes Atomkraftwerk durch Wasserwirbelanlagen kostengünstiger und nachhaltiger zu ersetzen – oder ein neues AKW dadurch nicht bauen zu müssen . "
Die kleinen Kraftwerke selbst sind keine Naturverbraucher :
Sie werden an bereits vorhandenen und nicht mehr in Betrieb befindlichen Staustufen und anderen Wasserkraftanlagen eingebaut , von denen es in der Schweiz viele Tausend gibt .
Für das Leben in Fluss und Bach hat das sogar Vorteile : Fische und Kleinlebewesen können durch die Staubecken einfach hindurchschwimmen .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Attention , phony war heroes :
Dust off those surplus uniforms and shine up those medals awarded by eBay .
U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn has ruled that the Stolen Valor Act is an unconstitutional abridgment of your free - speech rights to deceive the public and dishonor those who actually did the heroic acts that you can only dream of doing .
Judge Blackburn , in a case before the District of Colorado over faux Marine Rick Glen Strandlof , ruled that the government lacked a compelling interest in abridging speech rights when it came to warrior impersonators .
This is no G.I. Joke .
The Stolen Valor
Act made it a misdemeanor for people to falsely claim “ verbally or in writing , to have been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of the United States . ”
Congress thought the law was necessary because “ fraudulent claims surrounding receipt of the Medal of Honor , the Distinguished Service Cross , the Air Force Cross , the Navy Cross , the Purple Heart , or any other medal or decoration awarded by Congress or the Armed Forces damage the reputation and meaning of these medals . ”
Counterfeiting is an apt analogy .
The counterfeiter turns paper into wealth he did not earn , and in so doing dilutes the value of legitimate currency possessed by others .
Service medals are akin to currency , but they are backed by blood , sweat and sacrifice .
They are a form of recognition that has value because of the official regulations and honored traditions that govern the awards .
Those who have earned the right to wear them , possess them or even say they were awarded them have acquired a tangible asset in the form of the respect bestowed on them by the public .
Most recipients of military medals do n’t seek them , and many are unassuming about their awards after the fact .
But the phonies seek only to profit from claiming to be among the ranks of these heroes .
They impersonate specifically to seek gain in the same way the counterfeiter seeks to profit from making phony bills .
Fraudulent heroes devalue military medals in two ways .
By making awards seem more common , they become less rare and seem more ordinary .
If every veteran - or rather , imposter - claimed to have been awarded the Silver Star , the award would soon inspire the same awe and admiration as a Girl Scout Brownie ’s merit badge for basket - weaving .
And when fakers are exposed , the disappointed public then looks with suspicion on genuine heroes .
The phonies break the bonds of trust established by those who earned it .
Heroes unjustly lose their repute ; the public unfairly loses the opportunity to have heroes to emulate .
In this way , the fakers assault the integrity of the military awards system itself .
It is in the government ’s compelling interest to defend the system established by Congress to render these official honors .
The issue is not whether all lying should be made illegal ; lying , with some notable exceptions , is protected speech under the Constitution .
Acknowledging a special interest in safeguarding the military awards system is no more a slippery slope than the laws governing perjury , libel , slander and criminal fraud .
If the government has an interest in recognizing valor at all , it also has an interest in seeing to it that valor is not cheapened .
A Purple Heart medal can be purchased online for less than $ 35 .
Compare that to the price paid by warriors who survived enemy attacks or who face a lifetime of disability from their wounds - or those who never make it back home .
No matter what some confused judge thinks , honoring genuine heroism and sacrifice for America is a compelling interest .

At last week 's G - 20 meeting , President Barack Obama achieved a two - fer .
He suffered a significant international defeat , and he increased the chances his party will suffer a major domestic one this fall .
Mr. Obama 's international defeat was self - inflicted .
He went to Toronto to press other major nations to do as he has done : Expand government spending , or suffer , in the president 's words , " renewed economic hardship and recession . "
Canada , Germany , Great Britain and most other countries declined Mr. Obama 's invitation .
The German economic minister " urgently " prodded America to cut spending at a press conference on June 21 , prior to the G - 20 meeting .
The president of the European central bank took direct aim at Mr. Obama 's argument , telling the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on June 16 that " the idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect . "
The European Union president , Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek , tore into Mr. Obama 's stimulus and other spending policies in a stunning address to the European Parliament in March 2009 , calling them " the road to hell " and saying " the United States did not take the right path . "
If it sounds strange to have European leaders lecturing the U.S. about fiscal restraint , it should .
But that is where America finds itself after Mr. Obama 's 17 - month fiscal orgy .

A man who secretly filmed himself having sex with a woman used the recording to clear himself of rape suspicions .
Then police prosecuted him for making the film .
Haimona Kenneth Gardiner , 25 , was charged with intentionally making an intimate visual recording of another person on May 21 , court documents show .
He works as a private secretary in Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia 's ministerial office at Parliament .
Although the maximum penalty for the offence is three years in jail , he completed diversion and the charge was withdrawn in Wellington District Court last month .
It is understood police began an investigation after a member of the public found a woman wandering along The Terrace one morning in May .
The woman , aged in her 40s , claims to have little memory of the night before but officers traced her back to Gardiner 's nearby home .
It is understood he argued they had met at a central Wellington bar the night before and the sex had been consensual – and as proof he handed over the recording .
Police viewed the tape and , on the basis of that evidence , decided against laying more serious charges .
Gardiner declined to comment when contacted yesterday through Mrs Turia 's office .
He has been described as an emerging Maori leader and has taken part in televised debates as a representative of the Young Maori Party .
He is currently part of a delegation of young parliamentarians on a 15 - day trip to the United States which includes visiting the White House in Washington DC .
Police refused to discuss any aspect of the case , but diversion is normally granted only for minor crimes and first offences .
It can involve reparation and the victim 's views are considered .
Mrs Turia told The Dominion Post she had spoken to Gardiner and he was genuinely apologetic for his actions .
Police must have accepted he had learned a lesson to have given him diversion , she said .
" He has gone through a court process , he 's been given diversion .
I do n't think there is anything more that I can say ... that is going to alter the story , " Mrs Turia said .
" I need to talk to him face to face , I need to speak with his family .
They 're the important people in all this . "
Mrs Turia would not comment on his actions or any potential repercussions but said he would not be recalled from the United States trip .
" He 's already there .
There 's no way I 'm going to pull him back because The Dominion Post is running a story on him ... no way . "
Under Internal Affairs Department guidelines , parliamentary employees are obliged to disclose any offences or charges laid against them – excluding minor traffic offences .
Wellington Sexual Abuse Help Foundation general manager Helen Sullivan said the filming aspect of the case was unusual .
" There are situations that may not necessarily fit a criminal definition , but women are still left with the same feelings of guilt and shame , of being abused or being uncomfortable .
" Whether something becomes a criminal case or not ... there 's a moral or social issue there . "
F.lux for Ubuntu
F.lux is a small but very useful application :
It fades your screens to a warmer color temperature in the evening .
This is pleasant for your eyes and wo n’t leave you wide awake at 2 am because your computer monitors are so bright .
There are mac and windows versions , but only a commandline app for Linux .
Together with Michael Herf , the author of F.lux , I made a version for Ubuntu .
F.lux for Ubuntu is an indicator applet ( like the new Messaging Menu ) , so it works very nicely on Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 .
Michael improved the commandline application by leaps and bounds .
There are a bunch of new configuration options ( all available in the GUI ) , the night / daytime cycle is now much more accurate , and it even takes daylight savings into account .
The F.lux indicator applet automatically manages the color temperature of your screen based on your latitude and longitude , or if you are in the US , your zipcode .
In the preferences panel , you can set your preferred nighttime colortemperature and see a preview , as well as seeing the current color temperature .
Installation
Installation is easily done by adding the PPA for f.lux , simply type the following into your terminal :
sudo add - apt - repository ppa:nathan - renniewaldock / flux sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get install fluxgui
When you first launch the application ( via ‘ accessories ’ in the menu , or by pressing alt + f2 and opening “ fluxgui ” ) you will be asked to fill in either your latitude and langitude , or your zipcode .
If you want f.lux to autostart at the next startup , select the “ autostart ” option .
Close the preferences panel and you ’re all set !
There is a bug in the current version of Fluxgui that ’s preventing it from running correctly the first time it ’s started .
I wrote a fix that ’ll be available in the PPA shortly ( version 1.1.4 ) .
If you ca n’t start because fluxgui claims it ’s already running , remove “ fluxgui.pid ” from the /tmp folder .
After the update , it should work as advertised !
On developing F.lux for Ubuntu
As I mentioned , F.lux for Ubuntu is built using GTK +.
This is n’t by choice , but needed because I wanted to built an indicator applet .
Coming from Python + Qt ( for Trimage ) , GTK + feels like a serious step back .
The Glade interface builder is clunky and quirky , and surprisingly , modules such as python - gconf and python - appindicator are virtually undocumented .
There is a massive amount of time spent on figuring out what - goes - where - and - how .
Nevertheless , I like Python more each time I use it , and going back to JavaScript often feels weird ( “ Oh , yes , parentheses ! ” ) so I think it ’s time to start doing more with Coffeescript in the future .
Official announcement
Michael posted an official announcement on the F.lux website with these instructions as well : f.lux for linux , so be sure to go there and leave nice comments for us and tell us what we can improve ! :)
Future versions
The currently released version is 1.1.1 , For version 1.2 we will be adding a “ pause for an hour ” function , as well as an indication of how long until sunset / sunrise .
Feel free to suggest other new features or fork the project on Github .
It ’s build using Python and GTK + , and the GUI is MIT licenced .
I ’m quite proud of the result so far , and I hope it ’ll be as useful to others as it already has been to me !
Please leave suggestions for new features in the replies :)

In 2000 Mike Gordon released a surreal movie titled Outside Out .
While some people tried to explain the plot , were amused by the antics of Colonel Bruce Hampton ( retired ) , talked about how the movie was a giant loop ( the first scene actually takes place right after the last ) , or just coveted the giant blue button featured in the film , others noticed a very intriguing statement in the DVD packaging .
A soundtrack album featuring " industrial - grade compact disc musicians " was promised to come out in 2001 .
Excited Mike fans waited throughout the year .
No album .
2002 came .
Phish returned at Madison Square Garden , but no soundtrack album emerged .
It took until August 2003 for Inside
In to come out , but the delay was because it was a much more interesting product than a simple soundtrack .
While the actual movie has a few tracks from the album – Take Me Out , " " The Teacher , " " Take Me Outro " – the songs on Inside
In mostly take snippets from background music and expand them into full songs .
It 's less of a soundtrack than an album inspired by the film .
The result is an atmospheric disc which has a small but rabid fanbase within the Phish community , a cult subgroup of a cult subgroup .
" Couch Lady " tells the tale of a bit character in Outside Out .
Described solely as " Pakistani Guitarist " in the credits , Mike 's neighbor Virginia W. Herschede appears in the infomercial for the Outstructional Guitar Lessons that was the original heart of the movie .
She sits on a couch out in the woods and reveals that she took 34 lessons from the Colonel in 1927 in only six minutes .
It might not seem like her four lines of dialogue would be enough detail to create a song from , but Mike took the lead of ' fan fiction ' authors everywhere and created a back story for an obscure character .
The Catholic Church on Thursday is expected to release its new rules to try to prevent clergy from abusing children , a source close to the Vatican told CNN .
The rules will be aimed more at firming up existing practices , said the source , who asked not to be named because the source was talking about the regulations before they are made public .
The Vatican will add the possession of child pornography to the list of most serious crimes , declare the abuse of any mentally retarded person to be as bad as the abuse of children , and double the statute of limitations on the Vatican 's prosecution of suspected abuse .
The Vatican also plans to make it a major crime against the church to ordain a woman as a priest , the source said .
Some critics of the Catholic Church have said that having women in the hierarchy could have helped prevent clerical child abuse .
It is not clear if the hardening of the Vatican 's longstanding line against women priests is related to the accusation .
The new rules on child abuse are a response to accusations against priests across Europe and the United States in the past several years , and come not long , in Vatican terms , after the last set of such rules was issued in 2001 .
Pope Benedict XVI was a key in drafting the 2001 rules , when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger .
The source said the new rules were designed primarily to set down in canon law what the church already practices .
They deal only with how the church handles allegations of misbehavior by clergy , the source said , explaining that it did not change existing Vatican policy of also reporting suspected child abuse to civil authorities .
Abuse victims are already saying the changes do n't go far enough .
" There needs to be massive overhaul , not mere tweaking , of how the church
deals with abuse and cover - up , " said Barbara Dorris , of the Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests .
" As long as bishops can ignore and conceal child sex crimes without punishment , they 'll keep ignoring and concealing child sex crimes , " she said last week , responding to media reports about what the new guidelines would say .
" The focus needs to be on catching predators more quickly , involving secular law enforcement , and preventing recklessness and deceit by bishops , who can and should take many steps to protect the vulnerable long before the defrocking process begins , " she said .
Thousands of people have come forward in the United States , Ireland , the Netherlands , Austria and the pope 's native Germany to say they were abused as children by Catholic clergy .
The crisis has particularly shocked deeply Catholic Ireland , where three government - backed investigations have uncovered physical and sexual abuse stretching back decades .
Police in Belgium recenty raided the headquarters of the Catholic Church there , and later spent 10 hours questioning the cardinal who used to head the Belgian Catholic Church .
The pope has repeatedly said the Vatican will seek justice for victims .
Last month he said the church must promise " to do everything possible " to ensure that the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests " will never occur again . "
Benedict said the church must " insistently beg forgiveness from God " and from victims for the sexual abuse committed by Catholic priests .
He also said priests must be more thoroughly vetted before joining the ministry .

What !?
That ’s what I am sayin ’ about .
The U.S. military often portrays its drone aircraft as high - tech marvels that can be operated seamlessly from thousands of miles away .
But Pentagon accident reports reveal that the pilotless aircraft suffer from frequent system failures , computer glitches and human error .
Design and system problems were never fully addressed in the haste to push the fragile plane into combat over Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks more than eight years ago .
Air Force investigators continue to cite pilot mistakes , coordination snafus , software failures , outdated technology and inadequate flight manuals .
FOR THE RECORD :
Drone accidents :
An article in Tuesday ’s Section A about accidents among military drone aircraft identified Col. Jeff Kappenman as director of the Center of Excellence for UAS Research , Education and Training at the University of North Dakota and retired Rear Adm .
Thomas J. Cassidy Jr. as president of the aircraft systems group at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems , which makes Predator and Reaper drones .
Kappenman resigned from his position in May .
Cassidy assumed a new role , consultant and chairman of the executive committee , at his company in mid-March . —
Thirty - eight Predator and Reaper drones have crashed during combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq , and nine more during training on bases in the U.S. — with each crash costing between $ 3.7 million and $ 5 million .
Altogether , the Air Force says there have been 79 drone accidents costing at least $ 1 million each .
Accident rates are dropping , but the raw numbers of mishaps are increasing as use of the aircraft skyrockets , according to Air Force safety experts .
But no lives are lost , and for some experts that ’s the most important point :
For them , drones are the vanguard of a new type of remote warfare that minimizes the risk to U.S. personnel .
The number of crashes , however , illustrates how quickly the unmanned aircraft have become an essential part of U.S. combat operations .
At least 38 drones are in flight over Afghanistan and Iraq at any given time .
Flight hours over Afghanistan and Iraq more than tripled between 2006 and 2009 .
However , ground commanders in Afghanistan say only about a third of their requests for drone missions are met because of shortages of aircraft and pilots .
The loss of aircraft to crashes and other accidents can hamper combat operations — and risk the lives of troops who depend on them for reconnaissance and air cover .
The Air Force acknowledges that armed drones were not ready when first deployed as the U.S. military geared up for the campaign to oust the Taliban and Al Qaeda from Afghanistan .
Most weapons systems are tested and refined for years .
Unarmed drones had been in use since the mid-1990s , but the first armed version went to war just nine months after it was retrofitted .
It was pushed into use after a Predator successfully launched Hellfire antitank missiles at the Naval Air Weapons testing range at China Lake in January 2001 .
“ It was never designed to go to war when it did , ” said Lt. Col .
Travis Burdine , a manager for the Air Force Unmanned Aircraft Systems Task Force .
“ We did n’t have the luxury of ironing out some of the problems . ”
Technicians bought off - the - shelf equipment at Radio Shack and Best Buy to build a system to allow ground forces to see the drones ’ video feeds .
At least one drone crashed because it had no fuel gauge , and the aircraft ran out of fuel .
In another crash , investigators cited a design flaw :
The “ kill engine ” switch was located next to the switch to lower the landing gear , and a ground - based pilot confused the two .
Even now , the planes are not designed for the amount of use they ’re getting , their defenders say .
The 27 - foot Predators and 36 - foot Reapers operate under conditions that put enormous stress on the light drones — and the humans who operate them .
“ These airplanes are flying 20,000 hours a month , OK ? ” said retired Rear Adm .
Thomas J. Cassidy Jr. , president of the aircraft systems group at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems in San Diego , which makes Predators and Reapers .
“ That ’s a lot of flying , ” Cassidy said .
“ Some get shot down .
Some run into bad weather .
Some , people do stupid things with them .
Sometimes they just run them out of gas . ”
The drones flew 185,000 hours over Afghanistan and Iraq in 2009 , more than triple the number of hours flown in 2006 .
The Air Force expects that number to grow to 300,000 hours this year .
“ The Air Force needs as many as they can get , ” said Col. Jeff Kappenman , director of the Center of Excellence for UAS Research , Education and Training at the University of North Dakota .
“ There has been exponential growth in need and demand . ”
Air Force officials say design and training improvements have lowered the Predator ’s accident rate .
They say lessons learned from that plane ’s problems have solved some issues for the larger and more potent Reaper , in use in combat since 2007 .
Accident rates per 100,000 hours dropped to 7.5 for the Predator and 16.4 for the Reaper last year , according to the Air Force .
The Predator rate is comparable to that of the F - 16 fighter at the same stage , Air Force officers say , and just under the 8.2 rate for small , single - engine private airplanes flown in the U.S .
The crash figures do not include drones flown over Pakistan by the CIA , which does not acknowledge the covert program .
But independent experts said Predators flown over Pakistan probably experience problems similar to those flown by the Air Force in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Four Air Force Predators have crashed this year , three of them in Afghanistan — on Jan. 15 in southern Afghanistan , one on takeoff Feb. 9 in eastern Afghanistan , and a third March 14 in the southern part of the country .
All were total losses , the Air Force said .
Another Predator crashed in California during a training exercise April 20 .
In the 12 months ended Sept. 30 , the Air Force reported 16 Predator and Reaper accidents .
Four involved crashes during a 15 - day period in September .
On Sept. 13 , a pilot inside a ground station in Nevada lost video and data links to a Reaper over Afghanistan .
As it was about to exit Afghan airspace and crash , an F - 15 pilot was ordered to shoot it down and ground troops recovered the wreckage to keep top - secret technology out of insurgents ’ hands .
In another case , a drone crashed into a Sunni political headquarters in Mosul , Iraq .
No injuries were reported .
In some cases , a cause is never determined and no wreckage is recovered .
On May 13 , 2009 , a crew in Nevada lost contact with a Predator , and it was listed as “ presumed crashed ” somewhere in Afghanistan , according to an Air Force report .
Retired Gen. Wesley K. Clark , asked whether high drone mishap rates concerned him , replied : “ Not really .
They ’re expendable . ”
Others disagree , saying every drone that goes down is one less available for troops in need .
“ We ca n’t treat these things like disposable diapers and just throw them out , ” retired Air Force Gen .
Hal Hornburg , former chief of the Air Force Air Combat Command , warned officers at a conference on drones .
Kyle Snyder , who tracks military drones for the Assn. for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International , a nonprofit research group , said he had never heard anyone in the Air Force call drones expendable .
A 2007 study by the Air Force Research Laboratory found that up to 80 % of Predator crashes involved some degree of human error .
Updated studies attribute more recent accidents to inadequate manuals , crew coordination mistakes and crews being asked to perform tasks for which they are not fully trained , according to an analysis by the Air Force and a private contractor .
After a Predator crashed during a landing at Kandahar air base in March 2007 , investigators faulted the Predator system for a “ lack of visual cues ” to help pilots understand the position of a plane flying half a world away .
The pilot in Nevada misjudged the drone ’s altitude , the investigative report said .
The Predator that ran out of fuel over Iraq had a leak , but there was no gauge to warn the pilot , an Air Force crash researcher said .
And a pilot trainee at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada crashed a Predator by hitting the “ kill engine ” switch instead of the adjacent landing gear switch , according to an investigative report .
Some ground control stations , where pilots and camera operators sit , still have 1990s - era text - based computer systems .
Pilots have to type function and control commands rather than clicking on icons .
“ There ’s a control delay between typing something and having it actually happen on the airplane , ” said Gregg Montijo , a contractor who trains drone crews .
“ When the heat is on , sometimes guys will type something in , then type it again real quickly .
They ’ll confuse the computer and get the wrong display and get into a vicious cycle . ”
Despite the mishaps , Burdine said , Predators and Reapers are doing great work .
“ It ’s a big payoff for the Air Force to make sure the next generation of systems learns from the first generation , ” he said .
“ And that ’s what we ’re doing . ”

British Traffic Cop Jamie Slater , 33 , was jailed for 3 years having sex with women in exchange for letting them off driving offences .
After stopping women for a driving offence , he would threaten them with tickets or car impound unless they would give him their number and later agree to do some sexual favors .
He stopped six women , took their mobile phone numbers and later sent them text messages , demanding they meet him for sex .
Peter Davies , prosecuting , told a court the policeman stopped a married woman who was driving alone with only a provisional driving licence .
After taking her details , he said he would have to impound the woman ’s car , which made her cry .
‘ Slater told her if she gave him her mobile number he would not cause the car to be retained , ’ Mr Davies said .
The policeman then contacted her by text message and the pair met for sex on an industrial estate near the M4 .
Mr Davies said this happened three further times when Slater was on duty .
‘ On one occasion Slater was called out and involved in a high - speed chase while the woman was hiding in the vehicle , ’ he added .
He later ran checks on the woman ’s husband then taunted him with a text message that read : “ I ’m f** * ing your wife . ”

State District Judge Randy Clapp ruled after hearing from Nikki Araguz that she received a check for $ 60,000 on Thursday , about a 10th of the total cash expected because of Thomas Araguz 's July 4 death in an egg farm inferno .
The firefighter 's parents have filed a lawsuit alleging that the marriage is void because Nikki Araguz was born a man .
Their attorney , Chad Ellis , said family members got what they wanted in Friday 's hearing and expect to go forward .
" Nikki Araguz is someone who has conned people her entire life , " said Ellis , an attorney for Simone Araguz , the firefighter 's mother .
" We are getting daily reports that Tommy Araguz was not the first person who this has happened to .
She has deceived other men into thinking that she was born a woman . "
If the marriage is voided in Texas , he said , all of the proceeds will go to Tommy Araguz 's two sons from a prior marriage .
He said Thomas Araguz testified in a deposition two months ago that he did not know his wife was born a man , which was flatly disputed by Nikki Araguz .
" I had been completely honest with him about my entire history : legally , financially , physically , mentally , and medically , " Nikki Araguz said after the hearing .
" And I have evidence to prove such facts . "
She said she looks forward to the outcome of the case .
" My husband and I loved each other very much , " she said " When all of the evidence is presented , the whole world will know that I am Mrs. Capt .
Thomas Araguz III , and I 'm now a widow . "
Nikki Araguz 's attorneys have declined to comment on their defense but said they expect to file an answer to the lawsuit detailing their strategy in the coming weeks .
No one allowed to spend
Attorney Darrell Steidley noted that family members who are suing Nikki Araguz also cannot accept or spend money associated with the death , including from private organizations .
" I think now it 's a more even playing field , " said Steidley .
" We look forward to the next big step , which is our response . "
Thomas Araguz 's sister , Raquel Araguz , scoffed openly when Nikki Araguz broke down several times as she testified .
" This is absolutely ridiculous , " Raquel Araguz said after the hearing .
" She 's just a liar .
Everything she said was a lie , and it just disgusted us . "
Friday 's hearing was the first step in litigation to determine whether the two were legally married .
$ 600,000 in cash
The judge also heard from a Houston Fire Department community liaison who said the family can expect about $ 600,000 in cash , which ordinarily would be split between Nikki Araguz and the firefighter 's two sons .
The family can expect other benefits as well .
Clapp also ordered that the firefighter 's gun and his captain 's badge be held in trust during the litigation .
In court , Nikki Araguz 's birth certificate , indicating that she was born a man , and an affidavit in which she changed her name were admitted into evidence .
The law that generally determines gender in Texas is a 1991 court case , Littleton v. Prange , which held that three factors - a person 's gonads , genitalia and chromosomes - determine gender at birth .
Nikki Araguz 's attorney , Phyllis Randolph Frye , who is transgender , said she hopes this case will end that law .
" If the legal chips go where I hope they go , I hope that we can get Littleton overturned or rendered toothless , " she said .
Cristan Williams , a representative of the Transgender Foundation of America , said her organization is accepting donations for Nikki Araguz 's living expenses and legal bills because her assets were frozen .

Motorists frequently ignore protected bike zones at junctions .
Even the police give out mixed messages about whether they are breaking the law
A couple of days ago I blogged about my encounter with an Addison Lee minicab driver who drove into the protected bike zone at a red traffic light .
This happens frustratingly frequently and is clearly contrary to the Highway Code .
( Point 178 states : " Motorists , including motorcyclists , MUST stop at the first white line reached if the lights are amber or red " . )
But is it actually illegal ?
And if so what penalties do drivers face ?
When I started looking into this , the answer turned out to be surprisingly contradictory .
Peter Walker touched on the in a previous blog in which he asked the police why they apparently turn a blind eye to the offence :
Booking cars which enter the zone is tricky , [ PC James ]
Aveling says , as it's not illegal if they stop in one if a light turns red as they 're part - way in .
Officers thus have to watch a driver creep in on an already red light .
There are also rumours that some officers see the penalty for the infringement – six points on the licence the same as you 'd get for sailing all the way through the red light – as somewhat disproportionate .
So the offence comes under failure to stop at a red light .
Not so , says bike blog reader Nick Lane , who emailed us about another blog that mentioned the issue :
Cycle stop boxes are NOT legally enforceable , no points of fines can be levied against a vehicle entering or using one .
Therefore they are NOT illegal .
In 2004 I had a lengthy correspondence with a chief inspector of road policy policing in which I queried why officers were not fining or awarding penalty points to motorists who compromised [ advanced stop line ] boxes .
His reply on each occasion was emphatic - it is not an offence and therefore they cannot take action .
He advised that I should not interpret the Highway Code as a set of laws attached to which were penalties , but rather as a set of guidelines .
Can that really be true ?
What is the point of saying in the Highway Code that drivers " MUST " not do something if there is no sanction for transgression ?
If that is correct , it 's no wonder so many people do it .
The preface to the Highway Code suggests that the chief inspector is wrong .
It states :
Many of the rules in the code are legal requirements , and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence .
You may be fined , given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from driving .
In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison .
Such rules are identified by the use of the words ' MUST / MUST NOT '.
For chapter and verse on the subject I called the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) ( they ought to know , right ? ) .
After a day on the case , the press officer got back to me to say that nobody at ACPO knew the answer .
She suggested I contact the Department for Transport ( DfT ) .
So I did .
At last some clarity .
The DfT said that driving into a bike zone when the lights are red is an offence .
It carries a £ 60 penalty and three points on your driving licence ( maximum £ 1,000 fine if it goes to court ) .
Police have some discretion over which bit of the Road Traffic
Act to use , but most likely it will fall under " Failure to comply with a traffic sign or road marking " .
So driving into a bike zone when the lights are red is illegal .
Although there is apparently a great deal of confusion among the police themselves .
One thing is for sure .
Booking drivers for this offence is not a priority .
After a decade in which points and yards hit record highs and turnovers hit record lows across the NFL , defenses are searching for answers .
T.J. Watt is providing them .

Hello Jason / Trinity — love your site , I ’m not an anonymous coward , but read in PC World that you and partner Alex Shamash were formerly principals in “ Trinity Acquisitions Inc ” and “ Secure Software ” —
Is it true C2Media , LOP.com & “ Fla Internet Marketing Inc ” are your current spyware / malware companies used for “ data mining ” or spying on people ?
I ’m new to this NWO stuff … do your posts cover Tavistock Behavioral Research Institute and ( SRI ) Stanford Research Institute ?
Thanks in advance for setting the record straight .
SITREP : Jason Lucas / Alex Shamash are contract agents for Military Industrial Complex who ( 1 ) previously were principals in “ Secure Software ” and “ Trinity Aquisitions Inc ” arecurrently in joint ownership of “ Fla Internet Marketing Inc ” — a data mining business ( 2 ) GLP is masquerading as a place for people who are fed up w / global mgt team , to share info , when in reality Jason ( a.k.a. Trinity ) is compiling lists , turned over to Dept. of Defense ( DoD ) and at some point , will be classified as “ undesirables ” and “ enemy combatants ”
3 ) Jason Lucas & Alex Shamash own “ spyware ” companies ” ( 4 ) C2 Media is a CIA - front org w/ offices in IL , CO , TX , VA , NY , WA , OR , CA and Canada ( 5 ) Jason is a middleware sofware designer working w/ DoD , Joint Forces Command ( JFCom ) on system that will co-ordinate movements of Monarch Prog Multiples , using Virtual 3D imagery , Remote Neural Monitoring via EEG Evoked Potentials , utilizing all three NSA platforms ( SIGINT , COMINT , HUMINT )
The military apparratus displayed within TENA training manuals / visuals is a thinly veiled cover for army of Monarch Multiples — MK ’s they are the weapons in their arsenal .
This will give Military Industrial Complex ability to broadcast directly into audio / visual cortex of the brain — basically a huge megaphone heard simultaneously .
RFID ( Verichip ) implanted Monarch Units , as well as civilians , will feel the effect of “ having a song stuck in your head ” Signals will originate from NSA , transfer to GWEN towers , strategically placed throughout CONUS .
MKs have enhanced audio / visual capabilities — this system will allow on - line , real - time retrieval of images stored in audio / visual cortex , as well as transmitting coded intel to individual or groups of MK’s — the days of physically reporting for de-briefings are being phased out .
Easiest way to decode TENA is to substitute MK ’s for weaponry .

ITK7 : Jason Lucas , Alex Shamash , Congress , Dept. of Defense ( DoD ) , U.S. Joint Forces Command , MI6 , CIA , NSA and the rest of the “ spook ” community do n’t want you to know about MK - Ultra Monarch Mind Control Prog and its “ brainchild ” – – hiding behind the false banner of “ national security ” …
Tavistock has been all over the web for years , despite several name changes , the goal of its founders remains the same — condition the masses ( useless eaters ) to accept servitude — “ a slave is easier to control , if he does n’t know he ’s a slave ”
In 1920 , Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology ( TIMP ) was founded , renamed Tavistock Clinic , Tavistock Institute of Human Relations , currently known as Tavistock Behavioral Research Institute .
This was only a “ formal ” coming out .
Rothschild Dynasty funded Sigmond Freud ( about 1909 - 1912 ) and a team of Nazi mind scientists , set them up i n lavish estate to conduct “ mind science ” research .
Under the guise of “ providing assistance to wives of SS members ” , SS Himmler used these as breeding camps .
Orphanages were set up as holding pens , children were shipped to Germany for “ Germanization ” or “ re-education ” — read : subjected to horrific torture sessions in order to cause “ mind splitting ” ( DID - MPD ) in their twisted efforts to create army of human robots .
The generic description of “ experiments ” is deceptive , as it masks the “ purpose ” of the ( SRA ) satanic ritual abuse — those who could not withstand the torture , were ritually sacrificed under the Occult - Nazi death symbol — the swastika …
Origins : Rothschild Dynasty financed John D. Rockefeller in the oil industry , they planned to control — taught him ruthless business model for Standard Oil “ competition is a sin ” — through treachery and deceit became Exxon - Mobil ( 1911 Supreme Court mandated break up was a sham … ” you want us to break up the co .? oh this is awful ” ( * wink - wink * ) – each co. grew independently , when re-assembled , single entity was worth much more .
Rothchild ’s had almost two centuries of money manipulation when Rocky came along , and viewed him as a young upstart ( easy to control ) Rothschild used Rocky as cover for “ formal ” coming out of Tavistock .
The grant from Rocky , was Rothschild stake in their mind science plot to have earth ’s citizens serve them as perpetual monarchy …it ’s worked exceedingly well .
The formalization began w / these doctors ( not going to name all ) Elliott Jaques , Henry Dicks , Leonard Browne , Ronald Hargreaves , John Rawlings Rees ( Dir .
In 1932 became founder of World Federation for Mental Health in 1948 ) Mary Luff , Wilfred Bion and Tommy Wilson as Chrmn — others joined later John D. Sutherland , John Bowlby , Eric Trist , Fred Emery .
Tavistock joined Kurt Lewin and his Research Center for Group Dynamics ( RCGD ) at Univ. of Michigan , published an international journal , “ Human Relations ” relating theory to practice – 1st vol .
“ Overcoming Resistance to Change , ” & “ A Comparison of the Aims of the Hitler Youth and the Boy Scouts of America . ” Tavistock Institute used Lewin ’s techniques to arrange “ therapeutic communities . ” [ we call them “ 12 step programs ” the first of the 12 steps calls for the following declaration : “ We admit we are powerless over our addiction ” to alcohol [ drugs , gambling , sex ] — that our lives have become unmanageable ” — the sheer insanity of waking up everyday making negative affirmations about oneself and having this reinforced in group settings !
Any first year psychology major knows repetition is how the mind is conditioned , it ’s how you train your children … Ed . ]
In 1932 Lewin came to U.S. for concentration in child psychology .
During WW2 he was an agent U.S. Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) psychological warfare Division — which became CIA PsyOps …
Rees developed “ Tavistock Method ” which induces and controls stress via “ psychologically controlled environments ” in order to make people give up firmly held beliefs under “ peer pressure . ”
Wilfrid Bion pioneered “ Group Dynamics ”
In April 11 , 1933 , Rockefeller Foundation Pres .
Max Mason assured trustees that in their program , “ the Social Sciences ” will concern themselves w/rationalization of social control — the control of human behavior ” [ or MIND CONTROL ]
This declaration led to a Rockefeller grant that resulted in the birth of the “ Tavistock Institute of Human Relations ” in Rothschild controlled City of London in 1947 .
( see Empire States : Geostrategic Power Centers Pt. 1 ) This was 1yr after National Security Agency ( NSA ) was created , to provide the secrecy needed for these evil mind scientists under the banner of “ national security ” .
In 1935 , Harvard psychologist ( 1930 - 1967 ) Gordon Allport co-authored The Psychology Of Radio with Hadley Cantril .
In 1940 , Cantril wrote The Invasion From Mars : A Study In The Psychology Of Panic regarding radio broadcast of H.G. Wells ’
The War Of The Worlds [ masterful fear - based trauma , mind control Op , so successful , it caused mass hysteria / panic in the streets , as Americans believed country was under attack by Martian invaders — today it ’s fear of Islamic fundamentalism , tactics do n’t change … it ’s a formula ]

This morning ’s New York Times thumbsucker about Obama ’s “ arm twisting ” of BP is a masterpiece of pussyfooting , takebacks and special pleading for corporations .
It ’s full of passages like this :
The Wall Street executives who needed the government to prop them up , but still thought their services were worth millions a year , were cast by Mr. Obama as a shameless privileged class .
Toyota was described as seeking profits over safety ;
Wellpoint , the insurance giant , was castigated for seeking to insulate itself from the new health care legislation by taking actions that the law will soon prohibit .
Obviously , Wall Street was n’t shameless and privileged until Obama called them that .
Similarly , the problem with Toyota was n’t that its cars were killing people , it was his description of how their cars were killing people .
The conclusion of this piece is equally risible .
Obama must be very careful about delicate corporate feelings , otherwise we risk the following :
[ … ] [ H]e will have to avoid painting with such a broad brush that foreign and domestic investors come to view the United States as a too risky place to do business , a country where big mistakes can lead to vilification and , perhaps , bankruptcy .
In short , our best bet is to act like some third world shithole that bends over backwards to get a little corporate investment , no matter what the cost .
It ’s no coincidence that this front - page news analysis piece was written the Times ’ chief Washington correspondent , David Sanger .
For the DC Press Corpse , the “ rule of law ” is a quaint notion that went out at the turn of the century .
Mr. Sarkozy said , “ This crime committed against Michel Germaneau will not go unpunished . ”
A retired engineer , Mr. Germaneau had been working for a humanitarian association when he was abducted in late April .
His captors demanded freedom for Qaeda prisoners in France and elsewhere in exchange for his release .
On July 11 , the group threatened to kill him if its conditions were not met within 15 days .

French officials , however , said the group had never offered more than vague demands and refused all efforts to negotiate .
Mr. Germaneau ’s death was “ not preceded by the slightest beginnings of a dialogue with French or local authorities , ” Mr. Sarkozy said .
Al Qaeda ’s ultimatum , he said , was “ in fact no more than the announcement of a scheduled killing . ”
On Sunday , Al Jazeera broadcast an audio recording attributed to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb that announced Mr. Germaneau ’s death .
The French Defense Ministry said it authenticated the recording on Monday .
“ Sarkozy was unable to free his compatriot through this failed operation , but he definitely opened one of the gates of hell on himself , his people and his nation , ” said a man identified in the audio as Abu Musab Abdel - Wadoud , a leader of the abductors .
Two Ugandan nuns , Sisters Nanteza and Rita , were arrested this week for growing weed on the grounds of their convent , which they told police was used for farm animals .
Natenza attacked the officers for entering the convent without her permission .
A Ugandan newspaper , The New Vision , spoke with Masaka district Police commander Titus Byaruhanga , who said his officers entered the convent on a tip - off .
Sister Nanteza was having none of it and attacked the police .
She was then taken to the local police station , where she said , " You bypassed us without saying anything .
What if you got a problem here , whose fault would it be ? "
The BBC reports that an entire acre of the convent 's land was being used to grow .
The nuns told police they were growing the plants for pigs and other farm animals , but that it was definitely not for sale .
Police have yet to charge anyone , and have questioned two " porters " who were on the scene at the time of the bust .
So what the hell do farm animals do with weed ?

The day after the election announcement , several newspapers featured front - page photos of the Prime Minister , garbed all in white , and her ( male ) deputy - each bearing an exceptionally robust looking , if slightly bemused , white infant in their arms .
If the central issue of the election is population , these images of the - reconstructed and thoroughly contemporary - white heterosexual family underscore that the lowering of the birth rate is off the agenda .
The images are a powerful reminder of the importance of the ' ' natural '' reproduction of the nation , marking the limits of this '' debate ' ' on population .
In fact , of course , far from being simply natural , or a matter of individual choice , the manipulation and regulation of women 's fertility - through policies relating to subsidies ( the ' ' baby bonus ' ' ) , maternity leave , childcare , educational allowances as well as the broader social web of attitudes to sexuality , family and marriage - are all part of what Michel Foucault dubbed biopolitics .
The biopolitical , being that which shapes and orders the life and health of the population , is always explicitly or implicitly about shaping and maintaining its racial composition .
The ideal of the remade white heterosexual Australian family represented by Gillard and Wayne Swan at a baby welcome ceremony reaffirms the way in which the reproduction of the population is inextricably bound up with the reproduction of an established political and social order .
The image stages an unspoken but unmistakeable return to the defining characteristic of Australia as a nation - state built on whiteness , and dedicated to the reproduction of the racial order established at Federation .
Within this order , non - white bodies may be present , and even attain positions of relative power and prominence ; however , their presence is one that must remain subject to continuing containment , subordination or assimilation .
Although population has been explicitly identified as the defining issue of the 2010 campaign , it is somewhat misleading to assume that this is a first : historically , official inquiries , debates and policies of successive governments have directly and indirectly addressed the issue of population as a question of the racial reproduction of the nation .
In 1903 , two years after Federation , the NSW Commission into the Decline of the Birthrate linked concern for falling births with the racial '' threat from the north ' ' .
In succeeding years , Australia defined itself by practices of social engineering designed to '' breed out the colour ' ' of certain Aboriginal groups and by programs to promote the fertility of white women while discouraging that of Aboriginal , Asian and Pacific Islander women .
In the postwar period , slogans such as ' ' populate or perish '' encapsulate the linkage between race and reproduction .
These years were marked also by prohibitions against the circulation of racially marked goods and peoples across national borders .
Labor 's history of protectionism and racially exclusive trade unionism is one part of this story that has been conveniently forgotten , yet such histories return in contemporary form in the restrictions on temporary work visas and international students , as well as the frenzy over boat arrivals .
There are an awful lot of characters in superhero comics , and in today 's fast - paced world of retcons and alternate universes , sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of who everyone is , if that 's still who they are , whether they 're alive , or if perhaps it turns out they never existed at all .

How to Influence People
• Next article in this series : The Persuasive Power of Swearing • Previous article :
Central to the art and science of persuasion is understanding three goals for which everyone is aiming .
The art and science of persuasion is often discussed as though changing people ’s minds is about using the right arguments , the right tone of voice or the right negotiation tactic .
But effective influence and persuasion is n’t just about patter , body language or other techniques , it ’s also about understanding people ’s motivations .
In the scrabble to explain technique , it ’s easy to forget that there are certain universal goals of which , at least some of the time , we are barely aware .
Influence and persuasion attempts must tap into these to really gain traction .
Techniques of persuasion
To illustrate these universal goals , let ’s have a look at six common techniques of influence that you ’ll have come across either explicitly or implicitly ( from Cialdini , 2001 ) :
Liking :
It ’s much easier to influence someone who likes you .
Successful influencers try to flatter and uncover similarities in order to build attraction .
Social proof .
People like to follow one another , so influencers imply the herd is moving the same way .
Consistency .
Most people prefer to keep their word .
If people make a commitment , particularly if it ’s out loud or in writing , they are much more likely to keep it .
Influencers should try to gain verbal or written commitments .
Scarcity .
Even when companies have warehouses full of a product , they still advertise using time - limited offers that emphasise scarcity .
People want what they can’t have , or at least what might be running short .
Authority .
People are strongly influenced by experts .
Successful influencers flaunt their knowledge to establish their expertise .
Reciprocity .
Give something to get something .
When people feel indebted to you they are more likely to agree to what you want .
This feeling could arise from something as simple as a compliment .
There are many more , but these six are often quoted , especially in business circles .
The reason these work is that they tap into three basic human goals , and it ’s these goals that are the key to understanding how to influence and persuade people ( from Cialdini and Goldstein , 2004 ) .
1. Goal of affiliation
In the most part humans are social so they want to be liked .
Rejection is no fun and we ’ll do almost anything to avoid it .
We reciprocate because it sends a message about our sociability .
We try to elicit liking from other people by behaving in ways we guess will be attractive , like agreeing with them or complimenting them .
Not only do we want approval from specific people , we also want it from society at large ( see this article on conformity ) .
We want the things we do , think and believe to be broadly in line with what others do , think and believe .
It ’s not impossible to be different , but it is difficult .
The techniques of liking and reciprocity mentioned above both clearly play on our desire for affiliation , as do many other techniques of persuasion and influence .
Most people are joiners and followers so influencers like to give us something to join and someone to follow .
2. Goal of accuracy
People who do n’t care about doing things correctly never get anywhere in life .
To achieve our goals in what is a complicated world , we have to be continually trying to work out the best course of action .
It could be accuracy in social situations , such as how to deal with the boss or how to make friends , or it could be accuracy in financial matters like how to get a good deal , or it could be accuracy in existential matters .
Whatever the arena , people are always striving for the ‘ right ’ answer .
Influencers understand our need to be right and so they try to offer things that appeal to our need for accuracy .
For example , experts or authority figures influence people heavily because they offer us a ‘ correct ’ view or way of doing things , especially one that we do n’t have to think too carefully about .
The techniques of social proof and scarcity both nag at our desire to be accurate because we assume other people are likely to be right and we do n’t want to miss out on a bargain .
3 . Goal of maintaining positive self - concept
People want to protect their view of themselves because it takes a long time to build up a semi-coherent view of oneself and one ’s place in the world .
We work hard to keep our world - views intact : we want to maintain our self - esteem , to continue believing in the things we believe in and to honour whatever commitments we have espoused in the past .
In an inconsistent world we at least should be self - consistent .
Persuaders and influencers can leverage this goal by invoking our sense of self - consistency .
A trivial but instructive example is the foot - in - the - door technique .
This is where an influencer asks you to agree to a small request before asking for a bigger one .
Because people feel somehow that it would be inconsistent to agree to one request and then refuse the next one , they want to say yes again .
People will go to surprising lengths to maintain their positive view of themselves .
Unconscious motivators
Everybody wants to be accurate , to affiliate with others and to maintain their concept of themselves , however little awareness we might have of these goals .
Effective persuasion and influence attempts can target one or more of these goals .
With these goals in mind it is possible to tailor persuasion attempts to the particular characteristics of an audience , rather than relying on transparent generic techniques .
Whether it ’s at work , dealing with your boss , or at home negotiating with a neighbour , we can all benefit from thinking about other people ’s unconscious motivators .
Then we can work out how to align our message with their goals .

The Only Wheelchair with Robotic Arms Birthplace University of Pittsburgh Occupation Nurse : transports and feeds patients with spinal - cord injuries Why We Need It Today 4.3 million Americans rely on wheelchairs , yet few of those chairs are ideal for people with debilitating physical impairments , such as those of a quadriplegic .
How It Works After Rory A. Cooper was partially paralyzed during a bicycle accident , he learned firsthand the limitations of conventional wheelchairs .
Although he still had the use of his arms , many other paralyzed people he met did not .
So he set out to build them a better chair .
His Personal Mobility and Manipulation Appliance ( PerMMA ) features two robotic arms programmed to help users easily perform everyday tasks like cooking , dressing and shopping .
Users can control the robotic arms from a touchpad , microphone or joystick , depending on their abilities .
For now , each arm can support six pounds , but Cooper is designing a new arm strong enough to hold 150 pounds , pull a turkey out of the oven , or pick up a pot of spaghetti off the stove , he says .

Scientific contact : Michael Crommie , 510-642-9392
Graphene , the extraordinary form of carbon that consists of a single layer of carbon atoms , has produced another in a long list of experimental surprises .
In the July 30 , 2010 issue of the journal Science , a multi-institutional team of researchers headed by Michael Crommie , a faculty senior scientist in the Materials Sciences Division at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley , reports the creation of pseudo - magnetic fields far stronger than the strongest magnetic fields ever sustained in a laboratory – just by putting the right kind of strain onto a patch of graphene .
“ We have shown experimentally that when graphene is stretched to form nanobubbles on a platinum substrate , electrons behave as if they were subject to magnetic fields in excess of 300 tesla , even though no magnetic field has actually been applied , ” says Crommie .
“ This is a completely new physical effect that has no counterpart in any other condensed matter system . ”
Crommie notes that “ for over 100 years people have been sticking materials into magnetic fields to see how the electrons behave , but it ’s impossible to sustain tremendously strong magnetic fields in a laboratory setting . ”
The current record is 85 tesla for a field that lasts only thousandths of a second .
When stronger fields are created , the magnets blow themselves apart .
The ability to make electrons behave as if they were in magnetic fields of 300 tesla or more – just by stretching graphene – offers a new window on a source of important applications and fundamental scientific discoveries going back over a century .
This is made possible by graphene ’s electronic behavior , which is unlike any other material’s .
A carbon atom has four valence electrons ; in graphene ( and in graphite , a stack of graphene layers ) , three electrons bond in a plane with their neighbors to form a strong hexagonal pattern , like chicken - wire .
The fourth electron sticks up out of the plane and is free to hop from one atom to the next .
The latter pi-bond electrons act as if they have no mass at all , like photons .
They can move at almost one percent of the speed of light .
The idea that a deformation of graphene might lead to the appearance of a pseudo - magnetic field first arose even before graphene sheets had been isolated , in the context of carbon nanotubes ( which are simply rolled - up graphene ) .
In early 2010 , theorist Francisco Guinea of the Institute of Materials Science of Madrid and his colleagues developed these ideas and predicted that if graphene could be stretched along its three main crystallographic directions , it would effectively act as though it were placed in a uniform magnetic field .
This is because strain changes the bond lengths between atoms and affects the way electrons move between them .
The pseudo - magnetic field would reveal itself through its effects on electron orbits .
In classical physics , electrons in a magnetic field travel in circles called cyclotron orbits .
These were named following Ernest Lawrence ’s invention of the cyclotron , because cyclotrons continuously accelerate charged particles ( protons , in Lawrence ’s case ) in a curving path induced by a strong field .
Viewed quantum mechanically , however , cyclotron orbits become quantized and exhibit discrete energy levels .
Called Landau levels , these correspond to energies where constructive interference occurs in an orbiting electron ’s quantum wave function .
The number of electrons occupying each Landau level depends on the strength of the field – the stronger the field , the more energy spacing between Landau levels , and the denser the electron states become at each level – which is a key feature of the predicted pseudo - magnetic fields in graphene .
A serendipitous discovery
Describing their experimental discovery , Crommie says , “ We had the benefit of a remarkable stroke of serendipity . ”
Crommie ’s research group had been using a scanning tunneling microscope to study graphene monolayers grown on a platinum substrate .
A scanning tunneling microscope works by using a sharp needle probe that skims along the surface of a material to measure minute changes in electrical current , revealing the density of electron states at each point in the scan while building an image of the surface .
Crommie was meeting with a visiting theorist from Boston University , Antonio Castro Neto , about a completely different topic when a group member came into his office with the latest data .
“ It showed nanobubbles , little pyramid - like protrusions , in a patch of graphene on the platinum surface , ” Crommie says , “ and associated with the graphene nanobubbles there were distinct peaks in the density of electron states . ”
Crommie says his visitor , Castro Neto , took one look and said , “ That looks like the Landau levels predicted for strained graphene . ”
Sure enough , close examination of the triangular bubbles revealed that their chicken - wire lattice had been stretched precisely along the three axes needed to induce the strain orientation that Guinea and his coworkers had predicted would give rise to pseudo - magnetic fields .
The greater the curvature of the bubbles , the greater the strain , and the greater the strength of the pseudo - magnetic field .
The increased density of electron states revealed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy corresponded to Landau levels , in some cases indicating giant pseudo - magnetic fields of 300 tesla or more .
“ Getting the right strain resulted from a combination of factors , ” Crommie says .
“ To grow graphene on the platinum we had exposed the platinum to ethylene ” – a simple compound of carbon and hydrogen – “ and at high temperature the carbon atoms formed a sheet of graphene whose orientation was determined by the platinum ’s lattice structure . ”
To get the highest resolution from the scanning tunneling microscope , the system was then cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero .
Both the graphene and the platinum contracted – but the platinum shrank more , with the result that excess graphene pushed up into bubbles , measuring four to 10 nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) across and from a third to more than two nanometers high .
To confirm that the experimental observations were consistent with theoretical predictions , Castro Neto worked with Guinea to model a nanobubble typical of those found by the Crommie group .
The resulting theoretical picture was a near - match to what the experimenters had observed : a strain - induced pseudo - magnetic field some 200 to 400 tesla strong in the regions of greatest strain , for nanobubbles of the correct size .
“ Controlling where electrons live and how they move is an essential feature of all electronic devices , ” says Crommie .
“ New types of control allow us to create new devices , and so our demonstration of strain engineering in graphene provides an entirely new way for mechanically controlling electronic structure in graphene .
The effect is so strong that we could do it at room temperature . ”
The opportunities for basic science with strain engineering are also huge .
For example , in strong pseudo - magnetic fields electrons orbit in tight circles that bump up against one another , potentially leading to novel electron - electron interactions .
Says Crommie , “ this is the kind of physics that physicists love to explore . ”
“ Strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields greater than 300 tesla in graphene nanobubbles , ” by Niv Levy , Sarah Burke , Kacey Meaker , Melissa Panlasigui , Alex Zettl , Francisco Guinea , Antonio Castro Neto , and Michael Crommie , appears in the July 30 , 2010 issue of Science and is available online to subscribers .

Rarely has there been such a direct connection between a game - changing public policy initiative and a series of record - breaking corporate investments in wind and solar energy .
The policy change ?
The passage of Ontario ’s Green Energy Act ( GEA ) .
The investments ?
First , Samsung C&T ’s $ 7 billion decision in January to build 2,500 MW of wind and solar generating capacity and four manufacturing plants in Ontario , Canada .
Second , the April announcement of 184 new private - sector green energy projects – including a 300 MW off - shore wind project in Lake Ontario – with a total value of approximately $ 9 billion .
What is even more remarkable is how quickly all this happened .
In May 2009 , the Ontario legislature passed the GEA .
Regulations were published in September .
Within six months , proposals were submitted and negotiations were completed for the largest green energy investments in Canadian history .
The landmark policy that changed everything
Designed specifically to accelerate the growth of wind , solar and other renewable energies , Ontario ’s GEA includes North America ’s first comprehensive Feed - In Tariff ( FIT ) program , a streamlined province - wide approvals process for new projects , domestic content requirements , conservation measures and smart grid investments .
The GEA is a core element of the Ontario government ’s broader vision to create a sustainable , low carbon cluster in Ontario that can supply growing North American and global markets with green energy and innovative energy technologies .
The passage of Ontario ’s GEA won rave reviews around the world from green energy advocates .
Stefan Gsänger , the World Wind Energy Association ’s Secretary General , described it as “ an historic international milestone ” and “ the most advanced piece of renewable energy legislation in North America . ”
Michael Eckhart , President of the American Council on Renewable Energy ( ACORE ) said , “ Ontario ’s Green Energy Act and supporting initiatives are the most comprehensive renewable energy policy entered anywhere in the world .
Most importantly , it builds on worldwide experience to date on ‘ what works ’ . ”
Energy developers moved quickly
Green energy companies across the spectrum began examining the opportunities offered by the GEA , particularly in combination with Ontario ’s strategic advantages as a North American centre for advanced manufacturing .
Throughout October and November , developers were putting together proposals .
There was a December submission deadline for the first round of contracts to be awarded under the FIT program .
By December 1 , 2009 , the Ontario Power Authority ( OPA ) received more than 1,000 applications and began reviewing them to see which were “ shovel - ready . ”
On April 8 , 2010 , the OPA awarded the first contracts under the FIT program for large - scale projects ( those exceeding 500 kilowatts . )
In total they will generate almost 2,500 MW of green energy .
Seventy - six of the projects are ground - mounted solar photovoltaic , 47 are on - shore wind and 46 are waterpower projects .
The remainder include biogas , biomass , landfill gas , rooftop solar projects and one off - shore wind project .
A month earlier , on March 10 , OPA announced 510 projects for mid-scale FIT projects ( 10 kW to 500kW ) with a total generating capacity of 112 MW .
Samsung recognizes the opportunity
Meanwhile , Samsung C&T was also moving quickly .
Negotiations with the province began in late 2009 .
In January 2010 , Samsung C&T and a Korean consortium announced they would make the largest renewable energy investment of its kind in the world , and they would make it in Ontario .
The agreement with Ontario commits Samsung and its consortium partners to constructing 2,500 MW of renewable energy generation – 2,000 MW of wind power and 500 MW of solar power .
It also commits them to establishing four manufacturing plants in Ontario : towers , blades , solar inverters and solar module assembly .
In return , the province guarantees the consortium will receive FIT rates for 20 years plus additional incentives contingent on the plants meeting operational schedules starting in 2013 .
“ Through some of the most progressive legislation in North America , Ontario has sent a powerful message that it wants renewable energy – and it wants it now , ” said Hagen Lee , Manager of Business Development and Government Relations , Samsung Renewable Energy .
“ Samsung C&T is proud to be part of an endeavour that will bring not just clean energy to Ontario households but an estimated 16,000 new jobs . ”
What brought Samsung to Ontario
Ontario ’s renewable energy sector has expanded rapidly in the past few years , driven in part by the province ’s commitment to eliminate coal - fired power by 2014 – the single largest climate change initiative in Canada .
The number of wind turbines in Ontario has grown from 10 in 2003 to more than 670 by the time the GEA regulations were announced in 2009 .
Wind output from Ontario ’s commercial wind farms reached 2.3 TWh in 2009 , a 60 % increase over the previous year .
The GEA was specifically designed to accelerate renewable energy production by offering generous FIT rates .
FIT payments for wind power , for example , are 13.5 cents per kilowatt - hour ( c / kWh ) for on - shore and 19.0 c / kWh for off - shore projects .
The FIT also includes both a price escalation clause linked to inflation over the 20 - year contract and a " price adder " to encourage the development of Aboriginal and community projects .
Domestic content requirements were incorporated to fuel the growth of green energy component manufacturing and service sector in Ontario .
Wind developers , for example , will be required to have a percentage of their costs come from Ontario goods and labour by the time the projects become operational .
The requirement starts at 25 % and increases to 50 % on January 1 , 2012 .
With Samsung ’s worldwide expertise in both manufacturing and renewable energy development , Ontario proved to be a good match .
What ’s next ?
The investments by Samsung and other companies are expected to significantly expand market opportunities all along the green energy supply chain .
Ontario is the manufacturing heartland of Canada .
These new investments will encourage major manufacturers to begin tooling up for a sustained commitment to supplying the growing sector with parts and technologies .
Manufacturers in Ontario can also bring to the renewable energy sector a wealth of expertise in advanced manufacturing drawn from the aerospace , automotive and electronics industries .
They also have experience in market - focused R&D .
Across the province , there are publicly funded R&D labs specializing in advanced materials , engineering and other fields related to renewable energy .
World leading companies from Magna International to Goodrich to Research In Motion ( RIM ) conduct R&D in Ontario , in part because of the research talent pool and in part because the R&D tax credits available in the province are among the most generous in the world .
Tax reform for energy companies and suppliers
To further stimulate business investment , Ontario has launched a comprehensive , multi- year tax reform program that covers corporate , personal and sales taxes .
As a result , the marginal effective tax rate on new investment has plummeted from 32.8 % in 2009 to 18.6 % in 2010 and will continue to drop to 16.2 % by 2018 .
These tax cuts are making Ontario one of the most tax competitive jurisdictions in the world for new investment .
Through tax reform , the GEA and massive investments in education and infrastructure , the government of Ontario is determined to leverage the economic winds of climate change , innovative energy technologies and globalization to fuel long - term , sustainable job creation and growth .
The strategy hinged on winning the support of global investors .
It ’s clearly working .

Military ’s hit list of enemy militants : Reality of Afghanistan conflict or war crime ?
When it comes to war , killing the enemy is an accepted fact .
Even amid the sensation of the WikiLeaks.org revelations , that stark reality lies at the core of new charges that some American military commando operations may have amounted to war crimes .
Among the thousands of pages of classified U.S. documents released Sunday by the whistle - blower website are nearly 200 incidents that involve Task Force 373 , an elite military special operations unit tasked with hunting down and killing enemy combatants in Afghanistan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Denouncing suggestions that U.S. troops are engaged in war crimes in Afghanistan , military officials and even war crimes experts said Monday that enemy hit lists , while ugly and uncomfortable , are an enduring and sometimes unavoidable staple of war .
Some , however , cautioned that without proper controls that mandate the protection of innocent civilians , such targeted hits could veer into criminal activities .
Buried in the documents are descriptions of Task Force 373 ’s missions , laying bare graphic violence as well as mistakes , questionable judgments and deadly consequences Ã¢â‚¬â€ sometimes under fire , other times not .
In June 2007 , the unit went in search of Taliban commander Qari Ur- Rahman .
According to the files , U.S. forces , under the cover of night , engaged in a firefight with suspected insurgents and called in an AC - 130 gunship to take out the enemy .
Only later did they realize that seven of those killed and four of those wounded were Afghan National Police .
The incident was labeled a misunderstanding , due in part to problems with the Afghan forces conducting night operations .
ADVERTISEMENT
In another mission , members of Task Force 373 conducted a secret raid , hoping to snag al - Qaida commander Abu Laith al - Libi , who was believed to be running terrorist training camps in Pakistan ’s border region .
Five rockets were launched into a group of buildings , and when forces moved into the destroyed area they found six dead insurgents and seven dead children .
Al - Libi was not among the dead .
The summary of the incident says initial checks showed no indications that children would be there .
And it quotes an Afghan governor later saying that while the residents there were in shock , they “ understand it was caused ultimately by the presence of hoodlums Ã¢â‚¬â€  the people think it is good that bad men were killed . ”
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who organized the release of the classified documents , said he believes these are among “ thousands ” of U.S. attacks in Afghanistan that could be investigated for evidence of war crimes , although he acknowledged such claims would have to be tested in court .
ADVERTISEMENT
But even activists well versed in the realm of investigating war crimes would not go that far .
“ I do n’t think this incident rises to the level of a war crime , but it disturbs me greatly that seven children were killed , ” said Tom Parker , policy director at Amnesty International USA .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Afghanistan war , with its terrorist hit lists , counterinsurgency battles and high - tech battle gear , presents difficult questions .
“ It is really hard to know where assassination ends and war starts , ” said Parker .
Targeted military strikes , he said , are on the fringe of accepted military practice during an armed conflict .
“ This is a relatively new form of warfare that we ’re seeing now , ” he said .
“ The technology takes you to a different place and raises questions that just were n’t there 20 years ago .
A lot of these questions do n’t have answers Ã¢â‚¬â€ they have a test of acceptability . ”

Parker voiced concerns that have hounded the military , the administration and members of Congress over the past two years as the war has escalated :
How can the U.S. avoid civilian casualties that alienate the very population coalition forces are trying to win over in order to defeat the insurgency ?
“ This is a war .
The enemy is shooting at us , and we ’re shooting at them , ” said Rep. Adam Smith , D - Wash .
“ Are we really suggesting that while the Taliban plant suicide bombs , we should n’t try to kill anybody ? ”
Smith said U.S. troops are “ aggressively targeting ” the Taliban and al - Qaida but any “ condemnation of our troops is completely wrong and brutally unfair . ”
Congress and the military , he said , have already identified civilian casualties as a problem that must be corrected , and military leaders have adjusted their war tactics to try and minimize the killing of innocents .
Parker added that Americans may accept the idea of a military team going after an enemy general , but when it ’s reduced to a hit list of individuals ’ names , it becomes less palatable .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Personalization makes people uncomfortable , ” said Parker .
Still , trying to kill or capture enemy leaders “ is precisely what countries do when they are at war , ” argued Juan Zarate , former senior counterterrorism official in the Bush administration .
As the war in Afghanistan has dragged on , public support in the U.S. and abroad has begun to waver .
And the counterinsurgency Ã¢â‚¬â€ which pits U.S. forces against bands of militants rather than another nation ’s army Ã¢â‚¬â€ blurs the classic battle lines .
There also may be public confusion about the U.S. government ’s secret hit lists targeting militants .
ADVERTISEMENT
The military ’s target list is different from a separate list run by the CIA .
The two lists may contain some of the same names Ã¢â‚¬â€ Osama bin Laden , for instance Ã¢â‚¬â€  but they differ because the military and CIA operate under different rules .
While the military can only operate in a war zone , the CIA is allowed to carry out covert actions in countries where the U.S. is not at war .
The CIA ’s target list came under scrutiny recently when it was revealed that it now includes radical Muslim cleric Anwar al - Awlaki , an American citizen believed to be hiding in Yemen .
Al - Awlaki , who has emerged as a prominent al - Qaida recruiter , was added to the list after U.S. officials determined that he had shifted from encouraging attacks on the U.S. to planning and participating in them .
Also , the CIA uses unmanned aircraft to hunt down and kill terrorists in Pakistan ’s lawless border regions where the U.S. military does not operate .
The issue becomes murkier when elite military members participate in joint operations with CIA units .
In those cases , the military members are assigned to the civilian paramilitary units and operate under the CIA rules , which allow them to take on missions outside of a war zone .

Last December , Gen. David Petraeus , now the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , made it clear the military was going to increase its efforts to kill or capture enemy combatants considered irreconcilable .
Petraeus , who was then the head of U.S. Central Command , said more “ national mission force elements ” would be sent to Afghanistan this spring .
He appeared to be referring to such elite clandestine units as the Delta Force .
“ There ’s no question you ’ve got to kill or capture those bad guys that are not reconcilable , ” he told Congress .

An email from James Morley remarks :
Not sure if you saw this Congressional testimony from Robert Solow , but I thought it covered some familiar themes in a clearer and more concise way than I am currently capable of .
Oh , to be that lucid at 85 !
Or any age for that matter .
Yes .
Last time I saw him was at this conference where we appeared together on a panel discussing the causes of the crisis and the state of macroeconomics .
At one point during the conference , he was citing theorems from papers he had first read decades ago , in one case relying on work in the appendix , and from more contemporary work .
It was pretty impressive :
Building a Science of Economics for the Real World , Prepared Statement of Robert Solow Professor Emeritus , MIT , for the House Committee on Science and Technology Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight , July 20 , 2010 :
It must be unusual for this Committee , or any Congressional Committee , to hold a hearing that is directed primarily at an analytical question .
In this case , the question is about macroeconomics , the study of the growth and fluctuations of the broad national aggregates – national income , employment , the price level , and others – that are basic to our country ’s standard of living .
How are these fundamental aggregates determined , and how should we think about them ?
While these are tough analytical questions , it is clear that the answers have a direct bearing on the most important issues of public policy .
It may be unusual for the Committee to focus on so abstract a question , but it is certainly natural and urgent .
Here we are , still near the bottom of a deep and prolonged recession , with the immediate future uncertain , desperately short of jobs , and the approach to macroeconomics that dominates serious thinking , certainly in our elite universities and in many central banks and other influential policy circles , seems to have absolutely nothing to say about the problem .
Not only does it offer no guidance or insight , it really seems to have nothing useful to say .
My goal in the next few minutes is to try to explain why it has failed and is bound to fail .
Before I go on , there is something preliminary that I want to make clear .
I am generally a quite traditional mainstream economist .
I think that the body of economic analysis that we have piled up and teach to our students is pretty good ; there is no need to overturn it in any wholesale way , and no acceptable suggestion for doing so .
It goes without saying that there are important gaps in our understanding of the economy , and there are plenty of things we think we know that are n’t true .
That is almost inevitable .
The national – not to mention the world – economy is unbelievably complicated , and its nature is usually changing underneath us .
So there is no chance that anyone will ever get it quite right , once and for all .
Economic theory is always and inevitably too simple ; that can not be helped .
But it is all the more important to keep pointing out foolishness wherever it appears .
Especially when it comes to matters as important as macroeconomics , a mainstream economist like me insists that every proposition must pass the smell test : does this really make sense ?
I do not think that the currently popular DSGE models pass the smell test .
They take it for granted that the whole economy can be thought about as if it were a single , consistent person or dynasty carrying out a rationally designed , long - term plan , occasionally disturbed by unexpected shocks , but adapting to them in a rational , consistent way .
I do not think that this picture passes the smell test .
The protagonists of this idea make a claim to respectability by asserting that it is founded on what we know about microeconomic behavior , but I think that this claim is generally phony .
The advocates no doubt believe what they say , but they seem to have stopped sniffing or to have lost their sense of smell altogether .
This is hard to explain , but I will try .
Most economists are willing to believe that most individual " agents " – consumers investors , borrowers , lenders , workers , employers – make their decisions so as to do the best that they can for themselves , given their possibilities and their information .
Clearly they do not always behave in this rational way , and systematic deviations are well worth studying .
But this is not a bad first approximation in many cases .
The DSGE school populates its simplified economy – remember that all economics is about simplified economies just as biology is about simplified cells – with exactly one single combination worker - owner - consumer - everything - else who plans ahead carefully and lives forever .
One important consequence of this " representative agent " assumption is that there are no conflicts of interest , no incompatible expectations , no deceptions .
This all - purpose decision - maker essentially runs the economy according to its own preferences .
Not directly , of course : the economy has to operate through generally well - behaved markets and prices .
Under pressure from skeptics and from the need to deal with actual data , DSGE modelers have worked hard to allow for various market frictions and imperfections like rigid prices and wages , asymmetries of information , time lags , and so on .
This is all to the good .
But the basic story always treats the whole economy as if it were like a person , trying consciously and rationally to do the best it can on behalf of the representative agent , given its circumstances .
This can not be an adequate description of a national economy , which is pretty conspicuously not pursuing a consistent goal .
A thoughtful person , faced with the thought that economic policy was being pursued on this basis , might reasonably wonder what planet he or she is on .
An obvious example is that the DSGE story has no real room for unemployment of the kind we see most of the time , and especially now : unemployment that is pure waste .
There are competent workers , willing to work at the prevailing wage or even a bit less , but the potential job is stymied by a market failure .
The economy is unable to organize a win - win situation that is apparently there for the taking .
This sort of outcome is incompatible with the notion that the economy is in rational pursuit of an intelligible goal .
The only way that DSGE and related models can cope with unemployment is to make it somehow voluntary , a choice of current leisure or a desire to retain some kind of flexibility for the future or something like that .
But this is exactly the sort of explanation that does not pass the smell test .
Working out a story like this is not just an intellectual game , though no doubt it is a bit of that too .
To the extent that the observed economy is actually doing the best it can , given the circumstances , it is already adapting optimally to whatever expected or unexpected disturbances come along .
It can not do better .
It follows that conscious public policy can only make things worse .
If the government has better information than the representative agent has , then all it has to do is to make that information public .
If prices are imperfectly flexible , then the government can make them more flexible by attacking monopolies and weakening unions .
Actually this proposition is dubious on its own .
The point I am making is that the DSGE model has nothing useful to say about anti-recession policy because it has built into its essentially implausible assumptions the " conclusion " that there is nothing for macroeconomic policy to do .
I think we have just seen how untrue this is for an economy attached to a highly - leveraged , weakly - regulated financial system .
But I think it was just as visibly false in earlier recessions ( and in episodes of inflationary overheating ) that followed quite different patterns .
There are other traditions with better ways to do macroeconomics .
One can find other , more narrowly statistical , reasons for believing that the DSGE approach is not a good way to understand macroeconomic behavior , but this is not the time to go into them .
An interesting question remains as to why the macroeconomics profession led itself down this particular garden path .
Perhaps we can come to that later .
Recent debates about Arizona 's new immigration law have taken as self - evident that immigration restrictions are good policy , with the only question being which level of government should enforce the law , and how .
Yet the case for immigration restrictions is far from convincing .
Advocates of these restrictions rely on four possible arguments .
First , that immigration dilutes existing languages , religions , family values , cultural norms , and so on .
Second , that immigrants flock to countries with generous social welfare programs , leading to urban slums and inundated social networks .
Third , that immigration can harm the sending country if the departing immigrants are high - skilled labor .
Fourth , that immigration lowers the income of native , low - skill workers .
All of these arguments are wrong , overstated , or misguided .
Immigration may change cultural values or norms , but nothing suggests this is a negative .
Many societies flourish because they have incorporated new businesses , cultures , foods , and so on .
More important , immigrants normally assimilate to the pre-existing culture provided government policy does not segregate them from the rest of society .
In the past rich countries have incorporated large immigration flows with modest adjustment costs .
Many of these immigrants lived in difficult conditions at first , but within a generation they achieved middle class status or better .
The possibility that immigration puts pressure on the welfare state is a reasonable concern , although existing evidence does not suggest this is a major problem .
In any case , the possibility that a generous social safety net might encourage immigration is a reason to moderate this safety net , rather than a reason to restrict immigration .
Indeed , expanded immigration might create pressure to keep the welfare state modest .
The risk that immigration drains high - skilled labor from poor countries is real , but this kind of immigration has positive impacts on the sending country that mitigate against any negatives .
The possibility of migration to a high - wage country generates an incentive to acquire , and only some of those educated actually leave .
The threat of a brain drain nudges poor countries away from bad policies - such as excessive tax rates - that generate the brain drain in the first place .
Many immigrants send remittances to friends or relatives in their country of origin .
Plus , if borders were really open , many immigrants would seek education abroad but return to their home country , knowing they could leave if economic factors so dictated .
Similarly , with open borders many immigrants would pursue temporary stays in higher wage countries .
Temporary migration is common in many countries now , and was common in the U.S. before the tightening of immigration rules in the 1910s and 1920s .
Temporary migration raises fewer of the standard concerns than permanent migration , while still helping many people in low - wage countries .
Concern for the poor , assuming this includes the poor in other countries , argues for vastly expanded immigration since many potential immigrants are much poorer than the natives whose wages they might depress .
Only a bizarre view of equity favors people earning the minimum wage in rich countries over people near starvation in developing countries .
The conclusion that open borders is the best immigration policy is all the stronger because attempts to restrict immigration have their own negatives .
These include the direct costs of border controls , the creation of a violent black market for immigration , and incentives for corruption .
Further , immigration may have beneficial effects on by fostering and introducing new ideas , approaches , business models , products , and so on .
At the same time , many people in receiving countries enjoy the influence of new cultures .
Immigrants also work at jobs for which the native supply is small .
Reasonable people can argue that immigration should increase gradually to moderate the transition costs .
But any reasonable balancing implies vastly expanded immigration relative to current levels .
This would improve the welfare of poor people in other countries far more than foreign aid .
What Darwin Got Wrong by Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piattelli -Palmarini Farrar , Straus and Giroux , 264 pp. , $ 26.00
Nothing creates more misunderstanding of the results of scientific research than scientists ’ use of metaphors .
It is not only the general public that they confuse , but their own understanding of nature that is led astray .
The most famous and influential example is Darwin ’s invention of the term “ natural selection , ” which , he wrote in On the Origin of Species ,
is daily and hourly scrutinising , throughout the world , every variation , even the slightest ; rejecting that which is bad , preserving and adding up all that is good … .
Darwin , quite explicitly , derived this understanding of the motivating force underlying evolution from the actions of plant and animal breeders who consciously choose variant individuals with desirable properties to breed for future generations .
“ Natural ” selection is human selection writ large .
But of course , whatever “ nature ” may be , it is not a sentient creature with a will , and any attempt to understand the actual operation of evolutionary processes must be freed of its metaphorical baggage .
Unfortunately , even modern evolutionary biologists , as well as theorists of human social and psychological phenomena who have used organic evolution as a model for general theories of their own subjects , are not always conscious of the dangers of the metaphor .
Alfred Russel Wallace , the coinventor of our understanding of evolution , wrote to Darwin in July 1866 warning him that even “ intelligent persons ” were taking the metaphor literally .
The modern skeletal formulation of evolution by natural selection consists of three principles that provide a purely mechanical basis for evolutionary change , stripped of its metaphorical elements :
(1) The principle of variation : among individuals in a population there is variation in form , physiology , and behavior .
(2) The principle of heredity : offspring resemble their parents more than they resemble unrelated individuals .
(3) The principle of differential reproduction : in a given environment , some forms are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other forms .
Evolutionary change is then the mechanical consequence of variation in heritable differences between individuals whenever those differences are accompanied by differences in survival and reproduction .
The evolution that can occur is limited by the available genetic variation , so in order to explain long - term continued evolution of quite new forms we must also add a fourth principle :
(4) The principle of mutation : new heritable variation is constantly occurring .
The trouble with this outline is that it does not explain the actual forms of life that have evolved .
There is an immense amount of biology that is missing .
It says nothing about why organisms with the evolved characteristic were more likely to survive or reproduce than those with the original one .
Why , …
Controversial free and open source software luminary Richard Stallman will hit Australia for an unknown period of time in October , with a keynote scheduled to be held at the University of New South Wales .
The software developer and political activist is best known for his creation during the early 1980 ’s of the GNU Project , which combined with Linus Torvalds ’ kernel programming efforts in the early 1990 ’s to form what we today refer to as the Linux operating system .
Stallman also founded the associated Free Software Foundation in the mid-1980 ’s and is the original author of a bunch of popular software projects — such as the Emacs text editor ( although it does far more than that ) and the GNU Compiler Collection .
The Australian Computer Society has a listing on its events page detailing Stallman ’s talk planned at UNSW ’s Clancy Auditorium on Monday 11 October from 6 pm .
The event is being supported by National ICT Australia .
The topic of the talk is “ Free software in ethics and practice ” , with the ACS stating that Stall would talk about his home ground — the free software movement .
It ’s not known what else Stallman has planned for his visit down under , but the activist is hardly apathetic towards Australia .
On 26 June he noted on his political news page that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had been ousted by Julia Gillard after controversy over the Federal Government ’s new mining tax .
“ I have no love for Rudd , who wanted to impose filtering on the Internet , ” wrote Stallman at the time .
“ ( Maybe the new Prime Minister , Gillard , does too . ) ”
“ What is clear is that she ’s an opportunist who is willing to bow down to business .
Australians were fools to be taken in by business threats . ”
Earlier in June he claimed that Europe , Russia and Australia were pushing for “ a corrupt scheme for counting CO2 emissions from forests ” , and he also referred to the idea of carefully controlled grazing schemes in countries such as Australia .
On 24 May , in a post entitled “ slippery slope of zealousy ” , Stallman noted that Australia ’s Customs service had imposed searches on laptops of international travellers , demanding that they declare whether they were carrying pornography .
“ It will be hard for them even to know the answer .
Worse , it is an opportunity for further government censorship , ” Stallman wrote .

Review of deaths between 1921 and 2007 shows inequality is increasing with the poorest more likely to die younger
The gap between the health of the rich and the poor is greater now than at any time since records began , research has shown .
Government initiatives over the past few decades have done little or nothing to close the gap between the life expectancy of poor people compared with those who are wealthy .
A review of deaths between 1921 and 2007 showed inequality between the rich and poor has been increasing , especially in relation to premature deaths .
People in the most deprived areas are much more likely to die younger than those in the richest , and things are no better than during the economic depression of the 1930s , the study found .
Writing online in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Bristol , said : " The last time in the long economic record that inequalities were almost as high was in the lead up to the economic crash of 1929 and the economic depression of the 1930s , " researchers said .
But they warned that things could be about to become even worse , with the economic downturn of the past couple of years impacting on the health of Britain 's poorest .
" The economic crash of 2008 might precede even greater inequalities in mortality between areas in Britain , " they said .
While rates of rising inequalities may have been slowed " some underlying factors , such as unemployment , have been rising rapidly over the course of those two years [ 2008 and 2009 ] .
Furthermore , in absolute numbers , unemployment has increased fastest in the poorest areas . "
By 2007 , for every 100 people under 65 dying in the best - off areas , 199 were dying in the poorest .
The researchers added : " This is the highest relative inequality recorded since at least 1921 . "
Among under -75s , for every 100 people dying in the best - off areas , 188 were dying in the poorest .
" Recent government interventions have aimed to reduce these inequalities , but , the evidence suggests , to little effect , " experts said .
They analysed death rates in England and Wales from the Office for National Statistics , and for Scotland from the General Register Office for Scotland .
The data on under -75s was from 1990 to 2007 and from 1921 for under -65s .
Dr Vivienne Nathanson , head of science and ethics at the British Medical Association ( BMA ) , said : " This paper provides an insight into the extent of health inequalities in the UK and how much needs to be done to address this issue .
" We need to look at the causes of ill health to really make a difference .
" Doctors will need to work across sectors to point out the health impacts of policy decisions . "
Health minister Anne Milton said : " The government has made it clear that tackling health inequalities is a priority .
We need a new approach to improve the health of the poorest , fastest .
One that works across government to include factors that affect health that lie outside the NHS , such as poverty , housing , education and the environment .
" We need to step up our efforts to improve the health of the poorest .
We have already set out how we want to see the NHS , doctors and local government working together to improve the health of those who need it most .
" Later this year we will publish a public health white paper , which will incorporate wider proposals to improve the public health of the nation . "
Washington , D.C. , Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee fired 241 teachers Friday under a new evaluation system that holds teachers accountable for student test scores .
She also put an additional 17 % on notice that if they do n't improve next year , they could lose their jobs .
The move to oust 6 % of the system 's 4,300 teachers is the most drastic ...

PA outraged over Arab League secretary - general visit to Gaza
As Hamas prepares to mark the third anniversary of its violent takeover of the Gaza Strip , Palestinian Authority officials in the West Bank voiced deep concern over what they described as attempts to “ legitimize ” the Islamist movement ’s “ coup .
” A PA official in Ramallah said on Tuesday that the flotilla incident two weeks ago had played into the hands of Hamas .
“ The [ Israeli ] assault on the aid ships on May 31 has boosted Hamas , ” the official said .
“ It came as gift from heaven to Hamas .
” The official said that while the PA supported the lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip , it was worried that such a move would further embolden Hamas and its allies in Damascus and Teheran .
“ We must prevent Hamas from benefiting from the [ flotilla ] incident , ” the official said .
“ We want to see the blockade on the Gaza Strip lifted .
But at the same time we must be careful not to allow Hamas to reap the fruits and consolidate its control over the Gaza Strip .
” The PA is said to be outraged over a visit to the Gaza Strip earlier this week by Arab League Secretary - General Amr Moussa .
“ This visit legitimizes the Hamas coup , ” another official said .
“ We need to remind the Arab world and the international community that Hamas seized control over the Gaza Strip through a bloody and violent coup .
” PA President Mahmoud Abbas , who met separately in Sharm e-Sheikh on Tuesday with Moussa and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , reportedly relayed to them his deep concern over attempts to recognize Hamas ’s authority in the Gaza Strip .
Abbas announced after the meetings that he was prepared to form a new government if Hamas accepted an Egyptian initiative to solve the crisis between the movement and his ruling Fatah faction .
“ If Hamas signs the [ Egyptian ] document , we would have no objections to the establishment of a caretaker or a technocratic or independent government that would receive the funds needed to rebuild the Gaza Strip , ” Abbas said .
“ We are prepared to discuss with Hamas all of its demands , but only after it signs the Egyptian document .
” Azzam al - Ahmed , a senior Fatah official and advisor to Abbas , called on Hamas not to be “ deluded by imaginary victories ” – a reference to the movement ’s violent takeover of the Gaza Strip and the flotilla incident .
He said that lifting the blockade should be linked to efforts to end the power struggle between Hamas and Fatah .
“ The solution to the lifting of the blockade lies in ending the state of schism and achieving Palestinian national unity , ” al - Ahmed told reporters in Ramallah .
“ We need to be united so that we can have one law , one homeland and one people to face Israeli crimes .
” He said that he and other Fatah officials were prepared to meet with Hamas in the framework of the Egyptian “ reconciliation ” initiative .
He added that Hamas had refused to receive a delegation that was formed by Abbas and entrusted with visiting the Gaza Strip to discuss ways of ending the crisis between the two parties .

Labor Dept. Estimates $ 7.1 Billion in Overpayments to Unemployed
The figure is up from $ 4.2 billion in overpayments the previous year .
July 9 , 2010  --
While many Americans are feeling the pain of expired unemployment benefits , some have gotten a good chunk more than they were legally eligible for .
Preliminary estimates released by the U.S. Department of Labor find that , in 2009 , states made more than $ 7.1 billion in overpayments in unemployment insurance , up from $ 4.2 billion the year before .
The total amount of unemployment benefits paid in 2009 was $ 76.8 billion , compared to $ 41.6 billion in 2008 .
Fraud accounted for $ 1.55 billion in estimated overpayments last year , while errors by state agencies were blamed for $ 2.27 billion , according to the Labor Department .
The department 's final report will be released next month .
Some of the overpayments likely can be traced back to the overwhelming workloads facing state employment agencies during the recession , said George Wentworth , a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project .
" You 've got a system that 's been under siege like the unemployment insurance system has been for the last two years , " Wentworth said .
" You 've got a lot of new staff coming into the system , there 's been a lot of federal extensions [ to unemployment insurance benefits ] that have had to be programmed in and so on .
There 's just been a lot of change that states have had to handle .
... I just think the volume and the new staff have made the systems more susceptible to error . "
The newly - unemployed , meanwhile , have found themselves frustrated when trying to reach out to state officials for help in properly filling out their claims .
" In 2009 , it was a fairly regularly event to see different states ' call centers basically reaching maximum capacity where people would not be able to get through for hours or days at a time , " Wentworth said .
The Unemployment Claims ' Tsunami '
Heidi Myhre , of Hudson County , N.J. , questions whether she could have avoided an overpayment dispute with the state if she had gotten help filling out her unemployment claim early on .
When filing for unemployment insurance in 2007 , she called the state several times for guidance , she said , and got nowhere .
Among Myhre 's questions :
Where on her claim form she should disclose that she receives more than $ 100 a week in dividends from a family - owned elder care business ?
Myhre ultimately decided not to list the payment as earnings because , at the time , she was n't working for the business .
She would go on to receive six months ' worth of benefits totaling just under $ 14,000 .
Earlier this year , the state demanded that Myhre to return all the money and also pay a $ 3,500 fine for fraud after state officials determined that the payments from her family business should have , in fact , been considered earnings .
With the help of a lawyer , Myhre successfully appealed the state 's decision and reduced what she owed to $ 6,300 .
She remains bitter about the experience .
" It was the most poorly managed debacle I 've ever seen in my whole life , " she said .
Myhre 's lawyer , Jef Henninger , said that in the last six months , he 's seen a big uptick in calls from people who have made mistakes on their unemployment claims and now face payback demands from the state .
Henninger expects the situation to grow worse before it gets better .
" With so many more people applying for unemployment , statistics tell you you 're going to get more incidents like this , " he said .
New Jersey labor officials said they could not comment on specific overpayment cases , but Labor Department Assistant Commissioner Ron Marino conceded that the recession did put a significant strain on his department .
He had to pull employees from their regular roles -- including work preventing overpayments -- to handle new claims , he said .
" Our whole impetus for last couple of years has been ' Pay benefits .
Pay benefits .
Pay benefits , ' because of the 90 - foot tsunami that we got , " he said .
" No state recognized the recession was going to be this severe and longstanding . "
In New Jersey , fraud alone stripped $ 25 million from the state unemployment insurance fund in 2009 , according to a review by The Star Ledger newspaper .
Non-fraud overpayments in the state totaled $ 59.9 million in 2009 , up from $ 53.9 million in 2008 , New Jersey state officials told ABCNews.com .
Thanks to the hiring of more part - time workers and the use of an online employment claim filing system , Marino said , he has been able to redirect staff back to their regular duties , including preventing and identifying overpayments .
Back at Work , Still Getting Unemployment ?
Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training Jane Oates testified before Congress in May that the top cause for overpayments was people returning to work and continuing to claim benefits .
Employment benefits experts note that such overpayments are n't always the result of deception ; sometimes it 's a matter of confusion .
Technically , workers are no longer eligible for benefits on the first day they start at a new full - time job , but many believe they should continue to claim benefits until they actually receive their first paycheck .
" An individual goes to work and they report their earnings as soon as they get paid -- so they 're overpaid [ by the state ] for a week or two , " said Marie Moss , the assistant administrator of the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development .
Moss said that such confusion proves to be the culprit in about half the cases in which Tennessee workers fail to report earnings .
Other overpayments are often the result of the unemployed errantly claiming that they were laid off instead of fired for cause -- the latter of which typically disqualifies a person for benefits .
Such claims also do n't necessarily amount to fraud , Wentworth said .
" Most of these cases are about the employer and the claimant looking at the same set of facts from a different perspective , " he said .
Such overpayments are identified after employers successfully challenge their former employees ' claims .
Indiana Department of Labor spokesman Marc Lotter said the reversal of benefits decisions following employer challenges account for many of the overpayments in his state , where non-fraud overpayments totaled $ 34.3 million in 2009 , up from $ 22.5 million the year before , according to state data .
" The federal law requires states to pay unemployment benefits from the moment you 're determined initially eligible .
In many cases , after your initial eligibility is determined , a company will file an appeal and say , ' No , that person was n't laid off .
I fired them , ' " Lotter said .
Until a hearing is held to determine whether the employer is correct , he said , " we are required by law to keep paying . "
Recovering Overpayments
After a state identifies an overpayment , officials like Tennessee 's Moss know not to expect payback immediately .
" It is more difficult to recoup funds from individuals who have been unemployed because they 're already digging out of a hole , " she said .
The department , which saw overpayments of $ 17 million in 2009 , recovered $ 10.6 million that same year .
Some of the recovered money stemmed from overpayments in previous years .
Moss said the state relies on repayment plans that allow claimants to repay what they owe over time .
When necessary , she said , the state also can garnish wages .
In Indiana , state officials have the power to intercept state tax refunds to recoup overpayments and also can hire collections agencies , Lotter said .
Help may be on the way for states grappling with overpayments .
Under federal law , when states recover overpayments , they must deposit the money back into their unemployment funds .
Legislation backed by the Obama administration would allow states to spend up to five percent of the recovered money to prevent , identify or recover future overpayments .
It also would require states to issue penalties of at least 15 percent of the amount owed for fraud - related overpayments .
Oates told Congress in May that the extra money could be used by state labor departments to beef up personnel and technology .
" Because the program is now more important than ever , we must ensure that it is run as efficiently as possible , " she said .
Some potentially worrying news for those of you planning to pick up the new Xbox 360 slim line console from Microsoft , as a video appears to show the first case of a console failure .
It is not quite a RROD , but rather a Red Dot shown on the power brick for the console .
If you watch the video , you ’ll see the user following Microsoft ’s instructions to disconnect everything , including the power brick – but to no avail .
The power brick displays the red dot again after a few moments of rebooting the console .
For those of you who were thinking that the RROD problems were well and truly over with the new console , this video serves as a new headache for Microsoft .
Take a look for yourself below and let us know your thoughts on this .
Has this happened to you or not ?
It would be good to know how widespread this problem actually is .
The BHA has strongly condemned the decision of the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom to award the creationist Noah ’s Ark Zoo in Wraxall , near Bristol , a ‘ Quality Badge ’ in recognition of its educational programme .
The Council for Learning Outside the Classroom was established by the previous government to promote educational visits for schoolchildren .
Its Quality Badge is intended to assist schools in identifying external organisations , such as museums , who are ‘ committed to providing high quality teaching and learning experiences ’ .
The Quality Badge was awarded to Noah ’s Ark Zoo following a visit by assessors in June .
The BHA is writing to the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom urging them to retract the award .
BHA education campaigns officer James Gray said :
‘ This is an appalling decision .
It is entirely inappropriate that the Council should support an establishment that advances creationism and seeks to discredit a wide variety of established scientific facts that challenge their religious views , such as radio carbon dating , the fossil record and the speed of light . ’
‘ Teachers and parents look to the Council for assurance that children will experience high quality educational visits that meet the relevant government guidelines .
Awarding this particular zoo a Quality Badge risks exposing hundreds of children to anti-scientific dogma . ’
‘ This is not a freedom of speech or freedom of religion issue .
The question is whether the information displayed by this zoo meets the tests of accuracy and truth that parents , teachers and other educational professionals expect . ’
Notes
For further comment or information , contact James Gray on 020 7462 4993 or james@humanism.org.uk .
Further information about the Quality Badge is available on the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom ’s website .
Explaining the mission of the Noah ’s Ark Zoo , its website says ‘ Undoubtedly , Darwin helped science see that nature is continually changing , but along with this great progress there began a subsequent movement to remove any notion of God from our understanding of life .
This is unjustified and we look to put the case for a Creator across to those who wish to investigate . ’
The site goes on to ask : ‘ Is it right for Darwin ’s evolutionary theory to be portrayed as “ fact ” in today ’s scientific media and the idea of God , generally abandoned ? ’
New Yorkers will soon be asked to pay more to ride trains and buses that just weeks ago suffered the severest service cuts in a generation .
The series of fare increases will be unveiled on Wednesday by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority .
By Jan. 1 , when the increases would take effect , the heaviest users of the city ’s subways and buses could be paying as much as $ 104 instead of $ 89 for a monthly system pass .
Drivers who use E - ZPass on many of the city ’s tunnels and bridges would pay 10 percent more per trip , and rail commuters could face the frustration of longer lines to buy tickets .
The unlimited subway and bus MetroCard , which pushed ridership to record levels after its introduction in the 1990s and revolutionized the way New Yorkers imagine their transit system , could also be on the way out .
One proposal would place limits on how many rides could be taken on monthly and weekly passes .
Officials at the authority say they can avoid additional service cuts this year as a result of layoffs and cost-cutting .
And instead of an across - the - board fare increase , as in years past , the authority would make a variety of smaller tweaks to the myriad ticket types available .

Carstens considera que sólose tendrá una desaceleración .
Desempleo resta dinamismo al consumo , afirma
[ email protected ]
La reciente desaceleración de algunos indicadores económicos en Estados Unidos , la limitada creación de empleos y la vulnerabilidad evidenciada con la crisis de deuda en Europa , ponen en riesgo la actual recuperación global y abren la posibilidad de un menor dinamismo económico .
Durante la presentación del informe trimestral de inflación , Agustín Carstens , gobernador del Banco de México , explicó que mientras que los mercados financieros están moviéndose hacia la normalidad , con cierta vulnerabilidad evidenciada con la crisis de deuda en Europa , y a pesar de que el crecimiento de la economía de EU continuó en la primera mitad del año , los datos más recientes muestran señales de una desaceleración .
“ Está en el aire si será una desaceleración o una recesión ” , indicó Agustín Carstens .
“ En lo personal creo que será una desaceleración ” , añadió .
La desaceleración reportada en algunos indicadores en EU , junto con la incertidumbre sobre la sostenibilidad de la demanda privada ante los esfuerzos de consolidación fiscal en el mundo , son elementos que aumentan los riesgos a la baja para el crecimiento económico mundial .
“ Esta es una recuperación sin creación de empleos que hacia adelante implicará un lastre sobre la economía de Estados Unidos y del mundo ” , expuso .
El gobernador del Banco de México ahondó en que la producción y el comercio mundial siguen recuperándose , de tal forma que este último ya no se encuentra tan lejos del pico previo a la crisis .
No obstante , apuntó , el desempleo ha restado cierto dinamismo al consumo privado .
Agustín Carstens explicó que en México seguimos dependientes de la recuperación de las exportaciones y de la demanda en Estados Unidos .
El consumo se recupera
En tanto , el consumo interno se recupera paulatinamente , y la inversión fija sigue rezagada .
En la reunión trimestral de inflación , Banco de México mantuvo su expectativa de crecimiento económico para este año en un rango de 4 a 5 % .
El banco central pronosticó que en 2010 se crearán entre 525 mil y 625 mil empleos formales .
Para 2011 , pronosticó la generación de 500 a 600 mil empleos y un crecimiento del PIB de entre 3.2 % y 4.2 % .
El gobernador de Banxico estimó que la inflación cerrará este año en una tasa de 4.75 % , dato similar al estimado en el informe del trimestre anterior .
“ El balance de riesgos de la inflación hacia delante en el país ha mejorado , y se mantiene la expectativa inflacionaria de mediano a largo plazo , situada en 3 % ” , dijo .
Sin embargo , el gobernador aseguró que no modificarían su estimación de inflación , sino hasta tener más información sobre el comportamiento de los precios en el tercer trimestre .
“ Dentro de los elementos que han contribuido a las mejoras en la inflación se encuentran la fortaleza del peso y la menor volatilidad del tipo de cambio , la mayor competencia entre las cadenas comerciales , y una oferta abundante de frutas y verduras , y menores precios del gas ” .
Además , fue menor de lo previsto el impacto indirecto sobre los precios del traslado de los impuestos con las modificaciones fiscales implementadas durante este año .
There are five different types of bail , although some of them are used less frequently than others .
Let 's start with the most common ones .
Cash Bail
Cash bail means that the accused pays the full amount of bail in cash .
Sometimes the court accepts checks or even a credit card .

Surety Bond
Also called a bail bond , a surety bond can be used for any amount of bail , but it is especially useful when the accused can't afford to pay his or her bail .
This type of bail often involves a friend or relative of the accused contacting a bail agent , also known as a bail bondsman .
A bail agent is backed by a special type of insurance company called a surety company and pledges to pay the full value of the bond if the accused does n't appear in court .
In return , the bail agent charges his client a 10 percent premium and collects some sort of collateral ( i.e. a title to a house , car or boat , or jewelry or electronics ) .
By getting a friend or relative involved , the bail agent hopes that the defendant feels compelled to appear in court , since this friend or relative is probably paying the bail agent 's premium and has collateral on the line .
The bail agent 's bond is also at stake , and if the defendant does n't appear in court ( known as skipping or jumping bail ) , then it will be the agent who 's responsible for paying the entire bond .
If the defendant skips a court date , the bail agent , and even the family or friends of the defendant , might seek out a bounty hunter , assuming it 's legal in that state .
Commercial bail bonding is illegal in Illinois , Oregon , Wisconsin and Kentucky .
Some states require bondsmen to be licensed .
If you are in need of a bail bondsman , you can find listings in local phonebooks .
Release on Citation ( Cite Out )
In some cases , an officer will not book a suspect at all but will instead issue a citation saying that the accused must appear in court .
While this process is less thorough than taking a suspect to a police station and performing the formal booking procedure , it allows the arresting officer to focus on catching more serious offenders .
Release on Own Personal Recognizance
A judge may also choose to release a suspect on his own recognizance , meaning that he is responsible for showing up for court dates and does not have to pay bail .
Personal recognizance is usually only allowed when the charge involves a relatively minor , nonviolent crime and if the defendant is not considered a danger to anyone else or a flight risk — meaning that it 's highly unlikely that the person will flee and not appear for his or her court date .
Property Bond
Sometimes a defendant can provide some property to act as a bond .
In these cases , the court gets a lien ( essentially a legal claim ) on the property in the amount of the bail .
If the defendant does n't show up for his court appearances , the court can foreclose on the property to recover the forfeited bail .
Dealing with Bail Bond Agents
Though bail bond agents may seem like part of a sordid business since they 're constantly dealing with accused criminals , it 's still a business like any other .
Just like you would with a professional in another field , ask to see a bail bondsman 's license and identification .
Most agents charge a premium of 10 percent , but there may be some additional charges .
Ask the agent to explain these charges to you and present them in an itemized list .
Similarly , get receipts for everything , and request copies of anything you sign .
( Of course , make sure to review any documents you are asked to sign . )
Like with any type of loan , do n't get talked into financing that you can't afford .
If you 're employing a bail agent on behalf of a friend or relative , your agent should be available to you for questions and assistance .
In all likelihood , he will be , since he has a vested interested in making sure his clients show up for their court dates .
Technically , the defendant is in his custody and is his responsibility .
Even so , if it seems that an agent wo n't be available to talk to you , move on to someone else .
There are many options available that can easily be found in a phonebook , through a lawyer or online .
While there are federal laws about bail procedure , state laws vary .

The U.S. and the Philippines are the only countries with a commercial bail industry ( although other countries may use a bail system ) .

Inside a cool , shaded old plantation house in St. Bernard , Louisiana , we ’re all breathing in our favorite color and blowing out gray smoke .
This relaxation exercise is brought to a roomful of women by the St. Bernard Project , a nonprofit founded in 2006 to provide rebuilding services to Katrina - ravaged St. Bernard Parish as well as offer “ psychological rebuilding ” through its wellness and mental - health center .
Since the oil spill started , the organization has been looking to vastly expand its services to meet the area ’s latest mental - health crisis : the unrelenting depression falling on families living and working on the Gulf Coast .
Everyone here except the three clinic workers and me is a fisherman ’s wife .
Michelle , the clinical coordinator running this early - morning support group , asks the five wives who have come what the St. Bernard Project can do to help them .
“ I do n’t know , because I do n’t know what ’s gonna happen . ”
“ We need work .
For the wives . ”
“ Whatever happens needs child care .
If wives are gonna start workin’ , someone has to take care of the kids .
A lot of fishermen have kids . ”
“ The biggest issue is that our situation is unknown , ” a woman named Tammy says . *
She is tough and broad and has a soothing husk in her voice like phone sex or five packs of cigarettes .
Tammy is dressed in white and is eight months pregnant .
I hope never to get in a bar fight with her .
“ They have n’t stopped the oil , huh ?
This is like a time bomb .
You ca n’t prepare for what you do n’t know .
But I can tell you right now that we need toilet paper . ”
The claims checks BP is supposed to be sending are eight days late , which means everyone ’s out of cash for necessities .
The day before , cars lined up and down the nearby highway for a 38,000 - pound food giveaway .
This morning , like every morning , there was a line outside a church center in New Orleans East , in a part of town where stray dogs scavenge trashy lots and industry makes the air smell like burning toast .
There , and at four other locations around Southern Louisiana once a week , Catholic Charities is giving out $ 100 grocery vouchers .
Though they do n’t open until nine , sometimes it takes being at the doors by four in the morning , when it ’s somehow already hot , to get one , because they always run out .
But you ca n’t buy toilet paper with the vouchers — food only .
I remember that about the $ 75 grocery vouchers the Red Cross gave us as Katrina evacuees in 2005 .
The checkout clerk at a grocery store in Ohio would n’t let me buy vitamins , and boy was I mad about that .
Had I not already cried myself out at the Gap looking at a shirt that I already owned but might be underwater back home , I would have pitched a sobby fit in Giant Eagle .
“ They wo n’t even let you buy Dawn , ” Brenda complains .
It ’s difficult to describe Brenda without employing the phrase “ fiery redhead . ”
In January , she moved out of the 10 - by - 16 - foot FEMA trailer she ’d been living in with four kids and a husband and cats and dogs .
In the new house , she ca n’t stop the kids from sleeping in her bed , because they got used to doing it , out of necessity , for so long .
She thinks almost everything , including the following statement , is funny : “ I mean , Dawn is related to food . ”
“ So is toilet paper , ” Tammy says , and everyone thinks that ’s funny , too .
“ You could get food with food stamps , but ai n’t no way to get toiletries . ”
“ That ’s why we need them checks .
We never got our second check . ”
“ Us either . ”
“ I heard on TV that BP spent $ 2 billion on the spill . ”
“ Maybe in boom .
It ’s not comin ’ in money . ”
Everyone laughs .
“ The money goes through local authorities and they stuff it in their pockets .
They gettin ’ the money and it ’s supposed to come to us and it just gets stuck there . ”
“ We got our first check for the wrong amount and we went to tell them and they said we had to bring in all this paperwork , then we gotta wait two weeks for them to fix the check . ”
“ My husband ’s talking about finding BP CEOs and hurting them .
He ’s not thinking clearly .
The oil spill has completely consumed him . ”
In the meantime , the women ’s husbands are working for BP , doing cleanup .
Boat captains make $ 36 an hour , $ 25 for deckhands , but BP ’s capping their wages at $ 200 a day .
All around , it ’s far less than the husbands usually make in June .
And there ’s a lottery for work .
Those people who get drawn seven days a week ?
It ’s rigged , the women say .
There are cliques .
Young , fresh - faced Julie with the toddler on her lap does n’t want her husband doing cleanup anyhow .
She tells him to stop doing it because it ’s dangerous .
He says , “ How do you want me to feed you ? ”
She says , “ How are we gonna eat when we ’re dead from chemical contamination you ’re bringing into the house ? ”
He says , “ We ’ll live on the check . ”
At this point in Julie ’s re-creation of this daily fight , everyone yells , “ But we ’re not getting the check ! “
“ Okay , ” Michelle says calmly .
Soon she will admit that she does n’t watch news about Louisiana anymore .
She stopped watching it after Katrina .
All it does is upset her .
When she describes this to us , her body will give away how visceral her response is ; she ca n’t talk about the glimpses she ’s caught of the oil well gushing away , that live underwater feed in the corner of CNN ’s coverage , without cringing and wincing .
But right now , she asks the fishermen ’s wives how they ’re feeling .
“ Mad !
I ’m mad !
At BP , at nobody has their shit together to take care of all this oil ! ”
“ I ’m not depressed ; I ’m angry . ”
And the men ?
How are they dealing with their own anger ?
“ My husband ’s talking about finding BP CEOs and hurting them , even if he has to go to prison forever .
He ’s not thinking clearly .
The oil spill has completely consumed him . ”
“ They ca n’t smoke pot anymore .
It ’s just a part of the culture , all the fishermen do it , but now they have to take drug tests to get the cleanup work .
So now they goin ’ drinkin’ . ”
“ My husband ’s goin ’ drinkin’ .
My husband comes home and screams at me .
The food ’s not good enough , the floors are n’t clean enough .
That ’s why I ’m here , for him to take it out on me . ”
In next - door Plaquemines Parish , 11 domestic violence calls came in on one recent weekend , compared with 3 on a typical weekend .
Cathy Butler , the woman who takes the calls , is n’t ready to attribute the spike entirely to the oil spill ; it ’s a hundred degrees outside , after all , and calls always increase a bit in the summer .
The mayor of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , says they ’ve had 320 percent more incidents of domestic violence since the spill .
Whatever the cause , Butler is sure it ’s gonna get worse soon .
“ The more people are out of work , the more trouble we ’re gonna have , ” she says .
“ Plaquemines Community CARE is offering help now , but we ’re gonna need some more counselors .
In the coming months , I ’m gonna see a definite increase . ”
She says she is also seeing an increase in child abuse calls .
In Plaquemines Parish , 11 domestic violence calls came in one weekend ; 3 is typical .
The mayor of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , says they ’ve had 320 percent more domestic violence incidents since the oil spill .
Michelle tries to offer some perspective to the women by explaining that their husbands ’ anger is just a reaction against helplessness .
He ca n’t fix this , but he can fight .
That ’s why we need to breathe to learn to be calm when we ’re awake .
We need to accept surrender in the situation .
If we can keep ourselves grounded , it helps the other person to ground themselves .
That ’s one reason why the St. Bernard Project is reaching out to the fishermen ’s wives — to spread some of the grounding back to guys who are n’t really therapy types .
As Margaret Dubuisson of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans , which has recently added 17 case managers and crisis counselors to its staff , says , “ They ’re not the kind of people who think , when trouble comes along , ‘ Oh , I need a shrink . ' ”
Soon after this session , we ’ll hear about an Alabama charter boat captain shooting himself in the head on board his vessel , which had n’t seen much business lately aside from doing cleanup work for BP .
“ He had been quite despondent about the oil crisis , ” said a coroner .
One of his deckhands told the Washington Post that many more fishermen share his boss ’ despair : “ It ’s just setting in with ’em , you know ; reality ’s kicking in .
And there ’s a lot of people that are n’t as happy as they used to be . ”
Everyone in the plantation house practices breathing in — one , two , three , four , five , six — holding for a second with abdomens , not just upper chests , full of oxygen , exhaling through the mouth for six counts more .
Try to make it a game with kids , Michelle says .
Have them visualize inhaling their favorite color , exhaling smoke with a hiss like a snake .
The sound also lets you know they ’re really doing it , really practicing stress relief .
Julie says her daughter ca n’t go into the fish section in Wal - Mart anymore .
When she sees it , she just starts crying .
“ It ’s disappointing when you realize you ’re not as resilient as you thought you was , ” says a woman in a pink T - shirt .
Her name is Donna , and she ’s ropy , a tight and wiry fortysomething with short dark hair .
Once she starts talking , she ca n’t stop spewing distress .
“ Everyone ’s saying this knocked us on our knees ?
We were already on our knees .
I used to say I was a Katrina survivor until Gustav , and I realized I had n’t really survived , because I could n’t deal with Gustav .
And now this . ”
The other women let her talk , nodding , though they ’ve not been anywhere near so voluble about their own vulnerability .
Tammy , for example , has simply announced several times , “ I ’m a nervous wreck . ”
“ I feel like if I could just get structure back in my life , I could do it , ” Donna continues .
“ I have n’t had structure since Katrina .
I have four kids and a full - time job and they had all their activities and us adults played baseball but I still found a way to do it because I had structure .
We functioned like this just fine .
I was 40 when Katrina hit .
It took me 25 years to get my structure in place , and now I do n’t have it .
I turn on the washing machine , and come back later , and I ’ve run the washing machine without putting the clothes in it .
I do n’t know what I ’m doin ’ .
Every time I start to get structure something else happens .
I hope I figure it out before the next disaster .
But now I feel like we ’ll never get there .
We ’re not even goin ’ in that direction anymore . ”
Plaquemines Community CARE hopes to expand its wellness services with satellite offices , but does n’t have the funding yet .
Catholic Charities does its counseling in St. Bernard on the back porch of a rectory .
The organization , which is also the only place many workers affected by the spill can go for some help toward rent and utilities , got $ 1 million from BP for this kind of emergency assistance .
The money ran out in less than a month .
The scenery between New Orleans and the St. Bernard Project office is grim , the stuff they show you on disaster tours , neighborhoods that look like Katrina was five weeks ago , not five years ago .
The project is still helping the hurricane ’s survivors , treating 300 low - income patients suffering post - storm trauma in the last year and a half .
They saw a surge of mental - health care need just from local residents watching eerily familiar total devastation in Haiti on the news .
They now need two satellite offices and to increase hours ; Patron Tequila is currently sponsoring a five - city fundraising train tour .
Joycelyn Heintz , coordinator of the St. Bernard Project ’s Mental Health and Wellness Center , is bracing herself for the psychological damage this disaster is going to inflict both on her companions and on her client base .
“ Once we see the full impact , ” she says , “ it ’s gonna be worse than Katrina . ”

How often do you find yourself performing the same series of commands in Photoshop ?
When there are typical tasks that you perform on a regular basis , you have two choices ; you can do things the hard way by performing each step every time you need to perform the task , or you can get smart and use an action .
Similar to macros in programs like Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel , Photoshop actions are recorded steps that you perform on an image ; these steps can be saved and replayed on another image at a later date .
Photoshop actions automate repetitive tasks — they ’re easy to create , easy to use , and , best of all , quite often you do n’t even have to create them yourself because someone else has done the work already .
In this article , I ’ll show you what a Photoshop action is , how to find and play an action , and how to record your own .

Does Kirk actually have sex with every girl that crosses his path ?
Well , here 's the absolute TRUTH !

The Animated Series
ALL THE ANIMATED EPISODES COMBINED :
KISSES:0 SEX:0 PAST:0 CHARM:0
Playing Sonic 4 at E3 was like being splashed in the face with a bucket of cold water .
Finally , a 2D Sonic , in high definition , that played as well as the classic games .
This is what we 've been been hoping for through the years .
After the show , I was able to speak with Ken Balough , the digital brand manager for Sonic 4 , and Aaron Webber , the assistant community manager for Sega of America .
My first question was a simple one : after all these games that disappointed what we consider to be the core fans , is Sonic damaged goods ?
" From a brand standpoint , Sonic is a very popular brand .
It 's second only to Mario in terms of popularity .
Is it a damaged brand ?
Absolutely not . "
Balough told us .
The issue is some people grew up with a very specific idea of what Sonic is , and those people were not being served by the games being released .
" There is a vocal community that grew up with Sonic on a 2D playing field , and that 's really what they want .
We understand Sonic is a huge brand , and this way we can cater to what everyone wants . "
Webber agrees , pointing out that the level of enthusiasm and conversation that accompanies each release , even if it 's not what fans wanted , demonstrates the ongoing love for the character .
" Sonic is never damaged goods for those people , because they 're always hoping for the game they wanted .
Something that makes them feel way they felt when they played those old games .
Sonic holds a special place in the hearts of all those fans . "
Even the chronically disappointed show how much they care about Sonic .
" There are people who are very critical , but they 're critical because they 're hopeful about getting the gameplay they remember . "
Why now ?
Finally , after all the Werehogs and the minigames and the guest stars , we 're getting what we want .
So what took so long ?
" A big part of it is we have the right team at the right time that wanted to make this game , " Balough told us .
From the development team to the producers to marketing , everyone seemed to come together in their enthusiasm .
" You ca n't just do a 2D Sonic and name it something different , whether it 's digital or not , this is going to be perceived as the fourth Sonic , so why not just say this is Sonic 4 and make the game everyone wanted ?
Why was n't it done before ?
I can't say , " said Balough .
" I 've been working on the Sonic brand for around three years ; when we came here we knew what we liked about Sonic , and when this opportunity arose we pushed hard to make Sonic 4 . "
That also lead the team to create an episodic , digital product .
" If we wanted to create Sonic 4 and mitigate our risk , make sure we deliver the game everyone wanted , the best way to do was episodical .
That allows people to digest it in bite - sized chunks , paying $ 10 or $ 15 for the first episode and so on .
If you divide it into a certain amount of chunks , people are willing to absorb it easier , " Balough argues .
" It 's kind of like buying a car —very few people just balls - out say ' Here 's $ 30,000 for a new car , ' but if you break it out into car payments ... "
This way the risk is lower for the consumer , and each chunk of the game is a much easier sell .
Why compete with a ton of other products at the $ 50 or $ 60 price point when you can make it more of an impulse buy for consumers ?
Of course , this introduces some risk for fans , as each section is being created in sequence ; they are n't being finished ahead of time .
The story is in the bag , but now the games have to actually be developed .
" We have every intention of releasing the complete story , but if it comes out and not a single soul buys it and it becomes a losing thing ... well , if no one really wanted it I would n't be surprised if we did n't release the second .
But as it stands , I do n't see that as a risk , " Balough explained to Ars .
Webber points out that they 're delivering what everyone has always said they wanted .
" I do n't want to sound too cocky about it , but this is the best direction for Sonic to take , and I hope the fans support that and in doing so will also support the series . "
The first episode will include four zones , each with three acts , and then one boss .
In addition , there are seven bonus stages for the chaos emeralds .
You can make a first pass through the game in a few hours .
Finding all the chaos emeralds and getting the final ending , while exploring each path in the levels — that will take much more time .
Online leader boards will also keep people interested .
After the first episode is released , what will the wait be for the next ?
" We do n't want it to be the case where you 're waiting two or three years for the next one , " Balough told Ars .
More realistically , a year or a year and a half between each section .
If you finish the first episode with all the chaos emeralds , you 'll get a glimpse at the next section of the game .
You 'll get a high level of replayability for your initial investment of $ 10 or $ 15 .
So are they blowing smoke ?
The gaming community holds its collective breath each time a Sonic game is announced , waiting to hear about the deal - breaker .
With Sonic 4 , the game seems to be exactly what we 've been looking for all along .
After spending close to 20 minutes with the game at E3 , I found myself getting excited , and the more I talk to the people handling the game the more it seems like they " get " what we want out of Sonic 4 .
Fans , it may be safe to get your hopes up this time .
Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes to win when the match is even .

No , it 's not an advert for " Sheila 's Wheels " .

ATYRAU , Kazakhstan 
Even as the petroleum industry continues drilling in the Gulf of Mexico at considerable expense and risk , a single field here in Central Asia stands ready to produce two - thirds as much oil each day as the entire gulf does , with less danger to the environment .
But 30 years after its discovery , this field , known as the Tengiz , is still running at only about half speed .
Blame geopolitics , not geology .
The problem with the Tengiz field , whose lead operator is the American company Chevron , is not a matter of extracting the oil .
More than 100 working wells have already been successfully drilled into the scrub brush desert of western Kazakhstan , near the Caspian Sea .
The challenge is getting the oil to the market .
The Tengiz field , one of the world ’s largest known petroleum reservoirs , is tied to a 935 - mile pipeline to the Black Sea that the Russian government has declined for years to expand .
That refusal has held even though Chevron is a minority partner in the Russian - led pipeline , the Caspian Pipeline Consortium , or C.P.C. , which agreed a dozen years ago to more than double its carrying capacity when demand required .

However after a freak thunderstorm they discover that it is anything but dull .
Bestowed with strange powers , the five very different teens realize they have a lot more to worry about than just picking up litter , especially as they discover that they are not the only ones who have been given strange powers .
Secrets will be revealed , feelings brought to the surface and relationships formed and broken .

Sarah Palin 's daughter engaged again to Levi Johnston
Levi Johnston and Bristol Palin attended the 2008 Republican convention with Sarah Palin
Continue reading the main story Related Stories
Bristol Palin , daughter of former vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , is once again engaged to marry Levi Johnston , the father of her baby son .
The pair were engaged previously but separated soon after the child 's birth .
Mrs Palin issued a statement on their reunion , announced in a US magazine .
" We obviously want what 's best for our children , " she said .
" Bristol believes in redemption and forgiveness to a degree most of us struggle to put in practice in our daily lives . "
The engagement , announced in celebrity magazine Us Weekly , marks the latest twist in a drama that has gripped the US news media since the 2008 election campaign .
The Palin family rose to prominence in summer 2008 , when Republican presidential candidate John McCain plucked Sarah Palin , then governor of Alaska , from relative obscurity to be his running mate as he stood against Barack Obama .
' No approval '
The McCain camp announced in the heat of the campaign that Bristol , then 17 , was pregnant and that she would marry Mr Johnston , an unemployed former high school hockey star .
The couple had met at school .
Their son was born in December 2008 , shortly after the election , and the pair split in March 2009 , only to announce their engagement on Wednesday in Us Weekly .
" It felt right , even though we do n't have the approval of our parents , " Bristol Palin , now 19 , told the magazine in a statement .
" It is intimidating and scary just to think about what her reaction is going to be .
Hopefully she will jump on board . "
The magazine 's editor , Caroline Schaefer , told NBC the couple were living separately and practising abstinence and planned to wed within the next month .
Since the election , Bristol Palin has become an spokeswoman for teen abstinence , encouraging teenagers not to have sex because of the risk of pregnancy .
Sarah Palin resigned from the Alaska governor 's office in July 2009 and has become one of America 's most popular conservative politicians .
She is now one of President Barack Obama 's chief critics , using her Facebook page and frequent appearances on Fox News to target him and other Democrats .
Meanwhile , Mr Johnston has attempted to position himself in the public eye , posing nude in Playgirl and appearing frequently on television to criticise Sarah Palin .
But last week the 20 - year - old appeared to soften his attitude toward Ms Palin .
In People Magazine , Mr Johnston apologised publicly to Mrs Palin and her husband Todd Palin , saying he had said things about them that were untrue .
MEXICO CITY  Prisoners in a northern Mexico jail were allowed out at night to carry out murder - for - hire jobs using jail guards ’ weapons and vehicles , officials said Sunday , revealing a level of corruption that is stunning even in a country where prison breakouts are common as guards look the other way .
The prisoners carried out three massacres this year in the city of Torreón in which 35 people were killed , Ricardo Nájera , the spokesman for the attorney general ’s office , said at a news conference .
Among them , the authorities said , was last week ’s attack on birthday revelers at a party hall .
The gang shot randomly into the crowd , they said , killing 17 people .
Ballistics studies confirmed that four guns used in the shooting were the same as those assigned to jail guards , Mr. Nájera said .
“ The criminals carried out their executions as part of a settling of scores against members of rival gangs linked to organized crime , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately , in these executions the criminals also cowardly murdered innocent civilians  and then returned to their cells . ”
Healthcare.gov is up and running – and that should be good news for the many US citizens who are trying to understand the brave new world of US health care following this year ’s passage of sweeping reform legislation .
The website is mandated by the new law , as is its July 1 start date .
It is intended to be both a one - stop - shopping site for individuals looking to see what their insurance options are , and a central repository for news and information about the health bill ’s rollout .
“ Healthcare.gov will take some of the mystery out of shopping for health insurance , ” said Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on the White House blog Thursday morning .
People looking for insurance can visit healthcare.gov , answer a few questions about their age , health status , and family size , and then look at a list of private plans in their state that are accepting new enrollees .
The site contains information on Medicaid , Children ’s Health Insurance Program plans , and state plans that cover people with preexisting conditions as well .
The site can handle over a billion different search scenarios , according to Secretary Sebelius .
Say you are the head of household of a family in Maryland who lost insurance when your job changed .
Enter that info , and healthcare.gov comes up with a list of at least eight plans you might be able to enroll in , from Aetna to Time Insurance Co .
Click through to find more information , though , and you may find it lacking .
Price information is not yet posted .
The website says that such data are coming in October , when a more detailed version of the website is supposed to debut .
Large insurance companies have complained about providing the government with such detailed price information , however , so stay tuned .
You ca n’t enroll in insurance plans directly from the site .
Instead , it provides phone numbers and other contact information so you can reach insurers directly .
Another section of the website lists news about the implementation of the new health reform law , including a time line of when various provisions take effect .
The site also links to “ Hospital Compare , ” another HHS Web service , where consumers can check various quality indicators on their local hospitals .

Will it cut costs ?
Administration , Hill , and industry sources do the math on what could be the summer ’s most contentious confirmation battle .
Last week , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd aroused the ire of progressive activists when he wondered whether Elizabeth Warren , the former Harvard Law professor who is a leading candidate to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , would be “ confirmable . ”
“ There ’s a serious question about it , ” he said on NPR ’s “ Diane Rehm Show . ”
Dodd ’s concern is legitimate given that a mere 41 votes can block action in the Senate , and that the GOP has been willing to filibuster even seemingly popular proposals .
But , after surveying a dozen insiders over the last few days — congressional aides , industry officials , progressive activists , and a few administration officials — I ’ve concluded that the odds are good that Warren would be confirmed if nominated by the White House .
( The White House itself agrees — it is " confident she is confirmable , " according to a spokeperson . )
Most telling is the basic Senate math .
According to two senior Senate aides — one whose boss favors Warren and the other whose boss would prefer an alternative — pretty much every Senate Democrat ( and Independent ) would find it agonizingly difficult to join a filibuster of Warren ’s nomination , which would mean opposing an outspoken consumer advocate at a time of deep anti-Wall Street sentiment .
Simply put : Hoping the president will choose another candidate — something that describes several Senate Democrats — is n’t the same as opposing his eventual nominee .
The biggest possible exception to this is Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson , who has n’t been shy about bucking Democrats on other priorities , like extending unemployment benefits .
Nelson returned from the Fourth of July recess anxious about the size of the new agency ’s budget and its accountability to Congress .
( Though spokesman Jake Thompson says the senator ’s concerns have largely been defused , and that he has n’t taken a position on any potential nominee . )
He later fretted that it could become a “ rogue agency ” under the wrong leadership .
So suppose the entire Democratic caucus were to support Warren except Nelson and another moderate , leaving her two votes shy of the 60 she needs .
There are four realistic places to find the additional votes : Republicans Scott Brown of Massachusetts , Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine , and Chuck Grassley of Iowa .
The first three voted for the final version of financial reform ; Grassley supported the Senate version in May .

Mathematics , logic , and computer science share a common history .
Mathematics and logic are ancient dragons , and not much upheaval is to be expected in their futures .
But where lies the future of computer science ?
Many philosophers of the 20th century embraced a view going back , at least , to Leibniz , viz. , that , by using a formal language where all assumptions are made explicit , most differences in opinion can be solved by tracing the differences back to different ( implicit ) assumptions .
It becomes evident , by reading a newspaper , e.g. , that this view , though of great potential , has not had a large impact in the domains of every - day life .
Computer science would seem to be much more fertile soil for such ideas , and this makes it all the more surprising that computer programming is an activity performed by people who , by and large , have little or no knowledge about formal languages and formal methods .
[ 1]
Since at least three decades , the computer industry is full of buzzwords with little or no real signification .
How many products , packages , and technologies have not promised to empower their users beyond what is reasonable to expect ?
There seems to be no evidence that the quality of newly written software is better than the quality of old software .
In many application domains it even seems to be worse .
This is partially explained by the increasing complexity of software and the thin spread of competent programmers : a disastrous combination .
Appeals for more scientific and rigorous approaches to IT - projects have been voices crying in the desert .
[ 2 ]
This unfortunate development is a consequence of the human mind meeting the unrelenting computers , without sufficient respect for the complexity of the problem at hand .
The obvious but tedious solution is the application of logic .
There are two approaches to logic in computer science .
The first approach is to apply some logical formalism , e.g. , propositional logic , to a conventional programming language .
The second approach is to replace the conventional programming language with a language designed by logicians .
In the former case we speak about formal methods and in the second case we speak about formal languages .
The language advocated here , Martin - Löf ’s type theory , is of the second kind , i.e. , a formal language : type theory is not an add - on to a conventional programming language , but a programming language in its own right . [ 3 ]
Though Martin - Löf ’s type theory usually is associated with functional programming , there is no real reason to limit its application to batch computing .
Haskell ’s monad system , and the many interactive programs written using it , shows that the style of programming dubbed functional also can handle interactive programs .
[ 4 ]
The long term goal of much ongoing research on Martin - Löf ’s type theory is to enable programmers to write complete applications using the language of Martin - Löf ’s type theory , including graphical user interfaces , web interfaces , business logic , workflows , integration components ( e.g , Web Services , COM+ , CORBA , etc. ) , system calls ( Win32 , POSIX , etc. ) , database interaction ( e.g. , ODBC ) , native code interoperability , and database schemata .
There is no royal road to software correctness .
Martin - Löf ’s type theory is a great tool , but we also need a method to address the quality problems of software : “ Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming ” .
Therefore , we , programming language designers , software architects , and computer programmers , have to face the hard facts and deal with the problems accordingly .
At this point I think it is fitting to review Descartes ’ method of rightly conducting the reason .
In his Discours de la méthode he writes that he thought that the following four precepts are sufficient : [ 5 ]
“ The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not plainly know to be such ; that is to say , carefully to avoid hasty judgement and prejudice , and to include nothing more in my judgements than what presented itself to my mind so clearly and so distinctly that I had no occasion to call it in doubt .
The second , to divide each of the difficulties I would examine into as many parts as possible and as was required in order better to resolve them .
The third , to conduct my thoughts in an orderly fashion , by commencing with those objects that are simplest and easiest to know , in order to ascend little by little , as by degrees , to the knowledge of the most composite things , and by supposing an order even among those things that do not naturally precede one another .
And the last , everywhere to make enumerations so complete and reviews so general that I was assured of having omitted nothing . ”
I think that these four points , conceived in 1637 , form a much more realistic and rigorous ground for software correctness than , most modern project methodologies .
Descartes ’ four precepts codify a mathematician ’s way of approaching a problem .
To my mind , there is no essential difference in how a computer programmer ought to approach a practical programming problem .
Indeed , Martin - Löf ’s type theory is both a foundation for constructive mathematics and for computer programming .
“ In fact , I do not think that the search for high level programming languages that are more and more satisfactory from a logical point of view can stop short of anything but a language in which ( constructive ) mathematics can be adequately expressed ” [ 6 ]
The appeal for a programming language of mathematical rigor is even more urgent today , when we develop larger and larger systems .
If the confidence in software is to be maintained , the links with mathematics and logic that computer science had in its infancy must be maintained and nurtured .
By its very nature , Martin - Löf ’s type theory is a very important link between the three subjects .

Federal Auditor General Sheila Fraser will be permitted to conduct a performance audit of how parliamentarians control their budgets , but wo n't audit the individual spending of all MPs .
Auditor General Sheila Fraser says her performance audit of Parliament 's spending will not reveal individual MPs ' office expenses .
Fraser joined Conservative House leader Jay Hill and Liberal MP Marcel Proulx in Ottawa on Tuesday to announce the terms of a deal reached with the Board of Internal Economy , an all - party body that oversees Parliament 's expenditures .
P.O.V. : Should Sheila Fraser 's audit of MP expenses go further ?
Take our poll
The secretive board initially rejected Fraser 's request to examine $ 533 million in annual spending by the House of Commons and the Senate , saying the proposed audit " would go beyond the scope of the auditor general 's mandate . "
But board members agreed to meet with Fraser and hear her intentions following a fierce public backlash and calls from other MPs for the decision to be reversed .
Similar audits of politicians ' expenses in Britain and Nova Scotia sparked scandals and police investigations .
Fraser said performance audits only examine existing management practices , controls and reporting systems .
She stressed that her office 's audit would not be looking at the management of individual member 's offices or the merits of their transactions .
" Nor will we comment on the performance of the House , its committees , or individual members , " she told reporters .
" We are not going to mention individual cases . "
Audit an ' extra step ' : Hill
Instead , the audit will examine some specific expenses of MPs to see how well the existing controls function , she added .
The Conservatives '
Hill insisted the board has not changed its position that existing oversight measures " perform the necessary tasks of ensuring the protection of Canadian tax dollars . "
" While we remain confident that these rules are robust , we have decide to take this extra step , " Hill said .
Currently , Parliament 's expenses are audited by the private accounting firm KPMG , but only the broad outlines of the expenses are made public .
The details are n't disclosed .
Fraser said she expects she 'll be able to report her findings to the House by fall 2011 .
I previously discussed how distributed version control systems ( DVCS ) can help with keeping the tip always compilable .
DVCS is also useful in making sure the tip always passes a test suite , or maintains any other standard of quality .
It does this by giving more control where control is needed .
When you first hear about DVCS , that statement seems counter - intuitive .
How can a decentralized system give more control to the central authorities ?
The key is that by giving up some control where it was n’t needed , you gain more control over the important parts , sort of like guarding a prisoner in a 10 × 10 cell instead of a 10 acre field .
In our company we have product - specific code for a number of embedded products , and a large base of code shared between products .
Because developers typically only have the hardware for the product they are working on , someone who makes changes to the shared code can only test it on that one product .
As a result , although breaking your own product ’s build is quite rare , shared code changes that break other products ’ builds are much too common .
So how can we set up our branches to mitigate this problem ?
The answer lies in examining who we want to have control over each branch .
At the same time , we think about what our ideal log would look like .
We want the “ official ” branch for a product to consist of a series of successfully tested builds .
We want to be able to take any revision of that branch at any time with confidence .
Obviously , the person best suited to controlling that branch is the lead tester for the product .
The log at that level would look something like this :
Here we have the log for a fictional Product A . Notice we only have one person committing here , the lead tester for product A .
This responsibility could be rotated among all the testers , and could be enforced by only giving the product A testers write permissions on the branch , or more loosely enforced just by social convention .
The important thing to notice is that the test group has more control over the product ’s official branch than the typical centralized model , where all developers have commit access .
Okay , so where do the developers come in ?
Developers like to have control , but it looks like you just took a whole bunch of control away from them .
For that we expand the log to the next level :
At this level you can clearly see which features made it into each promoted build .
Developers for product A have full control over this development branch and can set permissions on it as they see fit .
This includes preventing the test group from writing to this branch if desired , because all they need is to be able to do is pull .
In other words , each group has full control over exactly the areas they need it .
A developer ’s view in their daily work looks like this :
This shows the changes for Product A as if Product A is the most important product in the world .
All the shared changes from Product B are hidden behind the plus sign , which you only click to expand if you want to see the details .
A developer on Product B would see a similar view of Project B ’s development branch , as if Product B is the most important product in the world .
Here you can also see two possible approaches to receiving changes from the shared code .
One is what Amy did in revision 2.2.1 .
For her change , she knew she needed some changes in shared code from Product B in order to proceed with her work , so she merged them in .
The other alternative is an assigned branch manager thinking it ’s been a while since we synced up , so he more formally merges the changes in .
You can do both if you want .
Notice that either way the developers for product A have full control over when shared changes get pulled into their product ’s build .
If the shared changes cause a product - specific compile or run time error , Amy simply does n’t commit them until she has worked with the Product B developers to get it resolved .
In the mean time , Alice , Arnold , and the test team are all working from a clean baseline .
Another method we use to improve code quality is code reviews .
We use an online collaborative review tool , and it generally takes a few days to finish one .
In the mean time , you start work on your next change , going back as needed to fix the defects found in the review .
Turns out DVCS is useful in this situation as well , because we can create a new branch for our work as soon as the review is started , like so :
In conclusion , distributed version control offers many flexible ways to increase build stability through more local control and judicious design of a branching model .
What branching models have you found to be successful ?
The tax gap from evasion is , give or take the odd billion or so , £ 70 billion at present .
The total tax gap is about £ 120 billion .
Benefit fraud and official error combined cost £ 3.1 billion last year .
But apparently benefit cheating is times more important than tax abuse .
How do I know ?
Because of this exchange of parliamentary questions and answers from Hansard :
Tax Evasion : Publicity Katy Clark :
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much HM Revenue and Customs has spent on advertising for the purposes of preventing tax evasion in each of the last three years . [ 3776 ]
Mr Gauke : HM Revenue and Customs spent £ 633,284 ( excluding VAT ) on advertising for the purposes of preventing tax evasion last year .
There was no expenditure in the previous two years .
And :
Katy Clark :
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how much his Department budgeted for advertising tackling benefit fraud in each of the last three financial years .
[ 1035 ]
Chris Grayling :
The information is in the table : Budgeted expenditure for advertising tackling benefit fraud 2007 - 08 £ 6.5 million 2008 -09 £ 6.0 million 2009 - 10 £ 5.0 million Note : Includes media costs , PR , production and research costs .
It excludes VAT .
We are currently reviewing all advertising expenditure and requests for further funding will be submitted to HM Treasury for approval .
So over three years tackling tax evasion was worth just £ 633,000 but benefit fraud was worth £ 17.5 million .
So apparently , prima facie benefit fraud is 27.6 times more important than tax evasion over this period .
But weight the spend by the size of the problem and the ratio is even more spectacular .
Then benefit fraud is 624 times more important than tax evasion .
Which is indicative of a spectacular error of judgement .
The Red Sox hate the Yankees .
That 's a given .
But Bill " Spaceman " Lee really hates them — specifically the late George Steinbrenner .
Before Boston was honoring Steinbrenner with a moment of silence before Thursday night 's game , the Red Sox Hall of Famer was celebrating his passing , showing anything but remorse in an interview with New Hampshire 's WMUR .
" I have no sadness , " Lee said with a laugh .
" If hell freezes over , he 'll be skating . "
Lee was famous for his outspoken manner and brash reputation during his playing days , and the southpaw did n’t hold back when asked about the former Yankees owner , who died Tuesday .
" Steinbrenner tried to have me banned from baseball , " Lee explained .
" He said I was incompetent and bad for the game .
I ’m not a convicted felon like George Steinbrenner .
He ’ll take that to his grave . "
Lee spent 10 seasons in Boston and went 94-68 with a 3.64 ERA in 321 games ( 167 starts ) .
He did some of his best work against the Yankees , going 12 - 5 with a 3.86 ERA in 38 games ( 21 starts ) , but he is n’t going to miss The Boss .
" As far as Steinbrenner 's passing — good , " Lee summed up .
They do n’t call him the Spaceman for nothing .
Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are overloaded with expired drugs and medicines , Palestinian officials said .
The officials insisted Thursday that the drugs and medicines , which were donated to the Gaza Strip by aid organisations all over the world over the last two years , had expired , Xinhua reported .
Only 30 percent of the medical aid , sent to Gaza after the last Israeli military offensive 19 months ago , were used at hospitals and medical aid centres , an official in the Hamas - ruled ministry of health said .
The official said that several countries as well as civil society organisations sent to the Gaza Strip huge amount of medical aid , which included drugs , medicines and equipment .
” Such random donations , mainly drugs had caused lots of problems , ” he said .
“ 22 percent of the medical aid sent to the Gaza Strip had its date expired , where different kinds of medical donations were not helpful for medical emergency and medical care . ”
Officials in the ministry of health declined to reveal the names of the countries and organisations that sent expired drugs and medicines to the Gaza Strip over the past 19 months .
Israel has been imposing a tight blockade on the Gaza Strip , which has a population of 1.5 million people , after Islamic Hamas movement seized control of the costal enclave by force in 2007 .
Gaza rights groups said that around 300 patients died over the past three years due to medical aid shortage .
Asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia
Discovered in Paris by Hermann Goldschmidt in November 1852 , asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia has been a cosmic riddle for astronomers .
In an attempt to pin down its properties once and for all , ESA 's Rosetta spacecraft flew past Lutetia at a distance of 3162 km , at a relative speed of 15 km /s on 10 July 2010 at 18:10 CEST .
Read about key results from Rosetta 's flyby of asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia here and here .
First images of asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia from Rosetta : see links on right - hand menu .
Details of the spacecraft preparations leading up to the flyby , including images of Lutetia acquired during the navigation campaign , can be found in the status reports .
Asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia - pre Rosetta flyby
The asteroid flyby of 10 July 2010 was expected to address a number of open questions about Lutetia ; in particular , the observations and measurements obtained by instruments on board Rosetta were to be used to :
Attempt to settle the ongoing debate as to the asteroid 's true composition .
In particular to ascertain if it is a C - type or M - type asteroid .
Determine the mass and density of the asteroid with unprecedented precision .
Search for an exosphere around the asteroid and determine its composition .
Provide ground - truth for the better calibration of existing observations obtained by ground - based telescopes .
Test out the scientific instruments on board Rosetta as it continues to travel to its final destination : comet 67P / Churyumov -Gerasimenko .
Carry out a close - up study of a primitive building block of the Solar System , with the intention of using it to decode how our solar neighbourhood formed .
Situated in the main asteroid belt and with estimated dimensions of 132 × 101 × 76 km ( see Belaskaya et al. , [ 2010 ] ) , asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia has been subjected to intense ground - based scrutiny since it was announced as a target for Rosetta in 2004 .
Initial observations recorded a high albedo , suggesting a high metallic content , and led to the body being classified as an M - type asteroid ( see Bowell et al. , [ 1978 ] ) .
Should ( 21 ) Lutetia indeed turn out to be M - type , the Rosetta flyby would be the first close encounter of a spacecraft with this class of asteroid .
However , Lutetia 's true nature has always been far from clear - cut .
One difficulty in unambiguously classifying Lutetia is the lack of clear features in the spectrum of this asteroid .
Recent visual spectroscopic studies , reported in Belaskaya et al. , and Perna et al. , have noted different spectral slopes at different rotation phases .
This has been interpreted as arising from inhomogeneities in the asteroid 's make up , perhaps caused by local differences in mineralogical or chemical content of the surface .
Some researchers have suggested the closest analogue to Lutetia 's surface is a type of carbonaceous chondrite meteorite ( see Barucci et al . ) .
When Lutetia was at opposition in 2008 / 2009 the opportunity was taken to test this theory further .
A team of researchers used the VLT and Keck telescopes to estimate Lutetia 's bulk density , finding it to be in the range 3.98 to 5.00 g cm - 3 , depending on the model that is adopted .
Although no precise value could be determined this range of density would support a carbonaceous composition ( see Drummond et al. , [ 2010 ] ) .
The ground - based observations in preparation for the flyby have also allowed astronomers to construct Lutetia 's light curve .
Most asteroids tend to be irregularly shaped and therefore different amounts of sunlight are reflected towards the Earth as they rotate .
Hence the ratio between the three major axes defining the asteroid as well as its rotational properties can be determined from measuring how this reflected light changes with time .
Assuming a certain reflectivity ( albedo ) the dimensions of the asteroid can also be estimated .
Knowing , from this preparatory work , that Lutetia rotates with a period close to 8.17 hours was of great help in planning the scientific measurements for the flyby .
The encounter of Rosetta with asteroid ( 21 ) Lutetia is key to understanding the true nature of this puzzling member of the main asteroid belt .
Only with the close inspection that is possible with a flyby can the riddles of Lutetia be solved , as this provides the opportunity to measure and analyse many of the asteroid 's properties including its shape , density , composition and surface topography .
The instruments on board Rosetta have been designed specifically for such tasks and will be able to provide the answers that are sought .
The flyby at Lutetia was the second time Rosetta had studied an asteroid up - close .
In 2008 the spacecraft flew past asteroid ( 2867 ) Steins at a distance of just 802.6 km , only 2.6 km further out than baselined .
However , these two asteroids are just stepping stones on the journey to Rosetta 's ultimate goal , the rendezvous with comet 67P / Churyumov - Gerasimenko , scheduled for 2014 .
The Rosetta team hopes that with this rendezvous they can decipher the enigmas of the formation of our Solar System , just as its namesake helped unscramble ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics .
It could n't have been spelled out more explicitly , clearly and emphatically .
Read and judge for yourselves : " Our position is clear : When Israel returns the entire Golan Heights , of course we will sign a peace agreement with it ....
What 's the point of peace if the embassy is surrounded by security , if there is no trade and tourism between the two countries ?
That 's not peace .
That 's a permanent cease - fire agreement .
This is what I say to whoever comes to us to talk about the Syrian track :
We are interested in a comprehensive peace , i.e. , normal relations . "
Who said this to whom ?
Syrian President Bashar Assad to the Lebanese newspaper As - Safir last week .
These astounding things were said to Arab , not Western ears , and they went virtually unnoticed here .
Can you believe it ?
Open gallery view Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .
Credit : AP
What more can Assad say that he has n't already ?
How many more times does he have to declare his peaceful intentions before someone wakes up here ?
How long must he knock in vain on Israel 's locked door ?
And if that were not enough , he also called on Turkey to work to calm the crisis with Israel so it can mediate between Israel and Syria .
Assad 's words should have been headline news last week and in the coming weeks .
Anwar Sadat said less before he came to Israel .
In those days we were excited by his words , today we brazenly disregard such statements .
This leads to only one conclusion : Israel does not want peace with Syria .
Period .
It prefers the Golan over peace with one of its biggest and most dangerous enemies .
It prefers real estate , bed and breakfasts , mineral water , trendy wine and a few thousand settlers over a strategic change in its status .
Just imagine what would happen if we emerged from the ruins of our international status to sign a peace agreement with Syria - how the international climate regarding us would suddenly change , how the " axis of evil " would crack and Iran 's strongholds weaken , how Hezbollah would get a black eye , more than in all the Lebanon wars .
And maybe even Gilad Shalit , held by the Damascus - based Hamas , would be freed .
Sound too good to be true ?
Maybe , but Israel is not even trying .
A prime minister who ignores this chance is no less than a peace criminal .
Instead of the Shalit march that has just ended , a different march should have set out this week , one more massive and determined , calling on the Israeli government , the peace refuser , to do something .
Hoarse shouts should have gone up : Peace with Syria now .
But this march will not go forward this week .
Apparently it will never happen .
Singer - songwriter Shlomo Artzi , Zubin Mehta and the respectable demonstrators who marched on behalf of one soldier will not do so to support a move that could save the lives of many soldiers and civilians .
Why ?
Because that takes courage .
Why ?
Because Assad was right when he told La Repubblica in Italy : " Israeli society has tilted too far to the right , and it is not capable of making peace with Syria . "
True , they say the Mossad chief thinks that Assad will never make peace because the whole justification for his regime is based on hostility toward Israel .
Our experts are never wrong , but similar things were said about Sadat .
True , Assad also said other things .
Other ?
Not really .
He said that if he does not succeed through peace , he will try to liberate the Golan through resistance .
Illogical ?
Illegitimate ?
Not a reason to try to challenge him ?
What do we have to lose but the chance ?
Even the latest fig leaf a few prime ministers have used here - the assessment that the U.S. opposes peace with Syria - is absurd .
Does anyone see U.S. President Barack Obama opposing a peace move with Syria ?
What a pity that he is not pressing Israel to move ahead with it .
And then there is the old refrain : " Assad does n't mean it . "
When Arab leaders make threats , they mean it ; when they talk peace , they do n't .
And also : " We 'll return the Golan and end up with a piece of paper and missiles . "
Remember how that was said about Egypt ?
But we persist :
The prime minister is criminally missing a historic chance for peace , and we yawn apathetically .
Sounds logical , right ?

However , many of us forget that inflation really does enter into every aspect of our lives — including the cost of raising children .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently released a report assessing the cost of raising a child born in 2009 to the age of 17 .
As you might expect , those costs have risen since 2008 .
According the USDA , it will cost you $ 222,360 to raise your child from birth to age 17 .
If you are interested in how much it will cost you to raise your little cherub , the USDA provides a handy calculator to estimate how much your children are costing you each year .
You enter information about your child ’s age , how many children you have ( and their ages ) , your income , the region in which you live and the number of parents in your household .
The calculator then provides a breakdown of estimated yearly costs .
My seven - year - old son should cost a little more than $ 26,000 a year , according to the USDA .
In my case , it would cost another $ 260,000 to raise my son over the next 10 years — blowing the average out of the water .
I ’m not sure whether my living in the Western region is skewed by California , or whether assumptions are being made because of my income level ( or both ) , but if it costs that much to raise my son , I ’ll be very disappointed in myself .
For fun , I decided to enter in a couple more kids .
If I had three kids , each would cost a little more than $ 16,000 per year .
Apparently , your cost per child goes down when you have more of them .
Your overall costs to raise your children rise , of course , but the per-child cost is reduced , thanks to hand - me - downs , shared rooms , car pooling and other ways of sharing costs out amongst children .
Saving Money on Raising a Child
Honestly , I do n’t think that it should cost nearly a quarter of a million dollars to raise a child .
The USDA includes budget categories housing , food , transportation , clothing , health care , child care and education , and the ambiguous “ other ” .
I ’ve added up expenses related to my son using my personal finance software ( it ’s easy , since I have categories for him ) , and they do not amount to anything approaching $ 26,000 a year .
Some of the ways I ’m saving money on raising my son include :
Living in a modest home .
Using meal planning and preparation , and other grocery shopping techniques to save money on food .
Driving inexpensive cars , bought used .
We also try to use public transportation when feasible ( our local system is pretty bad ) .
Only buying clothing on sale ( preferably clearance ) .
Using a high deductible plan , combined with a HSA to save on health care costs .
Also , we try to live a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent the need for frequent doctor trips .
And , luckily , my son is free of chronic and / or genetic conditions .
Reducing my need for childcare by working from home .
Limiting the number of toys , games and material possessions that we have as a family .
Also , while my son is involved in some activities , we plan to limit them to two or three .
We also expect that our son will have a job as a teenager , earning money so that he can help pay for some of his activities himself , hopefully teaching him to be responsible with money , while at the same time reducing direct costs to us with regard to raising him .
With some careful planning , it is probably possible to help your child live a good life , and develop good qualities — without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars .

A science historian at The University of Manchester has cracked “ The Plato Code ” – the long disputed secret messages hidden in the great philosopher ’s writings .
Plato was the Einstein of Greece ’s Golden Age and his work founded Western culture and science .
Dr Jay Kennedy ’s findings are set to revolutionise the history of the origins of Western thought .
Dr Kennedy , whose findings are published in the leading US journal Apeiron , reveals that Plato used a regular pattern of symbols , inherited from the ancient followers of Pythagoras , to give his books a musical structure .
A century earlier , Pythagoras had declared that the planets and stars made an inaudible music , a ‘ harmony of the spheres ’ .
Plato imitated this hidden music in his books .
The hidden codes show that Plato anticipated the Scientific Revolution 2,000 years before Isaac Newton , discovering its most important idea – the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics .
The decoded messages also open up a surprising way to unite science and religion .
The awe and beauty we feel in nature , Plato says , shows that it is divine ; discovering the scientific order of nature is getting closer to God .
This could transform today ’s culture wars between science and religion .
“ Plato ’s books played a major role in founding Western culture but they are mysterious and end in riddles , ” Dr Kennedy , at Manchester ’s Faculty of Life Sciences explains .
“ In antiquity , many of his followers said the books contained hidden layers of meaning and secret codes , but this was rejected by modern scholars .
“ It is a long and exciting story , but basically I cracked the code .
I have shown rigorously that the books do contain codes and symbols and that unraveling them reveals the hidden philosophy of Plato .
“ This is a true discovery , not simply reinterpretation . ”
This will transform the early history of Western thought , and especially the histories of ancient science , mathematics , music , and philosophy .
Dr Kennedy spent five years studying Plato ’s writing and found that in his best - known work the Republic he placed clusters of words related to music after each twelfth of the text – at one - twelfth , two - twelfths , etc .
This regular pattern represented the twelve notes of a Greek musical scale .
Some notes were harmonic , others dissonant .
At the locations of the harmonic notes he described sounds associated with love or laughter , while the locations of dissonant notes were marked with screeching sounds or war or death .
This musical code was key to cracking Plato ’s entire symbolic system .
Dr Kennedy , a researcher in the Centre for the History of Science , Technology and Medicine , says : “ As we read his books , our emotions follow the ups and downs of a musical scale .
Plato plays his readers like musical instruments . ”
However Plato did not design his secret patterns purely for pleasure – it was for his own safety .
Plato 's ideas were a dangerous threat to Greek religion .
He said that mathematical laws and not the gods controlled the universe .
Plato 's own teacher had been executed for heresy .
Secrecy was normal in ancient times , especially for esoteric and religious knowledge , but for Plato it was a matter of life and death .
Encoding his ideas in secret patterns was the only way to be safe .
Plato led a dramatic and fascinating life .
Born four centuries before Christ , when Sparta defeated plague - ravaged Athens , he wrote 30 books and founded the world ’s first university , called the Academy .
He was a feminist , allowing women to study at the Academy , the first great defender of romantic love ( as opposed to marriages arranged for political or financial reasons ) and defended homosexuality in his books .
In addition , he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery before being ransomed by friends .
Dr Kennedy explains : “ Plato ’s importance can not be overstated .
He shifted humanity from a warrior society to a wisdom society .
Today our heroes are Einstein and Shakespeare – and not knights in shining armour – because of him . ”
Over the years
Dr Kennedy carefully peeled back layer after symbolic layer , sharing each step in lectures in Manchester and with experts in the UK and US .
He recalls : “ There was no Rosetta Stone .
To announce a result like this I needed rigorous , independent proofs based on crystal - clear evidence .
“ The result was amazing – it was like opening a tomb and finding new set of gospels written by Jesus Christ himself .
“ Plato is smiling .
He sent us a time capsule . ”
Dr Kennedy ’s findings are not only surprising and important ; they overthrow conventional wisdom on Plato .
Modern historians have always denied that there were codes ; now Dr Kennedy has proved otherwise .
He adds : “ This is the beginning of something big .
It will take a generation to work out the implications .
All 2,000 pages contain undetected symbols . ”

The paper ‘ Plato ’s forms , Pythagorean Mathematics , and Stichometry ’ is available .
Plato quoted :
“ Be kind , for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle . ”
“ If women are expected to do the same work as men , we must teach them the same things . ”
“ Ignorance : the root of all evil . ”
“ Only the dead have seen the end of war . ”
“ The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men . ”
“ Wise men talk because they have something to say ; fools , because they have to say something . ”

January 2012 .
A cold winter has settled across Europe while the hard freeze gripping the economies of countries that once made up the eurozone is spreading across the globe .
European Monetary Union is over .
The stresses and strains caused by the bailout of Greece and the problems that enveloped other peripheral countries has made the euro a distant memory .
This is the scenario explored by economists at Dutch bank ING who have produced one of the first financial models of what might happen if the single currency falls apart during 2010 .
In a bleak assessment , entitled " quantifying the unthinkable " , they warn that in the first year alone , so by the start of 2012 , output would fall between 5 % and 9 % across various member states , while their new national currencies would fall by 50 % .
The 16 countries that ditched their own currencies a little over a decade earlier have dusted down the printing presses to try to introduce new domestic notes again .
They are doing battle with a crisis that dwarfs the one caused by collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 .
While Spain and Portugal are grappling with near double - digit inflation , Germany and other core countries are gripped with a deflationary shock , one that has also begun to infect the US which is flirting with a full blown recession .
In Britain , the economy is struggling with a double - dip recession inflicted by the euro crisis .
With share prices falling and house prices plummeting , governments are facing the prospects of bailing out banks that have been crippled by bad debts caused by corporate defaults .
Mark Cliffe , ING 's global head of financial markets research , stressed he is not trying to predict the probability of an EMU break - up , but merely considering what would happen if the once " unthinkable " were to happen .
" We do not address the potential long - term pros and cons of dismantling EMU .
However , the initial trauma outlined in this report is sufficiently grave to give pause for thought to those who blithely propose EMU exit as a policy option , " Cliffe said .
On the basis of a euro break - up by the end of 2010 , he warned : " In 2011 a deep recession across the eurozone emerges , dragging down the global economy .
In the eurozone output falls range from - 4 % in Germany to - 9 % in Greece " .
But he notes neighbouring European economies are also caught up in the chill , with GDP falling 3 % in the UK and 5 % in central and eastern Europe .
" While the US would be less adversely affected , the combination of lower global growth and a strongly appreciating US dollar would see it flirting with outright recession in 2011 , " Cliffe added .
Some economists have argued that if individual countries inside the eurozone were able to allow their currencies to float freely , their economies would benefit and help them tackle their debt burdens .
Cliffe disagrees .
" If Greece and other southern European members were to leave , the ensuing currency depreciation would not directly help improve their fiscal solvency problems .
In fact , unless they re-denominated their existing debts into their newly depreciating currencies their debt - to - GDP ratios would soar , " Cliffe said .
Another argument put forward by those who favour an EMU breakup is that a country might be able to grow more quickly if it were able to benefit from the price competitiveness caused by a free - floating currency .
Again , Cliffe is sceptical .
He acknowledges that while the markets will seek a " new equilibrium " for the new domestic currencies born out of the euro collapse , the benefits will not be enough to outweigh the lack of domestic demand .
" A weaker exchange rate will benefit exports to the rest of the world .
However this will not be enough to compensate for the domestic demand collapse , " he explained .
As well as considering the impact of a complete break up of EMU , the ING economists also analysed the potential effects of a less dramatic carve - up of the eurozone where a " stage - managed " exit is arranged for Greece .
Even in that scenario , the economists describe their predictions as " non-trivial " .
While Greek output would fall , the countries that remain in the eurozone would also suffer , with output falling by as much as 1 % .
The newly created Greek drachma would fall 80 % against the euro .
" Losses on Greek assets spread the pain across Europe and beyond , " the ING analysts said .
He also notes that the " departure of Greece alone would be a major blow to the financial markets ' confidence in the sustainability of the EMU " .
" The notion of the irreversibility of EMU would be shattered forever . "
The euro could slump from around $ 1.20 in 2010 to $ 0.85 , close to its previous low in 2001 in the Greek departure scenario , while if the euro were to break up altogether the ING analysts expect " huge volatility " in the currencies that are created to replace the euro .
For instance , the Spanish peseta , Portuguese escudo and Irish punt could devalue 50 % against the new Deutsche mark .
The ING analysts are concerned about the potential for a breakdown in payments systems – and the chaos that would ensue – if EMU collapsed .
Cliffe also asks : " What would [ an EMU break up ] do to the politics of Europe ?
That would have also have economic consequences " .
While there are those who argue that the break - up of the EMU could help kickstart troubled economies in the eurozone , the ING economists calculate the loss of output in the first two years would be close to 10 % – dwarfing the fall caused by the collapse of Lehman .
" This is perhaps something that policymakers may care to reflect upon when the blithely talk of exit from EMU as being a policy option , " Cliffe concludes .
New research indicates that the interactions of microscopic organisms around a particular organic material may alter the chemical properties of the ocean and ultimately influence global climate by affecting cloud formation in the atmosphere .
Justin Seymour , a research fellow at the University of Technology Sydney , is the lead author of a paper published in the July 16 issue of Science that describes how a relative of the smelly chemical that sea birds and seals use to locate prey , dimethylsulfide ( DMS ) , may serve a similar purpose at the microbial scale , helping marine microorganisms find food and cycle chemicals that are important to climate .
" We found that ecological interactions and behavioral responses taking place within volumes of a fraction of a drop of seawater can ultimately influence important ocean chemical cycling processes , " said Seymour .
Using microfluidic technology , the team of researchers led by Professor Roman Stocker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , recorded microbes swimming toward the chemical dimethylsulfoniopropionate ( DMSP ) as it was released into a tiny channel occupied by the microbes .
The fact that the microbes actively moved toward the DMSP indicates that the tiny organisms play a role in ocean sulphur and carbon cycles , which exert a powerful influence on Earth 's climate .
How fast the microorganisms consume DMSP -- rather than converting it into DMS -- is important because DMS is involved in the formation of clouds in the atmosphere .
This in turn affects the heat balance of the atmosphere .
Seymour , Stocker , Professor Rafel Simó of the Institute for Marine Sciences in Barcelona , and MIT graduate student Tanvir Ahmed carried out the research in the MIT laboratory of Stocker , who pioneered the use of microfluidics and video microscopy in the study of ocean microbes .
The new study is the first to make a visual record of microbial behaviour in the presence of DMSP .

" It 's important to be able to directly look at an environment in order to understand its ecology , " Stocker said .
" We can now visualize the behavior of marine microorganisms much like ecologists have done with macro- organisms for a long time . "
To do this , the team recreated a microcosm of the ocean environment using a microfluidic device about the size of a flash drive with minuscule channels engraved in a clear rubbery material .
The scientists injected DMSP into the channel in a way that mimics the bursting of an algal cell after viral infection -- a common event in the ocean -- then , using a camera attached to a microscope , they recorded whether and how microbes swam towards the chemical .
The researchers found that some marine microbes , including bacteria , are attracted to DMSP because they feed on it , whereas others are drawn to the chemical because it signals the presence of prey .
This challenges previous theories that this chemical might be a deterrent against predators .
" Our observations clearly show that , for some plankton , DMSP acts as an attractant towards prey rather than a deterrent , " said Simó , an expert on the role of DMSP in the sulfur cycle , " By simulating the microscale patches of the chemical cue and directly monitoring the swimming responses of the predators towards these patches , we get a much more accurate perception of these important ecological interactions than can be obtained from traditional bulk approaches . "
" These scientists have used impressive technology to study interactions between organisms and their chemical environment at the scales they actually take place , " said David Garrison , director of the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's biological oceanography program .
" The research will give us new insights on the workings of microbial assemblages in nature . "
The research also indicates that marine microorganisms have at least one behavioral characteristic in common with larger sea and land animals : we 're all drawn to food .
The team plans to extend the research from the laboratory to the ocean environment ; the team is working on an experimental system that can be used on board oceanographic ships working with bacteria collected directly from the ocean .
A major problem with religion is that it causes believers to accept nonsense over reality .
Sometimes , it ’s just silly .
Other times , that can lead to disaster .
Take a look at what happened to 8 - month - old Alayna May Wyland :
I do n’t care if that makes you uncomfortable .
Keep reading :
The Wylands ’ daughter , Alayna , had a small discoloration over her left eye when she was born .
The area started swelling and the fast - growing mass of blood vessels , known as a hemangioma , eventually caused her eye to shut , pushed the eyeball down and outward , and affected the eye socket , said Dr. Thomas Valvano , a pediatrician at Doernbecher Children ’s Hospital at Oregon Health & Science University .
“ This was medical neglect , ” said Valvano , who testified at the hearing .
Alayna could lose vision in her left eye and probably will need surgery , he said .
The worst part is that this may have been preventable had Alayna seen doctors .
But even if it was absolutely preventable , her parents , Timothy and Rebecca Wyland , would n’t have cared .
The Wylands said they never considered getting medical attention for the growth and would not have if DHS had not intervened .
Attorneys for the Wylands said the couple were n’t given a chance to obtain medical care after DHS got involved in the case late last month and have been largely excluded from medical appointments .
[ Deputy district attorney Colleen ] Gilmartin asked Rebecca Wyland why she did n’t take Alayna to a doctor .
“ Because I believe in God and put my faith in him , ” she replied .
“ If DHS never came into your lives … at what point would you have accessed medical care , ” Gilmartin asked Timothy Wyland .
He did not answer the question directly and said he puts his faith in God .
If his daughter did not improve , “ that ’s his will , ” he said .
Why ca n’t it ever be God ’s Will for the parents to suffer the same medical conditions as their helpless children … ?
And take a wild guess where all this took place .
In Oregon , where Alayna ’s parents were members of the Followers of Christ Church — home to other faith - based killers like the parents of Ava Worthington and Neil Beagley .
As Susan Nielsen of The Oregonian points out , there may be punishment in store for the parents :
Over the past three decades , more than 20 Oregon children whose parents belong to the Followers of Christ church have died of treatable illnesses , according to the state medical examiner ’s office .
Yet Oregon grants special leniency to faith - healing parents , singling them out favorably in state policy and protecting them from being charged with certain crimes .
In a 1999 compromise , the Oregon Legislature stripped away some of those legal protections but gave judges the authority to give lighter sentences to faith - healing parents .
In recent years , Clackamas County authorities have successfully prosecuted two couples for the preventable deaths of their children .
Things are moving in the right direction .
Still , Oregon remains a national outlier for its level of deference toward faith - based crime .
These parents are dangerous .
They may not come to their senses until their daughter dies .
And even that would be “ god ’s will ” in their minds .
That ’s what their faith teaches them .
It ’s not just mindless nonsense .
It ’s dangerous extremism .
Ugh … I hope they pay dearly for this .
In a surprising development , the most bearish , and easily most comprehensive , report that we have read in a long time on the broader markets , comes from Canada of all places , via BMO 's Quant / Tech desk .
The report 's title is simple enough : Go To Cash - In Plain English .
Not much clarification needed .
Here is the gist : " We advocate switching out of equity positions and going to cash .
The European sovereign debt crisis appears to be nowhere near over .
The global credit environment is worsening .
Cost of capital is going up and availability is going down .
There are large gaps between where the credit market prices risk and where the equity market is priced .
Equity is lagging the deterioration in credit conditions .
Moves in currency , equity and commodity markets are mirroring the moves in the credit market .
Global growth , in a credit - constrained environment , will slow .
Profits will be squeezed by the higher cost of capital ... We advocate a zero weight toward equity , and that investors convert their equity positions to cash . "

CONRAD , Iowa , July 27 ( UPI ) -- A 17 - year - old Iowa girl said she has hit five deer while driving her family 's vehicles during the past year .
Kacee Larson , 17 , of Conrad , said she totaled her minivan Friday in a head - on collision with a deer on County Road S - 75 , marking her fifth crash involving the notoriously hazardous animals since her first deer crash in July , KCCI - TV , Des Moines , Iowa , reported Tuesday .

Larsen said her second encounter with a deer on the road happened a few months later while she was on the way to church , and the third took place a few months after that while driving a friend home from cross-country practice .
She said the fourth crash happened in the early morning this past spring while she was en route to a babysitting gig .
Larson and her mother , Ronda Chesick , said they are thankful she was n't injured in any of the crashes .
" Let 's find a 50 dollar car and put a steel plate in the front .
That way , if she hits a deer it 's just going to bounce off , " Chesick joked .
Developer Summary :
Kill enough ghouls to weaken the stitches on the tear in space , so that you can follow the ghouls through the houses and rescue your sister .
What We Think :
“ Jamie and the Magic Torch ” This Ain’t ( and that ’s a good thing ! )
A remake of a less - than - stellar NES title of the same name , Illuminator manages to stay true to its game play roots , but offers up a great deal more in the story and development department .
The player controls a young boy , asleep in his home , when screams are heard .
Suddenly , the lights go out .
After some exploring , it ’s clear that your sister is gone , and now , armed only with a powerful flashlight , you have to fend off an army of unsightly ghouls if you ever hope to be reunited with your sibling .
The flashlight is a considerable weapon , and provides the most powerful source of light in the game .
Hitting ghouls with its beams will cause them to smoke .
Allow the flashlight to supercharge , and you can send ghouls to a fiery end .
Be careful in the moments when the house is dark .
Ghouls are constantly moving around and can get the drop on you without even knowing of their presence .
Be certain to search all areas of the home !
You will find helpful health bonuses , night lights ( which will provide a dim island of respite amidst the shadows ) .
Strands of Christmas lights can be run along short distances of the floor , and desk lamps can be aimed at certain areas .
When ghouls cross these elements , you ’ll at least see them coming , giving you a valuable second to mount a counter - measure or flee to a safer area .
Seek out the dimensional fissure in each area and meet the conditions to force it open .
This is how you complete a level .
It will bring you through a rift , provide you with an additional life , and deposit you in the next stage .
The Horror … The Horror …
This is one creepy game .
The music that plays throughout occupies a realm somewhere between Ghosts ‘ N Goblins and Splatter House .
Though you can get away with keeping your flashlight on in the earlier stages , you ’ll have to flash and dash in the later ones .
This means a great deal of time in almost darkness .
It will freak you out .
You ’ll be able to close the door on basic ghouls , but enemies in other levels are faster , and some are even able to work doorknobs .
If you do n’t place your night lights strategically , you may well find your health points depleted quickly when an unseen barrage of baddies charges your position .
You ’ll have to play strategically to get through some of the larger levels .
You ’ll be hearing beasts you ca n’t see well after you stop playing the game and try to get some sleep .

Antifascist Calling ... , July 22 , 2010
When investigative journalist Daniel Hopsicker broke the story four years ago that a DC - 9 ( N900SA ) " registered to a company which once used as its address the hangar of Huffman Aviation , the flight school at the Venice , Florida Airport which trained both terrorist pilots who crashed planes into the World Trade Center , was caught in Campeche by the Mexican military ... carrying 5.5 tons of cocaine destined for the U.S. , " it elicited a collective yawn from corporate media .
And when authorities searched the plane and found its cargo consisted solely of 128 identical black suitcases marked " private , " packed with cocaine valued at more than $ 100 million , the silence was deafening .
But now a Bloomberg Markets magazine report , " Wachovia 's Drug Habit , " reveals that drug traffickers bought that plane , and perhaps fifty others , " with laundered funds they transferred through two of the biggest banks in the U.S. , " Wachovia and Bank of America .
The Justice Department charge sheet against the bank tells us that between 2003 and 2008 , Wachovia handled $ 378.4 billion for Mexican currency exchanges , " the largest violation of the Bank Secrecy Act , an anti-money - laundering law , in U.S. history . "
" A sum " Bloomberg averred , equal to one - third of Mexico 's current gross domestic product . "
Since 2006 , some 22,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence .
Thousands more have been wounded , countless others " disappeared , " torture and illegal imprisonment is rampant .
In a frightening echo of the Reagan administration 's anti-communist jihad in Central America during the 1980s , the Bush and now , Obama administration has poured fuel on the fire with some $ 1.4 billion in " War on Drugs " funding under Plan M�rida .
Much of that " aid " is destined to purchase military equipment for repressive police , specialized paramilitary units and the Mexican Army .
There is also evidence of direct U.S. military involvement .
In June , The Narco News Bulletin reported that " a special operations task force under the command of the Pentagon is currently in place south of the border providing advice and training to the Mexican Army in gathering intelligence , infiltrating and , as needed , taking direct action against narco - trafficking organizations . "
One former U.S. government official told investigative journalist Bill Conroy , " ' Black operations have been going on forever .
The recent [ mainstream ] media reports about those operations under the Obama administration make it sound like it's a big scoop , but it 's nothing new for those who understand how things really work ' . "
But , as numerous investigations by American and Mexican journalists have revealed , there is strong evidence of collusion between the Mexican Army and the Juarez and Sinaloa drug cartels .
A former Juarez police commander told NPR in May that " the intention of the army is to try and get rid of the Juarez cartel , so that [ Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman ] Chapo's [ Sinaloa ] cartel is the strongest . "
The cosy relations among the world 's biggest banks , drug trafficking organizations and the U.S. military - intelligence apparatus is not however , a new phenomenon .
What is different today is the scale and sheer scope of the corruption involved .
As Michel Chossudovsky points out ,
This trade can only prosper if the main actors involved in narcotics have " political friends in high places . "
As legal and illegal undertakings are increasingly intertwined , the dividing line between " businesspeople " and criminals is blurred .
In turn , the relationship among criminals , politicians and members of the intelligence establishment has tainted the structures of the state and the role of its institutions , including the military .
( The Global Economic Crisis : The Great Depression of the XXI Century , Montreal : Global Research , 2010 , pp. 195-196 )
While the Bloomberg story should cast new light on highly - profitable links amongst major financial institutions and narcotrafficking organizations in what may be protected drug rackets green - lighted by corrupt officials , media silence , particularly by outlets such as The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times , threaten to propel what should be an international scandal into a one - off news item scheduled for a trip down the memory hole .
" Cocaine One "
If , as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman claims " the hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist , " then perhaps too , drug cartels work their " market magic " with their own " hidden fist " or , as the Russians like to say a krysha , a web of protectors -- and facilitators -- drawn from business , finance , organized crime and the secret world of intelligence .
Dubbed " Cocaine One " by Hopsicker , the DC - 9 was curious for a number of reasons , not least of which was the fact that " one of the chief shareholders " of a dodgy outfit called SkyWay Aircraft " is a private investment bank in Dallas which also raised funds for a Mexican industrialist with reported ties to a Cali and Juarez Cartel narcotics trafficker . "
More curious still , the airline kitted - out its fleet with distinctive colors and a seal " designed to impersonate planes from the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security . "
And when he learned that " SkyWay 's genesis can be traced to In - Q - Tel Inc. , a secretive , Arlington , Va. , investment group owned , operated , and financed out of the black box budget of the Central Intelligence Agency , " well you can bet corporate media ran themselves ragged investigating that !
To top it off , when another drug plane crash landed in the Yucatan Peninsula eighteen months later and broke apart , a Gulfstream II business jet ( N987SA ) that spilled " 4 tons of cocaine across a muddy field , " Hopsicker reported that it had originated from the same network and used the same source for its financing , the " Casa de Cambio Puebla SA , a country - wide network of currency exchanges . "
And to make matters even more intriguing from a parapolitical perspective , after searching through FAA records Hopsicker discovered that the Gulfstream II business jet " was owned by a secretive Midwestern media baron and Republican fund - raiser , who had a business partner who , incredibly , owned the other American drug plane , the DC - 9 , recently busted in Mexico . "
In fact , as Bloomberg investigative journalist Michael Smith learned years later , these were the same planes and same currency exchange which Hopsicker reported back in 2007 traffickers had used to purchase drug jets with funds laundered through Wachovia .
" One customer that Wachovia took on in 2004 was Casa de Cambio Puebla SA , " Smith wrote .
The Puebla , Mexico currency exchange was the brainchild of Pedro Alatorre , a " businessman " who " had created front companies for cartels . "
Alatorre , and 70 others connected to his network , were seized in 2007 by Mexican law enforcement officials .
Authorities discovered that the accused drug money launderer and airline broker for the cartels controlled 23 accounts at the Wachovia Bank branch in Miami and that it held some $ 11 million , subsequently frozen by U.S. investigators .
In 2008 , a Miami federal grand jury indicted Alatorre , now awaiting trial in Mexico along with three other executives , charging them with drug trafficking and money laundering , accusing the company of using " shell firms to launder $ 720 million through U.S. banks . "
The Justice Department is currently seeking Alatorre 's extradition from Mexico .
According to Bloomberg , " Puebla executives used the stolen identities of 74 people to launder money through Wachovia accounts . "
Jose Luis Marmolejo , the former head of the Mexican attorney general 's financial crimes unit told Smith , " Wachovia handled all the transfers , and they never reported any as suspicious . "
Some $ 300,000 was transferred by Wachovia to a Bank of America branch in Oklahoma City .
With cash in hand Bloomberg reports , traffickers " used the funds to buy the DC - 9 through Oklahoma City aircraft broker U.S. Aircraft Titles Inc . "
When queried by Smith about the sale , " U.S. Aircraft Titles President Sue White declined to comment . "
Jeffrey Sloman , the federal prosecutor who handled the Wachovia case said in a press release that " Wachovia 's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations . "
Yet , as Hopsicker wrote nearly three years ago , " the politically - explosive implications of the scandal may explain why American officials have been reluctant to move against , or even name , the true owners of the planes and basically ' turned a blind eye ' to the American involvement exposed by the drug trafficking seizures . "
As of this writing , no Americans have been criminally charged in the cash - for drug planes banking conspiracy .
" Troubled Assets " or Something More Sinister ?
When Wells Fargo bought Wachovia , once America 's fourth largest bank in 2008 at the fire - sale price of $ 12.8 billion , the bank and its former CEO , Kennedy " Ken " Thompson , who " retired at the request of the board " before the full - extent of the financial meltdown hit home , were in deep trouble .
Before the Wells takeover , Wachovia had been on a veritable shopping spree .
After the firm 's 2001 merger with First Union Bank , Wachovia merged with the Prudential Securities division of Prudential Financial , Inc. , with Wachovia controlling the lion 's share of the firm's $ 532.1 billion in assets .
This was followed by the bank 's purchase of Metropolitan West Securities , adding a $ 50 billion portfolio of securities and loans to the bank 's Lending division .
In 2004 , Wachovia followed - up with the $ 14.3 billion acquisition of SouthTrust Corporation .
Apparently flush with cash and new market clout , Wachovia set it sights on acquiring California - based Golden West Financial .
Golden
West operated branches under the name World Savings Bank and was the nation 's second largest savings and loan .
At the time of the buy - out , Golden West had over $ 125 billion in assets .
For Wachovia however , it was a deal too far .
With an enormous housing bubble fully inflated , and a new speculative merger - mania in full swing , one can only surmise that the need for liquidity at any price , had driven banking giants such as Wachovia to play dumb when shadier , yet highly - profitable transactions , such as the " arrangement " with Casa de Cambio Puebla SA , were involved .
Bleeding cash faster than you can say " mortgage backed securities , " Wachovia was on the hook for their 2006 $ 26 billion buy - out of Golden West Financial at the peak of the housing bubble , a move that BusinessWeek reported generated " resistance from his own management team " but ignored by Thompson .
Why ?
" Because no one outside of Thompson and Golden West CEO Herb Sandler seemed to like the deal from the moment it was announced , " a company insider told BusinessWeek .
While the buy - out may have given Thompson " the beachhead in California he had long desired ... the ink was barely dry on the Golden West deal in late 2006 when the housing bubble in markets including California and Florida began to deflate . "
Hammered by the housing bust , Wachovia 's share price , which had risen to $ 70.51 per share when the Golden West deal was announced had slid to $ 5.71 per share by October 2008 .
In other words , Wachovia , along with the world 's economy , began circling the proverbial drain .
However you slice it , although it was clear that the Golden West deal had gone south quicker than you can say " credit default swaps , " this did n't seem to stop Wachovia from paying " smartest guy in the room " Thompson $ 15.6 million in total compensation in 2007 , a year after the fatal Golden West transaction .
Nor did these losses stop the bank from showering Thompson with a severance package worth nearly $ 8 million .
But was something else going on here ?
Wells Fargo bank admitted in a signed Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the federal government that they would not contest charges brought by the Justice Department in its indictment of the bank .
The banking giant was forced to admit charges by prosecutors that " On numerous occasions , monies were deposited into a CDC [ Casa de Cambio ] by a drug trafficking organization .
Using false identities , the CDC then wired that money through its Wachovia correspondent bank accounts for the purchase of airplanes for drug trafficking organizations .
On various dates between 2004 and 2007 , at least four of those airplanes were seized by foreign law enforcement agencies cooperating with the United States and were found to contain large quantities of cocaine . "
Bloomberg reported that Wells Fargo , in the wake of the settlement " declined to answer specific questions , including how much it made by handling $ 378.4 billion -- including $ 4 billion of cash -- from Mexican exchange companies . "
There was however , more than " troubled assets " and charges of money laundering to the story .
In fact , the purchase of these drug planes have been tied to some of the Bush administration 's most secretive " War On Terror " programs .
Drug Flights , CIA Renditions .
Just Another Day at the Office !
Replicating a pattern used by the Central Intelligence Agency during the Iran - Contra scandal of the 1980s , the secret state used a network of cut-outs and legitimate businesses to transport prisoners to Agency black sites for " special handling . "
During Iran-Contra it was " guns in , drugs out . "
Today one might say its " drugs in , tortured prisoners out . "
The results however , were the same ; egregious crimes and lawbreaking on a staggering scale .
Subsequent investigations by Narco News revealed that " this particular Gulfstream II ( tail number N987SA ) , was used between 2003 and 2005 by the CIA for at least three trips between the U.S. east coast and Guantanamo Bay , home to the infamous ' terrorist ' prison camp , " Bill Conroy reported .
" In addition , " Conroy wrote , " the two SkyWay companies are associated with individuals who have done highly sensitive work for the Department of Defense or U.S. intelligence agencies , public records show and Narco News sources confirm . "
According to AFP , the Mexican daily El Universal said " it had obtained documents from the United States and the European Parliament which ' show that that plane flew several times to Guantanamo , Cuba , presumably to transfer terrorism suspects , ' " the French newswire reported .
The plane was carrying " Colombian drugs " bound for the U.S. for the " fugitive leader of Mexico 's Sinaloa cartel , Joaquin ' Chapo ' Guzman , " when it crashed in the Yucatan .
According to El Universal , the Federal Aviation Administration 's " logbook registered that the plane had traveled between US territory and the US military base in Guantanamo , " and that its last registered owner was " Clyde O'Connor in Pompano Beach , Florida . "
The Independent confirmed separately in January of this year that " Evidence points to aircraft -- familiarly known as ' torture taxis '-- used by the CIA to move captives seized in its kidnapping or ' extraordinary rendition ' operations through Gatwick and other airports in the EU being simultaneously used for drug distribution in the Western hemisphere . "
Hugh O'Shaughnessy , confirming earlier reporting by Bill Conroy and Daniel Hopsicker said that " a Gulfstream II jet aircraft N9875A identified by the British Government and the European Parliament as being involved in this traffic crashed in Mexico in September 2008 while en route from Colombia to the US with a load of more than three tons of cocaine . "
While O'Shaughnessy got the tail - number and date wrong , he 's correct when he states that U.S. intelligence assets " continue the drug dealing they indulged in during the Iran - Contra affair of the Reagan years . "
Narco News , citing DEA sources , learned that the crashed Gulfstream loaded with four tons of cocaine " was part of an operation being carried out by a Department of Homeland Security agency . "
However in a later report , Mark Conrad , a former supervisory special agent with ICE 's predecessor agency , U.S. Customs , told Narco News that the crashed Gulfstream used to transport drugs and prisoners was controlled by the CIA and " that the CIA , not ICE ... [ was ] actually the U.S. agency controlling the ... operation .
If this were the case , then " any individuals or companies involved in a CIA - backed operation , even ones that are complicit in drug trafficking , would be off limits to U.S. law enforcers due to the cloak of national security the CIA can invoke . "
In other words , a jet purchased by drug traffickers with funds laundered through an American bank and used in the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " program may have been part of a protected drug operation by U.S. intelligence agencies .
An operation furthermore , whose purpose is still unknown .
This report tracks closely with evidence uncovered by Peter Dale Scott .
In a recent piece in Japan Focus Scott wrote that " it is not surprising that the U.S. Government , following the lead of the CIA , has over the years become a protector of drug traffickers against criminal prosecution in this country . "
" A recent spectacular example " Scott tells us , drawing on research from his forthcoming book , is the curious case of CIA Venezuelan asset , General Ramon Guill�n Davila .
General Ramon Guill�n Davila , chief of a CIA - created anti-drug unit in Venezuela , was indicted in Miami for smuggling a ton of cocaine into the United States .
According to the New York Times , " The CIA , over the objections of the Drug Enforcement Administration , approved the shipment of at least one ton of pure cocaine to Miami International Airport as a way of gathering information about the Colombian drug cartels . "
Time magazine reported that a single shipment amounted to 998 pounds , following earlier ones " totaling nearly 2,000 pounds . "
Mike Wallace confirmed that " the CIA - national guard undercover operation quickly accumulated this cocaine , over a ton and a half that was smuggled from Colombia into Venezuela . "
According to the Wall Street Journal , the total amount of drugs smuggled by Gen. Guill�n may have been more than 22 tons .
( Fueling America 's War Machine : Deep Politics and the CIA 's Global Drug Connection ( in press , due Fall 2010 from Rowman & Littlefield ) .
Scott adds that " the United States never asked for Guill�n 's extradition from Venezuela to stand trial ; and in 2007 , when he was arrested in Venezuela for plotting to assassinate President Hugo Chavez , his indictment was still sealed in Miami .
Meanwhile , CIA officer Mark McFarlin , whom DEA Chief Bonner had also wished to indict , was never indicted at all ; he merely resigned . "
But the stench of Iran - Contra , like that of the CIA 's torture program , as with earlier secret state machinations with drug cartels never went away ; in fact , like a cancer , one managed drug operation seamlessly metastasized into another .
Greasing the Wheels
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODOC ) state in their 2010 Annual Report that " money - laundering is the method by which criminals disguise the illegal origins of their wealth and protect their asset bases in order to avoid suspicion of law enforcement and to prevent leaving a trail of incriminating evidence , " and that financial institutions , particularly U.S. and European banks are key to efforts to choke - off illicit profits from the grisly trade .
The trouble is these institutions , along with U.S. intelligence agencies , are the problem .
UNODOC estimate that profits derived from narcotics rackets amount to some $ 600 billion annually and that up to $ 1.5 trillion dollars in drug money is laundered through seemingly legitimate enterprises .
Part of the fallout from capitalism 's economic meltdown has been that " drugs money worth billions of dollars kept the financial system afloat at the height of the global crisis , " The Observer disclosed late last year .
Antonio Maria Costa , UNODOC 's director , told the British newspaper he saw evidence that proceeds from the illicit trade were " the only liquid investment capital " available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year and that " a majority of the $ 352bn ( �216bn ) of drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result . "
The UN drugs chief said that in " many instances , the money from drugs was the only liquid investment capital . "
And with markets tanking and major bank failures nearly a daily occurrence , " liquidity was the banking system 's main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor . "
According to Costa , " Inter - bank loans were funded by money that originated from the drugs trade and other illegal activities ...
There were signs that some banks were rescued that way . "
Web of Corruption
Although the UN's top anti-narcotics official declined to identify either the countries or banks that have benefited from the murderous trade , a web of corruption envelops the entire financial sector of the capitalist economy as the quest for " liquid assets " trumps everything .
Martin Woods , once director of Wachovia 's anti-money - laundering unit in London told Bloomberg , " It 's the banks laundering money for the cartels that finances the tragedy . "
Woods told the magazine he " quit the bank in disgust " after executives " ignored his documentation that drug dealers were funneling money through Wachovia 's branch network . "
Despite warnings from the Treasury Department since 1996 that Mexican currency exchanges were laundering drug money through U.S. banks , " Wachovia ignored warnings by regulators and police , according to the deferred - prosecution agreement , " Bloomberg reported .
" As early as 2004 , Wachovia understood the risk , " the bank admitted in court .
" Despite these warnings , Wachovia remained in the business . "
At the bank 's anti-money laundering unit in London , Woods and his counterpart Jim DeFazio in Charlotte , NC told Smith " they suspected that drug dealers were using the bank to move funds . "
Former Scotland Yard investigator Woods , said he " spotted illegible signatures and other suspicious markings on traveler 's checks from Mexican exchange companies , " and that he sent copies of his report to the U.K. 's Financial Services Authority , the DEA and U.S. Treasury Department .
But rather than being rewarded for his diligence , Woods told Smith " his bosses instructed him to keep quiet and tried to have him fired . "
In one meeting , " a bank official insisted Woods should n't have filed suspicious activity reports to the government , as both U.S. and U.K. laws require . "
According to a whistleblower suit filed with an employment tribunal in London , Barrons reported last year before the Wachovia scandal broke , that Woods claimed " his bosses bullied and demoted him , then withdrew his reports of other suspicious activities in Eastern Europe . "
It gets worse .
Woods ' complaint alleges " that Wachovia staff may have even tipped off Mexican - exchange clients about his laundering suspicions , " and the veteran investigator told Wachovia officials " he feared for his safety . "
In response , bank spokesperson Mary Eshet said at the time , " Wachovia believes that it has acted appropriately in its business dealings , and Mr. Woods ' claims to the contrary are without merit . "
Meanwhile , on the American side of the pond , 21 - year FBI veteran DeFazio said " he told bank executives in 2005 that the DEA was probing the transfers through Wachovia to buy the planes . "
The bank ignored his warnings and continued along on their merry way until their indictment .
The law enforcement veteran told Bloomberg , " I think they looked at the money and said , ' The hell with it .
We 're going to bring it in , and look at all the money we 'll make ' . "
The former Scotland yard investigator added , " If you do n't see the correlation between the money laundering by banks and the 22,000 people killed in Mexico , you 're missing the point . "
But Wachovia was n't the only large financial institution " missing the point . "
Bloomberg also revealed that Bank of America and the London - based " HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe 's biggest bank by assets , " American Express Bank , Banco Santander SA , Citigroup Inc. , as well as " the world 's largest money transfer firm , " Western Union were also up to their eyeballs in dubious transactions .
In 1994 for example , American Express paid $ 14 million to settle with the federal government after " two employees were convicted in a criminal case involving drug trafficker Juan Garcia Abrego . "
Yet between 1999 - 2004 , Bloomberg reported " the bank failed to stop clients from laundering $ 55 million of narcotics funds , the bank admitted in a deferred - prosecution agreement in August 2007 ... and paid $ 65 million to the U.S. and promised not to break the law again . "
Charges were dismissed a year later under terms of the agreement .
And back in 2004 , The Independent disclosed that " HSBC , the UK 's largest bank , have been slammed for lax money - laundering procedures in a report by a US Senate subcommittee . "
Journalists Hugh O'Shaughnessy and Paul Lashmar revealed that " the UK - based multinational stands accused of laxity in the fight against money laundering , drug trafficking , corruption and terrorism , notably in the oil - rich African state of Equatorial Guinea . "
" In one of the few cases " when the scandal - plagued and now - shuttered Riggs Bank " seems to have properly followed US anti-money - laundering legislation , " Riggs formally asked HSBC and a Spanish bank , Banco Santander , " to divulge the identities of the owners of two companies that kept accounts with them and that were receiving suspicious wire transfers totalling in excess of $ 35 m ( � 20 m ) .
The banks refused to say who the owners were . "
Bloomberg disclosed that " federal agents caught people who work for Mexican cartels depositing illicit funds in Bank of America accounts in Atlanta , Chicago and Brownsville , Texas , from 2002 to 2009 . "
Authorities contend that " Mexican drug dealers used shell companies to open accounts at London - based HSBC . "
Nevertheless , neither bank were accused of wrongdoing by the federal government and both firms denied any involvement in money laundering schemes .
Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton told Smith that they " strictly follow the government rules . "
Norton said , " Bank of America takes its anti-money - laundering responsibilities very seriously , " a fact not readily apparent from Bloomberg Markets investigation .
Both Norton and HSBC spokesman Roy Caple told Smith that " [ privacy ] laws bar them from discussing specific clients . "
And so it goes .
Fallout ?
What Fallout !
In the wake of Wachovia 's admission to federal prosecutors , Wells Fargo will pay " $ 160 million in fines and penalties , less than 2 percent of its $ 12.3 billion profit in 2009 . "
" If Wells Fargo keeps its pledge , " Bloomberg reports , then " according to the agreement [ the federal government will ] drop all charges against the bank in March 2011 . "
Why might that be ?
Large banks are immune from vigorous prosecution for violating the Bank Secrecy Act " by a variant of the too - big - to - fail theory . "
Veteran Senate investigator Jack Blum , who led probes into the Iran - Contra drug connection and the CIA 's favorite shadow bank during the 1980s , the Bank of Credit and Commerce ( BCCI ) told Bloomberg , " the theory is like a get - out - of - jail - free card for big banks . "
" There 's no capacity to regulate or punish them because they 're too big to be threatened with failure , " Blum says .
" They seem to be willing to do anything that improves their bottom line , until they 're caught . "
Meanwhile as the bodies pile up , there 's no jail time for executives and the assets of firms that could charitably be described as part of a " continuing criminal enterprise " have n't been seized ; only a slap on the wrist and a promise to " do better next time . "
Even after six books and an upcoming feature film , there 's still a lot we do n't know about Scott Pilgrim 's mysterious lady love Ramona Flowers .
Fortunately , actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead helped us shed some light on Ramona 's shadowy past .

Winstead explained that each cast member received a list from Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley detailing ten facts about their character that was n't in the books or the film .
Ramona 's list described her pre-Toronto life :
It was just a lot about her childhood and her relationships that are n't talked about in the books and the movie that kind of shaped who she is .
And it made me understand what a sort of sad character she is at the core and not so much bad - ass and mysterious and cool so much as just guarded because she 's been through a lot of ... you know .

Although Winstead was n't sure how much she could reveal , we did manage to coax one detail out of her , in the video above .

The Pentagon ’s new intelligence unit ’s purpose could raise the valid question of how far the U.S. is moving toward militarized domestic databasing , but its resemblance to a ‘ disestablished ’ program used to spy on peace activists can reasonably confirm the program was never halted .
The Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) “ wants to open a new repository for information about individuals and groups ” July 15 , as Jeff Stein reported yesterday at his Washington Post blog .
The new Foreign Intelligence and Counterintelligence Operation Records ( FICOR ) unit mirrors one shut down in recent years after civil liberty advocates brought claims it violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
The claims were confirmed after a court ruled in favor of a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) suit [ .pdf ] against the Pentagon .
The unit “ appears to be a successor to a controversial counterintelligence program that was disbanded in [ August ] 2008 ” , the War Deparment ’s former Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) .
CIFA databased intimate details of non-governmental organizations against imperialism and activists , the FOIA suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union revealed .
Mr. Stein outlined the game of musical chairs that followed :
The new Foreign Intelligence and Counterintelligence Operation Records section will be housed in DIA ’s Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center , or D.C.H.C. , formed after the demise of the Counterintelligence Field Activity , or CIFA , according to an announcement that appeared Tuesday in the Federal Register .
The “ activity ” was disbanded , but evidently not its records database , which seems to be headed to the new unit .
One of the criticisms of CIFA was that it vacuumed up raw intelligence on legal protest groups and individuals from local police and military spies .
Ironically , it was President Obama ’s designation for the vacated director of national intelligence post — James Clapper , current and then - undersecretary of defense for intelligence — who “ ordered an end ” to CIFA methods , which included spying on and violating the privacy of “ antiwar protesters after the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 ” , as Joby Warrick reported in April 2008 at the WaPo .
His “ recommendation to close the agency ” was part of his “ planned restructuring ” of DIA .
“ The small agency had drawn widespread criticism from civil liberties groups and some Democratic lawmakers , who contended that it represented an unwarranted expansion of the Pentagon ’s domestic spying capability , ” Mr. Warrick added .
The D.C.H.C. , a Pentagon statement at the time read , “ shall not perform any law enforcement functions previously assigned to DoD CIFA ” , but Mr. Stein notes the ambiguity in the announcement of FICOR — to the point where one can reasonably hypothesize the purpose is to revive CIFA with a thicker coating of candy :
“ It ’s a little hard to tell what this is exactly , but we do know that DIA took over ‘ offensive counterintelligence ‘ for the D.O.D. once CIFA was abandoned , ” said Mike German , a former F.B.I. Special Agent who is now policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ It therefore makes sense that this new DIA data base would be collecting the same types of information that CIFA collected improperly , so Americans should be just as concerned . ”
The Defense Department has also started collecting Suspicious Activity Reports , German pointed out , “ which they share with federal , state and local law enforcement through the F.B.I. eGuardian system . ”
Tuesday ’s announcement in the Federal Register was vague about the kinds of intelligence the new records center will hold .
It said that it would hold information on “ individuals involved in , or of interest to , DoD intelligence , counterintelligence , counterterrorism and counter - narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and / or training activities . ”
The kinds of records it intends to hold , according to the Federal Register , include “ Social Security Number ( SSN ) , address , citizenship documentation , biometric data , passport number , vehicle identification number and vehicle / vessel license data . ”
Records would be gathered from “ Federal , state , local , and tribal entities , foreign intelligence agencies , educational and research institutions , foreign governments and open source literature , ” the announcement says .
The new records center would have a broad domestic and homeland security mandate , judging from the announcement .
There is substantial reason to conclude that this datamining will integrate with the previous CIFA database , which will just have a new label on the header , as Mr. Stein further quotes the announcement :
“ The system of records includes ad hoc or temporary databases established to support particular investigations , task forces , or analytical projects . ”
Considering Mr. Clapper ’s fingers in the pie on the shut down of CIFA and the coming - opening of FICOR while posted at the Pentagon , my question is : if the plan was to provide a more pacifying narrative for the CIFA methods , through which unit at the D.I.A. has it been unlawfully datamining non-combatants within the U.S. since August 2008 ?
DIA did n’t just stop , but if records are to be used in future cart - before - the - horse bases for ‘ inevitable discovery ’ claims from the FICOR database .
When CIFA was “ disestablished ” , according to a Pentagon statement , it ’s “ resources and responsibilities ” were “ transferred ” to DIA units — Defense Counterintelligence , or C.I. , and the Human Intelligence Center , or HUMINT .
The CIFA website ‘s been defunct for quite a while , but the creation of FICOR tells us the unit was never disbanded ; the public establishment of the entity just went further underground for a while .
Mushroom caps can be filled with all sorts of ingredients , like crab meat , breadcrumbs , bacon , and cheese , and often times a combination of these ingredients .
These Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms are simple in their construction , but rich in flavor .
This recipe makes enough to feed a crowd , and there are never any leftovers .
The earthy flavor of mushrooms is what makes them so special .
They taste wonderful sauteed with garlic and olive oil , or filled and baked with similar tasty and earthy ingredients .
The Parmesan cheese in these Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms goes extremely well with the delicious mushroom flavor .
Because the cheese filling is pretty rich , it is best to use smaller sized mushroom caps .
I like using the smaller caps because you can pop them in your mouth without making a mess , making this appetizer a perfect finger food for parties .

Personal Essays Jun 8 , 2010 Cheater Cheater
Illustration by Julia Sonmi Heglund
She was a bright - faced first year from Hawaii , one of the more alert students in the writing class I was teaching at a university in the middle of Texas , a refreshing curiosity because of where she was from ; she had opinions and could share them in class , and , as far as I could tell , was a decent writer .
I never figured her as someone who was going to play me for a fool .
She was a plagiarist .
The first one I caught .
The only one I punished .
Six years later , I got a magazine assignment to write about the lives of cheaters .
No longer a professor , I tracked her down .
How had her plagiarism resonated in her life ?
“ To be honest with you it has never left my mind and I do think about it often , ” Haley ( which is n’t her real name ) told me in an email reply .
Two weeks later , we were sitting across from each other at a Waffle House in Fort Worth , a tape recorder on the table .
Back then , she never looked or acted like a punk , and she had n’t changed much : her blonde hair in a ponytail , her eyelashes thick , her voice chirpy .
I asked her why she did it .
Well , she explained , the due date to pass in a rough draft had snuck up on her , because her boyfriend had been in town .
Her life was n’t so great at the time .
She ’d just moved from Hawaii , and her parents were getting divorced .
She was overwhelmed by college life , the giant campus , the partying .
“ I was n’t very happy . ”
With the boyfriend around , “ I could n’t ditch class , so I did n’t ditch class , but I kind of slipped off a lot of work that I had to do .
Then he left , and the next day the paper was due .
And so I thought , I can’t , all these things happening at once , a combination of things , all these things .
I can’t , ca n’t do it !
I can not sit here and think about what I am going to write for this paper .
My mind is not there . ”
So she went online .
( For historical reference , this would be Before Google , around 1997 . )
“ I found that website , and I said , ‘ This works !
This is good !
This is good enough !’
So I highlighted , I copied , and I pasted it into my paper and I read through it . ”
She insisted that she ’d changed a few things .
“ I did n’t exactly copy and paste . ”
She paused , then reversed herself .
“ Ummm , but pretty much I did . ”
She said that she told herself , “ Honestly , I ’m just going to do it for the first draft .
The final paper will be completely different .
Which — you know , it would have been , but you would have been , ‘ What the heck ?
She ’s gone in a totally different direction in this final paper . ’ ”
“ When you passed it in , did you know what you were doing ? ” I asked .
She nodded .
“ I knew .
I was worried sick about it .
I would pray : Please Lord , do n’t let me get in trouble for this . ”
“ You prayed to God ? ” I asked , incredulous .
“ Yes ! ” she chirped .
“ For getting off a bad thing I did !
Is n’t that terrible ?
That ’s terrible . ”
When Haley plagiarized , it was safer for me to act as a junior bureaucrat .
I saw no other choice .
What she did n’t know was that I ’d worked hard to come up with engaging writing assignments .
This one was , find a real instance where a book is being banned somewhere in the U.S. and write to the person trying to ban it and persuade them why they should n’t .
Making assignments plagiarism - proof was n’t my first goal , but this one turned out that way .
So while Haley was praying to God that I would slip into a temporary coma or orthographic fugue , I was noticing that she ’d put her name on a traditional five - paragraph exegesis of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn .
Suspicious , I put a few of lines into one of the archaic search engines we had back then , which produced the irrefutable evidence in a split second .
I printed out a few pages , then called her on the phone , to serve justice .
“ When you called me , I knew , ” Haley recalled .
“ I told myself , he just wants to go over grades , but I knew .
I was like , oh great . ”
The next morning we met in a departmental office where I confronted her with the evidence .
An administrator served as witness so that procedures were followed , no bargains struck .
I remember that my voice trembled — I was a little afraid that she ’d fight the charge , which students had the right to do .
Besides , my colleagues ’ war stories often contained an indignant student and a muddle - headed administrator , perhaps a parent in denial .
But Haley buckled , waiving her right to an appeal with a signature on a piece of paper .
I told her I would give her an F on the paper , then we left .
“ The walk home felt so terrible .
I never felt like I was going to get back .
I just wanted to be home and sit and — ugh .
It was terrible . ”
She laughed , then sighed .
“ I cried the minute I got in my dorm room .
My roommate asked , ‘ How did it go ? ’
And I said , ‘ Oh my gosh , ’ and I just started crying .
Because I knew I was going to get in trouble for it and I was disappointed in myself . ”
Her roommate — the only person who knew about the cheating until years later , when Haley told her parents and her boyfriend — suggested that Haley write a letter of apology .
“ I did n’t want you to think terrible things about me , ” she said .
She seemed especially ashamed for plagiarizing a draft .
“ I remembered , that was a draft .
I was busted for cheating on a draft !
You know ? ”
She laughed .
“ A draft !
Oh , well . ”
Catching Haley , I felt triumphant .
No fool , I . But powerful !
But between that triumph and our Waffle House meeting , more had happened to me than I could really describe to myself , much less to Haley .
How , precisely , had working with hundreds of student writers changed me , as a teacher , a writer , a person ?
I ’d seen them in five years ’ worth of classes and in the writing clinic where I worked as a consultant .
I saw them baffled by what teachers said they wanted ( “ compare and contrast ‘ A Good Man is Hard to Find ’ and ‘ Bartleby the Scrivener ’ ” ) , which often seemed to mask what they really wanted ( “ elegantly analyze these stories and compose , in formal prose , a well - supported argument that will not only engage the ambiguities without resolving them but delight and surprise me ” ) .
And over and over I saw how the nature of the institution and its agents reduced the complexity of student experience to neat bureaucratic decision trees ( “ Was the student intoxicated ?
If no , then refer to disciplinary committee .
If yes , then refer to police ” ) .
One way to do this : make a moral issue out of a moment in a life , to graft a forking path ( and therefore a high road not taken ) onto a moment when there ’d been no choice at all .
Only later would I see such moments for what they were and try to wrest them back from the machine .
But when Haley plagiarized , it was safer for me to act as a junior bureaucrat .
I saw no other choice .
In the broader intellectual sphere , incidents of plagiarism skyrocketed in universities in the late 1990s , and some people reached for scapegoats like the Evil Internet .
But others began to rethink plagiarism , not only what it was but what it meant that administrators and instructors reacted as they did .
Rebecca Moore Howard , a professor at Syracuse University , sensed that her students were lifting sentences from published sources not because they were bad people or did n’t know how to cite things , but because they did n’t understand the texts they were reading well enough to synthesize them .
Howard realized that what was monolithically labeled “ plagiarism ” by institutions was actually a bunch of activities .
Some you could legitimately condemn .
Some you could teach through .
Others were culturally acceptable practices , even time - honored and literary ones .
The students had simply done them awkwardly or badly .
Howard advocated that policies on student authorship abandon the monolith and try to find students where they were , morally and cognitively .
Shortly before I pursued a career as a writer , in my last year of teaching at a small liberal arts college , I learned something that had been wide knowledge for about a decade : Martin Luther King , Jr. , had plagiarized substantial portions of his doctoral dissertation .
In the schools where I taught , King ’s “ I Have a Dream ” speech and his “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” were highly regarded , oft - taught pieces of rhetorical brilliance .
His plagiarism ?
Never discussed .
And the fact that his plagiarism was never discussed was never discussed .
I hesitate to say that this influenced me , because a mention of King ’s academic plagiarism is usually a tool used to discredit him and the movements he led .
It ’s also used to attack liberal academics , as if they ’re unique in ignoring the moral fault of their heroes .
To me it meant that there were contradictions about what we did and what we said in our culture about who we looked up to and who we made pay for our sins .
It also meant that authorship and authoring were far more complicated than could be taught — I myself was about to see this , live it .
Haley told me she was afraid of writing the two papers remaining in our class together .
“ At first I did n’t really want to write — at first I did n’t want to go to class , ” she said .
From that semester , I remembered us talking a few times but always about what came next , not the past .
She knew what a written sentence should be like and could put them together competently .
As a speaker , she was better : direct , enthusiastic , confident .
She could have been a classroom star , a student I ’d remember fondly .
Instead , after the plagiarism , to me she became a piece of furniture .
Later , she told me , she took a few other classes with writing assignments — she did n’t avoid such classes , but she was on guard .
“ Every paper I wrote after that was so careful , I never plagiarized on anything .
People in my group said , let ’s change it to make it work .
You know how people will work on a paper and find a quote and need it to say something just a little bit different and they ’ll kind of tweak it to make it work ?
And I was like , we ’re not going to do that .
I was a stickler about it .
I was not going to get in trouble again . ”
But what she could n’t know was how I became more confident in spotting an opportunity to instruct , and less interested in policing boundaries .
After she left my class , Haley told me , she pledged a sorority , graduated in 2001 as a communications major , and worked as an accountant for a small oil company .
Because she had a disciplinary file in the dean ’s office , she decided against graduate school and did n’t take the GRE , though she was thinking about graduate school in business .
More importantly , though , her self - image as a good girl had been crushed .
Until recently she ’d told no one her secret .
“ I felt bad , ” she said .
“ You know ?
It was n’t like me .
To this day , it was not like me to do something like that .
It says something bad about a person . ”
She laughed .
“ But I did it , and so I did n’t want anybody to know . ”
Haley told her parents , after she graduated .
( She said that her dad said , “ People do it , it happens . ”
Which I find puzzlingly amoral .
Like father , like daughter , perhaps . )
She eventually told her boyfriend ( not the one who visited her ) years later , in a conversation about bad things they ’d done in their lives .
“ I told him , and he was like , Wow .
He was shocked .
‘ That was really stupid , ’ and I ’m like , I know , I know it was really stupid .
Thank you , I know that ! ”
“ Did he have something to beat it ? ”
“ He did n’t .
He ’s pretty good .
Which makes me feel worse . ”
Then it was my turn : I told Haley a bit about how her plagiarism had affected me .
How I took it personally , and trusted students a little less ; I made sure that assignments were plagiarism - proof .
But what she could n’t know was how I became more confident in spotting an opportunity to instruct , and less interested in policing boundaries — which were , after all , mine to teach .
She also could n’t know that at one point , I ’d considered designing a course that would focus on rewriting , rephrasing , riffing , and appropriation as real tools of the writer ’s trade .
It would n’t teach anything that would get anyone in trouble , but unlike other writing courses , it would be honest about where ideas and language come from : well , who knows where they come from , but not from angelic transmissions into our minds .
I wanted to admit to her that it if I ’d had more teaching experience , things might have turned out differently ; that only later did I realize that , like her , I might have had other choices , too .
I did n’t say it like this , and however I put it , she did n’t look too happy .
But she did n’t say she wished for another outcome .
“ You did n’t know what type of person I was .
You did what you thought was right .
It was your job to make sure I knew it was bad and not do it again . ”
Amazing that her sense of right and wrong had remained so intact .
Perhaps , I thought , she was putting this on ?
Telling me what I wanted to hear ?
In my mind , there was so much distance between our previous roles , but perhaps not so for her .
“ Did you ever feel angry at me ? ” I asked .
“ No . ”
“ Did you ever get pissed off ? ”
“ No . ”
You know , I said , I might have given you more time , or had you write a letter of apology , rather than the F on the paper .
“ Did you ever consider that there might have been other outcomes ? ” I asked .
What could she say ?
She ’d been put through the machine .
“ Yeah , ” she said , “ you could have failed me in the class . ”
So much for looking back together to see who we used to be .
How long would it take for us to talk like two people , and not keep reverting to our old roles in the university ’s machine ?
When she comes to interview me , I ’ll know , maybe it ’s now .
Yesterday 's September labor market report was lousy by any measure , with 263,000 lost jobs and the jobless rate climbing to 9.8 % .
But for one group of Americans it was especially awful : the least skilled , especially young workers .
Washington will deny the reality , and the media wo n't make the connection , but one reason for these job losses is the rising minimum wage .
Earlier this year , economist David Neumark of the University of California , Irvine , wrote on these pages that the 70 - cent - an - hour increase in the minimum wage ...

The Toronto G - 20 summit sent a message to poor and working people in Europe and North America .
“ You will pay for the global financial crisis through cuts to your social safety nets .
There will be no taxing of those who actually caused the crisis and made fortunes in the various bubbles over the last decades . ”
Of course not in so many words — what they said was they had committed to fiscal plans that will at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt - to - GDP ratios by 2016 .
That means austerity plans , which was pretty much what was on the agenda before the countries got there .
This was bad enough .
But there was another message , too , sent through the Canadian police : “ If you do n’t like it , how about a rubber bullet ? ”
It looks like G - 20 countries will deal with opposition to their plans through martial law and police brutality .
I was there in Toronto , where police turned the downtown center into something resembling martial law .
The invocation of an archaic piece of legislation called the “ Public Works Protection Act ” at the G20 site essentially suspended probable cause , giving police the rights of search and seizure to anyone , anywhere in the area .
In other parts of the city peaceful demonstrators were charged with “ conspiracy to commit mischief ” and “ disturbing the Queen ’s peace ” .
Canadians learned that there was no right to freedom of assembly and no freedom of speech as long as extraordinary measures could be rationalized .
And what were the circumstances ?
Well , in the midst of twenty thousand peaceful demonstrators were around one hundred people dressed in black ( known as the Black Bloc tactic ) .
At a certain point on Saturday afternoon , they broke away from the main protest march , and ran up and down Yonge Street breaking windows .
Four police cars were trashed and burned .
There is evidence a few of the cars were abandoned by police for hours before they were set upon .
On one such car , protesters painted the words “ bait ” .
There was nothing very secret about the Black Bloc ’s intentions or plans .
There is evidence that the police had infiltrated the group , but in any case , they actually published most of their plans on a public web site .
Yet in footage captured by a freelance journalist and dozens of cams posted on YouTube , police can be seen standing by for as long as an hour or more while the rampage occurred .
Was it a deliberate plan by the security forces ( led by the RCMP ) , or a lack of resources as police claimed ?
When you try to answer that , keep in mind the Canadian government spent close to a billion dollars on security that included around 19,000 police on the streets .
In any case , television images of burning police cars became the rationale for almost a thousand arrests , mostly not of people wearing black , but of ordinary demonstrators .
We know of times when people sat cross - legged holding up peace signs had rubber bullets fired at them .
Journalists were manhandled , thrown to the ground , beaten with batons or punched in the face or gut , which happened to Jesse Rosenfeld ( writing for the British paper The Guardian ) and our own Jesse Freeston at The Real News .
The public has a right to know whether police are or are not abusing their powers .
And the public ca n’t know this without professional journalists with the courage to report from the centre of the storm .
These journalists must be able to stand their ground if police try to move them , and the law must protect their right to do so .
Without this , we are on our way to a police state .
Canadians are still processing the Toronto protest .
What happened with the $ 1 billion the federal government is spending on security ?
Are the people of Ontario going to put up with the Public Works Protection Act , implemented quietly for the G - 20 ?
Will they accept the principle that the police can declare any protest or demonstration an illegal assembly ?
Will they demand full accountability from politicians and the police ?
If the protest marked a turning point for the city , then it also marked a turning point for the world .
If the Toronto G - 20 is the shape of things to come , then people faced with drastic reductions in their living standards will be denied their freedom of speech and assembly at the snap of a police officer ’s or politician ’s fingers .
The firing of those rubber bullets should be a shot heard round the world .

If you rewind the clock by just 12 months , Apple ’s flagship iPhone was king of the hill in the Australian smartphone market .
One year ago – almost to the day – the iPhone 3GS went on sale at well - attended midnight launches around the country , with Apple fans lining up in the freezing cold alll night to be the first to claim the new device and take advantage of its speed benefits and added features .
The TV cameras were there , McDonald ’s next door did a roaring trade , and even the Chaser boys showed up to take the piss .
The iPhone 3G had kicked off proceedings a year before , stealing 5.8 percent of mobile phone sales in its first three months and bringing the dollars rolling in for Apple Australia .
By October 2009 , that share was up to 21 percent , and it seemed the iPhone could do no wrong .
But oh , how quickly the tables can turn .
Today , just one year later in mid-2010 , many in Australia ’s mobile industry believe the iPhone no longer holds the crown as the dominant smartphone platform .
A new challenger has arisen – Google ’s Android operating system – and like the Hydra of Greek mythology , its multiple heads make it a treacherous rival for Apple to slay .
In Australia ’s early adopter technology market , an ongoing and vibrant discussion is constantly taking place about which elite Android - based handset is the best , from which carrier , and which applications can mimick or even exceed the capabilities offered by the iPhone .
In Australia ’s development market , many software houses already simultaneously build apps for both platforms .
And the ability for telcos and handset manufacturers to build their own devices using Google ’s software is spawning a vast wave of Android handsets hitting the Australian market – in all form factors , with features as varying as the stars .
There are still many questions on Australians minds about Android , however .
The first one might be something like ‘ How did it gain so much local momentum so far ? ’
Others ponder just what the real situation is on the street – what Android ’s powerbase really is , and what ’s next for the Google platform in Australia .
This article will attempt to begin to answer some of those queries .
Opening moves
The first Android - based phone to be released in Australia was the HTC Dream – known internationally as the G1 .
After weeks of fevered speculation and some three months after the handset launched in the US , the Dream came to Australia first on Optus ’ network .
The launch of the Dream did much to build on Optus ’ reputation as a carrier with its finger on the pulse of consumer sentiment when it came to smartphones .
The SingTel subsidiary had stolen a march on its rivals the previous year by nabbing what one Optus executive described as “ the lion ’s share ” of iPhone sales , and the expansion into the Android platform was the next step .
But the handset would turn out to be a disappointment .
As CNET.com.au noted in its review at the time , customers who visited their local Optus store to see the device would need to “ brace yourself for an underwhelming first contact ” .
The Android operating system was good – but HTC ’s first attempt to build hardware for the device was a disappointment .
The poor battery life was particularly a problem , and call quality was similarly bad .
A number of other Android handsets were announced for the Australian market in 2009 – although some , such as Melbourne manufacturer Kogan ’s Agora Pro , never quite made it .
The HTC Magic came Down Under and got better ratings than the Dream – but the device still lagged behind the iPhone 3G , and it was clearly not a match for the 3GS .
With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy in September , Australia ’s Android market took another lurch forward , but again , as long - time CNET.com.au reviewer Joseph Hanlon pointed out , the device was n’t quite up to speed .
The multimedia features the consumer market loved were n’t in the device , while the business features were n’t quite there either .
The HTC Hero rectified many of these mistakes in December – but adoption was hamstrung due to the fact that it was not offered directly by carriers on plans , with customers being forced to pick it up through Harvey Norman .
For the time being , it seemed , Android in Australia had stalled .
Many of the big international Android handsets – such as Google ’s own Nexus One and Motorola ’s Droid – were n’t slated to come to Australia .
It looked like Apple would have the smartphone market in a stranglehold for the forseeable future .
But then came the bombshell Australia ’s Android market had been waiting for .
HTC finally came out with a powerful Android handset which would rival – and in some aspects , better – Apple ’s iPhone 3GS .
And Telstra , which had largely kept to the sidelines in the Australian battle for Android devices , pounced .
The turning point
Looking back , most people agree that the inflection point when Android in Australia changed from being an interesting early adopter oddity into a big deal was 6:30 AM in the morning on February 17 .
The location was Barcelona , Spain .
That was the date , time and location that Australia ’s biggest telco revealed it had won a three - month exclusive to bring HTC ’s brand new flagship handset – the Desire – down under .
And Telstra did n’t mince its word about its commitment to Android , describing the momentum as “ clearly there ” .
“ This is only the beginning for Telstra and Android smartphones and we will be pushing these aggressively in the market , ” a Telstra spokesperson said at the time .
HTC Australia and New Zealand sales and marketing director Anthony Petts says if the previous launches of the Hero and the Magic represented a “ progressive ” ramp - up of Android in Australia , launch of the Desire was when things went “ exponential ” .
“ The tipping point for us would have been the 14th , ” he says – the day in February when HTC revealed the Desire and its little sister , the Legend , which VHA is now selling in Australia .
“ I look back to that date , I can feel the wave , the excitement at Barcelona , ” he says .
“ You can feel that Android finally had the interest and the strength behind it to take to the next level . ”
The combination of the Desire ’s 800×400 AMOLED screen , speedy 1 Ghz Snapdragon CPU , HTC ’s Sense user interface built on top of Android 2.1 and Telstra ’s premium Next G network finally unlocked the Google operating systems full capabilities and put them on display .
And customers have been picking up the device in droves – even dumping the iPhone to do so .
The switchers
One Australian who switched quickly after Telstra launched the Desire in April was Louise Roberts ( pictured , below ) , the managing director of public relations agency Sphere PR , which she established in 2005 to represent technology clients ( such as MIA , which is mentioned in this article , which she manages through another firm , Einsteinz ) .
Roberts had previously been using an iPhone 3G for about 20 months with Optus .
If you talk to people in Australia ’s early adopter community , Roberts ’ story will be a familiar one .
Initially happy with the iPhone ’s robust email and web browsing capabilities and third - party apps , the executive eventually became frustrated by slow 3G speeds and dropped calls on what appears to be a clogged Optus 3G network in the Sydney CBD .
Telstra made Roberts an offer she could n’t refuse – $ 200 to get out of her Optus contract – and she picked up a new HTC Desire as part of the switch .
“ I did n’t want to wait for the new iPhone to come out , ” she says .
So away she went .
Roberts ’ experience with the Desire has overall been positive .
“ The browsing experience has been fantastic – it seems to be a lot faster than my iPhone , especially in the CBD , ” she says .
There are no more dropped calls , and access to email is faster , too .
One of the oft - cited differences between the Android and iPhone platforms is the maturity of Apple ’s App Store .
Roberts acknowledges there is a shortfall – with mobile apps normally arriving on the iPhone first .
But in general Roberts says she uses quite a few Android apps and is happy for them .
“ I use the currency thing quite a lot – I ’ve got a client that I bill in US dollars , so I use that , ” she says .
“ I use the racing application , my husband and I quite like going to the TAB . ”
She also uses the BBC News app , Facebook , and an app called Peep for twitter access .
“ And the Google services , that ’s basically got everything in it , ” she says .
“ Gmail , search , Picasa photos , YouTube , Google Earth and all that kind of thing .
Everything is in one place . ”
The executive even has apps for Formula One racing and Buddhist meditation .
The executive found getting used to the new interface “ quite challenging ” , with no real help from Telstra staff , but she picked it up fairly quickly , “ being in the tech sector ” .
And there are some things the Desire does that the iPhone does n’t .
In comparison with the iPhone , which Roberts says “ very much makes you display things how they want you to ” , the HTC Desire ’s Sense interface lets her have five or six different screens , with different things on them .
The executive also likes that she can simply shake the handset to turn down the volume of its ring , if she ’s in a meeting , and she has also used Google ’s Goggles application , which lets you take a photo of text , a landmark , a book cover or artwork , for example , to instantly retrieve more information about it .
Asked if she would ever switch back to an iPholne , Roberts says Apple ’s new device ( since this interview took place , Apple has launched the iPhone 4 ) would have to be “ pretty amazing ” .
“ I ’m looking forward to things developing on the Android platform , ” she says .
The next generation
The launch of the HTC Desire appears to have spurred a number of other carriers to enter the Australian marketplace , with a number of handsets already having launched in the first half of 2010 and a sledload more planned for later in the year .
It has seemed at times over the past few weeks as though the Android news has been coming thick and fast in Australia .
Vodafone revealed last week that it would bring Google ’s own Nexus
One down under , although there are no details around when or how the device – which has similar specifications to the Desire , and is also manufactured by HTC – will be launched .
Last week Samsung launched the high - end Samsung Galaxy S , with Optus to have a one - month exclusive on the handset – after that it will also be available from Telstra .
LG is bringing its first Android phone to the Australian market – the GW620 – and Telstra will also launch the LG Optimus handset .
Motorola appears to prefer to launch its products through Optus .
The manufacturer already has several Android phones out – the DEXT , the BACKFLIP and the Quench , and there are rumours Optus will also launch the Milestone , which has been sold internationally as the Droid .
Sony Ericsson has its Xperia X10 out , as well as the mini version .
It looks like HTC are planning to follow up its successful Desire and Legend launches by bringing the Wildfire – a lower - specced version of the Desire – down under as well .
Did we miss anyone ?
Speaking to the manufacturers themselves , all agree the Android platform has a strong momentum going for it in Australia .
And it ’s easy to see why .
Andrew Morley , Motorola ’s vice - president of marketing for Europe , Middle East , Africa , Russia and Asia , says the manufacturer has focused very heavily on Android .
“ All of our devices in Australia are Android , ” he says .
“ It ’s not as if we have three devices , and another operating system on another device and legacy devices . ”
One reason for that focus is the open and flexible nature of Android – Google lets every manufacturer use the operating system differently , tailoring it to their own needs while still building on the same base .
“ We ’ve always been a very strong advocate of open platforms , ” Morley says .
One of the things that we like about Android is that it is so open and it is so flexible — building the eco-system and good healthy competition . ”
Where Motorola has focused on building social networking functionality into its Android devices , Sony Ericsson is pushing hard into an area it has long been comfortable with – multimedia .
One of the flagship features on the Xperia X10 is Mediascape – software which dramatically enhances Android ’s native media capabilities when it comes to music , movies , TV shows and so on .
The company ’s head of marketing for the Asia - Pacific region , Tim Barnes , says sales of the Xperia X10 have exceeded the company ’s expectations .
And again , he ’s a fan of Android ’s openness .
“ One of the great things about android is that it is an open platform and that it enables device manufactuers to put their look and feel on the phone , ” he says .
“ I think we ’ll see a continuing focus as well from SE moving forward on the Android platform . ”
The eco-system
The final piece of the puzzle is the development community .
The iPhone taught the market early that mobile apps can make or break a smartphone platform .
Is Australia ’s development community up to creating Android software ?
According to one executive – Jon Mooney ( pictured ) , the chief operating officer of mobile developer MIA International – which has 60 staff and its Australia as well as offices overseas – it already is .
MIA counts companies like Telstra , Optus , Vodaone , Warner Music Australia , ninemsn and more among its clients and Mooney says Android has momentum at the moment .
“ There is huge interest in the Android platform at the moment , ” he says .
Where MIA used to develop an app for the iPhone platform , Mooney says , now customers want the same app to be on Android as well .
“ The Android development community in Australia – I do n’t know the exact size , but it ’s growing , ” he says .
“ People who have developed for iPhone are developing for Android . ”
Mooney points out that Android devices are outselling the iPhone in the US , and while Australia is a bit behind , he expects that by October / November this year , there would be a huge amount of Android devices out in the Australian market – by different manufacturers , in different form factors – and potentially more than there are iPhones .
And the change has come fast .
“ If you talked to people six months ago about Android and the Google platform , nobody would have really known about it , ” he says .
Like the handset manufacturers , Mooney emphasises the openness of the Android platform when he talks about developing for it .
On the iPhone platform , “ everything has to go through the App Store or through Apple , ” he says , “ whereas Android gives the operators the choice to do their own things , the chance to maintain relationships with customers ” .
“ The speed to market is quicker .
That ’s not necessarily in the coding , but in the overall process .
You do n’t have to put [ the app ] in the marketplace , it can be available from somewhere else to download . ”
And like many people at the moment , Mooney mentioned the debate around Apple ’s rejection of what it deems as inappropriate applications from its App Store .
“ There ’s been a lot of stories about apps that they ’ve rejected along the way , ” he says .
The competition between the two platforms will only ever be good for consumers .
“ These two giants with $ 30 billion in spare cash each are looking at ways to please the customer , ” chuckles Kogan Technologies founder Ruslan Kogan , when asked about the mobile platform war .
“ You can see them battling it out as well .
Apple comes out and says we might be using Bing on our next versio nof the iPhone .
Google comes out and says we do n’t think we ’ll be updating Google Maps for the iPhone any more . ”
But ultimately Kogan , like a growing number of others in the Australian community , believes it ’s the power of Google ’s growing community and its utilisation of open source software that will help it win against Apple ’s relatively closed eco-system .
“ There ’s more people working on the code base for Android than Apple has on their [ entire ] payroll , ” he says , noting there has been quite a few Android releases in the past six months .
“ If you look at iPhone , there ’s been much fewer developments in that sense .
Apple relies on their internal staff to come up with suggestions and improvements . ”
Android looks like it ’s settling into a long run at the moment , but the next six months will see strong strong competition —
Apple ’s iPhone 4 will be launched in Australia in the next few weeks , and even Nokia has been making a lot of noise locally about its N8 device .
In the end , only time will tell just what the future of Google ’s operating system will hold down under .

The past year has seen both Sony and Samsung unveil tiny interchangeable lens cameras designed to compete with the Micro Four Thirds units from Panasonic and Olympus , and now Nikon 's getting in the game as well -- company president Makoto Kimura told Bloomberg Nikon will introduce a " new concept " mirrorless cameras with enhanced video functions as early as this year .
( That sort of sounds like the Canon G11 competitor with DSLR tech Nikon was hinting at earlier this year , but we can't tell if they 're the same . )
Kimura says that Nikon is " intensively " focused on developing the new mirrorless product as part of a plan to increase SLR revenue -- Nikon 's goal is to increase interchangeable lens camera sales a whopping 80 percent over the next three years .
That 's ambitious , but if Nikon can produce a tiny shooter with some of the D3S 's low - light capabilities and the ability to accept even a subset of its modern family of lenses , we do n't think it 's out of the question .
We 'll see what happens .

Under the bill , companies would be forbidden from using your cell phone 's geolocation information without your consent , and the same goes for information on your race , religious beliefs , or sexual orientation .
For most other information , a simple opt - out will keep that data — even data already collected — from being used .
Boucher chairs the House Subcommittee on Communications , Technology , and the Internet , and he has dealt with Internet issues for years ( he was a driving force behind the doomed attempt to patch the worst parts of the DMCA , as well ) ;
Stearns is the ranking member on the committee .
The two today released a " discussion draft " of their new privacy legislation in order to gauge Congressional and public opinion on its ideas .
Covered and sensitive
The bill is n't particularly long , and compared to laws in other countries , it 's not particularly strict .
But it does provide a decent privacy baseline in the US , providing limited protection for " covered information " and much tougher protection for " sensitive information . "
The bill makes a key distinction between the two kinds of data : covered information collection is " opt- out , " while sensitive information collection would become " opt - in " only .
According to the bill , covered information includes :
The first name or initial and last name
A postal address
A telephone or fax number
An e-mail address
Unique biometric data , including a fingerprint or retina scan
A Social Security number , tax identification number , passport number , driver 's license number , or any other government - issued identification number
A financial account number , or credit or debit card number , and any required security code , access code , or password that is necessary to permit access to an individual ’s financial account
Any unique persistent identifier , such as a customer number , unique pseudonym or user alias , Internet Protocol address , or other unique identifier , where such identifier is used to collect , store , or identify information about a specific individual or a computer
Companies and websites that disclose their data collection practices can harvest this data on the assumption that , by using the site , one has agreed to such collection .
But they are required to provide an opt - out option that would stop all such data collection and prevent the company from using even previously acquired data .
Sensitive information can't even be collected and stored in the first place without an explicit opt - in assent .
The bill defines sensitive information as :
Medical records , including medical history , mental or physical condition , or medical treatment or diagnosis by a health care professional
Race or ethnicity
Religious beliefs
Sexual orientation
Financial records and other financial information associated with a financial account , including balances and other financial information
Precise geolocation information
When it comes to that last one , the bill states that " a user ’s express opt - in consent to an application provider that relies on a platform offered by a commercial mobile service provider shall satisfy the requirements of this subsection . "
Aggregate and anonymous information can be collected without any privacy policy at all .
Salvation or devastation ?
The draft bill has only been out for a few hours , and its opponents are already issuing a call to arms .
The Progress & Freedom Foundation warns that " policymakers could unintentionally devastate the ' free ' Internet as we know it .
Because the Digital Economy is fueled by advertising and data collection , a ' privacy industrial policy ' for the Internet would diminish consumer choice in ad - supported content and services , raise prices , quash digital innovation , and hurt online speech platforms enjoyed by Internet users worldwide . "
Groups like the Center for Democracy & Technology have a different take .
" It has been almost a decade since Congress last considered consumer privacy legislation , " said CDT President Leslie Harris .
" Since that time , commercial collection and use of consumer information both online and off has increased exponentially .
Consumers deserve comprehensive privacy protection .
Today ’s release of the staff discussion draft of the Boucher - Stearns consumer privacy bill is the first step to achieving this important goal . "
As for Boucher , he sees the bill as ultimately pro-business .
" Our goal is to encourage greater levels of electronic commerce by providing to Internet users the assurance that their experience online will be more secure , " he said in a statement .
" That greater sense of privacy protection will be particularly important in encouraging the trend toward cloud computing .
" Online advertising supports much of the commercial content , applications and services that are available on the Internet today without charge , and this legislation will not disrupt this well established and successful business model .
It simply extends to consumers important baseline privacy protections . "
Long before Facebook got blamed for turning the concept of online privacy into a sick joke , I could tell that the Internet was going to make the control of one ’s personal information a challenge .
That moment arrived in the late 1990s , when I realized that my listed phone number , previously accessible only to those who knew enough about me to know where I lived and therefore which local phone book to check or which 411 operator to call , had become available to anyone capable of typing my name — and that ’s all — into an online database .
Well , it was a listed number , after all .
No great loss there .
But things have headed straight downhill since then .
Internet companies persuaded Congress to let them regulate themselves .
They promised to develop explicit policies covering to whom and under what circumstances they would share users ’ personal data , and stick to their promises .
They awarded each other seals of good privacy housekeeping , so we ’d trust them to safeguard our names , addresses , Social Security numbers and browsing habits .
What ’s the harvest ?
Scandal after scandal in which some big Internet service admits to having collected more data than it promised to , distributed it to people who should n’t have seen it , or let it get hacked in ways that were n’t supposed to happen .
All these failures expose innocent users to identity theft or other invasions of privacy .
Typically , the guilty company responds by sending forth a top executive to say “ We screwed up ” ( Google co-founder Sergey Brin ) or “ We just missed the mark ” ( Facebook ’s Mark Zuckerberg ) .
Facebook is the face of this problem because it has been a serial violator of fair practice .
The site purports to give its hundreds of millions of users “ control ” over how much of their personal information gets disclosed to strangers — name , birthday , likes and dislikes , gender , age , “ friends ” — but these controls are famous for being devilishly confusing and hard to use .
Worse , several times over the last year or so , Facebook has unilaterally reset users ’ preferences to make such information more public without their consent .
This behavior finally provoked the Electronic Privacy Information Center and other advocacy groups to file a complaint last month with the Federal Trade Commission , alleging that Facebook is deceiving its users .
The FTC has the matter under consideration .
Facebook responded by promising to simplify its settings .
Plainly it has a lot further to go .
I recently spent the better part of an hour tweaking the settings on my Facebook page , and I think I ’ve arranged it so that my personal information and that of my “ friends ” is open only to the extent I want it to be .
But for all I know , I ’ve actually exposed myself and the visitors to my page to wholesale identity theft by every resident of the Planet Zarg .
There ’s no easy way to tell .
Nor does that cover all the ways that information in Facebook accounts gets “ leaked ” to other sites , without any control by the users .
Some of this happens through external applications Facebook allows users to access through their accounts .
Some happens when outside websites collect user data from Facebook and compile it with the same users ’ data from other social networks or e-commerce sites .
In other words , while you think you ’re maintaining your privacy , your identity is leaking out to sites you do n’t even know about in ways you ca n’t possibly imagine .
As Balachander Krishnamurthy of AT&T Labs and Craig Wills of Worcester Polytechnic Institute showed in a 2009 paper , networking sites such as Facebook , MySpace and LinkedIn have done a poor job of shielding user information that might be accessed from their accounts by third - party sites .
This is the sort of “ leakage ” that ca n’t be commonly controlled by user settings , only by the websites themselves .
“ People are led to believe that they can make privacy settings and things will happen , ” Krishnamurthy told me .
“ But what happens underneath in the protocol exchange mechanism is something most people do n’t even know about and so would not be able to block . ”
Every time a popular online service rolls out a new feature , a new unforeseen potential opportunity for leakage arises .
“ We ’re always one privacy fiasco behind , ” says Ari Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology , another privacy watchdog .
There ’s a notion in cyberspace that we ’re more comfortable sharing information about ourselves publicly today than we used to be , and that ’s good .
One of Facebook ’s “ core principles , ” according to an op -ed Zuckerberg published last month in the Washington Post , is that “ a world that ’s more open and connected is a better world . ”
It ca n’t be a coincidence that the leading promoters of such ideas are executives hoping to profiteer from snarfing up free - floating private information , like Zuckerberg .
But there ’s no evidence that people have become more comfortable about letting their personal information loose .
A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that 44 % of young users of social networking sites ( those 18 to 29 ) took pains to limit the personal information they disclose online , compared with 33 % of users aged 30 to 49 and 20 % of those aged 65 and older .
They had also done more than older users to tighten their privacy settings .
I doubt most people regard an entirely “ open and connected ” world with unalloyed glee , as Zuckerberg contends .
Think about your high school or college graduating class — do you really want to hear from everybody in it right now , much less share your current address with them ?
And by the way , how many “ friends ” on your Facebook page are really friends , as opposed to randomly interconnected strangers of no value or interest to you ?
They are , however , extremely valuable to the proprietors of Facebook , Linked In , et al. , and extremely interesting to those sites ’ commercial partners .
That brings us to a facet of social networking that users often overlook :
They are not the sites ’ customers ; they ’re the merchandise .
The real customers are the advertisers and the aggregators who suck up the data on the users and use it to target commercial come - ons more effectively .
When Mark Zuckerberg promises , as he did in his op - ed , that “ We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone , ” he ’s giving the game away .
Of course it ’s free for users — why would he want to discourage the cattle from walking into the abattoir ?
Because Facebook earns money from business partners thirsting for knowledge about its users , “ Facebook ’s incentives will always be to expose as much personal information as it can , ” says Marc Rotenberg , EPIC ’s director .
He says the answer is regulation to require that users opt in to every disclosure of personal information , rather than letting the sites expose the data unless the user opts out .
Remember the New Yorker cartoon of a dog at a computer remarking , “ On the Internet , nobody knows you ’re a dog ” ?
That was in 1993 .
In 2010 , lots of people would know he ’s a dog , what breed he is , who his owners are , where they live , and what they bought each other for Christmas .
But he would n’t know they knew .
And that ’s where the danger lies .

Forget the four out of five dentists who recommend Trident … .
Try the 97 out of 100 scientists that believe in man-made climate change .
This data comes from a new survey out this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study found that 97 percent of scientific experts agree that climate change is " very likely " caused mainly by human activity .
The report is based on questions posed to 1,372 scientists .
Nearly all the experts agreed that it is " very likely that anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been responsible for most of the unequivocal warming of the Earth 's average global temperature in the second half of the twentieth century . "
Click here for an interactive graphic that shows how global warming occurs .
As for the 3 percent of scientists who remain unconvinced , the study found their average expertise is far below that of their colleagues , as measured by publication and citation rates .
In the study , the authors wrote : " This extensive analysis of the mainstream versus skeptical / contrarian researchers suggests a strong role for considering expert credibility in the relative weight of and attention to these groups of researchers in future discussions in media , policy , and public forums regarding anthropogenic climate change . "
The study authors were William R.L. Anderegg , James W. Prall , Jacob Harold and Stephen H. Schneider .
The report comes as the Earth continues to sizzle in 2010 .
So far , through May , 2010 is the warmest year ever recorded , according to the National Climatic Data Center .

Explaining the background of the current Gay Friendly Helsinki campaign , Hanna Muoniovaara , the Marketing Manager , of the campaign , says that Helsinki has already promoted itself among gay communities of different countries , hoping to attract a new class of tourists with ample spending power .
Having noticed that Helsinki ’s biggest competitors in the tourist business , Stockholm and Copenhagen , have been more active in promoting themselves among the gay , lesbian , and transgender tourists , the Finnish capital decided to follow suit .
Gay - Friendly Business Network Established
To give credence to the campaign , the city ’s tourist officials worked to set up a network of businesses committed to fair treatment of gays , both in their hiring policies , as well as customer service .
HESETA chairwoman Kerttu Tarjamo feels that Helsinki is worthy of the title , in spite of occasional outbreaks of homophobia .
" I think Helsinki is relatively friendly .
There are many gay people in Helsinki who have moved from other places , because you can live relatively freely , and there is less prejudice .
I think we 're somewhere in the middle .
We 're going in a better direction , but definitely it is not the worst . "
Gay Culture More Open than Before
When Gay Gambrini , Helsinki 's first gay club opened up in the mid-1980s , the main entrance was discreetly located in the back of the building , allowing customers and staff to come and go without drawing too much attention to themselves .
Today , there are quite a few gay bars and clubs in Helsinki , with establishments feeling no need to conceal their character .
" Especially in the past few years , we have a very lively gay community in Helsinki - we have places to gather .
Also I think that an active campaign about being gay friendly will positively affect attitudes of people who live here ” , Kertto Tarjamo says .
Attacks “ Aberrations ”
The pepper spray and smoke bomb attack against the Helsinki Pride event a week ago Saturday , and the attack against HESETA headquarters Thursday night were seen as aberrations , but they also indicate that homophobia has not gone away .
" Of course we were shocked about it , because nothing like that has happened in the past ten years or so .
In Finland most people respect the right to express opinions , so from that point of view it is a setback , but also it shows that we take more space .
The more we are seen , the more there will be statements against us , ” says Kerttu Tarjamo on the attack against the Helsinki Pride event .
The gas attack sparked sharp condemnation from President Tarja Halonen , and Kerttu Tarjamo is pleased that that Helsinki police are treating the attack as a serious hate crime .
" This particular event and the way that the police have handled it will have a positive effect on how police will react to hate crimes in the future . "
Homophobia a Bigger Problem in Some Countries
While many of the gay visitors to Finland come from countries that are relatively tolerant , others are under more pressure at home to stay in the closet .
" We have countries nearby where Pride events cannot be organised , or they are vandalised much more than our event was , so I hope that they will find their way to Helsinki and see that this is a safe haven for them as well . "
For Hanna Muoniovaara , the ultimate aim is to make a separate designation of " gay friendly " unnecessary :
" The main aim is that nobody has to have these labels such as gay friendly , but as it still is such a sensitive subject , that we need to talk about it .
I hope that all companies will be gay friendly in Helsinki , and that it would spread out to the whole country . "
First you hear the wail of a siren - like synth , which is quickly followed by a chorus of female voices yelping in syncopation to a strutting beat .
In these initial moments , it could be Girls Aloud or the Pussycat Dolls , or any one of a host of less well - known Anglo - American girl bands -- but in fact the group is 4 minute , one of the stars of South Korea 's homegrown K - pop scene .
Singing in a mix of Korean and English , the polyglot 4 Minute also bear the dubious distinction of having reopened the propaganda war between North and South Korea .
Following the sinking of the Cheonan warship earlier this year , the South has resumed radio broadcasts and installed 11 loudspeaker points along the demilitarised zone that separates the two countries .
Radio and loudspeaker broadcasts to the North -- which largely attempt to convince subjects of Kim Jong - Il 's authoritarian regime to defect by boasting about higher living standards -- form one element of the low - level conflict that has simmered between the two countries ever since the Korean War ended in stalemate in 1953 .
As relations between the neighbours warmed , in 2003 the South suspended its " psychological warfare " campaign .
It was resumed last month , however , launched by 4 Minute 's song " Huh " and provoking a threat from the North Korean regime to turn South Korea 's capital , Seoul , into a " sea of flame " .
But who are the ultimate targets of this propaganda ?
The number of North Koreans it will reach is unclear , given that in 2003 the broadcasts were described as " virtually ineffective " by South Korea 's Hangyore newspaper , but the song has now been relayed around the world 's media countless times .
" Huh " , in the words of Bloomberg News , is a " pop song extolling freedom of choice " .
And indeed it is , if by choice you mean a rigid adherence to the norms of consumer culture .
( A typical lyric translates as : " When I say I want to appear on TV , when I say I want to become prettier , everybody says I can't do it .
Baby , you 're kidding me ?
I do as I please . " )
The 4 - hour radio broadcast that followed " Huh " also included a taunt about North Korea 's devastating famine of the late 1990s and its ongoing food shortages .
South Koreans , said the presenter , are more worried about getting fat than starving to death .
" Huh " is a fitting accompaniment to this charming statement .
Boasting a glut of flashy production techniques , the very song itself sounds obese : the lead melodies are swimming in reverb , vocal harmonies are layered one on top of another , cymbals , kick drum and distorted bass combine to give a pumped - up , aggressive thrust .
In keeping with much pop music , its underlying message is simple and perhaps even a little threatening .
Much like when bankers meet with the chancellor of the Exchequer , the message is : keep the party going -- or else .
Crude enough , but as Walter Benjamin averred , there has never been a document of culture that is not simultaneously one of barbarism .
Just ask Alex , the delinquent protagonist of Anthony Burgess 's novel A Clockwork Orange , who sneers at the idea that he will be reformed by listening to Beethoven :
Civilized my syphilised yarbles .
Music always sort of sharpened me up , O my brothers , and made me feel like old Bog himself , ready to make with the old donner and blitzen and have vecks and ptitsas creeching away in my ha ha power .
Ha ha power indeed .

This proposition purports to offer free apple pie .
You may like apple pie .
But do n’t be fooled .
This is not apple pie .
It ’s a crab apple tart .
The tart tactic is in play by business interests and conservative ideologues against Proposition 25 on the November ballot .
The initiative is sponsored by public employee unions and endorsed by the League of Women Voters .
The measure would reduce the Legislature ’s herculean vote requirement for budget passage from a two - thirds to a simple majority .
The two - thirds hurdle is the single biggest cause of dysfunction in the state Capitol .
Just two other states — Arkansas and Rhode Island — require a two - thirds budget vote .
California is the only state that mandates a two - thirds vote for both budgets and taxes .
Advertisement
Prop. 25 would retain the two - thirds vote for tax increases .
It also would decree that if legislators did n’t pass a budget by the rarely met June 15 constitutional deadline , they ’d forfeit all salary and expense reimbursements for each day they dallied .
“ This is a clear , simple reform , ” says campaign manager Richard Temple .
Not so fast , contend opponents .
It ’s not what it seems .
Advertisement
They argue that Prop. 25 also could allow tax increases to be passed on a majority vote .
Now it starts to get confusing .
The opposition ’s thesis is that if a tax hike funded a budget appropriation , it could be approved on a majority vote .
That ’s because of a clause in the measure that states : “ Notwithstanding any other provision of law … bills providing for appropriations related to the budget may be passed [ by ] a majority . ”
Prop. 25 is “ a fraud on the voters , ” says opposition attorney Steve Merksamer , a longtime initiative lawyer for business interests .
“ It ’s misleading . ”
Advertisement
Nonsense , counter the supporters .
Right in the proposition ’s “ purpose and intent ” section it reads : “ This measure will not change the two - thirds vote requirement for the Legislature to raise taxes . ”
But Merksamer says that is superseded by the “ notwithstanding any other provision ” language .
“ Unbelievable and incorrect , ” responds Prop. 25 ’s attorney , veteran Democratic and initiative lawyer Lance Olson .
The routine “ notwithstanding ” clause was included to differentiate between budget and non-budget appropriations , Olson says .
“ Courts look at the intent language and at the intent of the voters .
Can you imagine a court saying , ‘ No matter what voters meant …?’
No court would do that . ”
Advertisement
The legislative analyst , in a Prop. 25 overview to be included in the official voter information guide , tells the public that the measure ’s intent is to leave the two - thirds tax vote unchanged .
And the tentative ballot label that voters will see , written by Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , proclaims that the measure “ retains [ the ] two - thirds vote requirement for taxes . ”
Do n’t be surprised if Merksamer challenges that in court .
Opponents also claim to have found another flaw in the proposal :
It would deny voters the right to repeal budget - related acts through the referendum process .
They essentially do n’t have that right now .
But , critics argue , at least the bills currently require a two - thirds vote .
That trade - off — making a bill hard to pass but exempting it from voter repeal — no longer would exist .
Money bills would be easier to pass and still could n’t be repealed .
Advertisement
Then there ’s a third claim that seems far - fetched :
On a majority vote , legislators could boost their per diem pay to compensate for lost wages when budgets were late .
And then they ’d face mass recall .
“ They ’re trying to scare people into contributing [ money ] to the ‘ no ’ side , ” says Prop. 25 spokesman Richard Stapler .
If a Legislature ever did try to play games like the ones the opponents assert , Stapler adds , someone “ would go to a judge faster than you could say ‘ lawyer . ’
And the Legislature would be on the losing end . ”
Advertisement
“ The things they talk about are so absurd they ’re laughable . ”
But one legitimate concern of opponents is that legislators could merely pass a bogus , half - baked budget by the deadline to preserve their pay , then slumber into summer in stalemate on a real deal .
That would be unconscionable if only a majority vote were needed .
Yet , almost anything would be better than the current system of minority - party tyranny and insufferable gridlock .
Vendors are stiffed .
Bond ratings fall .
And state spending actually rises .
Advertisement
In the mid-1990s , a bipartisan citizens commission concluded : “ There is no evidence [ the two - thirds vote ] does anything to slow the increase in state spending .
Instead , it encourages horse trading [ and ] pork - barrel legislation ....
Stories abound of ‘ buying ’ votes to reach the two - thirds . ”
Business interests benefit from the horse trading .
Skilled lobbyists broker the needed GOP votes to open tax loopholes and provide other goodies for their clients .
They love the two - thirds vote .
So do Republican legislators .
It makes them relevant as hostage - takers .
The latest nonpartisan Field poll shows that likely voters overwhelmingly support the measure , 65 % to 20 % .
This includes 58 % of Republicans .
Advertisement
But opposition strategist Rick Claussen logically surmises that this is because the proposal would punish legislators financially if they failed to pass an on - time budget .
“ A lot of Republicans think ‘ My God , this is exactly what I ’ve wanted to do , ’ ” he says .
“ We ’ve got to convince them this is a sham ” — crab apple .
But it ’s actually apple pie — just what it seems .

From Robert Kennedy
Jr , we learned that BP has huge economic dis-incentives to clean up the oil .
Let ’s say that better — it has huge economic incentives to keep the seas dirty .
That story is here .
Now , thanks to Keith Olbermann on Countdown , we learn that dehydrated peat moss is an excellent way to soak up oil :
[ D]ehydrated peat moss [ is ] not only capable of soaking up crude , which does not leak out afterwards , but microbes inside the moss break down the oil as well .
But BP wo n’t use this solution , which has been around for years :
The owner of the peat moss company [ told The Globe and Mail newspaper that ]
BP has informed him it cannot use peat moss because the oil giant would not then be able to retrieve the oil afterwards .
And you may translate that as : the oil giant would not be able to sell the oil afterwards .
Money , folks .
The beast wants only money .

Team Change — can we have some now please ?

The bedraggled immigrants were picking their way through the boulders and scrub when a group of heavily armed men descended on them just short of the California - Mexico border .
They corralled them in a cave and pointed their guns on the 10 men and one woman .
These lawless badlands in the hills east of Tijuana have long teemed with bandits and rapists , but these criminals demanded only phone numbers .
They started calling the immigrants ’ loved ones in Pomona , San Diego and Bakersfield :
Send us money or we ’ll shoot , they said .
The days - long kidnapping ordeal in May illustrates a growing trend as roaming gangs of well - organized , heavily armed gunmen turn their sights on illegal immigrants , making a treacherous journey ever more dangerous for people trekking north .
In the spree of kidnappings , which began about two years ago , gunmen hold people captive until family members in the U.S. send wire transfers of up to $ 5,000 to accounts in Mexico .
Some immigrants are beaten ; several have been killed , including a pair of brothers from Mexico City .
Many straggle across the border and turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents .
Others end up in migrant shelters in Tijuana , too frightened to report the cases to Mexican police .
Little was known about how the criminals operate until Mexican authorities dismantled two gangs in recent months , including the one in May , when 11 suspects were arrested after a shootout and a wild foot chase through the hills .
The arrests provided authorities with a rare glimpse into criminal networks whose reach stretches from the border to cities across the U.S. and Mexico .
The gang was allegedly run by a career criminal from Nayarit and included a former Mexican army soldier .
They admitted kidnapping more than 100 immigrants over 18 months , holding them in remote caves , makeshift camp and ranches .
“ We threatened the families that if they did n’t pay we would kill the immigrants , ” said Jose Flores Romero , the alleged ring leader , in his statement to detectives , referring to the abductions in May .
Authorities believe several gangs continue to operate .
With a network of lookouts scattered at key points across 60 miles of rugged , isolated terrain , few immigrants slip by without them knowing about it .
“ They know all the trails leading to the border , from Tijuana to Tecate and the La Rumorosa ” mountain range , said Fermin Gomez , a Baja California assistant attorney general .
“ They know exactly where they ’re going , how many are walking , and they ’re all intercepted . ”
The current situation resulted from a convergence of factors in the U.S. and Mexico that put increasing pressure on the traditional human smuggling groups in the area , according to authorities in both countries .
Organized - crime bosses in Tijuana , squeezed by a drug war , demanded higher payoffs , while U.S. authorities , adding fencing and staffing on the border , were making it more difficult to get immigrants through .
With a smuggling infrastructure already in place , it was easy and profitable for criminals to switch to kidnapping .
Federal authorities in the U.S. immediately noticed the dangerous trend .
Many immigrants began showing up at the border , seeking medical attention instead of eluding agents .
“ They ’re traumatized , ” said Robert C. Rodgers , a supervisor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego , which investigates smuggling groups in the area .
“ They jump the fence into the U.S. looking for help . ”
The journeys start out straightforward enough .
In Tijuana , recruiters scour fleabag motels that house immigrants waiting to cross the border .
Offering safe passage , the recruiters transport the immigrants to staging areas in the ranchlands east of the city .
Many of the recruiters and drivers are women who bring along their children to put the immigrants at ease .
At the staging areas , foot guides lead the immigrants into the mountains , down well - worn paths , into the hands of gunmen .
“ For the guides it ’s a win - win proposition :
They do n’t have to cross the border , or risk being captured by the Border Patrol , and they still get paid , ” one Mexican federal agent said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media .
The deception does n’t end there .
One gang , arrested in April , would plant a member in the group of immigrants .
When asked for a telephone number , he would immediately provide it and be rewarded with good treatment .
Other immigrants , seeking to avoid beatings , would do the same .
“ You ’ve saved yourself , ” the kidnapper told a gang member disguised as an immigrant , according to one victim in a videotaped interview with authorities that shielded his identity .
“ He acted like an immigrant , but we found out later that he was n’t .
We realized that they had never hit him . ”
In the kidnapping incident in May , 11 immigrants were walking through the hills off the Tecate - Tijuana toll road when they were confronted at gunpoint .
They were stripped , tied up and watched over by several gunmen while their families were contacted and ordered to wire $ 2,000 to gang associates in Mexico .
A couple of days later , Mexican authorities stumbled upon the gang during a routine patrol .
In the ensuing gun battle , a Tecate deputy police chief was wounded in the leg by AK - 47 gunfire .
The group was eventually captured , and members led police to the alleged ring leader , Flores .
The highly publicized arrests have made immigrants aware of the dangers .
Cupartin Sanchez , 27 , interviewed at an immigrant shelter in Tijuana , said several smugglers had promised to get him across the border .
He does n’t trust any of them , so he ’s going home to Guerrero .
“ I ’m not scared of the Border Patrol , ” Sanchez said , “ but I am scared of the kidnappers . ”

Julian Assange 's remarkable service to truth , transparency and democracy are appreciated on the ground in Afghanistan .
Yet there was little in the WikiLeaks revelations that came as a surprise to Afghans and the local media mostly refrained from commenting , limiting their effort to reporting news of the publication of secret files .
Only a few papers tried to take a clear stance in reaction to the story .
This silence could be interpreted in different ways .
Given that the WikiLeaks revelations primarily compromise Afghanistan 's key ally in Washington by showing that the US army has little regard for civilian casualties , the papers might have feared backlash by the Kabul administration and hence refrained from comment to avoid confrontation .
Alternatively , the silence might have a mundane explanation : nothing in the published secret files was news to Afghans .
If anything , the WikiLeaks files substantiated Afghan authorities ' much - repeated concern that the neighbouring states played a key role in systematically undermining Nato 's efforts in Afghanistan .
In the words of presidential spokesman Wahid Omer , " the sheer number of the reports might be surprising , but not so their content " .
The spokesman added : " There are two issues that appear repeatedly in the secret files and that are a matter of concern to us : the issue of civilian casualties and the role of the Pakistani intelligence ISI in actively undermining stability in Afghanistan . "
Echoing his words , the pro-government Hewad daily said the WikiLeaks revelations substantiated the Afghan authorities ' views that the root - causes of terrorism were not Afghan , but lay elsewhere , outside of the country .
The paper added that the reports prove President Hamid Karzai right that little has been done to protect Afghan civilians ' lives and property .
Among the few papers that commented was the independent daily Hasht-e Sobh .
In an editorial entitled " The secrets that were not so secret after all " , the paper said : " Despite much international uproar , hype and fuss , there is hardly anything in the reports that we have not yet known about . "
Islamabad 's active and determined support for the Taliban and other terrorist groups that create horrific violence in Afghanistan ; the fact that the Taliban have now gained access to advanced weaponry or that the ISI staff attend terrorists ' meetings and provide them with logistic , financial and moral support are issues that ordinary people and Afghan authorities have long suspected and known about it .
In the words of Hasht-e Sobh : " If anything , Pakistani authorities have hardly tried to conceal all this . "
For Afghans , the more pertinent question that arises from the WikiLeaks revelations is the degree in which Kabul 's international allies have been aware of Pakistan 's involvement in actively undermining Nato 's success in Afghanistan .
Hasht-e Sobh was sceptical about Washington 's innocence : " To assume that by carrying out such secret activities Pakistan has been trying to fool Washington is naive if not downright silly . "
But what about the rest of the Nato countries whose troops are currently based in Afghanistan ?
In the words of Hasht-e Sobh : " Bearing in mind that throughout the many years of the jihad against the Soviets the international community has been working together and sharing intelligence , and the fact that they had chosen Pakistan to act on their behalf and fight the Soviets on the ground in Afghanistan , we find it hard to believe that the revelations have taken them fully by surprise . "
Like Hasht-e Sobh , the Afghan daily , Khedmatgar , suspected that contrary to all appearances , the publishing of the secret files was in fact approved by Washington and represented an attempt to pressurise Islamabad , forcing it to cut ties to terrorist groups .
The paper said that prior to the WikiLeaks revelations , US secretary of state Hillary Clinton had publicly announced that the leaders of al - Qaida and the Haqqani network were hiding in Pakistan .
The paper insinuated that such announcements were a preparation for the subsequent WikiLeaks revelations .
In other words , Washington 's public denunciation of WikiLeaks was only a cover for a US publicity campaign to morally undermine Pakistan , forcing it to come clean about its game of double standards .
Given that of late the Afghan government and the Afghan people in general have been held singularly responsible for the failure of democracy in Afghanistan , the WikiLeaks reports are both a source of concern and relief for most Afghans .
Concern because the reports show that the outcome of the war is likely to be shaped largely by hostile regional powers with little interest in a stable Afghanistan supported by the international community .
Relief because the reports show evidently that the idea it is the Afghans ' warrior - like nature and their culture of extremism that is solely responsible for the violence does n't stand scrutiny .
Such cultural - relativism theories were increasingly gaining ground , particularly in leftwing and liberal press in the US and European countries .
But as WikiLeaks reports show , the truth is that though Afghan corruption is certainly undermining stability , the financial and logistical support that has led to the killing of foreign troops and disillusionment of the public in the west comes from states who have strategic reasons for turning Nato 's mission in Afghanistan into a failure .
In other words , even though Afghans play a role in their own misery , the active support for the war comes from elsewhere .
Perhaps the most important aspect of the WikiLeaks revelations is that they show the Afghan conflict is still international in character and the success or failure of Nato 's mission is likely to be determined by powers that operate outside of Kabul .
Afghanistan has always paid a high price for its strategic geo-political position , and this , too , is old news to Afghans .
The best user interface anticipates actions that you want to perform and never gets in your way .
When planning out the new tabbed browsing features for Firefox 4 , this principle guided our focus .
One of the things we think Google Chrome really nailed is its tab closing behavior : when you close a tab with the mouse , the remaining tabs shift or resize so that the next tab ’s close tab button moves right under your cursor .
This way , you can click the same spot to close the next tab .
Back in December , Basil Safwat wrote a fantastic piece , full of screenshots , that details these behaviors .
We ’re working on implementing this in Firefox , so it will be super easy to close a whole row of tabs without moving your cursor a pixel :
[ YouTube HTML5 ( if available ) ]
We are also taking it a step further and including support for the tab overflow mode that Firefox has had for a while .
No matter how your tabs scroll and move and resize , you can always count on the close button being in the right location when you need to close them :
[ YouTube HTML5 ( if available ) ]
Finally , let ’s talk about a design decision made in Firefox ’s earlier days : we placed the tab close buttons on the right side of each tab for all platforms , including OS X .
To some people , this seems to break with the design of Apple ’s platform , since Safari and OS X windows have close buttons on the left side instead .
( It ’s also worth noting that several of Apple ’s applications have the close button on the right too — iChat , Pages and Automator all do this in various parts of their UI . )
Now imagine if we put the close buttons on the left .
With that configuration , when closing the rightmost tab , we would have to shift the remaining tabs to the right to move the next close button to the same place , leaving an awkward gap on the left side of the tab bar .
Placing the close button on the right ( for left - to - right locales ) is the more intuitive choice .
Another important aspect we have found is that favicons on tabs are the primary way people identify and navigate tabs , so we give them prominent placement .
This optimized close / resize behavior is just one of the many improvements to tabbed browsing we ’re working on .
Be sure to check out other new tabbed browsing features in upcoming Firefox 4 betas !
AFTER five years of stalemate , a compromise between Hong Kong 's democrats and Chinese officials has paved the way for the approval of fiercely debated political reforms by the territory 's legislature .
This spares the local government potential embarrassment .
It will allow a majority of legislators to be elected by popular vote for the first time in Hong Kong 's history .
For China , too , these will be uncharted waters .
Noisy demonstrations by hundreds of people outside the Legislative Council , or Legco , building in central Hong Kong suggested that the package will not end political feuding over the pace of democratic reform .
The demonstrators accused the Democratic Party , the biggest pro-democracy group , of abandoning its principles by supporting the compromise .
As The Economist went to press , Legco was still debating the most controversial reforms , of the next Legco election in 2012 , but had approved changes to the election for the chief executive in the same year .
Of Legco 's 60 members only a dozen or so were expected to vote against the Legco - related motion .
Objectors say the package fails to spell out how Hong Kong will eventually achieve full democracy .
One Democratic Party legislator quit the party in protest .
Yet the concessions made by the Chinese and Hong Kong government are more striking .
The reforms will increase the number of Legco seats to 70 in the next elections .
Five of the new seats will be directly elected , representing geographical constituencies .
The other five will represent district councils , which look after local issues such as cultural events and environmental projects .
Originally China had opposed any change in the equal split in Legco between geographical seats and those for “ functional constituencies ” , returned by business , professional and other interest groups .
Members chosen by functional constituencies are mostly pro-government .
Their votes , added to those of the handful of directly elected pro-government legislators , ensure that on most issues the government and its backers in Beijing get their way .
Pro-democracy politicians demand that functional constituencies be scrapped by 2020 , which is when China has promised “ universal suffrage ” for Legco elections .
China is reluctant to abolish them .
But during talks with Democratic Party leaders on June 20th , a senior Chinese official agreed to the party 's proposal for the five new seats reserved for district councillors to be chosen by a much bigger electorate .
The candidates would be nominated by district councillors , but everyone who does not have a vote in another functional constituency ( about 93 % of the electorate ) would be allowed to pick the winners .
Arcane and trivial though it sounds , this was a remarkable turnaround from earlier Chinese hints .
Officials probably worried that if they did not concede the point , the political - reform package might be rejected by Legco .
Changes in voting arrangements need the support of two - thirds of legislators , which in effect gives the pro-democracy camp a veto .
In 2005 the government suffered a severe political blow when legislators turned down its first attempt at political reform .
The Democratic Party has been bitterly attacked by its ideological allies for abandoning its earlier insistence on popular elections for all seats in 2012 .
They say that by accepting an expanded electoral base for the district council - filled seats , the Democratic Party has implicitly endorsed the idea of functional constituencies , and made it even harder to persuade China to abolish them .
Approval of the package means Donald Tsang , Hong Kong 's chief executive , no longer has to worry about leaving office in 2012 having made no progress towards greater democracy .
That remains a stated goal of his and China 's governments , much as China clearly hopes to load the dice against democrats .
It is for Mr Tsang 's successor , and new leaders who will take over in China too in 2012 , to do battle with the democrats over the next steps .
Personal project ( 2009 )
I ’ve been known to have an unhealthy obsession with superheroes .
What began as childhood enthusiasm evolved into a love of sequential art , an appreciation for the branding and symbology of these characters , and an understanding of their function as modern mythology .
In this personal project , I sought to bridge my passions for illustration and design , capturing the essence of each character through bold shapes and colors .
The poster series celebrates the form , dynamism , and unique aesthetics of superheroes .
Each characters is represented with their iconic color palette , silhouette , and catchphrase or slogan .
Note :
Though I did sell these works as prints during 2010 and 2011 , they are no longer for sale and will not be reprinted .
The Daily Mail is n't exactly known for its progressive view of women .
Then again , neither are Russian men .
What happens when you bring the two together ?
Disaster .
Pure and simple .

In an article published on Tuesday , a doctor writing under the pseudonym Sergei Matrosov describes his " candid " view of British women .
The " fascinating , if sometimes uncomfortable " ( as the Daily Fail itself puts it ) article is basically one long complaint leveled against British women .
Particularly wealthy British women .
Especially wealthy British women who would like to have control over their birth .
Oh , and did we mention he 's a gynecologist ?
First of all , Dr. Matrosov makes it extensively clear which type of women he prefers :
In labor , Russian women are both more emotional and more patient .
They can be screaming , and swearing , and demanding a Caesarean and a full anaesthetic , but if they are asked to bear it , they will .
It is quite typical for an English woman to insist on a spinal anaesthesia after the very first contraction , and then lie with an absent face , reading a fashion magazine , until the business is done .

Hear that , Brits ?
Your women are total pussies .
With horrible - smelling feet ;
In Russia , hospitals expect women to bring their own clean socks .
Sadly the same is not true in Britain .
Sometimes , the stench is so bad we have to stop work and open all the windows .
You can't tell a woman : ' Wash your feet , darling . '
It might cause a court case and the English would see it as a rude intrusion into their privacy .
Matrosov goes on to criticize " high society " girls who come in demanding cosmetic surgery " on their vagina . "
Others come in with STDs , because " belonging to high society does n't guarantee a husband 's fidelity and monogamy , especially given an inflow of extremely beautiful and very friendly East European girls . "
Unfortunately for him , Matrosov is such a charmer that women can't help falling in love with him .
According to Matrosov , when women complain of being harassed or manipulated by their doctors , they 're really trying to say why does n't he love me ?
n Britain , women patients fall in love with their doctors at every step - especially psychotherapists , gynecologists and plastic surgeons .
Doctors pay for it by having their licence to practice withdrawn for ever .
The charges are often identical : the doctor ' seduced ' a patient by abusing her trust .
The verdict is harsh and means the end of his medical career .
Advertisement
By the end of his article , you almost wish he would come out and just say it already : British women are smelly , weak , awful sluts .
Russian women are tougher , wear cleaner socks , and are far more " friendly " and appealing to men .
The entire piece can be boiled down to these two sentences - neither of which have anything to do with the medical field .
Even for the Daily Mail this is a new low .
There is absolutely no merit to his rant , no logic , no insight contained within .
The entire purpose of printing a piece like this is to incite anger .
While Matrosov may believe the shit he 's spewing , the editors at the Daily Mail chose to run his anti-UK screed for ( we assume ) pure shock value .
It is poorly written , poorly edited , and poorly conceived .
And yet , it might just sell papers .
Misogyny - especially coming from an expert in the field - is deplorably marketable .
But ultimately , my biggest problem with the " article " is that it is written under a pseudonym .
British women deserve the right to know who to boycott .

El senador perredista Carlos Navarrete Ruiz dijo que esperaba el destape de Andrés Manuel López porque el tabasqueño no ha dejado de estar en campaña desde septiembre de 2006 , pero recordó que por ahora López Obrador es simplemente un precandidato más , que tendrá que someterse a las reglas que el PRD establezca para designar a su candidato presidencial en 2012 .
“ No hay sorpresas .
¿ Cómo las va haber , si Andrés Manuel tiene cuatro años recorriendo el país , buscando eso y diciéndolo .
Por lo menos para mi no hay sorpresas .
Es la consecución lógica de lo que Andrés ha venido haciendo desde septiembre de 2006 ” , explicó .
Carlos Navarrete Ruiz reiteró su aspiración presidencial , y anunció que una vez que deje la presidencia del Senado podría “ plantear cosas ” .
El perredista consideró que López Obrador tiene el derecho de abrir su aspiración y presentar su plataforma política rumbo a 2012 , pero dijo que en su momento las autoridades electorales y las dirigencias del Partido de la Revolución Democrática , el Partido del Trabajo y Convergencia puedan establecer reglas para sus precandidatos .
“ No es madruguete ; en esto no hay sorpresas , sino sorprendidos .
Andrés Manuel López Obrador es el primer precandidato de las izquierdas mexicanas rumbo al 2012 .
Bienvenido ” , comentó durante una rueda de prensa .
El integrante de la corriente Nueva Izquierda , opositora al movimiento lopezobradorista , felicitó a López Obrador por dejar claro su objetivo .
Navarrete Ruiz agregó que “ cada quien tiene sus ritmos y formas ” , por lo que pidió respetar a López Obrador , a quien , dijo , “ le gusta plebiscitar ” sus decisiones en el Zócalo capitalino .
“ Yo tengo otros estilos , será porque somos de diferentes lugares .
Por lo pronto , yo tengo una responsabilidad como senador de la república .
Andrés Manuel tiene la ventaja de estar libre , estar suelto , puede hacer lo que crea conveniente como ciudadano .
Yo soy senador de la República , soy coordinador parlamentario y por unas semanas más Presidente del Senado , entonces tengo que ser mucho más prudente ” , complementó el perredista .
López Obrador violó la ley : PRI
El secretario general del PRI , Jesús Murillo Karam , consideró que Andrés Manuel López Obrador viola la ley electoral al adelantarse y presentar su aspiración presidencial y su plataforma política rumbo a 2012 .
“ Es fundamental que todos los que somos políticos nos sujetemos a las normas que la propia ciudadanía se ha dado ” , consideró el legislador .
Given a 50/50 random chance choice of flag - labeled food boxes , Paul the Octopus has " picked " winners in the six World Cup games played by the German national soccer team .
CNN reporter Paul Armstrong thinks this means Paul the Octopus is psychic .
To quote Dave Barry , " I am not making this up . "
Can an octopus really be psychic ?
Michelle Childerley , who describes herself as an animal communications expert , told CNN that all animals — as well as humans — possess a psychic ability , with telepathy the main way of communicating among many species .
She says dogs can often sense what an owner wants before they vocalize it .
As for as Paul 's ability to predict a football result , Childerley claims the octopus is perfectly aware of what he is being asked .
" He 's picking up on what everyone around him is thinking , " she said .
" He knows there are two boxes which represent two sides , so he 's basically tuned in to the more positive team at the moment he makes his choice . "
Seriously .
A professional journalist at a publication that was not The Weekly World News wrote that .
And professional editors published it .

Re-armed and newly sensitive , RUBI was ready to test as a teacher .
In a paper published last year , researchers from the University of California , San Diego , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Joensuu in Finland found that the robot significantly improved the vocabulary of nine toddlers .
After testing the youngsters ’ knowledge of 20 words and introducing them to the robot , the researchers left RUBI to operate on its own .
The robot showed images on its screen and instructed children to associate them with words .
After 12 weeks , the children ’s knowledge of the 10 words taught by RUBI increased significantly , while their knowledge of 10 control words did not .
“ The effect was relatively large , a reduction in errors of more than 25 percent , ” the authors concluded .
Researchers in social robotics  a branch of computer science devoted to enhancing communication between humans and machines  at Honda Labs in Mountain View , Calif. , have found a similar result with their robot , a three - foot character called Asimo , which looks like a miniature astronaut .
In one 20 - minute session the machine taught grade - school students how to set a table  improving their accuracy by about 25 percent , a recent study found .
At the University of Southern California , researchers have had their robot , Bandit , interact with children with autism .
In a pilot study , four children with the diagnosis spent about 30 minutes with this robot when it was programmed to be socially engaging and another half - hour when it behaved randomly , more like a toy .
The results are still preliminary , said David Feil - Seifer , who ran the study , but suggest that the children spoke more often and spent more time in direct interaction when the robot was responsive , compared with when it acted randomly .
Making the Connection
In a lab at the University of Washington , Morphy , a pint - size robot , catches the eye of an infant girl and turns to look at a toy .
No luck ; the girl does not follow its gaze , as she would a human’s .
In a video the researchers made of the experiment , the girl next sees the robot “ waving ” to an adult .
Now she ’s interested ; the sight of the machine interacting registers it as a social being in the young brain .
She begins to track what the robot is looking at , to the right , the left , down .
The machine has elicited what scientists call gaze - following , an essential first step of social exchange .

WASHINGTON– Rep. Joe Barton , R - Tex , has plunged the Republican Party into turmoil with his blurted apology to the CEO of BP for what he called President Obama ’s “ shakedown ” of the oil giant , securing $ 20 billion to help victims of the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico .
With BP CEO Tony Hayward sitting in the witness chair during a June 17 hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Barton , ranking Republican , said it is a “ tragedy ” that a “ private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown ” by President Obama in setting up the escrow fund .
It was not a slip of the tongue .
Barton was reading from his prepared opening statement .
But the reaction by his fellow Republicans was instant panic .
With one stupid statement , Barton tore aside the Republican ’s hypocritical mask exposing their real loyalties , not to the stricken people of the Gulf Coast , not to the oil - soaked beaches and wetlands , the dying pelicans and turtles .
No , their hearts bleed for their biggest campaign contributors , profit - greedy oil companies .
After a break in the hearing , Barton attempted to take back his blunder , apologizing for the apology and pleading that his comments not be “ misconstrued . ”
Reflecting GOP panic over the firestorm , Barton ’s formal retraction , including an apology to President Obama , was hastily released and circulated by the office of House Minority Leader , John Boehner , R - Ohio .
But the damage was done .
David Plouffe , who is currently the mid-term elections consultant for the president ’s grassroots group , Organizing for America , pointed out that Barton ’s comments are consistent with other GOP statements on the disaster .
Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said he “ shares ” Barton ’s concerns .
Rep. Michele Bachman , R - Minn , a darling of the tea party , said BP should not allow itself to be “ fleeced ” to pay for damages inflicted to the Gulf Coast .
Rush Limbaugh ranted the escrow account to compensate victims in the Gulf is a “ bailout . ”
Rand Paul , the GOP Senate candidate in Kentucky called criticism of BP “ un-American . ”
Said Plouffe , “ Let ’s be clear .
This fund is a major victory for the people of the Gulf .
It ’s a key step toward making them whole again .
BP has a responsibility to those whose lives and livelihoods have been devastated by the disaster .
And BP executives do n’t deserve an apology - the people of the Gulf do . ”
Big oil knows who its allies are , Plouffe continued , And if Republicans win majority control of the House in November ’s midterm elections , “ Rep. Barton could be chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee — overseeing the regulation of the oil and gas industry , ” he warned .
Companies like Halliburton , responsible for faulty cementing of the Deepwater Horizon rig “ are directing their political committees to deliver thousands of dollars to GOP candidates this cycle , ” said Plouffe .
Barton himself has received more than $ 100,000 from the oil and gas industry this election cycle .
In fact , Barton has received more campaign contributions from oil and gas companies since 1990 than any other member of the House , $ 1,448,380 .
His single biggest donor is BP partner , Anadarko Petroleum , which owns a 25 percent share in the Macondo Prospect , the site where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank .
Anadarko , so far , has given Barton $ 56,500 in PAC contributions and $ 90,000 in individual contributions so far this year .
Anadarko is so covered with slimy oil from the Gulf gusher that BP sent them a bill to pay for its share of the cleanup , reports Nate Silver on his web site , FiveThirty Eight - Politics Done Right .
Barton joined earlier this week in sponsoring a bill to lift the moratorium on deepwater drilling .
In announcing the bill , Barton blasted President Obama for ordering a halt to offshore drilling claiming the president ’s hidden agenda is to make the moratorium permanent .
Barton is a notorious denier of global climate change and a fanatical opponent of pending legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The series of GOP gaffes in siding with BP in this disaster may well emerge as a “ game - changer ” in the midterm elections in which the GOP was counting on major gains , perhaps even recapturing majority control of the House .
Now even Republicans in safe districts , including Barton , fear an angry voter backlash .
Barton ’s Democratic opponent in the heavily Republican district south of Dallas is David Cozad who had about $ 10,000 in his campaign coffers compared to Barton ’s $ 1.7 million .
But Barton ’s money reeks of oil and Texas voters now know it .

Especially if you 're interested in the minor leagues or prospects .
And now for something completely different , here 's a smattering of thoughts on Andrew Peters .
Some still hold that teams today need an enforcer .
A big man to do the dirty work of upholding codes and honor and whatever else by punching another , willing man in the face on the ice .
To stick up for a teammate .
To show that he and his team will not be intimidated .
To do the one thing they 're largely paid to do , drop the gloves , have all the hockey stop so they can tussle , and then be done with it by sitting in the box whilst both teams at their benches bang their sticks against the boards to show support or something .
Admittedly , I 'm not a fan of fighting in hockey .
But we 'll agree to disagree on all of that .
More importantly , I 'm not a fan of Andrew Peters ' performance last season .
From my eye , he was quite slow , he did n't play much , and did n't do much hitting like Pierre - Luc Letourneau - Leblond or " energy " play like streaking into corners like Vladimir Zharkov .
He 's drawn no calls and taken 5 at even strength this past season according to Behind the Net.
Also , Peters ' GVT last season was dead last on the team at - 1.5 , below replacement level .
In fact , he 's always been below replacement level as a contributor to his teams throughout his career per Tom Awad 's all - time GVT list .
On top of and he put up this glorious stat - line for the New Jersey Devils in 2009 - 10 .
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - 10 - Andrew Peters 29 0 0 0 -5 93 0 0 0 0 15 0.0
Let us be frank , Peters has one purpose : to bust up dudes with his massive fists .
He 's an enforcer , a goon , a fighter , &c .
That is his role .
Mind you , I 've met Peters , I have no personal issue with Mr. Peters , and I never want to have one since his biceps are bigger than my fat head .
He 's a genial enough fellow and I bear no ill will towards Andrew Peters , the man .
Still , let me raise this question : What benefit does Andrew Peters ' fighting provide to the team ?
Did the Devils perform any better after each of the 9 fights Peters had in this past season ?
Here 's a quick and simple way .
What was the score before the fight , how many goals were scored and conceded by New Jersey in the period after the fight , and what was the final score of the game ?
If Peters ' fights led to , say , the team scoring more goals , then I 'd say that would suggest a benefit .
The team gets pumped up , momentum goes their way , and so forth .
That momentum should lead to goals for it to have a true impact on the game , no ?
( Note : I 'm limiting it to within the period since attitudes and momentum can change during intermission . )
To find out , I went through Peters ' game log at NHL.com to find out the answers .
The results come after the jump .
Key : T.o.F. = Time of Fight within the period ; GF in Per. A.F. = Goals For in Period After Fight ; GA in Per. A.F. = Goals Against in Period After Fight .
Dates in italics are the fights that Peters won per the users of hockeyfights.com .
What I discovered was the following .
The Devils are 3 - 4 - 2 3 - 3 - 2 when Andrew Peters fought in a game .
( Thanks to ILWT user acasser for the correction . )
3 - 3 - 2 when Andrew Peters fought in a game .
( Thanks to ILWT user acasser for the correction . )
Andrew Peters was 3 - 4 - 2 per the users of hockeyfights.com .
In Peters ' 3 wins , the Devils only won once .
In that game , neither team scored in the period after the fight , the Devils lost the lead later in the game , and the Devils only got a second point through the shootout .
Andrew Peters will tend to fight really early in the game .
Only once did he drop the mitts after halfway through the game .
The Devils outscored their opposition only twice this past season in the same period after a Peters fight .
They only won one of those games ; the 3/18 goal was a game - tying goal that resulted to a shootout loss .
The Devils got outscored by their opposition twice this past season in the same period after a Peters fight .
The Devils lost both games .
Only once did the Devils manage to win after a Peters fight was held while the Devils were losing .
Even then , the Devils did n't do their scoring in the same period as the fight .
I will admit that perhaps that looking at the shot counts before and after the fight may be more fruitful .
All the same , the scoring did n't pick up after a Peters fight for either team more often than not .
A big part of that could come from how early he fought in a game , and so the game was still up in the air .
Therefore , a team may not have broken down an opponent to get a goal or get that lucky bounce that finds the biscuit in the basket .
Still , would n't that mean that Peters ' fights do not get the team going to produce something on the scoreboard ?
I will also admit that the Devils being 3 - 5 - 1 in games where Peters fight may very well be a coincidental statistic .
If that 's the case , then would n't that make Peters fighting even more pointless ?
That Peters ' fights have no effect on the Devils ' or opponent 's performance ?
Since he 's got a one - way contract for the league minimum ( $ 500,000 ) that ends in 2011 according to CapGeek , it 's likely he's in New Jersey for another season .
So let me ask you all this question :
What is the benefit of Andrew Peters fighting for the New Jersey Devils ?
Does it only apply to Peters or to others who drop gloves on the Devils ?
Maybe I 'm missing something crucial , but I 'm not really seeing any real benefit based on scoring after Peters ' fights .
Let me know what you think about Andrew Peters and his fights in the comments .

C and C++ frequently coax you into using an unsigned type for iteration .
Standard functions like strlen and the size method of containers ( in C++ ) return size_t , which is an unsigned type , so to avoid conversion warnings you comply and iterate with a variable of the appropriate type .
For example :
size_t len = strlen ( some_c_str ) ; size_t i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; ++i ) { /*
Do stuff with each char of some_c_str */ }
I 've long been aware of one painful gotcha of using size_t for iteration - using it for iterating backwards .
The following code will fail :
/* Warning : buggy code ! */ size_t len = strlen ( some_c_str ) ; size_t i ; for ( i = len - 1 ; i >= 0 ; -- i ) { /*
Do stuff with each char of some_c_str , backwards */ }
When i reaches 0 it 's still within bounds , so it will be decremented and become a huge positive number ( probably 2 ^( ( sizeof ( size_t ) * 8 ) - 1 ) .
Congratulations , we have an infinite loop .
Today I ran into another manifestation of this problem .
This one is more insidious , because it happens only for some kinds of input .
I wrote the following code because the operation had to consider each character in the string and the character after it :
/* Warning : buggy code ! */ size_t len = strlen ( some_c_str ) ; size_t i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len - 1 ; ++i ) { /* Do stuff with some_c_str [ i ] and some_c_str [ i+1 ] .
*/ }
Can you spot the bug ?
When some_c_str is empty , len is 0 .
Therefore , i is compared with the unsigned version of - 1 , which is that huge positive number again .
What chance does poor i have against such a giant ?
It will just keep chugging along , well beyond the length of my string .
As I see it , to avoid the problem we can either :
Use an int variable and cast the return value of strlen to int .
This feels a bit dirty , especially in C++ where you 'd have to use static_cast < int > .
Just keep using unsigned types for iteration , but be extra careful and use various hacks to avoid the problematic corner cases .
None of these options is ideal , so if you have a better idea , let me know .
Thanks everyone for the excellent comments !
It 's obvious creative ways exist to overcome this problem for unsigned types .
Still , it remains a gotcha even seasoned programmers stumble upon from time to time .
It 's not surprising that many C/C++ style guides recommend keeping unsigned types for bitfields only , using plain ints for everything else .
Image caption A ban on drilling was imposed following the BP oil rig explosion
A US federal court judge has blocked President Barack Obama 's six - month moratorium on deep water oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
The moratorium was put in place in the wake of the massive oil spill triggered by an explosion at a rig in April .
The judge said the lengthy ban was " invalid " and could not be justified , as the negative impact on local businesses was simply too great .
The White House said it would be appealing against the decision .
" An invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of wells in the depths over 500 ft simply cannot justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs , the local economy , the Gulf region and the critical present - day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country , " judge Martin Feldman said .
Energy needs
The decision to overturn the ban follows vocal protests by the oil industry .
The world does need the oil and the energy that is going to have to come from deep water production going forward Steve Westwell , BP 's chief of staff Newfoundland drilling continues Global deepwater oil production
Top executives from BP , Transocean and other oil firms have warned against over - regulating deep sea oil drilling .
Oil found in deep waters is needed because the world will need 45 % more energy by the year 2030 , BP 's chief of staff , Steve Westwell , told the World National Oil Companies Congress earlier on Tuesday .
Consequently , the world would need new reserves from " new frontiers " , he said .
Steven Newman , chief executive of Transocean , which owned and operated the destroyed Deepwater Horizon rig that blew up on 20 April , had attacked the US ban on deep water drilling .
" There are things the [ US ] administration could implement today that would allow the industry to go back to work tomorrow without an arbitrary six - month time limit , " Mr Newman said on the sidelines of the meeting in London a few hours before the ban was overturned by the judge .
A prolonged ban on deep water drilling would also " be a step back for energy security " , added Chevron executive Jay Pryor , suggesting it would " constrain supplies for world energy " .
Commercially viable

Mr Westwell said BP would re-assess how it balanced risks , but he also insisted that the leak in the Gulf of Mexico would not lead to deep water production being halted .
It would be a mistake , he insisted , to create an environment in which investment in deep water would become impossible .
" The world does need the oil and the energy that is going to have to come from deep water production going forward , " he said .
" Therefore , the regulatory framework must still enable that to be a viable commercial position . "
And he said " BP will come through " , suggesting that most of the flow from the well in the Gulf should be staunched by August .
Who wanted a back shot of the Motorola Droid Xtreme ?
Well here you go .
You can see the beastly 8 MP camera is embedded in that hump which we all have mixed feelings about .
And it indeed says “ HD VIDEO ” up there .
It is also definitely running Android 2.1 which I know differs from our previous post .
These new photos also confirm that it has the same styling as the Droid1 which is exciting to see .
One more front shot showing off the operating system :
Still not 100 % sure on whether or not that is MotoBlur but it sure looks sort of like it does n’t it ?
Our source also completely squashed the “ Shadow ” codename .
It ’s definitely the Xtreme people .
We will no longer be using it .
And if you missed out on our previous exclusive Xtreme shots ?

Surprising fact : baby otters actually need to be taught how to swim !
Not so surprising fact : the process is obscenely adorable !
In March we brought you incredible pictures of the Columbus Zoo 's newest baby otter kits .
Now we bring you wonderful video of mama otter teaching those same pups how to swim and some great additional photos .
If you 've spent any time watching the Zoos North American river otters or our Asian small - clawed otters , youve probably noticed that otters seem almost as home in the water as most fish .
But , did you know that otters have to be taught how to swim ?
Otter pups arent born with any innate knowledge of how to swim or handle themselves in the water .
And since otters depend on water to survive , mom has to teach her babies how to be as home in the water as they are on land .
In March , Audrey , the Zoos North American river otter female , gave birth to three healthy male pups .
At around 30 days old , the pups are strong enough to begin their swimming lessons although sometimes , theyre not the most enthusiastic students much like kids everywhere .
But Audrey is a good mom and a patient , persistent teacher .
She teaches each pup individually at first this allows her to focus her full attention on each pup and each lesson especially since its the first time the pups have been in the water .
Audrey teaches the pups in stages making sure each pup is comfortable with one step before moving on to the next .
Typically , Audrey eases her pup into the water , then teaches him to float .
After floating comes swimming , and the pups learn how to maneuver and swim , skills that are vital to their survival as adults .
Once the pup is confident as a swimmer , Audrey teaches him to dive and move underwater .
Then , she teaches each pup how to dry off and stay warm after a dip in the pool .
As anyone whos been swimming knows , swimming is exhausting !
So once the pups lesson is over , Audrey carefully carries the little one back to the den where they immediately nap and get some much needed rest .
Before long , the pups are confident swimmers and well on their way to becoming the expert swimmers that all otters seem to be .
And , once the pups are venturing out of the den and swimming well , Audrey will begin the group swimming lessons .
Its a sight to behold and , often , simply too adorable for words .
The North American river otter habitat at the Zoo is now reopened to the public .
Be sure to stop by on your next visit and you might be lucky enough to see Audrey teaching her pups the essentials of being an otter !
In the wake of an incident involving team boss turned TV pundit Eddie Jordan at the British Grand Prix , there is talk that the Irishman could find himself nobbled again at Hockenheim this weekend .
At the end of the British Grand Prix , as Red Bull team boss Christian Horner is being interviewed , former McLaren boss Ron Dennis is seen sneaking up behind Jordan .
Subsequently , the camera cuts away to race winner Mark Webber , However , on its return to the interview Jordan is no longer wearing his headphones and is trying to get a new set from a BBC technician .
It was subsequently revealed that Dennis - naughty boy that he is - had cut through the leads on Jordan 's headphones , thereby leaving the Irishman unable to hear anything .
He was given ear plugs but experienced great difficulty keeping them in .
According to reports , Jordan is seething at Dennis ' practical joke , a BBC source telling the media that the Irishman was " spitting feathers and wanted the BBC to charge Dennis with criminal damage " .
Fact is , in the opinion of many , both within the paddock and those watching on TV , Jordan has become just a little too big for his boots .
When he first got the BBC gig , Jordan was extremely nervous and even resorted to getting coaching from a long - term friend .
A year down the line and the Irishman , who is regarded as one of the key elements in the British broadcaster 's pitlane team , can't get enough attention , what with his flamboyant clothing and endless contradicting of ( fellow pundit ) David Coulthard as he lays in to drivers , team bosses and just about everyone else .
At Silverstone , Jordan put Horner on the spot , telling the Red Bull boss that his post race radio talk with Mark Webber did n't appear genuine , however , in previous weeks McLaren 's Martin Whitmarsh , Ferrari's Stefano Domenicali and numerous others have been publicly done over .
While this might be good TV , it is understood that there are many within the sport who feel that Jordan has got just a little bit above himself and that the Irishman needs bringing back to earth ... preferably with a bang .
There is currently a rumour doing the rounds that team members at two teams are looking for an opportunity to nobble Jordan in Germany this weekend , using Dennis ' prank as the benchmark , while two of the most popular F1 fora in Germany have threads relating to fans wishing to " sabotage " the Irishman for comments he has made in recent weeks , particularly in reference to Michael Schumacher .
Other than the usual suggestions about tampering with his equipment ( ouch ) or holding up abusive signs behind his back - but in full view of the TV cameras - some of the others ideas being put forward are genuinely hair - raising .
Rest assured , Pitpass - and many members of the paddock , including , no doubt , the Ronster - will be watching EJ with relish this weekend .

VANCOUVER --
A racy photograph of the Georgian economy minister , said to be taken at a Vancouver strip club , is creating international media furore .
Vera Kobalia , 28 , who lived in Vancouver and was educated at BCIT , is pictured posing salaciously with a group of scantily clad women .
The Russian media has sprung forward , criticizing President Mikheil Saakashvili for appointing " strippers " to his cabinet .
The U.K.'s Independent newspaper is reporting that Saakashvili appointed the brunette beauty to the ministerial post after meeting her during his trip to Vancouver in February during the Winter Olympics .
Kobalia , who is Georgian , was raised in Canada .
According to her official biography on a Georgian government site , she graduated from King George high school in 1999 and BCIT in 2004 .
The website also says Kobalia worked as a television producer in Vancouver for Global TV and CBC .
However , no one at the Global TV newsroom could recall the name , and Petra Mehner at Global ’s Human Resources department said there is no record of Kobalia ever having been on the payroll .
BCIT would not confirm or deny whether she graduated from a program , saying it ’s policy to protect students ’ privacy rights .
The risque photo of Kobalia , attached to this story , was taken from a Facebook page under Kobalia 's name .
But the minister denies Russian media claims that it was taken at a Vancouver strip club .
According to the Independent , Kobalia insists the snap was taken almost 10 years ago when she was on holiday in Florida .
She is quoted as saying : " If the worst thing that the opposition or anyone else can find about me is my old picture from college than I do n't see anything wrong with that . "
As I write this , my in - laws are driving five hours to come visit .
According to television , this should frighten me .
My mother - in - law will suggest other men my wife should have married , and my father - in - law will glare and sneer at me at the same time–sort of a snare , if you will .
Except , this wo n’t happen .
Oh the many splendid lies of television .
Even the best of parents can’t shield their children from television ’s grasp , and even the nimblest of minds get corrupted by distorted television portrayals .
One of the classic ones to use in a communication class is to ask what percentage of Americans work in law enforcement ?
Students , having been fed a diet of Law & Order , CSI , Bones , etc. will respond rather highly .
Sometimes as high as forty percent or more .
The truth is that as of 2004 , 3.5 out of every 1,000 people worked in law enforcement ( or less than one percent ) .
In other words , television distorts terribly our view of reality .
Watch reruns of The Simpsons , Everybody Loves Raymond , or a variety of other sitcoms and you ’d think every mother - in - law hated their son - in - law .
This is likely true for some , but for most ?
Watch Bones or CSI and you ’d assume that crime stoppers had almost bottomless coffers with which to battle criminals .
Watch Friends or How I Met Your Mother and you ’d assume most young singles lived fabulous lives in spacious apartments while having sex with different partners week in and week out .
Of course , most of us are keenly aware television and film are fantasy .
We know that Keanu does not know kung - fu , or at least in the manner portrayed in The Matrix .
We know that Bugs and Daffy blowing each up with dynamite would kill the average rabbit and duck ( this is to say nothing of robo - ducks ) .
But those crime numbers are startling .
How many of us would guess the numbers were that low ?
As a teacher , I am both amused and troubled by my profession ’s depiction on television .
Teachers are usually young , good looking types that waltz into a classroom throwing high - fives while explaining Hamlet using a single rap song .
These types might exist , but this not only grossly oversimplifies the work of a teacher , but the complexity of Hamlet .
In medicine we see Dr. House solve one perplexing diagnosis after another , but in reality ?
In reality we watch as friends and loved ones die from ailments doctors are unable to diagnose .
Maybe if they ’d just been smarter , or worked harder ?
Like Dr. House .
I do n’t hate television .
Obviously the world of Professor Hobo is a distorted view of academia .
But all too often I find myself buying into the small lies of television , if not the big ones .
Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I have a show choir team to inspire with improvisational adaptations of classic rock .
The first bourbon in our wood - finishing series , Maker 's Mark 46 ™ was created by Bill Samuels , Jr. , to amplify the flavors he loves in Maker 's Mark® .
The innovative wood - stave - finishing process starts with fully matured Maker 's Mark® at cask strength .
We then insert 10 seared virgin French oak staves into the barrel and finish it for nine weeks in our limestone cellar .
The result is Maker 's Mark 46 : bolder and more complex , but without the bitterness typical of longer - aged whiskies .
Want the full Maker 's Mark 46 story ?
Science fair projects were great because you got to make up your own questions and then answer them .
My teachers never allowed it when I ’d try that on exams .

( CNN ) -- Venezuela recalled its ambassador to Colombia on Friday as it rejected Colombia 's assertion that Colombian rebels are living in Venezuela .
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the administration of outgoing Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is trying to undermine the possible normalization of relations between the two countries , which have had strained ties in recent years .
" After eight years of failed diplomacy and of militarism as the only regional policy , President Uribe leaves a country at war , a government isolated in Latin America and detached from its neighbors , " the statement said .
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said Venezuela was recalling its ambassador to Colombia for consultations .
Meanwhile , the Colombian government raised the prospect Friday of turning to international organizations .
It said Colombia " has had a patient dialogue " for six years about its belief that Colombian " terrorists " were in Venezuela .
It passed that information to Venezuelan authorities , the Colombian government said , but its overtures were " unsuccessful with relation to terrorist leaders . "
On Thursday , Colombian authorities said they have proof that high - ranking leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , live in Venezuela .
The FARC is a Marxist rebel force that has been battling the Colombian state for decades .
Details of the evidence that Colombia may hold were not immediately clear .
Colombian Defense Minister Gabriel Silva met with the members of the Colombian news media for about an hour and a half Thursday to discuss the matter .
After the meeting , Silva gave a brief statement to reporters reiterating that Colombia has coordinates and knows of apartments used in Venezuela by rebels with the FARC and another rebel group , the National Liberation Army , which is known by its Spanish acronym , ELN .
Colombian authorities are aware of meetings between rebels in Venezuela as recently as Thursday , and have evidence of rebel camps , Silva said .
" The continued and permanent tolerance of the presence of terrorists in that country is a threat to the security of Colombia , " he said .
On Friday , Venezuela criticized what it called the " pathetic media spectacle " in Colombia the day before .
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Venezuelan authorities have investigated each time Colombia has asserted that FARC rebels were in Venezuela .
It also said the Colombian president had made " irresponsible " assertions that Venezuela was helping FARC rebels .
Uribe is a two - term president who has high approval ratings for his tough stand against FARC .
Colombia has accused Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of supporting the rebels .
Chavez has previously accused Colombian officials and right - wing paramilitary units of plotting his assassination .
Security analysts have said FARC guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion , kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela , Panama and Ecuador .
FARC is accused of trafficking in cocaine to finance its insurgency .
Colombia also has accused another neighbor , Ecuador , of giving refuge to rebels .
In 2008 , Colombia carried out a raid in Ecuadorian territory that resulted in the killing of a top FARC leader .
Chandler 's fatal narcotics operation at a south Phoenix home Wednesday was a drug bust gone sour , a deal that resulted in death , a confrontation over bales of marijuana worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars , Phoenix police said .
The shootout that felled a Chandler detective and two suspects may have started after the targets of the investigation resorted to robbery , turning the tables on three Chandler criminal - investigations unit members , said Phoenix police Sgt. Steve Martos .
Officer remembered | Condolences
Slain officer was Gilbert father of 2
" They ( the suspects ) have not admitted that is what they were doing but that is what we are looking at , " he said .
Chandler police Detective Carlos Ledesma , 34 , a Gilbert husband and father of two , was slain in the exchange of gunfire .
Two other Chandler officers were injured ; one is in critical but stable condition and the other has been treated and released from St. Joseph 's Hospital and Medical Center .
Their names have not been released so as not to jeopardize their roles as undercover agents , Chandler Police Chief Sherry Kiyler said .
" Carlos Ledesma gave his life last night for his community , " Kiyler said at a news conference Thursday .
" The events of last night are a grim reminder of challenges faced by the law - enforcement community . "
Altogether , there are eight suspects , aged 25 to 40 .
Two suspects were killed , one has been hospitalized and five have been arrested on charges ranging from murder to possession of marijuana with the intent to sell .
The five in custody were identified as Thadika Singleton , 38 , John Webber , 37 , Doarnell Jackson , 35 , Jerry Wayne Cockhearn , 25 , and Eldridge Gittens , 34 .
None was charged with being in the country illegally .
The bales of marijuana would be worth between tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands on the street , Martos said .
He said that the undercover Chandler police were carrying cash to purchase the drugs .
Whether the police were carrying cash and how much is in dispute , as Chandler Sgt. Joe Favazzo said it is " inaccurate that the officers were carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars . "
It all started at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday in a neighborhood south of Lindo Park in Phoenix , where community leaders and police have grappled for years with drug - related violence .
The undercover officers and suspects met at a residence in the 2300 block of West Maldonado Road .
Favazzo said it is common for criminal investigations to spread from a city into other jurisdictions .
The narcotics investigation , which Favazzo said involved a " large quantity of marijuana , " began in Chandler , and Phoenix had been notified of the operation .
The undercover officers , who according to reports were not wearing vests , were posing as drug buyers , Phoenix police said .
When the deal soured , the criminal suspects shot first , Martos said .
The undercover officers returned fire , killing two .
Martos said more criminal suspects descended on the scene .
Another was shot and injured .
Favazzo said that working undercover is highly dangerous as the officers are playing a role .
" Everyone 's senses are heightened , " he said .
" They are in an uncontrollable situation that they can't control as if they were in uniform . "
At Chandler Police Department at 250 E. Chicago St. , mourning was apparent in the form of flowers and lit candles laid at the foot of a statue of a police officer .
Employees inside were choked up , some tearing .
They are grieving the death of one of their own , who died trying to protect the public .
The city of Chandler has also canceled an All - America City event scheduled for today .
Republic reporters Nathan Gonzalez and Edythe Jensen contributed to this article .
She is known to the world as a human rights activist who has spent 14 of the last 20 years under house arrest as punishment for demanding democracy in her home country .
But in these photographs Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is shown not as the fearless campaigner who has given up her liberty for the sake of her nation , but as a young woman in love and a doting mother .
Many of these pictures come from the private collection of her late husband , the Oxford academic Michael Aris , who died from prostate cancer in 1999 .
Almost all are today published for the first time , and now belong to the private Aris family trust , which has released them to the Guardian to mark and celebrate Aung San Suu Kyi's 65th birthday tomorrow .
As she has done for most of the past two decades , the Nobel laureate will celebrate not with her two sons and family , but in her crumbling villa on University Avenue in Rangoon , surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by armed soldiers .
Under the terms of her current imprisonment she will not be released until early 2011 , though many of her supporters fear Burma 's military rulers will find , yet again , a new spurious reason to keep her locked away once she has served her term .
The United Nations believes she should not be imprisoned at all , and this week the UN working group on arbitrary detention pronounced her continued detention a breach of international human rights law .
The current excuse for her imprisonment is that she breached the conditions of her last house arrest , when an uninvited American man with mental health problems took it upon himself to swim across the lake to visit her home .
Perhaps the most striking picture in the collection shows Aung San Suu Kyi walking down a snowy track in the mountains of Bhutan .
She could easily be a young girl of 13 in her oversized Tibetan gown and boots and men's gloves , but this picture was taken in January 1971 , when she was 25 years old and already an established figure at the United Nations , where she worked in New York ( and where her Burmese passport , right , was issued ) .
The Bhutan photo marks a milestone in her life : she has just accepted a proposal from Michael Aris , who was then working as a tutor to the Bhutanese royal family .
She had flown from the US to the landlocked Himalayan country to visit her beloved , and on a trip to visit Taktsang , " the lair of the pregnant tigeress " , a complex of temples which make up one of the oldest and most sacred shrines in Bhutan , Aris proposed .
They married on New Year 's Day the following year .
Pictures here show the couple in the London registry office where their marriage was made official before being blessed at a private Buddhist ceremony at a friend 's home .
The workaday surroundings belie the extraordinary union – the Oxford don marrying the beautiful young woman with a nation 's hopes on her slim shoulders .
In the background of one shot is a stern sign ordering guests not to celebrate with confetti or rice .
Other images come from the next stage in Aung San Suu Kyi's life , when she has become a mother .
The family were living in Oxford by then , as Michael researched Tibetan and Bhutanese studies , and one shot records their first visit back to Burma after the birth of their first son , Alexander , in 1973 .
Alexander is in the arms of his grandmother , Daw Khin Kyi , widow of General Aung San , the Burmese revolutionary who was instrumental in bringing about Burma 's independence from British colonial rule .
In 1977 Aung San Suu Kyi gave birth to her second son , Kim , and devoted much of her time and energy to motherhood .
One photograph shows her outside the Oxford terrace where the family lived , and where Burmese exiles still visit today .
Three other pictures show family holidays in the UK .
One , taken in Grantown - on - Spey in the Cairngorms , could show any other late 70s family on a typically chilly British picnic .
Everyone is bundled up in thick jumpers or coats , surrounded by Tupperware and eating sandwiches .
Another Scottish scene takes place in more clement weather , as Aung San Suu Kyi bends down to speak to her two boys , playing on the croquet lawn at their paternal grandfather 's house in Grantown - on - Spey .
In another photo the future leader of the Burmese Democracy Movement is tending a barbecue on the Norfolk Broads , where the family were enjoying a narrow boat holiday with friends .
Within 10 years she was back in Burma , leaving them all behind in order to fight for what she believed in .
It was her destiny , she said , and her family accepted it : before her marriage to Michael Aris , she told him : " I only ask one thing , that should my people need me , you would help me to do my duty by them . "
" The hardest letters to produce were C and R , but I could n't tell you how we did them , other than to say that we did n't use Photoshop at all , " said John

Good advice :
Stop making gay adoption political
By Ken Manford and Jennifer Chrisler
A week before the Republican gubernatorial primary , Karen Handel said gay parenting is not “ in the best interest of the child . ”
When asked by an Atlanta TV reporter why she thought gay parents are n’t legitimate , Handel replied , “ Because I do n’t . ”
She went on to say she would outlaw gay adoptions .
As gay parents , we strongly disagree with Handel on the legitimacy of gay parenting .
We also resent the way gay adoption was turned into a political circus as each of the Republican candidates felt obligated to prove their anti-gay credentials with voters in the final weeks of the general primary .
Husband - and - wife journalists , 49 , and , 36 , were gunned down on 28 June in the Internet café they owned near their home in Coyuca de Benítez , in the southwestern state of Guerrero .
Their deaths bring the number of journalists murdered since the start of the year in Mexico to seven ( or possibly eight ) .
Rodríguez was the local correspondent for two dailies , El Sol de Acapulco and Diario Objetivo , while his wife edited Semanario Nueva Línea , a weekly .
“ The level of violence against media personnel keeps on mounting in Mexico , ” Reporters Without Borders said .
“ Journalists are continually exposed to threats and physical attacks in the course of their work and live in fear of reprisals .
We hope the investigators quickly identify those responsible for this double murder and their motives , and thereby help to end the impunity that prevails in most of these killings .
Will the federal authorities now finally break their silence ? ”
According to local press reports , Rodríguez and Hernández were shot at close range by gunmen who arrived in a black car .
Several .38 calibre bullet impacts were found in the Internet café .
The couple had two children , aged 17 and 8 .
The elder witnessed the shooting .
Rodríguez had been a journalist in the Costa Grande region north of Acapulco for the past 20 years and represented his colleagues on the technical committee of the Guerrero state Support Fund for Journalists .
A few days ago , he and several dozen fellow journalists and representatives of media organisations participated in an annual convention for Guerrero state journalists in Coyuca de Benítez , during which concern was voiced about the persistent violence against journalists .
He had worked for El Sol de Acapulco for the past five years , providing general coverage of the Costa Grande region .
Pedro Arzeta García , the coordinator of the Support Fund for Journalists , said that so far there was nothing that clearly indicated that his murder was linked to his work as a journalist .
The Guerrero state prosecutor ’s office began an investigation yesterday .
A total of 64 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 2000 , while 11 others have gone missing since 2003 .
“ We were talking to Square for quite awhile , ” Feargus Urquhart , CEO of Obsidian said while introducing Dungeon Siege 3 .
“ You make RPGs , we make RPGs , it would be great to see what we could do together .
And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs .
And , so it kind of all ended up fitting together . ”
Square Enix gave Obsidian the task of reviving the Dungeon Siege series after they purchased the rights to it from Gas Powered Games .
Since Obsidian and Square Enix have been conversing for some time , I asked Urquhart if there was any franchise other than Dungeon Siege 3 they would like to work on .
Urquhart snickered and sarcastically said , “ Chocobo Racing . ”
He followed up with a more serious response , “ If I could come across everything that I played I would have to go with Chrono Trigger .
I think Chrono Trigger was one I really enjoyed . ”
And how would you make Chrono Trigger more of a Western RPG ?
“ It ’s tough because a lot of the Japanese RPGs have very specific functions for everything .
There is very specific item progression , very specific class progression , very specific everything .
I think … I do n’t know I ’d have to think about it , ” Urquhart pondered .
While I put Urquhart on the spot , Nathan Chapman , Lead Designer , jumped in with an answer .
“ I think we ’re going with Chrono Trigger because it has elements of a Western RPG .
It ’s more open , it ’s still mostly linear , but there are parts you can explore more , ” said Chapman .
“ There are lots of differences , like you can beat Lavos at different parts of the game and you get different endings based on that .
There are obvious answers like dialogue trees and all of that good stuff .
The seeds are there for that kind of development . ”
“ I think it would be fun to take the setting of a Japanese RPG , which is a weird mix of fantasy and sci-fi mashed together and make a Western RPG out of that , ” Urquhart chimed in .
“ I think that would be cool .
I mean it ’s kind of Star Wars , that ’s kind of what Star Wars is a fantasy in space .
I think that would be interesting . ”
Chapman continued , “ In terms of the Japanese RPGs that I find really cool is the style .
That ’s something that , especially the Japanese Square games , the style permeates everything .
The super high production values .
The characters … ”
“ Gigantic swords , ” Urquhart cracked .
“ Gigantic swords , something we ’ve taken from them .
All of that stuff is really cool , ” Chapman concluded .
A week ago Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's condition was nearly desperate .
The Turkel committee became a committee with teeth liable to bite the prime minister , while State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss ' scrutiny of the flotilla affair threatened to wound the prime minister .
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman started making threats again and Defense Minister Ehud Barak continued to make trouble .
Many observers are predicting that the government will start to disintegrate by September .
The man who is conducting an intimate dialogue with history has realized that by next summer , he may well become an obscure and marginal historical footnote himself .

There were also other troubles .
In private , Netanyahu was told he was surrounded .
After all , the international community is closing in on him ; he lost Turkey , is losing Europe and is liable to lose the United States .
If he does n't break through the noose , his fate is sealed .
Worse than that were the words of the defense minister .
Very , very quietly , without anyone knowing about it , Barak laid a pistol on the table .
The man on whom Netanyahu depends - politically , diplomatically , strategically and emotionally - made it clear he will not stay with him forever .
If Netanyahu does not make U.S. President Barack Obama a real offer , he will remain all alone under siege .
A week has gone by and things have turned around .
Netanyahu is king .
The White House is welcoming him with flowers , smiles and unprecedented affability .
Blair House , Oval Office , press conference .
The man who was anathema in March is given a royal reception in July .
After a long period during which the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel were adversaries , they are now falling all over each other .
And this is not just atmosphere , not just manners and politeness .
Netanyahu is extracting from Obama a series of diplomatic achievements : an unambiguous commitment to Israel 's unique needs , acknowledgment that Israel has to defend itself from the violent neighborhood in which it lives , a promise not to detract from Israel 's defense capability .
And by implication : recognition of Dimona .
Recognition of the Iranian threat .
Recognition that the way to Israeli - Palestinian peace is through direct talks .
After 18 wasted months during which Obama was the president who exerted pressure , he has become the president who embraces .
Obama is embracing the State of Israel and the prime minister of Israel .
What happened ?
Three things have happened .
On one level , Netanyahu waged a struggle .
And the statesman who is depicted as susceptible to pressure did not succumb to the American pressure of this past spring .
He fought back .
The price for what Netanyahu did was felt by Obama in Chicago .
The Israeli leader applied hidden pressure to the American leader , which made it perfectly clear to him :
No more .
On another level , the Americans realized one - sided pressure on Israel is dangerous .
It hurts them , keeps peace at bay and undermines stability in the Middle East .
Even if Israel can be irritating , it is a fact .
And even if Netanyahu arouses wrath , he is the only game in town .
If there is peace during the Obama years , it wo n't be Tzipi Livni 's peace .
Nor will it be Yair Lapid 's peace .
The peace will be solely Netanyahu's .
On a third level , Israel demonstrated its seriousness .
For many months , the two government engaged in an ongoing and in - depth working dialogue .
The Israelis made it clear to the Americans that they are serious .
In order to receive diplomatic and strategic credit , they deposited guarantees in the hands of their discussion partners - guarantees that will need to be put into effect in the coming months .
That which sweetened the prime minister 's visit to the White House is liable to embitter his life at home .
Thus the royal visit to Washington is not the end of the story .
The Americans gave , and the Americans are expecting to get .
Netanyahu must not let himself become confused .
Now he is king for a day , maybe for a summer .
However , if he does not immediately take advantage of the hard - won credit he has been granted in order to come out with an Israeli diplomatic initiative , his situation will become desperate again .
Turkel and Lindenstrauss are still out there .
So are Lieberman and Barak , as well as Hamas , Hezbollah and Iran .

But security improvements have , for now , taken a back seat .
Mozilla has released the first beta version of Firefox 4
The striking differences are in the user interface ; for instance , tabs default to the top of the window , a la Google Chrome .
In fact , security changes seem almost nonexistent in this version .
The " What 's New in Firefox 4 Beta ( revision 1 ) " in the release notes does n't mention a single security feature .
This Features page has one : new privacy controls .
There seem to be two themes to the new privacy features : one is the claim that version 4 :
Makes it easier to know what info websites are gathering about you , what they can do to your computer and what they 're allowed to know about you .
Unfortunately , from what I can see , the privacy and history user interfaces are almost exactly the same as in version 3.6 .
Perhaps these features are not yet implemented in beta 1 .
The second is about how version 4 attempts to plug a privacy hole in the CSS : visited selector which , in combination with the JavaScript getComputedStyle ( ) function , can allow a malicious site to examine your browsing history .
Mozilla 's strategy for blocking abuse is somewhat incredible :
getComputedStyle ( and similar functions like querySelector ) will lie .
They will always return values as if a user has never visited a site .
There will also be limits to the styles and some other features that can be used for visited links .
It 's not clear to me if this has been implemented in beta 1 .

Ten Gulf Coast U.S. senators asked in a resolution that BP PLC consider using local products and services in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster .
The resolution states more than 2.5 million barrels oil have flowed into the Gulf of Mexico .
Resources such as fishing , tourism , shipping and energy exploration the Gulf generate about $ 200 billion in economic activity , it stated .
And , the economic impact on the Gulf Coast economy has amounted to more than $ 175 million in reported claims to date .
Sen . Roger Wicker , R - Tupleo , said , " Not only has the BP oil spill crippled the economy of the coast , but it also has devastated the way of life for so many of those who call the Gulf home . "
Wicker said that BP has sent millions on a public relations campaign to assure Americans it would " get it right " and help restore the damage it has caused .
" One way BP can honor its pledge is by working with the local communities and considering all of the resources that local businesses have to offer . "
Sen .
Thad Cochran , R - Jackson , said , " This Senate resolution expresses a belief that BP should adhere to a ' good neighbor ' policy .
This means it should first look to utilize Gulf Coast residents and resources as it carries out what will be an extensive , multi- year ecological and economic recovery operation . "
Senators joining Wicker and Cochran in the resolution introduced Wednesday are Mary Landrieu , D - La. , John Cornyn , R- Texas , Kay Bailey Hutchison , R- Texas , George LeMieux , R - Fla. , Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , Jeff Sessions , R - Ala. , Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , and David Vitter , R - La .
In other oil - related news :
-- Donald Langham , emergency management director for Jackson County , said no near shore oil sill material was reported off Mississippi 's coast in a Wednesday afternoon briefing .
The forecast for the next two days appears clear of any heavy oil impacts for the state 's coast , he said .
-- An emergency order requiring the removal of all crab traps from Mississippi territorial marine waters is effective 6 p.m. July 28 was issued by the state departments of marine resources and environmental quality .
The waters have been closed to commercial and recreational fishing , but this is the first notice to remove crab traps , said Lauren Thompson , DMR public relations director .
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported the following :
Cat , Horn and Petit Bois islands were moderately impacted , while Ship Island was lightly impacted .
Each island was cleaned by manual cleanup crews .
Sporadic coverage in Hancock , Harrison and Jackson counties , and areas were cleaned as needed .
Two confirmed oiled live birds and four oiled dead birds .
Mississippi skimmers cleaned a total of 100 gallons of oil in the following locations : 50 gallons in Bayou Caddy in Hancock County , and 50 gallons at Point
Cadet near Biloxi .
The Mississippi National Guard has completed 200 flights in support of Operation Deepwater Horizon Response since the military 's activation on April 30 .

Fans were attempting to get in to see the Nigerians play North Korea Sixteen people , including two policemen , have been injured after a crush outside a South African ground hosting a World Cup warm - up game .
Several fans fell under a rush of people outside the Makhulong Stadium in the Johannesburg suburb of Tembisa .
Entry to the friendly between Nigeria and North Korea was free , and many more than the 10,000 capacity turned up .
Football 's world governing body Fifa has said it was not involved in any " operational " aspect of the fixture .
A Fifa statement added that " contrary to some media reports , Fifa had nothing to do with the ticketing of this game " .
One fan , Japhta Mombelo , described the moment he was caught up in the chaos .
" The crowd overpowered me and I went down , " he said .
" I fell down and people just fell over me . "
The first crowd surge came when the stadium gates were opened to allow fans entry .
Police soon closed the gates , but when they were re-opened , a second rush occurred , with more people falling over .
" When we were coming in , they were just stepping on us , " another fan , Princess Mbali , who was wearing a South Africa shirt , said .
" I thought I was dying .
I was at the bottom . "
The incidents have provided the wrong sort of build - up to the World Cup that the South African authorities would have wanted
BBC Sport's Piers Edwards
One policeman was seriously hurt after reportedly being crushed against a gate .
He remains in a stable condition , according to the South African Police Services .
The crowd was mainly made up of local South African and travelling Nigerian fans .
Police said that hundreds of them were also holding photocopies of tickets and tried to break down the gates after the match had started and police had closed them .
In a separate incident the game was then stopped for five minutes in the second half when a railing collapsed inside the stadium .
The incidents have provided the wrong sort of build - up to the World Cup that the South African authorities would have wanted , the BBC's Piers Edwards , outside the stadium , says .
The venue is not a World Cup venue , but the incident is likely to heighten security even further ahead of the World Cup opener between South Africa and Mexico at Soccer City on Friday , our correspondent says .
The game itself finished 3 - 1 to Nigeria , with Yakubu Aiyegbeni , Victor Obinna Nsofor and Obafemi Martins scoring for the Super Eagles , while Jong Hyok Cha was on target for North Korea .

London mayor 's move welcomed by Westminster council as end to ' hijacking of one of London 's historic public spaces '
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Boris Johnson , the mayor of London , today won a high court order evicting protesters who have turned Parliament Square into a makeshift encampment .
Mr Justice Griffith Williams said the mayor had " directed himself correctly , considered all the relevant matters and reached a reasoned decision which cannot be criticised " .
He noted that the camp had no running water or toilet facilities and said there was evidence of criminal damage to flowerbeds , graffiti and other unlawful activity .
There was also evidence that the camp was acting as a magnet to homeless people who were taking advantage of the lack of control , and evidence of heavy drinking .
" I am satisfied the Greater London Authority and the mayor are being prevented from exercising their necessary powers of control management and care of Parliament Square Gardens , " he said .
A Greater London Authority spokesman said the mayor was pleased the court had supported the GLA 's application .
" The mayor respects the right to demonstrate , " the spokesman said .
" However , the scale and impact of the protest , which has gone on since 1 May , has caused considerable damage to the square and prevented its peaceful use by other Londoners , including those who may have wished to conduct an authorised protest .
" Parliament Square sits alongside a world heritage site and is a top tourist attraction that is visited by thousands of people and broadcast around the world each day . "
Colin Barrow , the leader of Westminster City Council , also welcomed the court 's verdict , saying : " We are delighted by this decision , as we feel that the hijacking of Parliament Square , one of London 's historic public spaces , needed to be brought to an end .
" We all support peaceful protest , but it is completely unacceptable for parts of our city to be occupied and turned into no - go areas by vociferous minorities , however laudable each cause might be . "
However , the Green party GLA member Jenny Jones said it was " a bad day for democracy in London " .
" The lack of police presence showed that the protesters were not causing a problem , " she said .
" Yet the mayor was dogmatic in pursuing an expensive legal process .
" The mayor has satisfied the lobby who wanted the square ' tidied up ' – but at what cost to our democracy ? "
The decision , however , does not affect the activist Brian Haw , who has been protesting on the pavement by the square , opposite the Houses of Parliament , for the past nine years .
Haw first set up camp in June 2001 in a one - man protest against war and foreign policy – initially the sanctions against Iraq .
He said he had been inspired to take up his vigil after seeing images and information produced by the anti-sanctions Mariam appeal campaign .
The father of seven has been arrested many times , most recently last month , but successfully resisted repeated legal attempts by Tory - led Westminster council and the former Labour government to remove him .
Prior to the high court 's decision , demonstrators in the square said they feared defeat .
Ian , a protester in his 60s , said : " I suppose we 've done quite a lot of good work in a way .
It 's inevitable that the state stamps on anything that challenges its authority . "
Others said they had not thought the demonstrations would last as long as they have and would protest non-violently when the bailiffs came to remove them .
Greater London authority ( GLA ) officers acting for Johnson began proceedings for trespass at the high court at the start of the month .
Johnson outlined his decision to apply to the high court to begin legal proceedings for trespass on the same day that David Cameron 's Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition government announced plans to " restore rights to non-violent protest " as part of its 18 - month legislative programme .
In its various guises the camp has included communists , climate change protesters , opponents of the war in Afghanistan , anarchists and homeless people .
It has also featured a communal vegetarian kitchen , an IT tent and a " peace garden " with an oak sapling surrounded by vegetables planted in the ground .

PARIS  France is embarking on a grand experiment  how to diversify the overwhelmingly white “ grandes écoles , ” the elite universities that have produced French leaders in every walk of life  and Rizane el - Yazidi is one of the pioneers .
The daughter of protective North African parents in the tough northeastern suburb of Bondy , Ms. Yazidi is enrolled in a trial program aimed at helping smart children of the poor overcome the huge cultural disadvantages that have often spelled failure in the crucial school entrance exams .
“ For now we ’re still a small group , but when there will be more of us , it ’ll become real progress , ” said Ms. Yazidi , 20 .
But she is nervous , too .
“ We ’re lucky , but it ’s a great risk for us , ” she said .
“ We might never make it ” to a top school .
Because entrance to the best grandes écoles effectively guarantees top jobs for life , the government is prodding the schools to set a goal of increasing the percentage of scholarship students to 30 percent  more than three times the current ratio at the most selective schools .
But the effort is being met with concerns from the grandes écoles , who fear it could dilute standards , and is stirring anger among the French at large , who fear it runs counter to a French ideal of a meritocracy blind to race , religion and ethnicity .
Subject 046 M , for male , was seated nervously across from me at the table , his hands clasped tightly together in his lap .
He appeared to have caught an incurable case of the squirms .
I resisted the urge to laugh , and leaned forward , whispering conspiratorially .
“ Today , we ’re going to play a game with Mr. Moo ” — I produced an inviting plush cow from behind my back .
“ Can you say hi to Mr. Moo ? ”
In the Stanford lab I work in with Professor Michael Ramscar , we study how children go about what is arguably the most vital project in their career as aspiring adults — learning language .
Over the last several years , we ’ve been particularly taken with the question of how kids learn a small , but telling piece of that vast complex : color words .
We want to know how much they know , when they know it , and whether we can help them get there faster .
046 M was off to a good start .
I arranged three different color swatches in front of him .
“ Can you show me the red one ? ”
He paused slightly , then pointed to the middle rectangle : red .
“ Very good ! ” I said , beaming .
“ Now , what about the one that ’s blue ? ”
The test was not designed to trip kids up .
Far from it — we only tested basic color words , and we never made kids pick between confusable shades , like red and pink .
To an adult , the test would be laughably easy .
Yet , after several months of testing two - year olds , I could count my high scorers on one hand .
Most would fail the test outright .
046 M , despite his promising start , proved no exception .
Before the test would begin , the child ’s parents were told that today we would be testing color words .
Responses were typically enthusiastic .
“ Oh , that ’s great !
Margie ’s got her colors down pat . ”
At which point , we leveled with them : if they wanted to sit through the study , they would have to be blindfolded .
Such measures may seem extreme — but then again , so were the reactions we got from parents during the pilot study , as they watched their little ones fail to pick out the right color , over and over again .
The reactions ran the short line from shocked to terrified , and back again .
Some parents were so dismayed they started impatiently correcting their children mid-test .
One mother , in particular , could n’t seem to stop herself , and took to nervously grabbing her little boy ’s hand whenever it veered away from the correct choice .
Then , inevitably , would come the post - test breakdown : “ Is my child colorblind ? ”
Divorced from context , most two and three - year olds might as well be colorblind ; certainly they look that way when asked to correctly identify colors in a line - up , or accurately use color words in novel contexts .
What ’s more , psychologists have found that even after hours and hours of repeated training on color words , children ’s performance typically fails to noticeably improve , and children as old as six continue to make major color naming errors .
This is seriously bizarre when you consider all the otherthings that children at that age can do : ride a bike , tie their shoes , read the comics , and – mistake a blue cupcake for a pink one ?
Really ?
Does that actually happen ?
Apparently yes – which is where 046M , and his color - naming compatriots came in .
Armed with the tools of cognitive psychology , and a gang of nineteen year - old Nancy Drews ( “ research assistants ” ) , we decided it was high time to figure out 1 ) why it takes so long for children to learn colors , of all things , and 2 ) whether we could n’t shortcut the process .
As ever , just because something seems easy , does n’t necessarily mean that it is .
For one thing , knowing which range of hues counts as which color is something that ca n’t be purely innate , since color categories are not universal across human cultures .
Different languages vary both in the number of basic color distinctions they make ( ranging anywhere from two to over twenty ) and in the ways they draw those distinctions on the spectrum .
Comparing how Himba speakers and English speakers distinguish colors on a map is a bit like comparing how Democrats and Republicans might gerrymander the same district : there ’s just not much overlap .
In Himba , a northern Namibian dialect , the color “ zoozu , ” cuts straight across what we would think of as black , green , blue and purple , while “ serandu ” encompasses much of pink , purple and red .
Even in languages with highly similar color vocabularies , a given color wo n’t necessarily pick out the exact same set of hues in one language as it does in the other ( check out Korean and Russian for starters ) .
What all this means is that the learning problem consists in not only learning a word to color mapping , but also in learning the peculiar color “ maps ” your language uses in the first place .
The task is further complicated by the fact that color is ubiquitous in everyday life .
At any given time , we are surrounded by a multitude of hues , as we move through a world of faces and places , objects and surroundings .
This overwhelming ubiquity is not a feature of other common words , such as nouns .
Imagine , for example , that a child is trying to learn to distinguish “ dog ” from “ bear . ”
The learning problem is n’t so difficult in this case : unless you ’re watching Old Yeller , dogs will tend to be seen and talked about in contexts in which bears are n’t present , and bears will tend to be seen and talked about in contexts in which dogs are n’t present .
This means that if you ’re three , and you ’re trying to learn what things out there in the world you might expect to match to the word “ dog , ” you ’ll fast learn that bears are n’t one of them .
We can contrast this with the problem of learning color words .
Whenever a three - year old hears “ red , ” it can be virtually guaranteed that there will be a whole bunch of other colors around just to make things confusing ( writing this , I can make out at least a half dozen colors on my colleague ’s shirt ) .
This means that the sheer ubiquity of color presents a problem : it makes sorting out which hues a toddler should expect to be “ red ” and which “ orange , ” a lot harder than figuring out which furry beasts she should expect to be “ bears ” and which ones “ dogs . ”
This may explain why children , across every language studied , invariably learn their nouns before their colors .
As it happens , English color words may be especially difficult to learn , because in English we throw in a curve ball : we like to use color words “ prenominally , ” meaning before nouns .
So , we ’ll often say things like “ the red balloon , ” instead of using the postnominal construction , “ the balloon is red . ”
Why does this matter ?
It has to do with how attention works .
In conversation , people have to track what ’s being talked about , and they often do this visually .
This is particularly so if they ’re trying to make sense of whatever it is someone is going on about .
Indeed , should I start blathering about “ the old mumpsimus in the corner ” you ’re apt to begin discretely looking around for the mystery person or object .
Kids do the exact same thing , only more avidly , because they have much , much more to learn about .
That means that when you stick the noun before the color word , you can successfully narrow their focus to whatever it is you ’re talking about before you hit them with the color .
Say “ the balloon is red , ” for example , and you will have helped to narrow “ red-ness ” to being an attribute of the balloon , and not some general property of the world at large .
This helps kids discern what about the balloon makes it red .
But , you might wonder , wo n’t a kid figure out that the red in “ the red balloon ” has to do with the balloon ?
How is this different ?
There ’s a lot of theory that goes into this , but to give you a rough idea , in the first case ( “ the balloon is red ” ) , kids learn that “ red ” is the name of a property , like wet , or sharp , while in the second case ( “ the red balloon ” ) , kids learn that “ red ” is more like a proper name , like “ Tom ” or “ Heather . ”
Think about it this way : knowing someone ’s name does n’t usually tell you that much – it ’s just a label that happens to get attached to them – but knowing whether someone is funny or boring , or whether a dish is mild or spicy , tells you a lot .
Funny enough , whether kids learn “ red ” as something like a name or something like a property , depends entirely on how their attention is directed when they hear it .
That was the idea , anyway , and the prediction was simple : using color words after nouns should make colors far easier to learn , and should make kids far faster at learning them .
To test this , we took a couple dozen two - year olds and gave them some quick training on color words .
Either we trained them with prenominal sentences ( the standard variety ) or postnominal sentences ( helpful , we hoped ) .
In both cases , we would simply show them familiar objects and say encouraging things like “ This is a blue crayon ” or “ This crayon is green . ”
Then we would test them again , with the same standard battery .
We found that the kids who got the postnominal training improved significantly over their baseline test scores , whereas the ones who got the prenominal training still looked just as confused as ever .
Given that previous studies had n’t found much improvement after hundreds of explicit training trials , it was hard to believe that such a simple manipulation could make such a clear difference — and yet , it did !
Which brings me to the simple , take - home point : if you want to make your two - year old the color - naming talk of the party , watch your tongue .
It might seem faster to ask Charlie not to pop “ the red balloon , ” but if you want him matching colors with aplomb , best rephrase with , “ I mean , the balloon that is red . ”

Shoes and clothes have recently been allowed through into Gaza Maybe , like most people in Gaza , I had been watching a little bit too much of the World Cup .
But sitting on Abu Nafez 's lush sprinkler - assisted lawn outside his palatial home in the southern Gaza Strip , I kept thinking it was a bit like meeting a Premiership footballer .
Twenty - five years old , lean , good looking , with a chiselled jaw and a neatly trimmed Beckhamesque beard , Abu Nafez is rumoured to be a Gazan millionaire .
A tunnel millionaire .
And his is a rags to riches story if ever there was one .
' Riddled with holes '
Abu Nafez was born in a refugee camp in the southern Gazan town of Rafah , right on the border with Egypt .
For at least five years , this place has been a smugglers ' paradise .
The soft desert sand on which the town sits is riddled with tunnels into Egypt .
If you could take a slice of the ground under Rafah you would find it riddled with holes - like a Swiss cheese .
For all his riches , Abu Nafez has never legally left Gaza in his entire life
Like thousands of teenage boys in Rafah , Abu Nafez started off at 17 as a tunnel labourer .
Dangerous , dirty and demanding work .
Hundreds of people have been killed in this underground industry , crushed or suffocated when the tunnels collapse .
Within four years though , Abu Nafez had become his own boss .
He had dug his own tunnels .
He had over 100 employees and was smuggling millions of pounds worth of goods into Gaza .
Crisps , coffee , cookers , cows , cars - yes , that 's right , whole brand - new cars .
Sitting in his garden I asked him how much he earned .
A shy smile crept across his lips as he sipped on a glass of mint tea .
" Over £ 100,000 ( $ 150,000 ) a year , " he reluctantly admitted .
The look on his face suggested it was probably more .
Dwindling traffic
Bling is in short supply in Gaza .
But Abu Nafez 's house has got it .
Loads of it .
A Palestinian smuggler in a tunnel connecting Egypt and Rafah Set back from the road behind an intricate wrought - iron gate , its mirrored , tinted windows bounced back the setting sun .
The style - Palestinian with a twist - an alpine - chalet pine - roof extension to my knowledge unique in Gaza , providing the finishing touch .
This lavish home is the fruit of Abu Nafez 's labours .
But the tunnels business has almost disappeared in the wake of Israel 's decision to ease its blockade of Gaza .
In just a matter of weeks , he says , 80 % of the tunnels have already stopped operating , unable to compete with cheaper , better quality goods now coming in from Israel .
Why buy a dusty , battered box of cornflakes dragged laboriously and illegally underground from Egypt when you can get a nice shiny Israeli box of Kellogg 's finest for two - thirds of the price ?
But money is tight in Gaza where nearly 40 % of people are unemployed .
Frankly , most cannot afford to buy any cornflakes , Israeli or otherwise , when they cost around £ 3 a box - far more expensive than in London or New York .
Skills for export ?
And Israel 's blockade is only being eased , not lifted .
Gaza 's devastated economy is unlikely to pick up .
It will still be hard to get hold of the gravel and sand required for construction .
The Israelis say building materials , which are urgently needed in Gaza , can only be supplied to the United Nations .
The UN still says it is getting only a fraction of what it needs .
The sea blockade remains in force .
And exports , incidentally , are still forbidden too .
And crucially the restrictions on people 's movements remain .
Unless they are very sick , it is extremely difficult for Palestinians to get out of Gaza .
For all his riches , Abu Nafez has never legally left Gaza in his entire life .
Once , he says , he managed to get across to Egypt by his own means but he was arrested .
I ask him , with all his money , where in the world would he most like to go .
" Turkey " , he grins .
" Really ? " I laugh .
" But it was the Turkish Free Gaza Flotilla that indirectly put you out of business . "
" Yes , " he says .
" But I am happy the blockade is over and the Turks they have shown they care about the Palestinians . "
So what will he do now his business is gone ?
Some tunnellers have joked they could export their skills .
Maybe go to the Mexico - US border and set up there , smuggling people or drugs into America .
" You get me there , I 'll go , " quips Abu Nafez .
But for the moment the tunnel millionaire sitting cross-legged in the evening sun in his garden seems happy with his lot .
A big house , lots of money , a new wife and a baby .
Genuinely pleased that the blockade , for the moment at least , is being eased - even if it means he is losing out .

Sambava , Madagascar --
The world 's largest vanilla industry is feared to be on the verge of collapse as farmers struggle to earn a living .
Madagascar , renowned for its high quality vanilla , is the world 's leading exporter of the spice , accounting for half of global production .
But abysmal wages , sharp competition from markets in Asia and the growing popularity of synthetically produced alternatives means Madagascan farmers are abandoning their crops .
According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) , most vanilla production is concentrated in the north - east of the island , where about 70 percent of the population depends on the spice to earn a living .
Jean Bruno is one such farmer and earns little over $ 1.50 a day .
He told CNN : " Yes , it is difficult to grow , to tend it day after day .
But the worst part is the price , it 's miserable . "
Economist Michel Manceau , who is currently collecting information on Madagascar 's vanilla crops , agrees .
He believes with prices so low , many farmers will stop growing the crop altogether .
" The game is to press the price down as strongly as possible to those people , who today are making a dollar a day family income , if they are only in vanilla , " he said .
" A dollar a day .
That 's the limit that has been reached in the last two or three years and most of them are quitting vanilla , " he continued .
Vanilla is a volatile commodity , and the past decade has seen prices fluctuate widely .
According to the IFAD , in 2003 a single kilo of vanilla could cost you up to $ 500 .
Today the price hovers around the $ 25 to $ 30 mark , barely enough for farmers to survive .
Ironically , it was vanilla 's inflated prices in 2003 , when farmers profited the most from the sweet - smelling spice , which have spelt disaster for Madagascar 's vanilla industry .
The price surge was the result of a devastating cyclone in 2000 , which destroyed vast acres of crops .
With the bean in short supply , prices soared and major importers turned to synthetically produced alternatives , the IFAD said .
Winning back these importers has been difficult , with many companies looking to avoided future pitfalls in such a volatile market .
Recovery has been made even harder by competition from countries such as Indonesia , India and Uganda , who entered the market after the 2003 price hike .
It 's a dismal situation for a country renowned for making some of the world 's best vanilla .
Although the Madagascan crop is one of the most labor - intensive in the world , it is highly prized due to its high vanillin content , which gives the vanilla its flavor .
The vanilla bean was introduced to Madagascar during the 19th century .
With no local bees to pollinate the crop each flower must be pollinated by hand in order to produce the prized vanilla beans .
It 's a timely process , which is compounded by the fact that each flower only lasts one day , meaning growers have to inspect and pollinate their plantations every day .
The European Development Research Network estimates farmers needs to spend 260 days per hectare during the first year and about 460 days during the next four to eight years in order to maintain a vanilla crop .
It 's a huge amount of time , especially considering a rice harvest requires an average of 120 man hours per year .
As a result , many vanilla farmers say they no longer reap the rewards of their hard labor .
Claude Andreas , the president of the Madagascar Vanilla Growers ' Association summed up the situation simply , telling CNN : " At less than $ 25 a kilo , the price is too low .
If it goes below that the farmers will just stop growing it .
They can't make ends meet . "
Like a burglar with a universal lock pick , many deadly pathogens use the same protein to gain access to the cells of a potential host , researchers have discovered .
The new findings could have implications for blocking infections by agents ranging from wheat rust to malaria .
Pathogenic fungi , such as flax rust and soybean rust , and similar pathogens known as oomycetes , such as the organism behind the Irish potato famine and sudden oak death , make similar proteins to disarm their hosts ' defenses .
But to work , these effector proteins need to first make their way inside of a cell .
And until now , scientists did not know , in the first place , how these compounds were able to break in .
A new study , published online July 22 in Cell describes how these blights do it .
To infect a plant , pathogenic fungi and oomycetes make a protein called RXLR — a type of effector protein — which enters plant host cells and blocks the plant 's defenses .
But the new research shows that both of these types of organisms are able to insert their effector proteins inside the cell by binding with a single type of lipid on the host cell 's surface .
This union allows the effector protein to be carried into the cell through the cell wall , where it can start doing damage .
" Even though they 're very different , they 're using a similar mode of entry , " says Shiv Kale , a National Science Foundation graduate research fellow at Virginia Tech 's Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and lead author of the new paper , of the various plant pathogens .
The " key " that the pathogens use to get into host cells is a lipid known as phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( or PI - 3 - P ) .
That such different organisms would make use of a single lipid was a surprise to Kale and his colleagues .
And although PI - 3 - P had been described before , " that lipid is predominantly on the inside of the cell , " Kale says , so finding it on the exterior surface of the cells was " really exciting . "
Even though the universality of the lipid use was unexpected , " it makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint , " Kale explains .
If the single key could give pathogens access to a multitude of hosts , the talent would be worth keeping around , leading Kale to conclude that the pathogens ' mode of entry is probably " ancient and highly conserved . "
The single common technique for entry could be salutary for humans and the crops we depend on , though , as researchers in agriculture and medicine strive to find the best ways to block fungal and oomycete infections .
" The finding is no doubt a breakthrough in host–pathogen interaction , " Takao Kasuga and Lynn Epstein , both of the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California , Davis , noted in a joint e-mail to ScientificAmerican.com .
" We now know how pathogens ' effector proteins are delivered into host cells . "
These lipid receptors were not just found on the surface of the plant cells tested by Kale and his colleagues , but on some animal cells as well — including human lung epithelial cells .
Kale is hopeful that the findings might someday be put to use in new treatments that could suppress PI - 3 - P and block the pathogen 's path .
" It seems that if you can find a target for this entry mechanism , you could develop a therapeutic , " he says .
Such a medication might be useful to patients who have compromised immune systems and fall prey to fungal infections that healthier individuals can usually fight off , such as those with AIDS who are more susceptible to cryptococcal meningitis , a fungal infection that can attack the nervous system .
The new data , however , did not illuminate whether any of the host 's biological processes would be interrupted if the binding capabilities of their cells ' external PI - 3 - P were inhibited , Kale says .
And not everyone is sure blocking the host 's binding lipid is going to be a simple approach .
The substance in question is " a ubiquitous and extremely important part of the cell membrane , " Kasuga and Epstein noted .
" Manipulating and blocking of effector–PI - 3 - P interactions without interfering with PI - 3 - P functions in healthy cells may be a challenge . "
More broadly , the findings could help to shed light on other scourges , such as malaria .
Red blood cells , which malaria infects , have not been shown to have PI - 3 - P on their surfaces .
Nevertheless , the malaria parasite Plasmodium seems to have developed a similar mechanism for entering the cells , Kale notes .
And by examining various entry methods of pathogens , researchers like Kale hope to zero in on an early , possibly universal step in the infection process .
Currently , scientists from various disciplines are designing new trials to start putting these findings to work in agricultural and medical realms .
Kale notes that this sort of basic discovery , although minute , is just the kind of jumping - off point many basic science researchers dream of .
He hopes that eventually preventive treatments will " have some benefit to humanity because of it . "

Consciousness in Human and Robot Minds
Daniel C. Dennett Center for Cognitive Studies Tufts University Medford , MA , USA
The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious , and we are a sort of robot ourselves .
That is , we are extraordinarily complex self - controlling , self - sustaining physical mechanisms , designed over the eons by natural selection , and operating according to the same well - understood principles that govern all the other physical processes in living things : digestive and metabolic processes , self - repair and reproductive processes , for instance .
It may be wildly over - ambitious to suppose that human artificers can repeat Nature 's triumph , with variations in material , form , and design process , but this is not a deep objection .
It is not as if a conscious machine contradicted any fundamental laws of nature , the way a perpetual motion machine does .
Still , many skeptics believe -- or in any event want to believe -- that it will never be done .
I would n't wager against them , but my reasons for skepticism are mundane , economic reasons , not theoretical reasons .
Conscious robots probably will always simply cost too much to make .
Nobody will ever synthesize a gall bladder out of atoms of the requisite elements , but I think it is uncontroversial that a gall bladder is nevertheless " just " a stupendous assembly of such atoms .
Might a conscious robot be " just " a stupendous assembly of more elementary artifacts -- silicon chips , wires , tiny motors and cameras -- or would any such assembly , of whatever size and sophistication , have to leave out some special ingredient that is requisite for consciousness ?
Let us briefly survey a nested series of reasons someone might advance for the impossibility of a conscious robot :
(1) Robots are purely material things , and consciousness requires immaterial mind - stuff .
( Old - fashioned dualism )
But if you are willing to concede the hopelessness of dualism , and accept some version of materialism , you might still hold :
(2) Robots are inorganic ( by definition ) , and consciousness can exist only in an organic brain .
I take it that no serious scientific or philosophical thesis links its fate to the fate of the proposition that a protein - free conscious robot can be made , for example .
The standard understanding that a robot shall be made of metal , silicon chips , glass , plastic , rubber and such , is an expression of the willingness of theorists to bet on a simplification of the issues : their conviction is that the crucial functions of intelligence can be achieved by one high - level simulation or another , so that it would be no undue hardship to restrict themselves to these materials , the readily available cost - effective ingredients in any case .
But if somebody were to invent some sort of cheap artificial neural network fabric that could usefully be spliced into various tight corners in a robot 's control system , the embarrassing fact that this fabric was made of organic molecules would not and should not dissuade serious roboticists from using it -- and simply taking on the burden of explaining to the uninitiated why this did not constitute " cheating " in any important sense .
I have discovered that some people are attracted by a third reason for believing in the impossibility of conscious robots .
(3) Robots are artifacts , and consciousness abhors an artifact ; only something natural , born not manufactured , could exhibit genuine consciousness .
And to take a threadbare philosophical example , an atom - for - atom duplicate of a human being , an artifactual counterfeit of you , let us say , might not legally be you , and hence might not be entitled to your belongings , or deserve your punishments , but the suggestion that such a being would not be a feeling , conscious , alive person as genuine as any born of woman is preposterous nonsense , all the more deserving of our ridicule because if taken seriously it might seem to lend credibility to the racist drivel with which it shares a bogus " intuition " .
If consciousness abhors an artifact , it cannot be because being born gives a complex of cells a property ( aside from that historic property itself ) that it could not otherwise have " in principle " .
There might , however , be a question of practicality .
We have just seen how , as a matter of exigent practicality , it could turn out after all that organic materials were needed to make a conscious robot .
For similar reasons , it could turn out that any conscious robot had to be , if not born , at least the beneficiary of a longish period of infancy .
Making a fully - equipped conscious adult robot might just be too much work .
It might be vastly easier to make an initially unconscious or nonconscious " infant " robot and let it " grow up " into consciousness , more or less the way we all do .
This hunch is not the disreputable claim that a certain sort of historic process puts a mystic stamp of approval on its product , but the more interesting and plausible claim that a certain sort of process is the only practical way of designing all the things that need designing in a conscious being .
Such a claim is entirely reasonable .
Compare it to the claim one might make about the creation of Steven Spielberg 's film , Schindler 's List : it could not have been created entirely by computer animation , without the filming of real live actors .
This impossibility claim must be false " in principle , " since every frame of that film is nothing more than a matrix of gray - scale pixels of the sort that computer animation can manifestly create , at any level of detail or " realism " you are willing to pay for .
There is nothing mystical , however , about the claim that it would be practically impossible to render the nuances of that film by such a bizarre exercise of technology .
How much easier it is , practically , to put actors in the relevant circumstances , in a concrete simulation of the scenes one wishes to portray , and let them , via ensemble activity and re-activity , provide the information to the cameras that will then fill in all the pixels in each frame .
This little exercise of the imagination helps to drive home just how much information there is in a " realistic " film , but even a great film , such as Schindler 's List , for all its complexity , is a simple , non-interactive artifact many orders of magnitude less complex than a conscious being .
When robot - makers have claimed in the past that in principle they could construct " by hand " a conscious robot , this was a hubristic overstatement analogous to what Walt Disney might once have proclaimed : that his studio of animators could create a film so realistic that no one would be able to tell that it was a cartoon , not a " live action " film .
What Disney could n't do in fact , computer animators still cannot do , but perhaps only for the time being .
Robot makers , even with the latest high - tech innovations , also fall far short of their hubristic goals , now and for the foreseeable future .
The comparison serves to expose the likely source of the outrage so many skeptics feel when they encounter the manifestos of the Artificial Intelligencia .
Anyone who seriously claimed that Schindler 's List could in fact have been made by computer animation could be seen to betray an obscenely impoverished sense of what is conveyed in that film .
An important element of the film 's power if the fact that it is a film made by assembling human actors to portray those events , and that it is not actually the newsreel footage that its black - and - white format reminds you of .
When one juxtaposes in one 's imagination a sense of what the actors must have gone through to make the film with a sense of what the people who actually lived the events went through , this reflection sets up reverberations in one 's thinking that draw attention to the deeper meanings of the film .
Similarly , when robot enthusiasts proclaim the likelihood that they can simply construct a conscious robot , there is an understandable suspicion that they are simply betraying an infantile grasp of the subtleties of conscious life .
( I hope I have put enough feeling into that condemnation to satisfy the skeptics . )
But however justified that might be in some instances as an ad hominem suspicion , it is simply irrelevant to the important theoretical issues .
Perhaps no cartoon could be a great film , but they are certainly real films -- and some are indeed good films ; if the best the roboticists can hope for is the creation of some crude , cheesy , second - rate , artificial consciousness , they still win .
Still , it is not a foregone conclusion that even this modest goal is reachable .
If you want to have a defensible reason for claiming that no conscious robot will ever be created , you might want to settle for this :
(4) Robots will always just be much too simple to be conscious .
If no other reason can be found , this may do to ground your skepticism about conscious robots in your future , but one shortcoming of this last reason is that it is scientifically boring .
If this is the only reason there wo n't be conscious robots , then consciousness is n't that special , after all .
Another shortcoming with this reason is that it is dubious on its face .
Everywhere else we have looked , we have found higher - level commonalities of function that permit us to substitute relatively simple bits for fiendishly complicated bits .
Artificial heart valves work really very well , but they are orders of magnitude simpler than organic heart valves , heart valves born of woman or sow , you might say .
Artificial ears and eyes that will do a serviceable ( if crude ) job of substituting for lost perceptual organs are visible on the horizon , and anyone who doubts they are possible in principle is simply out of touch .
Nobody ever said a prosthetic eye had to see as keenly , or focus as fast , or be as sensitive to color gradations as a normal human ( or other animal ) eye in order to " count " as an eye .
If an eye , why not an optic nerve ( or acceptable substitute thereof ) , and so forth , all the way in ?
Some ( Searle , 1992 , Mangan , 1993 ) have supposed , most improbably , that this proposed regress would somewhere run into a non-fungible medium of consciousness , a part of the brain that could not be substituted on pain of death or zombiehood .
Once the implications of that view are spelled out ( Dennett , 1993a , 1993b ) , one can see that it is a non-starter .
There is no reason at all to believe that some one part of the brain is utterly irreplacible by prosthesis , provided we allow that some crudity , some loss of function , is to be expected in most substitutions of the simple for the complex .
An artificial brain is , on the face of it , as " possible in principle " as an artificial heart , just much , much harder to make and hook up .
Of course once we start letting crude forms of prosthetic consciousness -- like crude forms of prosthetic vision or hearing -- pass our litmus tests for consciousness ( whichever tests we favor ) the way is open for another boring debate , over whether the phenomena in question are too crude to count .
2. The Cog Project : A Humanoid Robot
A much more interesting tack to explore , in my opinion , is simply to set out to make a robot that is theoretically interesting independent of the philosophical conundrum about whether it is conscious .
Such a robot would have to perform a lot of the feats that we have typically associated with consciousness in the past , but we would not need to dwell on that issue from the outset .
Maybe we could even learn something interesting about what the truly hard problems are without ever settling any of the issues about consciousness .
Such a project is now underway at MIT .
Under the direction of Professors Rodney Brooks and Lynn Andrea Stein of the AI Lab , a group of bright , hard - working young graduate students are laboring as I speak to create Cog , the most humanoid robot yet attempted , and I am happy to be be a part of the Cog team .
Cog is just about life - size -- that is , about the size of a human adult .
Cog has no legs , but lives bolted at the hips , you might say , to its stand .
It has two human - length arms , however , with somewhat simple hands on the wrists .
It can bend at the waist and swing its torso , and its head moves with three degrees of freedom just about the way yours does .
It has two eyes , each equipped with both a foveal high - resolution vision area and a low - resolution wide - angle parafoveal vision area , and these eyes saccade at almost human speed .
That is , the two eyes can complete approximately three fixations a second , while you and I can manage four or five .
Your foveas are at the center of your retinas , surrounded by the grainier low - resolution parafoveal areas ; for reasons of engineering simplicity , Cog 's eyes have their foveas mounted above their wide - angle vision areas .
This is typical of the sort of compromise that the Cog team is willing to make .
It amounts to a wager that a vision system with the foveas moved out of the middle can still work well enough not to be debilitating , and the problems encountered will not be irrelevant to the problems encountered in normal human vision .
After all , nature gives us examples of other eyes with different foveal arrangements .
Eagles have three different foveas in each eye , for instance , and rabbit eyes are another story all together .
Cog 's eyes wo n't give it visual information exactly like that provided to human vision by human eyes ( in fact , of course , it will be vastly degraded ) , but the wager is that this will be plenty to give
Cog the opportunity to perform impressive feats of hand - eye coordination , identification , and search .
At the outset , Cog will not have color vision .
Since its eyes are video cameras mounted on delicate , fast - moving gimbals , it might be disastrous if Cog were inadvertently to punch itself in the eye , so part of the hard - wiring that must be provided in advance is an " innate " if rudimentary " pain " or " alarm " system to serve roughly the same protective functions as the reflex eye - blink and pain - avoidance systems hard - wired into human infants .
Cog will not be an adult at first , in spite of its adult size .
It is being designed to pass through an extended period of artificial infancy , during which it will have to learn from experience , experience it will gain in the rough - and - tumble environment of the real world .
Like a human infant , however , it will need a great deal of protection at the outset , in spite of the fact that it will be equipped with many of the most crucial safety - systems of a living being .
It has limit switches , heat sensors , current sensors , strain gauges and alarm signals in all the right places to prevent it from destroying its many motors and joints .
It has enormous " funny bones " - - motors sticking out from its elbows in a risky way .
These will be protected from harm not by being shielded in heavy armor , but by being equipped with patches of exquisitely sensitive piezo - electric membrane " skin " which will trigger alarms when they make contact with anything .
The goal is that Cog will quickly " learn " to keep its funny bones from being bumped -- if Cog cannot learn this in short order , it will have to have this high - priority policy hard - wired in .
The same sensitive membranes will be used on its fingertips and elsewhere , and , like human tactile nerves , the " meaning " of the signals sent along the attached wires will depend more on what the central control system " makes of them " than on their " intrinsic " characteristics .
A gentle touch , signalling sought - for contact with an object to be grasped , will not differ , as an information packet , from a sharp pain , signalling a need for rapid countermeasures .
It all depends on what the central system is designed to do with the packet , and this design is itself indefinitely revisable -- something that can be adjusted either by Cog 's own experience or by the tinkering of Cog 's artificers .
One of its most interesting " innate " endowments will be software for visual face recognition .
Faces will " pop out " from the background of other objects as items of special interest to Cog .
It will further be innately designed to " want " to keep it's " mother 's " face in view , and to work hard to keep " mother " from turning away .
The role of mother has not yet been cast , but several of the graduate students have been tentatively tapped for this role .
Unlike a human infant , of course , there is no reason why Cog can't have a whole team of mothers , each of whom is innately distinguished by Cog as a face to please if possible .
Clearly , even if Cog really does have a Lebenswelt , it will not be the same as ours .
Decisions have not yet been reached about many of the candidates for hard - wiring or innate features .
Anything that can learn must be initially equipped with a great deal of unlearned design .
That is no longer an issue ; no tabula rasa could ever be impressed with knowledge from experience .
But it is also not much of an issue which features ought to be innately fixed , for there is a convenient trade - off .
I have n't mentioned yet that Cog will actually be a multi-generational series of ever improved models ( if all goes well ! ) , but of course that is the way any complex artifact gets designed .
Any feature that is not innately fixed at the outset , but does get itself designed into Cog 's control system through learning , can then be lifted whole into Cog - II , as a new bit of innate endowment designed by Cog itself - - or rather by Cog 's history of interactions with its environment .
So even in cases in which we have the best of reasons for thinking that human infants actually come innately equipped with pre-designed gear , we may choose to try to get Cog to learn the design in question , rather than be born with it .
In some instances , this is laziness or opportunism -- we do n't really know what might work well , but maybe Cog can train itself up .
This insouciance about the putative nature / nurture boundary is already a familiar attitude among neural net modelers , of course .
Although Cog is not specifically intended to demonstrate any particular neural net thesis , it should come as no surprise that Cog 's nervous system is a massively parallel architecture capable of simultaneously training up an indefinite number of special - purpose networks or circuits , under various regimes .
How plausible is the hope that Cog can retrace the steps of millions of years of evolution in a few months or years of laboratory exploration ?
Notice first that what I have just described is a variety of Lamarckian inheritance that no organic lineage has been able to avail itself of .
The acquired design innovations of Cog - I can be immediately transferred to Cog - II , a speed - up of evolution of tremendous , if incalculable , magnitude .
Moreover , if you bear in mind that , unlike the natural case , there will be a team of overseers ready to make patches whenever obvious shortcomings reveal themselves , and to jog the systems out of ruts whenever they enter them , it is not so outrageous a hope , in our opinion .
But then , we are all rather outrageous people .
One talent that we have hopes of teaching to Cog is a rudimentary capacity for human language .
And here we run into the fabled innate language organ or Language Acquisition Device made famous by Noam Chomsky .
Is there going to be an attempt to build an innate LAD for our Cog ?
No .
We are going to try to get Cog to build language the hard way , the way our ancestors must have done , over thousands of generations .
Cog has ears ( four , because it 's easier to get good localization with four microphones than with carefully shaped ears like ours ! ) and some special - purpose signal - analyzing software is being developed to give
Cog a fairly good chance of discriminating human speech sounds , and probably the capacity to distinguish different human voices .
Cog will also have to have speech synthesis hardware and software , of course , but decisions have not yet been reached about the details .
It is important to have Cog as well - equipped as possible for rich and natural interactions with human beings , for the team intends to take advantage of as much free labor as it can .
Untrained people ought to be able to spend time -- hours if they like , and we rather hope they do -- trying to get Cog to learn this or that .
Growing into an adult is a long , time - consuming business , and Cog - - and the team that is building Cog - - will need all the help it can get .
Obviously this will not work unless the team manages somehow to give
Cog a motivational structure that can be at least dimly recognized , responded to , and exploited by naive observers .
In short , Cog should be as human as possible in its wants and fears , likes and dislikes .
If those anthropomorphic terms strike you as unwarranted , put them in scare - quotes or drop them altogether and replace them with tedious neologisms of your own choosing : Cog , you may prefer to say , must have goal - registrations and preference - functions that map in rough isomorphism to human desires .
This is so for many reasons , of course .
Cog wo n't work at all unless it has its act together in a daunting number of different regards .
It must somehow delight in learning , abhor error , strive for novelty , recognize progress .
It must be vigilant in some regards , curious in others , and deeply unwilling to engage in self - destructive activity .
While we are at it , we might as well try to make it crave human praise and company , and even exhibit a sense of humor .
Let me switch abruptly from this heavily anthropomorphic language to a brief description of Cog 's initial endowment of information - processing hardware .
The computer - complex that has been built to serve as the development platform for Cog 's artificial nervous system consists of four backplanes , each with 16 nodes ; each node is basically a Mac - II computer -- a 68332 processor with a megabyte of RAM .
In other words , you can think of Cog 's brain as roughly equivalent to sixty - four Mac - IIs yoked in a custom parallel architecture .
Each node is itself a multiprocessor , and they all run a special version of parallel Lisp developed by Rodney Brooks , and called , simply , L. Each node has an interpreter for L in its ROM , so it can execute L files independently of every other node .
Each node has 6 assignable input - output ports , in addition to the possibility of separate i-o ( input - output ) to the motor boards directly controlling the various joints , as well as the all - important i-o to the experimenters ' monitoring and control system , the Front End Processor or FEP ( via another unit known as the Interfep ) .
On a bank of separate monitors , one can see the current image in each camera ( two foveas , two parafoveas ) , the activity in each of the many different visual processing areas , or the activities of any other nodes .
Cog is thus equipped at birth with the equivalent of chronically implanted electrodes for each of its neurons ; all its activities can be monitored in real time , recorded and debugged .
The FEP is itself a Macintosh computer in more conventional packaging .
At startup , each node is awakened by a FEP call that commands it to load its appropriate files of L from a file server .
These files configure it for whatever tasks it has currently been designed to execute .
Thus the underlying hardware machine can be turned into any of a host of different virtual machines , thanks to the capacity of each node to run its current program .
The nodes do not make further use of disk memory , however , during normal operation .
They keep their transient memories locally , in their individual megabytes of RAM .
In other words , Cog stores both its genetic endowment ( the virtual machine ) and its long term memory on disk when it is shut down , but when it is powered on , it first configures itself and then stores all its short term memory distributed one way or another among its 64 nodes .
The space of possible virtual machines made available and readily explorable by this underlying architecture is huge , of course , and it covers a volume in the space of all computations that has not yet been seriously explored by artificial intelligence researchers .
Moreover , the space of possibilities it represents is manifestly much more realistic as a space to build brains in than is the space heretofore explored , either by the largely serial architectures of GOFAI ( " Good Old Fashioned AI " , Haugeland , 1985 ) , or by parallel architectures simulated by serial machines .
Nevertheless , it is arguable that every one of the possible virtual machines executable by Cog is minute in comparison to a real human brain .
In short , Cog has a tiny brain .
There is a big wager being made : the parallelism made possible by this arrangement will be sufficient to provide real - time control of importantly humanoid activities occurring on a human time scale .
If this proves to be too optimistic by as little as an order of magnitude , the whole project will be forlorn , for the motivating insight for the project is that by confronting and solving actual , real time problems of self - protection , hand - eye coordination , and interaction with other animate beings , Cog 's artificers will discover the sufficient conditions for higher cognitive functions in general -- and maybe even for a variety of consciousness that would satisfy the skeptics .
It is important to recognize that although the theoretical importance of having a body has been appreciated ever since Alan Turing ( 1950 ) drew specific attention to it in his classic paper , " Computing Machines and Intelligence , " within the field of Artificial Intelligence there has long been a contrary opinion that robotics is largely a waste of time , money and effort .
According to this view , whatever deep principles of organization make cognition possible can be as readily discovered in the more abstract realm of pure simulation , at a fraction of the cost .
In many fields , this thrifty attitude has proven to be uncontroversial wisdom .
No economists have asked for the funds to implement their computer models of markets and industries in tiny robotic Wall Streets or Detroits , and civil engineers have largely replaced their scale models of bridges and tunnels with computer models that can do a better job of simulating all the relevant conditions of load , stress and strain .
Closer to home , simulations of ingeniously oversimplified imaginary organisms foraging in imaginary environments , avoiding imaginary predators and differentially producing imaginary offspring are yielding important insights into the mechanisms of evolution and ecology in the new field of Artificial Life .
So it is something of a surprise to find this AI group conceding , in effect , that there is indeed something to the skeptics ' claim ( e.g. , Dreyfus and Dreyfus , 1986 ) that genuine embodiment in a real world is crucial to consciousness .
Not , I hasten to add , because genuine embodiment provides some special vital juice that mere virtual - world simulations cannot secrete , but for the more practical reason -- or hunch -- that unless you saddle yourself with all the problems of making a concrete agent take care of itself in the real world , you will tend to overlook , underestimate , or misconstrue the deepest problems of design .
Besides , as I have already noted , there is the hope that Cog will be able to design itself in large measure , learning from infancy , and building its own representation of its world in the terms that it innately understands .
Nobody doubts that any agent capable of interacting intelligently with a human being on human terms must have access to literally millions if not billions of logically independent items of world knowledge .
Either these must be hand - coded individually by human programmers -- a tactic being pursued , notoriously , by Douglas Lenat and his CYC team in Dallas - - or some way must be found for the artificial agent to learn its world knowledge from ( real ) interactions with the ( real ) world .
The potential virtues of this shortcut have long been recognized within AI circles ( e.g. , Waltz , 1988 ) .
The unanswered question is whether taking on the task of solving the grubby details of real - world robotics will actually permit one to finesse the task of hand - coding the world knowledge .
Brooks , Stein and their team - - myself included -- are gambling that it will .
At this stage of the project , most of the problems being addressed would never arise in the realm of pure , disembodied AI .
How many separate motors might be used for controlling each hand ?
They will have to be mounted somehow on the forearms .
Will there then be room to mount the motor boards directly on the arms , close to the joints they control , or would they get in the way ?
How much cabling can each arm carry before weariness or clumsiness overcome it ?
The arm joints have been built to be compliant -- springy , like your own joints .
This means that if Cog wants to do some fine - fingered manipulation , it will have to learn to " burn " some of the degrees of freedom in its arm motion by temporarily bracing its elbows or wrists on a table or other convenient landmark , just as you would do .
Such compliance is typical of the mixed bag of opportunities and problems created by real robotics .
Another is the need for self - calibration or re-calibration in the eyes .
If Cog 's eyes jiggle away from their preset aim , thanks to the wear and tear of all that sudden saccading , there must be ways for Cog to compensate , short of trying continually to adjust its camera - eyes with its fingers .
Software designed to tolerate this probable sloppiness in the first place may well be more robust and versatile in many other ways than software designed to work in a more " perfect " world .
Earlier I mentioned a reason for using artificial muscles , not motors , to control a robot 's joints , and the example was not imaginary .
Brooks is concerned that the sheer noise of Cog 's skeletal activities may seriously interfere with the attempt to give Cog humanoid hearing .
There is research underway at the AI Lab to develop synthetic electro - mechanical muscle tissues , which would operate silently as well as being more compact , but this will not be available for early incarnations of Cog .
For an entirely different reason , thought is being given to the option of designing Cog 's visual control software as if its eyes were moved by muscles , not motors , building in a software interface that amounts to giving Cog a set of virtual eye - muscles .
Why might this extra complication in the interface be wise ?
Because the " opponent - process " control system exemplified by eye - muscle controls is apparently a deep and ubiquitous feature of nervous systems , involved in control of attention generally and disrupted in such pathologies as unilateral neglect .
If we are going to have such competitive systems at higher levels of control , it might be wise to build them in " all the way down , " concealing the final translation into electric - motor - talk as part of the backstage implementation , not the model .
Other practicalities are more obvious , or at least more immediately evocative to the uninitiated .
Three huge red " emergency kill " buttons have already been provided in Cog 's environment , to ensure that if Cog happens to engage in some activity that could injure or endanger a human interactor ( or itself ) , there is a way of getting it to stop .
But what is the appropriate response for Cog to make to the KILL button ?
If power to Cog 's motors is suddenly shut off , Cog will slump , and its arms will crash down on whatever is below them .
Is this what we want to happen ?
Do we want Cog to drop whatever it is holding ?
What should " Stop ! " mean to Cog ?
This is a real issue about which there is not yet any consensus .
There are many more details of the current and anticipated design of Cog that are of more than passing interest to those in the field , but on this occasion , I want to use the little remaining time to address some overriding questions that have been much debated by philosophers , and that receive a ready treatment in the environment of thought made possible by Cog .
In other words , let 's consider Cog merely as a prosthetic aid to philosophical thought - experiments , a modest but by no means negligible role for Cog to play .
3. Some Philosophical Considerations
A recent criticism of " strong AI " that has received quite a bit of attention is the so - called problem of " symbol grounding " ( Harnad , 1990 ) .
It is all very well for large AI programs to have data structures that purport to refer to Chicago , milk , or the person to whom I am now talking , but such imaginary reference is not the same as real reference , according to this line of criticism .
These internal " symbols " are not properly " grounded " in the world , and the problems thereby eschewed by pure , non-robotic , AI are not trivial or peripheral .
As one who discussed , and ultimately dismissed , a version of this problem many years ago ( Dennett , 1969 , p.182 ff ) , I would not want to be interpreted as now abandoning my earlier view .
I submit that Cog moots the problem of symbol grounding , without having to settle its status as a criticism of " strong AI " .
Anything in Cog that might be a candidate for symbolhood will automatically be " grounded " in Cog 's real predicament , as surely as its counterpart in any child , so the issue does n't arise , except as a practical problem for the Cog team , to be solved or not , as fortune dictates .
If the day ever comes for Cog to comment to anybody about Chicago , the question of whether Cog is in any position to do so will arise for exactly the same reasons , and be resolvable on the same considerations , as the parallel question about the reference of the word " Chicago " in the idiolect of a young child .
Another claim that has often been advanced , most carefully by Haugeland ( 1985 ) , is that nothing could properly " matter " to an artificial intelligence , and mattering ( it is claimed ) is crucial to consciousness .
Haugeland restricted his claim to traditional GOFAI systems , and left robots out of consideration .
Would he concede that something could matter to Cog ?
The question , presumably , is how seriously to weigh the import of the quite deliberate decision by Cog 's creators to make Cog as much as possible responsible for its own welfare .
Cog will be equipped with some " innate " but not at all arbitrary preferences , and hence provided of necessity with the concomitant capacity to be " bothered " by the thwarting of those preferences , and " pleased " by the furthering of the ends it was innately designed to seek .
Some may want to retort : " This is not real pleasure or pain , but merely a simulacrum . "
Perhaps , but on what grounds will they defend this claim ?
Cog may be said to have quite crude , simplistic , one - dimensional pleasure and pain , cartoon pleasure and pain if you like , but then the same might also be said of the pleasure and pain of simpler organisms -- clams or houseflies , for instance .
Most , if not all , of the burden of proof is shifted by Cog , in my estimation .
The reasons for saying that something does matter to Cog are not arbitrary ; they are exactly parallel to the reasons we give for saying that things matter to us and to other creatures .
Since we have cut off the dubious retreats to vitalism or origin chauvinism , it will be interesting to see if the skeptics have any good reasons for declaring Cog 's pains and pleasures not to matter -- at least to it , and for that very reason , to us as well .
It will come as no surprise , I hope , that more than a few participants in the Cog project are already musing about what obligations they might come to have to Cog , over and above their obligations to the Cog team .
Finally , J.R. Lucas ( 1994 ) has raised the claim that if a robot were really conscious , we would have to be prepared to believe it about its own internal states .
I would like to close by pointing out that this is a rather likely reality in the case of Cog .
Although equipped with an optimal suite of monitoring devices that will reveal the details of its inner workings to the observing team , Cog 's own pronouncements could very well come to be a more trustworthy and informative source of information on what was really going on inside it .
The information visible on the banks of monitors , or gathered by the gigabyte on hard disks , will be at the outset almost as hard to interpret , even by Cog 's own designers , as the information obtainable by such " third - person " methods as MRI and CT scanning in the neurosciences .
As the observers refine their models , and their understanding of their models , their authority as interpreters of the data may grow , but it may also suffer eclipse .
Especially since
Cog will be designed from the outset to redesign itself as much as possible , there is a high probability that the designers will simply lose the standard hegemony of the artificer ( " I made it , so I know what it is supposed to do , and what it is doing now ! " ) .
Into this epistemological vacuum Cog may very well thrust itself .
In fact , I would gladly defend the conditional prediction : if Cog develops to the point where it can conduct what appear to be robust and well - controlled conversations in something like a natural language , it will certainly be in a position to rival its own monitors ( and the theorists who interpret them ) as a source of knowledge about what it is doing and feeling , and why .

Image caption Rarely - seen images of the Queen and other royals will be available on the Flickr account
Rare pictures of the Royal family have been posted on the internet after Buckingham Palace opened an account on photography website Flickr .
The images of recent royal events , archive pictures of the Queen , Prince of Wales and other members of the monarchy can be seen from Monday .
More than 600 photographs have been added to the British Monarchy 's Photostream account .
The images will be updated as new engagements and events take place .
The development follows the launch of the updated royal website , British Monarchy Twitter account last year and the Royal Channel on YouTube in 2007 .
The Flickr account is timed to coincide with the summer opening of Buckingham Palace , as it features photographs commissioned for the exhibition The Queen 's Year , which opens next Tuesday at the London palace .
Royal children
Highlights from the photo website include early pictures of Queen Victoria and other leading figures from the era , images of Queen Elizabeth II as a baby and pictures of the latest royal events .
The account has been divided into two categories - the first , Royal Collection , contains images commissioned for The Queen 's Year exhibition and the Victorian pictures .
There are also behind - the - scenes shots showing the Royal household staff working at a state banquet .
And there are images by photographer Marcus Adams showing royal children , from the Queen as a baby to Prince Charles as a little boy .
The Royal Family section groups pictures of the monarchy by individuals .
Prince Harry is shown as a newborn baby , in the arms of his mother Diana , Princess of Wales , for example .
His older brother , Prince William , is pictured as a youngster with his parents and sibling , on exercise with Royal Navy in the Caribbean and meeting David Beckham in South Africa .
OAKLAND , Calif . 
Even as city residents cleaned up after a night of looting and vandalism , Mayor Ron Dellums of Oakland said he supported a federal investigation that is under way on the death of Oscar Grant III , a young unarmed black man who was shot and killed by a white transit police officer .
The officer , Johannes Mehserle , was convicted of involuntary manslaughter on Thursday by a Los Angeles jury that rejected a more serious charge of second - degree murder .
Mr. Grant , 22 , was shot in the back on Jan. 1 , 2009 , while lying face down on a subway platform ; in his defense , Mr. Mehserle said he had meant to draw and use his Taser , not his gun .
The verdict , which came after a little more than a day ’s deliberation , was met with both peaceful protests and more violent skirmishes after dark , with the police making 78 arrests and dodging homemade bombs , rocks and other projectiles .
But only three injuries were reported , one to a civilian and two to the police .
On Friday , Mr. Dellums praised his police department ’s performance and said he would back an investigation by the Justice Department and the F.B.I .
The Justice Department said it was looking “ to determine whether the evidence warrants federal prosecution . ”
PRINCETON , NJ — Contraceptive manufacturer Trojan unveiled its new line of “ No One ’s Pleasure ” condoms Wednesday , the first prophylactic specifically designed to intensify sexual dissatisfaction among bitter and resentful couples .

“ We ’ve always offered consumers a choice when it comes to protection , and we wanted to give emotionally distant partners an option that suits their lack of intimacy , ” said Jim Daniels , vice president of marketing at Trojan .
“ That ’s why we ’ve developed the only condoms clinically proven to exploit performance anxiety , heighten discomfort levels , and prolong the petty arguments that allow couples to bicker needlessly all night long . ”
According to a Trojan press release , No One ’s Pleasure condoms feature a quarter - inch - thick layer of non-lubricated latex with a unique abrasive texture that creates a variety of stinging sensations “ for both him and her . ”
The company statement goes on to explain that the product magnifies personal insecurities and awakens deep - seated , unresolved relationship issues that are “ sure to raise passions and quicken your pulse . ”
Advertisement
The cutting - edge prophylactics are also extremely tapered at their base and tip , which Trojan engineers said induces premature ejaculation and provides longer - lasting hostility and alienation .
Lead designer Benjamin Walton said the bulky , ill - fitting sheaths greatly constrict the movement of any man who wears them and when used correctly are 98 percent effective at preventing vaginal penetration .
Advertisement
“ These condoms feel extremely unnatural , and their sandpaper - like texture is so rough and gritty it rubs everyone raw , ” Walton said .
Advertisement
Trojan confirmed that No One ’s Pleasure condoms will be available in “ Frigid Touch , ” “ Extremely Oversensitive , ” and “ Ultra - Chafe : Super Dry , ” and will cost $ 20 for a three - pack , a price researchers found perfect for instigating squabbles over who has to pay .
Many will be sold in boxes containing fewer condoms than the packaging indicates in order to arouse feelings of suspicion and jealousy and help contemptuous couples get in the right mood for unfulfilling and empty sex .
Advertisement
“ Just by making the wrappers a little more difficult to open we raised frustration levels by nearly two - thirds . ”
Walton said .
“ And our most successful prototypes resulted in partners either not having sex or having really angry sex for maybe five seconds . ”
Later this week Trojan will begin promoting the new product with a nationwide marketing campaign , running print ads that feature a silhouette of two people facing away from each other , arms crossed , and the product ’s official slogan , “ Let ’s Just Get This Over With . ”

Consumers who participated in focus groups for No One ’s Pleasure were impressed by the condoms ’ ability to both sustain current animosities and rejuvenate old ones .
“ These things are great , ” said test subject
Jerry Morelli , who explained that the condoms have helped him find new ways to loathe and disparage his wife of 15 years .
“ If I ’m not gonna enjoy myself , I want to make damn sure she does n’t either . ”

Trojan reportedly decided to develop the new condoms after marketing research indicated the company was missing out on an entire segment of the population : the exasperated and spiteful sexual partners who account for 65 percent of all couples .
Why not just rent out an elementary school gym and sell recalled toys with lead paint ?

MongoDB at Etsy , Part 2
Posted by John Allspaw on July 3 , 2010
Note :
In 2020 we updated this post to adopt more inclusive language .
Going forward , we ’ll use “ primary / replica ” in our Code as Craft entries .
Dan and Wil posted a while ago about how we ’re using MongoDB at Etsy .
We ’ve been using MongoDB as the backing store for Treasury , and over the course of two and a half months , we ’ve had over 50,000 excellent Treasuries created by the Etsy community , all stored and served in MongoDB .
Not so bad .
I thought I ’d post a bit about what I like about MongoDB , operationally .
The things that were most important to me on that front were :
Stability
Sane behavior under increasing load
Metrics availability
Familiar replication behavior
Of course the first thing that was of concern was stability .
Who wants to implement something crashy ?
We got enough honest reports of stability from other folks with MongoDB in production and our experience is no different .
This is in large part due to the activity on the mongodb - user list , as well as talking to folks who have already put it into production .
Performance
One of the things that Dan touched on was that MongoDB behaves well when the working set of data exceeds available physical RAM .
The folks over at 10 gen obviously have put a good deal of thought into this , because otherwise you would n’t be able to call it “ humongous ” .
🙂
While the mechanics of how data is buffered to RAM and persists to disk appear to be different , the behavior appears to be along the same lines as InnoDB ’s buffer pooling and persistence .
Which is to say , query performance is excellent when the database is small enough to keep entirely in RAM , but when the data blows past RAM , the performance then plateaus , limited only by your disk I /O subsystem .
This is preferable and familiar ; there ’s no massive drop ( or crash ) in performance , there ’s only a nice plateau of response at the bound - by - disk condition .
When we first evaluated MongoDB , we loaded up all of the ‘ favorites ‘ data into a MongoDB instance ( it ’s currently kept in Postgres in production ) which was well over 40G of data .
We then hammered it with 5000 random queries at a time , constantly .
The machine has 8 15 K SAS spindles , RAID10 , and only 16G of RAM .
We watched the query performance as the filesystem cache filled to 16G , and once it hit 16G , the performance leveled out , consistent with a purely disk - bound workload .
We saw the same results when we loaded up 70G worth of Etsy ’s listing data and performed the same test .
This is what you ’d normally expect with any sane datastore that is expected to scale with large ( and growing ) working sets of persisted data .
Why is this important ?
Because any datastore can be fast when its working set is in RAM , but we need to prepare for exceeding that , and not relying on vertically scaling our machines to handle increasing traffic .
Metrics
The other piece that I appreciate in MongoDB is the metrics it exposes about its operations , and how it ’s easy to get at them .
There ’s currently an http interface at http://127.0.0.1:28017/_status that dumps a good deal of parse - able information .
We use these metrics not just for alerting thresholds ( on current connections , replica replication lag ) but also for gathering statistics for all of the Mongo operations being done .
Wil has a ganglia gmetric script that parses this data to put into Ganglia .
He ’s open - sourced the gmetric and it ’s on github .
This way , we can correlate what CPU , memory , disk , etc. values look like with increasing usage across all of the various mongo metrics .
Context is everything . 🙂
Familiarity
Having come from a LAMP background , I ’m used to having database replication be a given .
I realized the other day that the last time I worked somewhere replication of data was n’t an absolute requirement , it was 2003 .
So when we first evaluated MongoDB , replication was one of the first things I was happy to see .
Replication is super simple , and for anyone familiar with MySQL ’s built - in replication , all of the fundamentals apply : MongoDB writes to an oplog collection for transactions which is then used as the replication stream between primaries and replicas .
The oplog is actually a database , unlike binlogs in MySQL - land .
This means you can query it and inspect it in the same way you would any database in Mongo .
Dan ’s got a project up on github that allows you to inspect and manipulate the oplog easily , and he ’ll be adding more abilities to it in the future .
This will be familiar to those who have worked with mysqlbinlog in that it provides an easy way to juggle replication events in recovery or troubleshooting scenarios .
Dan did n’t write that tool out of curiosity .
It turns out that we were going to need something like that soon enough .
Stay tuned for Part 3 of this Mongodb Etsy story ….
SEATTLE , July 2 / PRNewswire / -- Cedar Grove Composting announced today that it is working with BioFerm Energy Systems , a German - based clean energy generation company owned by The Viessmann Group , to integrate anaerobic digestion into its composting process .
The proposed technology employs a high - solids anaerobic digester that produces a usable biogas by enhancing natural processes to convert food scraps and yard clippings into a viable fuel .
That biogas can then be used as either natural gas for auto and truck fuel or to produce electricity .
Cedar Grove is in the engineering and design phase of this project .
" Cedar Grove is always seeking proven new technologies to bring waste materials to a higher use , for example , turning food waste into compost or energy , " said Steve Banchero , Cedar Grove Composting CEO .
" Cedar Grove is moving into the next realm of its development , the creation of green energy from food scraps that were once destined for a land fill .
This is the closed loop business model that is our core competency and focus . "
The project is one of the first and largest of its kind in the U.S.
The digester will produce biogas by converting once wasted food and yard scraps into digestate that can then be combusted to produce electricity and heat , or be scrubbed to natural gas quality .
These can be used as a renewable alternative to compressed natural gas applications , such as transportation fuel .
Once operational , the digester will produce energy equivalent to the electricity usage of 400 homes or the fuel for 1,100 passenger vehicles per year .
" Like all of our sustainable business models , we need a healthy aftermarket for the products and by - products we produce in order for our programs to be viable , " continued Banchero .
" Our model is to continue to make quality products from materials that are otherwise destined for the landfill and sell them back into our local market .
We are currently looking to secure contracts for sale of electricity or natural gas in order to complete our digester business plan . "
" We have researched this technology in use in Europe and we are hopeful through our partnership with BioFerm that we can adapt it to U.S. standards and economics .
We are excited about its potential to produce green energy from food scraps and yard waste , " Banchero said .
" Our plans are to start with a relatively small digester and expand the use of this technology when it has proven itself in our system . "
By producing energy from food waste and reducing green house gases , Cedar Grove will help reduce landfill volumes , saving space for items that truly have no greater usage .
Energy made from source separated food and yard waste is also a cleaner fuel than landfill derived methane .

" We 've been looking for each other our entire lifetime , " Phil Collen tells PEOPLE of his costume designer bride
Love Bites ?
Well , not for Def Leppard lead guitarist Phil Collen .
The British rocker married costume designer Helen L. Simmons on the beach at Florida ’s Ritz - Carlton , Palm Beach resort in a sunset ceremony Friday .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ We ’ve been looking for each other our entire lifetime , ” Collen tells PEOPLE .
“ To say we ’re ecstatic this day has finally come is putting it mildly .
It could only be us for each other . ”
Guests included Collen ’s Def Leppard bandmates Rick Savage and Vivian Campbell , as well as Muay Thai champion and trainer Jean Carrillo , who served as best man .
The couple , who met on the band ’s 2008 Sparkle Lounge tour , also added some environmentally friendly touches to their big day .
“ We did n’t intentionally start out trying to have green wedding , ” says Collen , 52 .
“ But since it ’s a natural part of our lifestyle to respect the environment , everything flowed pretty naturally . ”
They e-mailed their invitations , which were designed by Paperless Post , and their alcohol - free reception meal featured an organic vegetarian and vegan menu since Collen has been meat - free for 27 years .
Evolution is Far Freer than Classical Liberalism
I am intensely distrustful of attempts to marshal the dead to support a particular political philosophy , and I am even more suspicious of efforts to use science to justify a political view .
It suggests a deficiency of living contemporary critical thought , not exactly a hallmark of a vital movement , and of the sciences , evolutionary biology has to explain diversity as well as adaptedness , and so is a poor discipline to use to promote a single view .
Larry Arnhart begins by telling us that libertarians need Charles Darwin , and that is because Darwinian science supports classical liberalism .
The first is unsurprising and the second too vague to be meaningful .
Everyone needs Charles Darwin .
His ideas are the foundation of modern biology , so that ’s about as great a truism as saying that everyone needs Isaac Newton .
Most political movements at least aspire to be congruent with reality , and denying the biological realities revealed in the light of evolutionary theory ( or denying the physical realities revealed by Newton ) would constitute a very poor framework for rational policymaking .
Throwing out a major chunk of modern science is a strategy to put one in the political ghetto of crackpots like David Icke , Lyndon LaRouche , or Sarah Palin — which , at least in the last case , is not an insurmountable barrier to some kind of political success , but it ’s got to be a blow against one ’s self - respect .
But to suggest that the science of evolution supports a specific view of the narrowly human domain of politics is meaningless .
Evolutionary theory supports the existence of ants and eagles , lichens and redwood trees , and finding an evolutionary basis for any human activity is trivial .
The Revolutionary Communist Party has claimed evolution for its own .
They ’ve even published a very good book explaining the basics of the theory , The Science of Evolution and the Myth of Creationism , by Ardea Skybreak .
I find their arguments that the science of biology supports a communist worldview just as convincing as Arnhart ’s that it supports classical liberalism … which means not very .
It has become a well - funded industry within certain branches of Christianity to push the compatibility of evolutionary biology with their religion , which beggars my imagination , at least .
I can concede that Arnhart is on stronger footing than BioLogos or the Templeton Foundation ; at least he is n’t postulating anything directly contrary to Darwinian ideas , such as the existence of intent shaping the history of life , but he comes close when he suggests that concern for virtue has some kind of scientific justification .
The Green Party could make an even better argument for compatibility with Darwinian thought .
At least there , there is some acknowledgment of organisms other than humans , our dependency on interactions with the environment , and the importance of species and habitat diversity .
If there is one arresting image to emerge from Darwin ’s work , it is the metaphor of the tangled bank , where diverse forms struggle for survival in a complex environment .
Any rationale that focuses on the habits of a single species , and addresses only a narrow range of interests in a single culture in a small slice of time , cannot lay claim to Darwin ’s mantle .
Among the flaws of Arnhart ’s argument , as well as those of other ideologies , is that there is little comparison of which side has the relatively best fit to the scientific observations — instead , there is a roster of points of correspondence of one favored theory to the science , followed by the conclusion that therefore science supports the theory .
At best , this is grounds for claiming compatibility , but given the multitudes of different ideas that flourish in the tangled bank of human politics , I am unconvinced that classical liberalism has any kind of privileged place .
Now where I do agree is the description of Darwin the man .
Charles Darwin was an upper middle - class businessman , cautious and prosperous in his investments , involved in the welfare of his community .
He was also , for his time , a social liberal who promoted great causes , like abolitionism .
He was the perfect figure of a classical liberal .
However , that says nothing about his science !
Peter Kropotkin was an anarchist , Theodosius Dobzhansky was devoutly Eastern Orthodox , Richard Lewontin was a Marxist , Francis Crick was an atheist — these are factors in their personal journeys through science , but they are not the lens through which we should look at their actual work … and if their work only makes sense as libertarian science or Marxist science , then there is a deep flaw in it .
We are always looking for the answers that transcend the circumstances of personality and politics , and are suspicious of those dependent on prior bias .
Most tellingly , though , if Darwin was a good classical liberal , and if his theory was so compatible with classical liberalism , why was he made so uneasy by his own ideas ?
He sat on it for two decades , uncomfortable with its implications for society and worried about its effect on those close to him .
This was not the action of a man who felt that his theory was entirely consonant with his philosophy .
In part this was because he felt that weakening the belief in a creator god would “ dissolve the moral bonds of human society , ” but again , atheism is not a necessary prerequisite of classical liberalism , since there have been and are theistic libertarians , and it does not distinguish other political philosophies from classical liberalism .
Evolution gives us only very general rules for our species .
Adapt to the environment , or die .
Change is inevitable .
No matter what our species does , it will eventually change or die .
It ’s not necessarily the most uplifting of messages , but there are encouraging lessons within it .
Diversity is unavoidable , providing many different avenues our species could follow , and also , that our happiness does not have to descend from our biological limitations ; we often work against our predispositions , because the elements of our inheritance that may have worked for a savannah ape must often be expanded upon and redirected to make a modern urban ape thrive .
Evolution does not incline us to classical liberalism ; it is just one of many options that evolution allows .

Can Kyrgyzstan Become a Democracy in Russia ’s Backyard ?
In recent weeks , Kyrgyzstan has offered little in the way of good news .
Once regarded as the best hope for democracy in Central Asia , the country ’s government was thrown out in a coup last April .
Just months later , the southern part of the country descended into communal warfare , sending tens of thousands fleeing , many across the border into Uzbekistan .
Seventy - five thousand people are still displaced .
Amid the violence , Kyrgyzstan ’s hopes for democracy seemed like a distant fantasy .
And then something unexpected happened :
The interim government followed through on its promise to hold a referendum on a new , more democratic constitution .
And when voters approved the document at the end of June , Kyrgyzstan became the strongest parliamentary system in Central Asia , at least on paper .
Not only that , but in limiting the power of its future head of state , the country achieved something unheard of in its authoritarian region .
The turmoil of recent months has produced a new glimmer of hope for a democratic Kyrgyzstan .
The new Kyrgyz power - sharing constitution is , of course , an experiment — but it ’s crafted in a cunning way that gives it a shot at survival .
Instead of adopting an existing Western constitution and slapping Kyrgyz names on it , the framers tried to tailor Western examples to fit their own political realities — beginning with the need to create more than one powerful national leader .
In the next government , there will be two top posts : a president and prime minister .
Just how the two divide their powers will need to be worked out in practice .
But the chairman of the constitutional council , Omurbek Tekebaev , notes that an initial framework is in place .
" The president can veto , or refuse to sign any laws , except for laws related to budget and fiscal policy , " Tekebaev told me .
It ’s a measure meant to prevent any future leader from ruling by decree , as powerful men do everywhere else in Central Asia .
If the parliament controls the purse strings , the logic goes , the president will have to be more restrained .
Just as it constrains the executive , the new constitution also tries to put a ceiling on how powerful any one party in parliament can become .
Individual parties are limited to a maximum of 65 seats in the 120 - seat chamber .
That is more than enough for a simple majority , but it also means a party would likely have to form a coalition to rule effectively .
Thomas Markert , secretary for the Council of Europe ’s Venice Commission , which advised Bishkek on constitutional issues , thinks the plan may work , given Kyrgyzstan ’s frustration with authoritarian rulers .
( Since the country declared independence from the crumbling Soviet Union in 1991 , it has had two autocratic presidents and two street revolutions to depose them . )
" I would not have advised [ them ] to do it , but I can understand why it is being done , " Markert said in an interview .
Of course , the true test for Kyrgyzstan ’s new constitution is not how it is written but how it is applied .
And a stark warning about what can go wrong is provided by Ukraine , another post - Soviet state where popular protest — the vaunted " Orange Revolution " — ushered in reformist leaders who proceeded to fight over their newfound power .
Some blame Ukraine ’s troubles on a provision similarly to that trumpeted in the Kyrgyz document , creating , in a sense , two people with authority over the executive branch .
If Kyrgyzstan wants to avoid the same , it might consider a more explicit division of tasks , as Western states with both president and prime minister have done .
There are , of course , those who write off the power of documents all together , lamenting a deeper , harder - to - fix problem : a post - Soviet culture of political expediency that still has deep roots across Central Asia .
This mentality , left deeply ingrained by a communist system that offered no financial rewards to those who played fair , has empowered authoritarians for the last two decades .
Those men have in turn bent the laws and circumvented ( or at least influenced ) the courts , reducing any constitution or bill of rights to an abstraction .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , upon reviewing the new Kyrgyz constitution , seemed to think it was doomed to failure in such a climate : " Will this not lead to a chain of eternal problems — to reshuffles in parliament , to the rise to power of this or that political group , to authority being passed constantly from one hand to another , and , finally will this not help those with extremist views to power ? "
Medvedev ’s prediction of failure is no simple outside observation ; Moscow still seeks to influence its former Soviet sphere and there are fears in the Kremlin that a new , democratic Kyrgyzstan could undermine the old order with which Russia is acquainted .
And yes , maybe things will go badly .
Or maybe Kyrgyzstan will prove Medvedev wrong , showing that democracy can indeed flourish in the unlikeliest of places .
A green stain lights up a protein tied to aging , showing that it is abundant in the hypothalamus region of mice brains .
Credit : Shin-ichiro Imai , Washington University in St. Louis
Researchers watched two groups of mice , both nearing the end of a two - day fast .
One group was quietly huddled together , but the other group was active and alert .
The difference ?
The second set of mice had been engineered so their brains produced more SIRT1 , a protein known to play a role in aging and longevity .
" This result surprised us , " says the study 's senior author Shin-ichiro Imai , MD , PhD , an expert in aging research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
" It demonstrates that SIRT1 in the brain is tied into a mechanism that allows animals to survive when food is scarce .
And this might be involved with the lifespan - increasing effect of low - calorie diets . "
Imai explains that the mice with increased brain SIRT1 have internal mechanisms that make them use energy more efficiently , which helps them move around in search of food even after a long fast .
This increased energy - efficiency could help delay aging and extend lifespan .
The research findings are published in the July 28 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience .
Imai 's past research demonstrated that SIRT1 is at the center of a network that connects metabolism and aging .
A form of the gene is found in every organism on earth .
The gene coordinates metabolic reactions throughout the body and manages the body 's response to nutrition .
SIRT1 is activated under low - calorie conditions , which have been shown to extend the life spans of laboratory animals .
The researchers found that the key to the mice 's extra activity lies in a small region of the brain called the hypothalamus , which controls basic life functions such as hunger , body temperature , stress response and sleep - wake cycles .
At the start of the research project , the study 's lead author Akiko Satoh , PhD , a postdoctoral research associate in developmental biology , saw that mice on low - calorie diets had increased amounts of SIRT1 in specific regions of the hypothalamus and that neurons in the same regions were activated .
So the research team developed mice that continually produced higher amounts of SIRT1 in their brains to see what the effect would be .
That 's when Satoh observed the mice 's unusual level of activity under fasting conditions .
" This is the first time that it has been demonstrated that SIRT1 is a central mediator for behavior adaptation to low - calorie conditions , " Satoh says .
Interestingly , these mice , called BRASTO ( brain - specific SIRT1 - overexpressing ) mice , also maintained higher body temperatures after a 48 - hour fast than ordinary mice , which experience a drop in body temperature during fasting .
" The BRASTO mice have a better capability to come up with energy to achieve a higher body temperature and increased activity level when food is restricted , " says Imai , associate professor of developmental biology and of medicine .
The team also examined mice that had no ability to produce SIRT1 in their brains .
During diet - restricting conditions , these mice did not increase their activity , and their body temperature dropped more than normal , giving further evidence that SIRT1 was essential for high - activity , high - temperature responses .
As the researchers looked further into the role of SIRT1 in the hypothalamus , they found that during diet restriction , SIRT1 enhanced the production of a specific neural receptor in the hypothalamus involved in regulating metabolic rate , food intake and insulin sensitivity .
Furthermore , mice with increased brain SIRT1 had a higher neural response to the gut hormone , ghrelin , which is known to stimulate the hypothalamus during low - calorie conditions .
Both findings add weight to a significant role for SIRT1 in the hypothalamic response to a restricted diet .
The scientists are continuing to study the BRASTO mice to see if they live longer than ordinary mice .
Their work suggests that the brain , and particularly the hypothalamus , might play a dominant role in governing the pace of aging .
They believe their studies could eventually provide clues for increasing productive aging in people .
" If we can enhance the function of the human hypothalamus by manipulating SIRT1 , we could potentially overcome some health problems associated with aging , " Imai says .
" One example is anorexia of aging in which elderly people lose the drive to eat .
It is possible that enhancing SIRT1 could alleviate behavioral problems like this . "

In the latest turn in the ongoing battle between state and federal air - pollution regulators , Texas 's attorney general filed a legal challenge on Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency .
The EPA 's rejection of Texas ' permitting program for large industrial plants last month constituted " improper overreach by the federal government , " according to the release from Attorney General Greg Abbott 's office .
Governor Rick Perry , who often rails against federal intrusion into state affairs , quickly jumped into the fray .
" The EPA ’s overreach is as potentially devastating as it is unnecessary , as Texas has achieved greater improvements in air quality than the nation as a whole since 2000 through our use of incentives and innovation , " the governor said in a statement today .
The EPA action , Perry said , would also " likely result in significantly higher prices for energy and just about everything else , a frightening prospect during a time so many Americans are struggling to make ends meet . "
The EPA has said that Texas ' system of " flexible " permits — in which an industrial plant must meet an overall pollution limit but does not set caps on individual units within the plant — does not accord with the requirements in federal law .
More than 120 plants are affected .
How the EPA will enforce its decision remains to be seen .
Ilya Kovalchuk will make a decision on where to sign today , according to his agent , Jay Grossman .
Grossman tweeted that Kovalchuk is “ looking ” to sign today .
It seems to be a two - horse race between the New York Islanders and the Devils .
Kovalchuk reportedly turned down a contract offer from the Los Angeles Kings over the weekend .
It ’s reported that Kovalchuk is seeking a 10 - year , $ 10 million deal .
There is a report that the Islanders have offered him that money , but it has n’t been confirmed by anyone within the Islanders organization .
The Devils , who have about $ 4.8 million in cap space left , will need to move a contract in order to meet those high salary demands .

Job applicants with some criminal history on their resumes have no problem getting approved to work among the state ’s most vulnerable foster care children , according to a Texas Tribune / Houston Chronicle investigation .
A review of background check letters the Department of Family and Protective Services sent Daystar Residential Inc. — a Houston - area facility that made headlines for forcing disabled girls to fight each other — shows that dozens of potential workers were approved for hire by the state despite arrests ranging from prostitution to assault with a deadly weapon .
It ’s unclear whether Daystar hired these workers ; the state redacted all employee names .
But their approval for employment raises questions about DFPS ’ background check process as lawmakers meet in Austin today to discuss abuse and neglect within Texas ’ 80 residential treatment centers for troubled kids .
“ Our goal is to strike a balance between protecting the children in these facilities and the presumption that an individual applying for a job is innocent until proven guilty , ” said DFPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins .
“ There are certain criminal convictions whose nature or severity does not indicate a risk to children , or that so much time has passed to indicate there is no longer risk of occurrence . ”
According to the Tribune / Chronicle review , of the 536 background checks the state performed on potential Daystar employees between 2007 and May 2010 , 136 resulted in a criminal match or a hit on the state ’s abuse and neglect registry .
While some of the job applicants ’ criminal history matches involved misdemeanors like evading arrest , fraud by check , speeding , DWIs or drug possession , others had histories that included arrests for robbery , aggravated assault and domestic violence .
On Dec. 4 , 2008 , DFPS told Daystar that a job applicant arrested in Houston in 2000 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon — a second - degree felony — was okay to hire .
“ This person ’s criminal history does not include a conviction that would prohibit the person from being present in a childcare operation , ” DFPS licensing representative Yolanda Hernandez wrote .
In 2007 , a DFPS licensing representative told Daystar that an applicant with a 2001 “ credit card or debit card abuse ” conviction “ must not be retained in a position allowing contact with children while the request for risk evaluation is prepared and considered . ”
Yet a 2009 Daystar job applicant with a 1991 arrest for prostitution , 1993 and 1994 arrests for theft and a 2008 conviction for reckless driving sailed through the criminal background process .
Hernandez wrote Daystar : “ This person ’s criminal history does not pose a threat and does not represent a standards violation , therefore no further action or follow - up is needed . ”
In many of the cases the Tribune and the Chronicle reviewed , it ’s unknown if the person involved was ever convicted , because the letters the agency sends to child care operations are often missing such information .
And , ultimately , it ’s unknown whether Daystar ever hired the employees with serious arrests .
Daystar attorney John Carsey said it would be unrealistic to expect a residential treatment center to have a staff free of employees with criminal histories .
“ When you consider what happens to people when they ’re in high school or college , with hot checks or various things , you could easily end up with something on your record , ” Carsey said .
“ It would be unfair to the labor pool ... to say nobody can work at a facility who has anything on their criminal history . ”
Before potential employees are hired to work with children in Texas , they must submit to a criminal background check , one performed by the Department of Public Safety and forwarded to DFPS .
Some minor offenses or older convictions that have no relationship to caring for a child — misdemeanor theft , or an old burglary , for example — do n’t stand in the way of a hire , Crimmins said .
But some felony offenses , including crimes against people , robbery , public indecency , stalking and failing to report the sexual assault of a child , are supposed to permanently bar an applicant from working at a center or any other child care setting .
Applicants who have committed misdemeanor offenses in those categories — and certain drug offenders with convictions within the last decade — are eligible for hire , so long as they pass a risk evaluation process .
DFPS officials say they consider the severity and circumstances of the crime , the length of time since it occurred , proof of rehabilitation and the applicant ’s job responsibilities .
“ We require risk evaluations for those convictions where we believe there may be a correlation between the crime and caring for a child , ” Crimmins said , “ … but where there also may be room for a person to be rehabilitated . ”
But advocates question why these facilities would want to hire anyone with a criminal record in the first place — and why the state allows them to do it .
The reality , child welfare expert Susan Watson said , is that the salaries at treatment centers are painfully low .
The facilities are often in remote , unmonitored areas .
And workers are undereducated and often simply do n’t care about the kids .
“ I appreciate that it ’s really crappy pay for demanding work , ” said Watson , who coordinates Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid ’s Individual Rights Group .
“ But they hire those kinds of folks in shelter care facilities , and it ’s just asking for trouble . ”
E -books are , in both price and size , still in their hardback stage .
Author , blogger and all - round clever thinker Seth Godin thinks it 's time for a " paperback " e-reader , a cheap Kindle which would be completely bare bones but also put e-books into the hands of just about anyone who can read .
Godin suggests that Amazon forget about a touchscreen and 3G connectivity and instead make a mass - market Paperback Kindle , a device so simple that it could be sold for just $ 50 .
Who would n't buy that ?
Especially if it was made without that giant , ugly chin for the keyboard and instead was small enough to fit in a back pocket like a real paperback .
In making this suggestion , Godin is seconding the opinion of e-book market experts who predicted , in a March 2010 Wired story , that the e-reader market would soon split into two segments :
One for high - end e-readers with color screens and one for cheap e-readers with monochrome E Ink screens .
There are some other great suggestions in Godin 's blog post ( buy eight books , get a free Kindle , for instance ) but it 's the idea of cheap hardware that seems to make so much sense .
The Lady dropped and broke my Kindle last week , and $ 260 ( plus international shipping and taxes , $ 350 ) is too much for a replacement .
This effectively means I have lost all the books I bought , too .
If the hardware cost $ 50 and was available in the corner store , I 'd have gotten one right after the old Kindle died .
Does this seem like wishful thinking ?
Maybe .
But perhaps Amazon ( or Sony , or anyone else in the e-reader market ) has no choice .
Godin :
The only way to get authors and publishers to embrace this device is to sell 20,000,000 of them .
You either become the best and only platform for consuming books worth buying or you fail .
And the only way to create that footprint in the face of an iPad is to make it so cheap to buy and use it 's irresistible .
There is one other alternative , and it actually is n't so bad for Amazon , although it would mean the end for the Kindle as hardware .
There is already one device which has sold a lot more than 20 million , and people replace it almost annually .
It 's the cellphone .
E - books will explode , but that does n't mean e-readers will necessarily be a success .
If Amazon continues to make its Kindle app available on more and more cellphones , then it could still win .

Former deputy PM John Prescott has defended taking a peerage as a platform to campaign - and said his wife asked him to do it .
Lord Prescott , who once branded hereditary peers an " offence to democracy " , dismissed suggestions he was a hypocrite as " prat talk " .
" I was against hereditaries , we got rid of 90 % of them , " he told the BBC .
But he conceded he looked like he was " chewing a wasp " as he accepted the peerage on Friday .
Mr Prescott was Tony Blair 's deputy for 10 years and was seen as the link between Labour 's grass roots and the New Labour politicians at the top of the party .
' Too much flunkery '
He stepped down as an MP at the general election and was made Lord Prescott in the Dissolution Honours - announced at the end of every Parliament .
He took up his seat as Baron Prescott of Kingston - upon - Hull on Thursday , wearing traditional ermine robes to pledge allegiance to the Queen and sign official documents .
Asked if he felt like a bit of a prat , Lord Prescott - known for his blunt manner - joked : " I did n't feel a prat - I do think I was chewing a wasp at the time . "
I 'm still in politics , it 's my life .
I have n't put on slippers Lord Prescott
The Daily Mail has reported Lord Prescott saying he did not want to go into the Lords in 2008 - although he denies it .
And he told the Scotsman in 2008 , when asked if he would take a peerage : " I 'm against too much flunkery and titles .
But Paul [ his wife Pauline ] would like me to .
I tell her , ' What do you want to be Lady Prescott for ?
You 're a lady already ' . "
Asked if he accepted people would call him a hypocrite , Lord Prescott told BBC One 's The Andrew Marr Show : " They can say that ... these journalists , most of our politics is by these journalists who love to play that - it's the prat talk , if you like , in politics " .
He added : " I was against hereditaries , we got rid of 90 % of them , we kept 10 % as a compromise , it was wrong - it's that I wanted getting rid of . "
But he said he was impressed with the quality of debate in the Lords , particularly crossbench peer Lord Hoffmann 's speech in a debate on the Defamation Bill , saying : " You would n't have got that in the Commons . "
Asked if it was true he accepted the peerage because his wife Pauline wanted him to do so , Lord Prescott laughed and said : " She 's a wonderful woman ... she makes her own mind but she said : ' Yes , I would like you to go in there ' , because I do n't think she wanted me at home all the time . "
Lord Prescott , who is also campaigning to become the Labour Party Treasurer , told the programme : " I 'm still in politics , it 's my life .
I have n't put on slippers .
" I 've got the Lords to put my case against the most reactionary government we are beginning to get .
And I 've got , hopefully , at the heart of the Labour Party if I win the election for Treasurer , [ the chance ] to make changes . "
President Obama said earlier this year that the health - care bill that Congress passed three months ago is " essentially identical " to the Massachusetts universal coverage plan that then - Gov. Mitt Romney signed into law in 2006 .
No one but Mr. Romney disagrees .
As events are now unfolding , the Massachusetts plan could n't be a more damning indictment of ObamaCare .
The state 's universal health - care prototype is growing more dysfunctional by the day , which is the inevitable result of a health system dominated by politics .

The global AIDS epidemic being pushed by the AIDS industry is a fraud .
Key pioneers from the industry now speak out against " the false marketing of the AIDS epidemic " in an exclusive video clip from the highly controversial documentary www.HouseOfNumbers.com ) .
Watch the clip right now at : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfnYciuXeB4
In this video clip , you 'll see Dr Joe Sonnabend , co-founder of ( The Foundation for AIDS Research ) explain how the organization committed fraud by hyping up the risk of AIDS in order to get more money from Washington .
" One day one of the networks had received a press release from us , and the press release said that heterosexual AIDS is about to happen , that straight men are going to drop in droves ...
And I said that 's B.S. where 'd you get that from ?
It was a total fraud and scam .
It was a fundraising ploy , " says Dr Joe Sonnabend .
" But it was so efficient that it resulted in a LIFE Magazine cover which said ' No one is safe from AIDS .' ... Once he put out this scare , the money started to flow .
It really did .
" Brent Leung , director of thefilm , then asks Dr Sonnabend , " Is n't that ethically wrong to scare an entire population ?
" " What do you think ? " answers Dr Sonnabend .
" You live in this world you know that 's exactly what they do .
" Watch this too - hot - to - handle interview yourself in this exclusive YouTube clip :
By the way , do you note the similarity between AIDS non-profit fundraising fraud and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure fundraising fraud we 've exposed here on NaturalNews ? ( https://www.naturalnews.com/028670_Komen_for_... )
For both groups , it 's always about the money , and the same thing is true with most other disease non-profit groups .
Also in this clip , you 'll see journalist Mark Conlan describing how the Wall Street Journal exposed the fundraising fraud behind the AIDS industry .
Journalist Celia Farber also appears in this exclusive clip , saying , " It 's a culture of P.R. A public relations phenomenon .
The truth does n't matter .
What matters is the image .
... The reality is that AIDS is over .
" AIDS , in other words , is no longer a threat to the world at large , and certainly not a threat to heterosexual men .
But the AIDS front groups want to keep spreading fear in order to unlock more fundraising dollars that will pad their own pockets .
So the fear mongering continues , the fraud continues and the truth gets swept under the rug .
What truth is that ?
That the " worldwide AIDS epidemic " is now largely a fictional construct created by the pharmaceutical industry , its non-profit front groups and the CDC to sell AIDS drugs that cause the very immunological suppression blamed on the disease .
and thus they become a self - fulfilling prophecy to any person who dares take them .

One cute feature of C# 1.0 was the introduction of the Conditional attribute .
When you apply the conditional attribute to a method , calls to this method are only included in the resulting code if the appropriate define is set .
For instance , consider :
[ Conditional ( " DEBUG " ) ] void Log ( string format , params object [ ] args ) { Console .
WriteLine ( String .
Format ( format , args ) ) ; }

Microsoft has reportedly surpassed the $ 1 billion ( just under R7.7 billion ) mark in revenue generated by its Xbox Live online video game service for its 2010 fiscal year .
According to Bloomberg
News this is a first for the company , reaching this milestone in a single fiscal year assisted by sales of movies , avatar accessories as well as extra game levels .
The report stated that approximately half the Xbox Live service ’s 25 million users paid an annual fee to play games online such as Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 in the financial year that ended on 30 June , which amounts to about $ 600 million ( about R4.62 billion ) .
Sales of products including DLC for games as well as movie and TV show downloads exceeded subscription revenue for the first time , suggesting that the total revenue is over $ 1.2 billion ( over R9.2 billion ) .
Not everyone wants to admit it , but having a Libertarian on the ballot tends to favor the Democrat in a close race , taking a few percentage points away from Republican candidates and allowing Democrats to squeak by .
And that party 's November slate could give an edge to Democrats in more than a dozen races .
Having a thumb on the scale helps .
Need an illustration ?
Look at the fight the Democrats and the Republicans are having over whether to allow Green Party candidates onto the Texas ballot .
The Greens — who tend to pull hard - left votes from Democrats and throw tight races to Republicans — can't get on without enough signatures on petitions , so Republican lobbyist Mike Toomey , Gov. Rick Perry 's former chief of staff , paid someone to get that done .
The Democrats are in court saying the ultimate efforts were illegally financed with corporate money and asking that the petitions be tossed and the Greens kept out .
( Libertarians are on the ballot because they got enough support in the previous elections to avoid the petition process . )
It 's impossible to know just which races will be close in November .
But more than a dozen
House races that are on the target lists of either the Republicans or the Democrats have Libertarians in them .
Republicans have set their sites on state Reps .
Mark Homer of Paris , Donna Howard of Austin , Diana Maldonado of Round Rock , Joe Moody of El Paso , Joe Heflin of Crosbyton , Chris Turner of Burleson , Allen Vaught of Dallas , Ellen Cohen of Houston and Hubert Vo of Houston , among others .
Democrats are gunning for state Reps .
Tim Kleinschmidt of Lexington , Charles " Doc " Anderson of Waco , Linda Harper - Brown of Irving , Joe Driver of Garland , Dwayne Bohac of Houston and Ken Legler of Pasadena .
That 's not the entire target list for either party , but those are the races that could be close — and that have Libertarians on the ballot .
Libertarian candidates signed up for the two Texas congressional seats on the GOP 's national target list , those held by U.S. Reps .
Chet Edwards of Waco and Ciro Rodriguez of San Antonio .
And they 've got statewide candidates all lined up , too .
" In a year like this , I would do anything I could to make it a one - person race , " says Todd Olsen , a consultant working with Associated Republicans of Texas , a political action committee trying to preserve and increase GOP majorities in the statehouse .
" If I could get the Libertarian to drop out and support me , I 'd do it .
The Green ?
I 'd do it . "
Republican Larry Gonzales , challenging Maldonado in Williamson County , was a political consultant for years before becoming a legislative candidate .
He 's not willing to concede that Charles McCoy , a Libertarian , is a gift to the incumbent .
" There are so many variables , " he says .
" I think it 's really hard to cast a generalization over .
... I just tell candidates , ' Keep your head down and keep going . "
Corbin Casteel is a Republican political consultant , too , but he 's not on the ballot .
He 's got no doubt about how Libertarians affects his candidates — they drain votes .
" Of course they do , " he says .
He 's helping Republican Jason Isaac of Dripping Springs , who 's challenging Democratic incumbent Patrick Rose for a seat in the Texas House .
And though they have n't made a public splash about it yet , the Libertarian in that race , Tom Gleinser , decided not to run after two unsuccessful tries .
He 's endorsing Isaac , according to his website .
" The only purpose my being a candidate has served is to help get a Democrat elected State Representative to the 45th district of Texas , " he says on his website .
" That is bad for the State and bad for the country .
... I have therefore taken the necessary steps to withdraw from being a candidate for office . "
And he closes his message by endorsing Isaac .
That makes it a two - man race .
This has been going on for years , but it 's heated up in recent election cycles , which featured a number of very close contests — contests where Libertarians had deciding influence .
In the 2004 elections , Austin Democrat Mark Strama won a closely contested race against Republican Jack Stick , getting only 48.6 of the vote but winning , in part , because Libertarian Greg Knowles got 3.7 percent and denied Stick another term in the House .
Democrats , who lost several races in that and previous cycles by close margins , took note .
" In a race where you win by less than a percent , everything matters , " Strama says now .
It did n't hurt to have Knowles on the ballot that year , but everything else mattered , too .
You have to bring a race close enough to win , and then hope everything goes right .
" Each variable is necessary , but not sufficient , " he says .
If he had another close race , would he rather have a Libertarian there as a buffer or not ?
" Probably so , " Strama concedes .
" But I would never consider myself sophisticated enough to orchestrate it . "
Republicans stand accused of trying to engineer Green alternatives to Democrats on the ballot .
But after the Strama race , the Democrats did a pretty good job of exploiting the Libertarian alternative to the Republicans .
In state House races in 2006 , Chuck Hopson — then a Democrat — got 51 percent and won re-election to the Texas House ; Libertarian Paul " Blue " Story pulled almost 3 percent , leaving only 46 percent for Republican Larry Durrett .
Austin Democrat Valinda Bolton just topped a majority in her race with Republican Bill Welch , while Libertarian Yvonne Schick was pulling 4.2 percent of the vote .
Those were closer to 50 percent than the winners might have wanted to be , but still over the magic line .
In other House races , the winner got home with less than half the votes .
Libertarians got the rest , allowing the winners to take office with something less than majority support .
That year , former state Rep. Robby Cook , D - Eagle Lake , beat Republican Kleinschmidt by 415 votes out of 40,148 cast , winning re-election in 2006 with 49 percent of the vote .
Libertarian Rod Gibbs had 1,283 votes , or more than 3 percent .
Other Democrats won with under 50 percent , thanks to Libertarians , including Corpus Christi's Juan Garcia , Joe Heflin of Crosbyton , Paula Hightower of Arlington and Joe Farias of San Antonio .
The 2008 election cycle had some similar results — not always losses for the Republicans , but closer races than they wanted or expected .
Democrat Wendy Davis unseated veteran state Sen. Kim Brimer , R - Fort Worth .
Hopson won his House seat again , barely , pulling less than 50 percent .
Lenard Nelson was back in that Corpus Christi House race , but the Libertarian did n't win enough votes to keep the district in Garcia 's hands , and Republican Todd Hunter made it over the 50 percent mark .
Harper - Brown won re-election with a margin of less than two dozen votes out of almost 41,000 cast .
At least two Democrats — Kristi Thibaut and Allen Vaught — won with skinny margins , barely over 50 percent .
A Libertarian in Vaught 's race gave him a little insurance .
Thibaut , who won by about 500 votes , could probably have slept easier with a Libertarian in her race .
" I 've run with a Libertarian on the ballot and won , and I 've run without a Libertarian on the ballot and won , " Bolton says .
There were rumors that the Republicans talked a Libertarian out of her 2008 race .
She won anyhow ( and they 're going after her again , blaming her win on a surge of support for Barack Obama that wo n't be there for her this year ) .
Do Libertarians have any effect ?
" I 've thought about it .
A lot .
I do n't honestly know , " Bolton says .
" I understand what the conventional wisdom is , and I understand that there are people out there who do n't feel comfortable in either party . "

At LinuxTag 2010 , the KDE community announced the " Join the Game " campaign to support KDE e.V. 's Supporting Membership Program .
The first new member was Georg Greve , founder of Free Software Foundation Europe ( FSFE ) .
We caught up with him for a ' short ' interview that turned into a two hour conversation about life , the universe and everything .
The pertinent bits are excerpted below .
Jos : Georg , you 've been interviewed before so you know what to do first ...
Georg :
Ah , yes , 42 short answers as to the why and how of me ...
Well , I started out as a software developer at age 13 .
I studied Physics , did my diploma thesis in the area of nanotechnology and became part of the GNU project during my studies .
The GNU Xlogmaster which I wrote was the first graphical log overview application that I know of .
It 's crappy , but there was no alternative back then .
Today there are other applications based on that idea that do a much better job .
So I was an alright coder , but it turned out that I had a knack at communicating technology to non-technical people , or " Muggles " if you are into Harry Potter .
I had been writing the Brave GNU World column for years .
So after chats with Richard Stallman and others we founded the FSFE in 2001 .
At that time I had several options , including an academic career with a PhD in nanotechnology , or a job in the industry .
While both would certainly have been a tad easier , I thought that FSFE would be more fun and was more necessary .
So after taking out a personal loan I started working full time .
( Luckily the bank never knew what the money was for and it has been paid back in full some years later . )
The organization grew quickly from there .
While at first I had to do everything myself , more and more people joined and took over tasks and responsibilities .
Much of these first years was spent travelling , speaking , meeting people and occasionally sneaking off to do a little coding or administrate FSFE 's systems .
At one point I remember that I fixed the mail system while sitting in the plenary of a UN conference , another time I ended up sneaking out into a street cafe in Buenos Aires , where I believe I wrote the Python layer that does the data transport over SMTP for FSFE 's Fellowship registration process .
Hard times .
In the last few years at FSFE , I 've worked to prepare our organization for a change in leadership .
I did n't want the FSFE to grow stale - fresh blood is good every now and then .
We had some amazing interns over time .
Now some of them form the next generation running the FSFE .
A sign of a healthy organization ( if you ask me ) is where an ambitious and talented intern can become president !
Jos :
And then you decided to start up a new company .
Georg : Yes , indeed .
The story is probably too long for the dot , but the short of it is that KDAB and Intevation brought Paul Adam and myself together .
Kolab Systems has been growing quickly since getting started in February 2010 .
We aim to support companies who deploy and service Kolab PIM and groupware installations .
Jos :
Which is why you 're here , at this conference ?!?
Georg : Yes , and of course for the Supporting Program membership ( grinning ) .
Jos :
Ok , so tell us what made you say yes to this request of becoming the First ?
Georg : Because I love the KDE community , of course !
Seriously , I 'm a huge fan .
I used to use Gnome , but switched when more and more non-free technology was added .
I think they are making a huge mistake giving up control of so much of their technological strategy to Microsoft .
So one day a friend came in and showed me how to slim down KDE 3.5 to a level I liked .
And then I became an incredibly early adopter of the KDE 4 series .
I installed the shiny Plasma desktop in the summer of 2008 .
It was interesting technology , and I wanted to support the KDE community in finding a new path from the bottom up instead of re-inventing something else as is done by others .
Having the courage to do something really new is something I greatly respect .
You guys and girls did it , and with success .
So I started sending in bug reports and telling people about what you were doing , publicly supporting the move KDE has made .
I was at the launch event of 4.2 in Zurich with Aaron Seigo .
While I could n't help much technically , these things I could do .
Besides the guts and technology the KDE community has , the people behind it and the whole culture within the community are major reasons for me to support it .
I always have great fun when meeting KDE people , be it for work or drinking beer .
The way you have fun , the way the work flows , it is truly remarkable .
The KDE community was one of the first in the Free Software world I knew to have a female president ( Eva Brucherseifer ) .
To me , an environment where women feel at home is a very positive and important thing .
It has something to do with respect , an open and friendly atmosphere .
I have no idea how to say what exactly it is that makes the KDE community so special .
I know many communities .
Many are great , but KDE is clearly awesome and for myself second only to the FSFE , which has a different job in our community .
KDE even helped to migrate my wife to Free Software .
She comes from a very artistic family , both her grandfathers were famous painters , so she is quite visually oriented .
When she saw my Plasma desktop she said " I want this " .
Now you must know I did n't try to force her .
If you knew her , you 'd understand that would never work .
So getting her interested is quite a compliment to KDE .
And a final thing ... I greatly appreciate the strong focus within the KDE community on freedom , Freedom with a capital F .
You spread this message of Be Free , which is what I have spent a full 10 years of my own life on , and continue to do so .
At the same time , you 're a pragmatic community , like myself and many people in the FSFE .
Jos :
Wow , I feel the love !
Cool to see you enjoy our company so much .
So how did you hear about our Supporting Membership Program ?
Georg : Well , Frank Karlitschek contacted me on jabber and asked if I wanted to join .
I said I 'd be honored ( which made it in the initial announcement as a germanglish quote as we spoke German ) .
Jos : Haha , yes , I noticed that ...
And what do you think about the program ?
Georg :
Well , everyone should join .
Ultimately it is the same for the Fellowship of FSFE .
We as a community need to support the associations and groups protecting our ability to live in freedom and have the technology we want .
So I 'm talking about both the political ( FSFE ) and technical ( KDE ) levels .
We even have the freedom to pick what we want to support , is n't that great ?
I pick the FSFE and the KDE communities because I agree with their values and choices and I 'm happy to support them .
It boils down to what a famous person said : " With great power comes great responsibility " ( editors ' note : hehe - Spiderman 's Uncle Ben ) and KDE is truly powerful .
Jos : So KDE and the FSFE fit together , it seems ?
Georg : Yes , I like the strong connection between the FSFE and KDE .
It is a match made in heaven .
Both communities share a lot of similar values .
We approach the same issues from different sides and thus are complementary .
I have been working with KDE since Eva was President of KDE .
We 've always gotten along great as we stood for the same things , even from different angles .
So I have a long - standing positive relationship with the KDE community and am happy to see it grow and be supported .
Jos :
We 're being interrupted by Paul so this is the end of our conversation .
Any last words ?
Georg :
Well , let 's hope they wo n't be my final words , but yeah .
I would give a big thumbs up to the KDE community and would urge users to support it !
Oh and on a more personal level , I can recommend the policy we have at Kolab Systems :
If you have not had a good laugh today , something is wrong and you have to fix it !
A series of attacks on The Pirate Bay , one of the most well known and controversial file - sharing websites has allowed a group of Argentinian hackers , headed by malware researcher Ch Russo , to access both the user database and the website administration panel of The Pirate Bay , comprising over 4 million usernames and email addresses in the process .
It is thought that the group first targeted the website administration panel on The Pirate Bay , the group succeeded and then employed a series of SQL injection vulnerabilities to gain access to the user database , where they were able to add and amend records and obtain information to identify trackers and torrents uploaded by specific users .
Ch Russo posted a cryptic message on his blog detailing reasons behind the attack :
As any other website , as any other system or mechanism , www.thepiratebay.org has robust parts and soft spots .
We beleive that the people behind this comunity always acted with the local laws on their side , and so have we .
The community caused problems to huge companies and corporations which turned into threats between this companies and them .
What we have done , we did not do it with anger , or for commercial value .
As always , we saw the change , the moment and decided to take it .
The protocol or procedure done to achieve this was n’t anything out of the ordinary .
As you can see , Russo acknowledges that the data would be of huge interest to anti-piracy groups like the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) .
In a telephone interview with KrebsOnSecurity he said : “ Probably these groups would be very interested in this information , but we are not [ trying ] to sell it , ” adding “ Instead we wanted to tell people that their information may not be so well protected . ”
According to Softpedia , the attackers have not been in contact with The Pirate Bay administrators since the attack but the offending weakness has since been identified and patched .

Now , here 's a memory test for loyal Media Watch viewers .
What is this ?
Well , it 's the Phantom of the Internet trophy , which back in March 2008 we awarded to IT journalist David Richards , owner of web publisher 4Square Media .
It 's for the most original explanation for apparent plagiarism .
We 'd identified some ten articles on Richards ' websites : Smarthouse ; SmarthouseNews and SmartOffice , that had clearly been lifted from elsewhere .
For example , a David Richards story about the imminent launch of Google 's Android phones , was taken directly from the website of Britain 's Telegraph newspaper :
The sophisticated handsets will make it easier to browse the web and bring some of the programs and features usually found on home computers to mobiles .

Smarthouse website , 10th February , 2008
Jonathan Holmes :
And so on , and so on , for five hundred and fifty three identical words .
— Media Watch , Episode 3 , 3rd March , 2008
Other articles were lifted from American websites like PC World , which specialise , as Richards ' do , in electronic consumer gadgetry .
At first , David Richards claimed that he had licenses that allowed him to use this material .
When we showed that was n't so , he came up with this :
We believe that a former employee who had access to our content engine has changed bylines , dates on stories and posted stories without our knowledge in an effort to discredit us .
— Media Watch , Episode 3 , 3rd March , 2008
It was all the fault of a mystery hacker - or , as we dubbed him then , the Phantom of the Internet .
Well , a couple of weeks ago a viewer tipped us off about this article on the website IT Journo ...
4Square Media is at the centre of another copyright controversy , with IDG demanding that the Smarthouse website take down content it believes was copied from the PC World website .
— IT Journo website , 10th June , 2010
PC World recently reviewed a new desktop computer from European company Medion - and was incensed to see chunks of its review reprinted on Smarthouse .
Medion ...

— PC World , 3rd June , 2010
The owners of PC World , IDG , sent a firm email to David Richards about the apparent plagiarism .
But the dreaded Phantom must have wormed his way into Smarthouse 's email system , because Richards told IT Journo that he had n't received any email from IDG .
In any case , he went on ...
" It 's all crap ...
Basically they can all go and get f#%ked .
This is bullshit " .
— IT Journo website , 10th June , 2010
We assumed those must be technical terms understood only by geeks .
So we got onto David Richards ourselves .
He explained that , though he had taken the odd sentence from PC World , it did n't amount to breach of copyright .
The copy you refer to is not substantial , is not novel and is basically a technical reference to a product which is available .

Richards fired off an email to IDG , making the same legalistic points , and claiming that he was :
... more than happy to defend a Copyright claim in the Supreme Court ... — Email from David Richards to Davy Adams ( Managing Director , IDG Communications ) , 18th June , 2010
He then made a threat of his own :
I believe that your claims to IT Journo are defamatory based on current copyright laws in Australia and as such I demand an apology .
— Email from David Richards to Davy Adams ( Managing Director , IDG Communications ) , 18th June , 2010
To which IDG responded drily :
Given that you have confirmed that you are doing what was covered in the IT Journo article , you might find winning a defamation case a bit of a slog .
Your time and effort would probably be better spent writing good original content .
— Email from Davy Adams ( Managing Director , IDG Communications ) to David Richards , 18th June , 2010
Ah , it 's all smiles and good fellowship out there in techno - geek land !
As for the Phantom of the Internet trophy - well , Mr Richards , it 's still yours .
Of the 1,090 people detained during the G20 weekend , approximately 16 remain in police custody , according to the Movement Defence Committee , a group of lawyers aiding those arrested during the summit .
In a news conference Monday , the MDC reiterated the call for an independent inquiry into the June 26 - 27 summit and demanded the release of anyone still held on G20 - related charges .
“ Those individuals who were arrested are clearly political prisoners , ” said lawyer Ryan White of the MDC .
They “ were caught up in the state ’s overreaching of their police powers and these individuals , first and foremost , should be freed as soon as possible . ”
White alleged that protesters were taken into custody “ specifically because of the political stance they had taken . ”
While he would n’t comment specifically , White said they face a charges including conspiracy , possession of dangerous weapons , mischief and obstruction of justice .
Toronto police spokesperson Wendy Drummond could n’t confirm the number still jailed but confirmed that at least 14 G20 - related cases are to appear in court Tuesday .
Asked whether police were justified in arresting anyone suspected of destroying property , White said the burden of proof was on the state .
“ If they have specific allegations against individuals , and they can prove that beyond reasonable doubt , then I think that ’s something that would stand , ” he said .
“ You can take action against an individual , but you have to do so in a way that is humane , in a way that is consistent with the Charter , and what we ’re saying is that the police have not done this at this point . ”
Also speaking were representatives of the Council of Canadians , the Asian Canadian Labour Alliance and Jane and Finch Action Against Poverty .
Sarah Reaburn spoke on behalf of Toronto Street Medics , a small group that trained about 100 volunteers to provide first aid to injured demonstrators .
Reaburn , a nurse and counsellor at the Hassle Free Clinic , alleged that street medics were targeted and harassed by police as they tried to provide first aid .
Several , including an EMS worker , were detained .
One faces multiple charges , she said , including possession of a concealed weapon for carrying bandage shears .
Reaburn said the volunteers prepared for “ extremely challenging situations ” but did not anticipate the seriousness of the “ hundreds ” of injuries they faced , including broken arms , lacerations from riot shields and a shattered finger .
Reaburn said she was cut while giving first aid .
She also treated a young man with a head injury who was showing symptoms of shock after being hit by a police baton .

“ Despite numerous requests of police to assist us in transferring him , we were unable to get him transferred to EMS , ” she said .
“ I ended up transferring him with assistance on a sandwich board , which we had taken from a store , and then we loaded him on the back of a vegetable truck ” to get him to an ambulance .
The medics continue their work , helping arrested individuals retrieve medication that disappeared during their detention .
Strikeforce released its middleweight champion , Jake Shields , from his contract with the organization on Wednesday , according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the negotiations .
The 31 - year - old Shields had been in a final - phase “ matching period ” of his recently completed contract with the San Jose , Calif . - based promotion , which allowed him to receive bids from other organizations , including the UFC , that Strikeforce could review and match in order to keep his services .
However , the source said Strikeforce waived that contractual right in its final 2 - 3 weeks and opted to release the Cesar Gracie fighter altogether before the period expired .
Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker confirmed to Sherdog.com that the promotion informed Jack Shields , the fighter ’s manager and father , of the release on Wednesday .
Coker would not comment further on the decision .
“ In the conversation we had today , they said they felt that Jake was leaning towards the UFC .
Honestly , we were talking to them with an open mind , though Jake wants to fight the best , ” said the elder Shields .
“ Between Strikeforce and EliteXC , Jake had the chance to fight on Showtime and CBS four or five times against some top fighters like Dan Henderson and Robbie Lawler .
Strikeforce gave him great opportunities and exposure .
They ’ve been nothing but great for Jake .
” Shields , who successfully defended his title against former Pride Fighting Championships champion and UFC middleweight Henderson on April 17 in Nashville , Tenn. , opted to not negotiate a renewal contract with Strikeforce prior to the bout .
The fighter ’s contract , which was originally drawn up by Pro Elite and purchased by Strikeforce after the short - lived fight organization went bankrupt in October 2008 , also did not contain a standard “ champion ’s clause , ” which could have placed stipulations on Shields ’ renegotiations while he remained a titleholder .
Prior to news of the release , Jack Shields told Sherdog.com that he submitted the fighter ’s asking price to the UFC on Wednesday and was awaiting an initial bid from the rival promotion to pass onto Strikeforce for review .
The elder Shields said he submitted figures for a series of bouts he thought requisite if his son fought the top contenders in both the UFC ’s welterweight and middleweight divisions .
Shields said his son would like to debut as a UFC middleweight , possibly against champion Anderson Silva , as welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre will be tied up with “ The Ultimate Fighter ” reality TV series and a pending bout with rival coach Josh Koscheck later this year .
“ We did n’t come to agreement with Strikeforce , but Jake ’s excited to challenge himself against the likes of Anderson Silva and others in the UFC , ” said Shields .
In recent weeks , Strikeforce ’s Coker had said the promotion had initial plans to hold a four - , eight - , or even 16 - man tournament to crown a new champion if Shields vacated .
Megalodon Shark Demands Rematch with Predator X and “ Moby Dick ” Sperm Whale !

C. megalodon mega - shark demands rematch with old nemesis Predator X . Says newly discovered “ Moby Dick ” sperm whale is all tooth and no bite !
Extra !
Read all about it !
OK , having a little fun here !
Yesterday ’s post was :
Does prehistoric “ Moby Dick ” sperm whale dethrone the mighty Predator X ?
In this post , I compared some of the greatest predators in the history of our planet .
I ventured that the crown should still belong to Predator X as probably having the most dangerous bite of all time .
But I also offered the view that the newly discovered ancient sperm whale , Leviathan melvillei , may well have had a killing bite to match Predator X .
It certainly had bigger teeth !
So did the first post disrespect C. megalodon , the greatest shark of all time , the ultimate ” Jaws , ” which dwarfs modern great whites the way a Rottweiler dwarfs a Chihuahua ?
C. megalodon was certainly one of the greatest sea predators of all time , if not the greatest — but that ’s a point of debate !
It is certainly one of very biggest fish of all time , although the largest sea creature that ’s ever lived is still today ’s magnificent blue whale .
And since the mighty blue whale eats krill and small fish , it could be argued that the blue whale is in fact the greatest predator of all time , as one observant reader noted .
Whether a 50 - 60 foot shark or marine reptile would dare take on a 80 to 100 foot blue whale is open to question !
Packs of orca have been known to attack blue whales , but one - on - one , between two creatures , would be a different matter , no doubt .
The blue whale is incredibly fast for its size , too , and is able to hit bursts of 30 mph , and so would n’t be easy to catch unless surprise attacked .
( The blue whale is one of my favorite creatures .
Be sure to see my post : The Largest Animal That ’s Ever Lived . )
When it comes to comparing these ancient , toothy super predators , I knew what I ’d written might be controversial .
Why ?
Because sizing up C. megalodon has always been controversial .
So , I was n’t surprised , and rather delighted , to get an immediate and engaging comment on the post , taking C. megalodon ’s side :
According to Wikipedia , the latest estimates of Megalodon are that it had a size of about 20 meters and a mass of about 100 metric tons .
The bite force was about 41,000 lbf , which leaves Predator X in the dust at 33,000 lbf .
It was more massive than Predator X , had a more powerful bite , had serrated teeth which were perfect for slicing , and basically never ran out of teeth .
In other words , megalodon would likely have whupped both Predator X and this new sperm whale if they had co-existed .
It probably fed on blue whales and other large whales .
Well , what about it ?
Let ’s have some fun and take a look at the scientific facts , estimates , and theories surrounding these magnificent ancient creatures .
I still feel that what I wrote in the first post is scientifically defensible , although some might argue I ’m too conservative about claims for C. megalodon .
If you rummage around the internet , you ’ll find that some predators almost have fan clubs , and there are huge debates and flame wars over which animal is more ferocious than another .
But , I think this ( non-flaming ) commenter makes a good point , so let ’s have some fun and look into it !
C. megalodon and the Fossil Problem
The first thing to know about C. megalodon , if that we have no complete skeletons of them — none , nada .
Good shark fossils are extremely rare .
Like all sharks , C. megalodon did not have bones ; their bodies consist of tissue and cartilage .
Dead sharks rot and disassemble quickly .
Rapid decomposition means there ’s little left to preserve .
So , what paleontologist usually find are the hardest parts of the shark : its teeth , its jaws , and sometimes , vertebrae .
This presents a problem .
As our beloved and oft - quoted Wikipedia tells us , “ Estimating the maximum size of C. megalodon is a highly controversial and difficult subject . ”
Indeed !
The reason for this is the lack of definitive fossil evidence .
So , what scientists have done is hypothesize that the great white shark is ( apparently ) a good analogue for C. megalodon .
Based on this assumption , scientists then rely on what they know about morphology of great whites to make assumptions and estimates about C. megalodon .
Of course , there are obvious problems with this .
And in fact , the most recent hypothesis about great whites is that they are only distant relatives of C. megalodon and actually share a closer relationship to ancient mako sharks .
So , we just do n’t know , and probably never will know , if our the body structure of the modern great white can tell us anything final about C. megalodon .
C. megalodon — A Controversial Fish Measured by Its Teeth
OK , so if we do n’t have complete fossils of C. megalodon , how in the heck do researchers come up with these huge size estimates ?
Relying on the morphology of great whites , scientists make estimates based on the statistical relationships between tooth sizes and body lengths of the great white .
To date , the largest C. megalodontooth measures about 7 and 5/8 inches in length :
Simple , right ?
If a C. megalodon tooth is size X , then that means the shark was length Y . Piece of cake .
Except it ’s not .
Here ’s where the “ ” Estimating the maximum size of C. megalodon is a highly controversial and difficult subject ” part comes in , even assuming that a great white is a good analogue for Megalodon .
I ’m not going to spend time rehashing all the controversies and various statistical methodologies scientists have come up with for estimating the physical anatomy of C. megalodon .
But Wikipedia does do a nice overview , and there are at least 5 or more methodologies that arrive at varying answers .
In general , Randall , Gottfried , and Jeremiah arrive at calculated estimates in the 40 to 50 foot range , and a shark weighing around 50 tons .
No small fish !
Well , what about speculated , non-calculated maximum , based on no existent fossil tooth ?
Some scientists speculate that the “ mother of all C. megalodons ” might — repeat , might — have reached 60 - 65 plus feet .
Based on one group of researchers way of calculating body mass , this would translate into a 100 ton shark .
Is this length and weight credible ?
Well , who knows ?
Without the “ mother of all shark fossil teeth ” to use for some sort of scientific calculation ( calculations which are themselves debated ) how can we ever verify this ?
Is it even likely ?
Scientific opinions actually vary .
Everyone can and should have their own opinion on this , but speaking for myself , I would tend to stay with the conservative estimates that are actually based on real teeth and that use some sort of good statistical / mathematical model : a 40 to 50 foot and 50 ton fish , with 60 feet a possible upper limit for a super fish ..
( The largest C. megalodon fossil tooth is about 7 inches and 5/8ths inches long , and to me , that tooth points to the smaller sizes based on researchers own tooth / size formulas . )
Comparing C. megalodon ’s and Predator X’s Bites
There ’s no doubt that a 50 plus foot , 50 - ton fish with 7 inch long serrated teeth has one hell of a bite !
Take a look at this reconstruction of C. megalodon ’s jaws , and then imagine these jaws connected to 50 tons of muscled fury .
A man can stand upright in those jaws !
It would swallow a diver whole !
Although as yet we do n’t have a similar Predator X reconstruction , compare the shark ’s gape with the gape of Predator X , whose teeth were daggers twice as long as C. megalodon’s ..
Well , what do you think ?
Which jaw does more damage to a larger animal , since either swallows a diver whole !
I think the bigger , deeper , nastier bite goes to Predator X , but that ’s just my personal opinion .
You may prefer the big shark ’s bite with those serrated teeth .
Any large whale in ancient seas attacked by either of these predators was certainly doomed .
So , how about bite force ?
Here ’s where my commenter friend claims that C. megalodon clearly wins , referring to Wikpedia and with its citation of an estimated ( by some researchers ) 41,000 lbf ( bite force ) compared to Predator X’s estimated 33 , 000 lbf .
This high figure for C. megalodon is based on estimates done by researcher Stephen Wroe in 2008 on the white shark ’s biting power .
This range for C. megalodon is based on the assumption that C. megalodon ’s bite was 6 to 10 times that of a great white .
( Again , the great white assumption ! )
Since a great white bites with a calculated 4,000 lbf , the 6 to 10 times figures for C. megalodon represent a range of possible bite forces of 24,000 lbf to 40,000 lb .
The upper limit seems to be based on the assumption that the great white shark is an accurate analogue for C. megalodon and that it could have reached the ( to me ) unlikely 65 foot / 100 ton range .
I do n’t know the science behind these estimates or what the basis is for the claim that C. megalodon ’s bite had to be 6 to 10 times that of a great white .
So , while I can’t comment on the how accurate these estimates might be , I can certainly assert that there no definitive proof in these range of estimates that C. megalodon bit harder than Predator X .
It might have , but we just do n’t know — just as we do n’t know if C. megalodon could surpass 60 feet in length , rather than the more conservative , actual tooth - calculated sizes of 40 to 50 feet .
We can argue “ likelihoods ” all day , no doubt !
And what about the newly discovered “ Moby Dick ” super sperm whale ?
The debate as whether C. megalodon or Predator X was more “ bad ass ” is endless , and it ’s a lot of fun .
But such debates are irresolvable , in my opinion , and finally , online debating is not doing science .
This blog is n’t a place to debate the issue of what animal could “ whup ” the other ( thank you , original commenter , for the “ whup ” analogy ! ) , though it ’s open to views and surmises that are based somewhere in actual scientific research and data .
So , where does the gigantic , toothy extinct sperm whale , Leviathan melvillei fit in the picture ?
At 60 feet in length , the size of a modern sperm whale , and with a killer whale - like mouth , with upper and lower teeth that were 14 inch long daggers that fit together like shears , I think Leviathan melvillei had one formidable bite .
And it was huge — considerably bigger than Predator X , and probably bigger than most C. megalodons that we have actual physical evidence for .
I could n’t ’ find any bite force figures for Leviathan melvillei , which is n’t surprising , given what a new discovery it is .
Since the jaw structure of Leviathan melvillei is so different from a modern sperm whale , there ’s probably no helpful analogue comparing them .
Maybe the bite force of a killer whale would be a better analogue , but the head structure of a sperm whale is very different from that of killer whales .
We just do n’t know , as yet , how powerful we might be able to estimate the muscles and jaw structure of this new beast might have been .
Ladies and Gentlemen , maybe , it ’s a draw !
If I was a betting man , I ’d probably still put my money on Predator X as the ultimate predator .
( Again , scroll back up and compare the jaws and gapes of Predator X and C. megalodon . )
But I certainly can understand arguments for the possibility of some C. megalodon on steroids as the champ .
It could be argued that the serrated teeth 7 inch teeth of the shark might cut better than Predator X’s 12 inch daggers .
But Predator X might be able to take a bigger bite with its massive jaws .
Again , maybe !
If bigger shark teeth are dug up , I ’ll believe in bigger sharks .
As for the new kid on the block , Leviathan melvillei , it might be too early to say .
In any event , 60 foot - long , 50 - ton sperm whale with an orca - like mouth filled with 14 inch teeth would be do horrendous damage to anything it attacked .
Who knows what will show up ?
Maybe some fossil hunter will find a C. megalodon tooth bigger than the current record 7 and 5/8 inch tooth .
Maybe the Predator X that was found was n’t full - grown and even bigger pliosaurs are waiting to be discovered .
Ditto Leviathan melvillei .
Or maybe some entirely new beast will show up :
It ’s fun and fascinating to learn about the biggest , fastest , strongest , longest , tallest things in nature .
This blog is all about such marvels .
It ’s fun to think , “ Just how big might some creature have gotten ?
What ’s the theoretical limit ? ”
The quest to answer these kinds of questions never ends .
But always , in science , the emphasis is on physical evidence and theories that are in some way testable or verifiable .
Where solid evidence or testability are lacking , then it seems right to me to be conservative about what ’s theoretically possible or what ’s likely .
All three of these great ancient predators are marvels in their own right , and unlike movie monsters , these monsters actually lived and hunted in our seas .
Today ’s great white sharks and killer whales are , after humans , top predator of the seas .
They — and our oceans — deserve to be protected so that future generations will be able to marvel at the wonders of our oceans and the creatures that live in them .

A “ one - hole context ” is a data structure with one piece missing .
Conor McBride pointed out that the derivative of a regular type is its type of one - hole contexts .
When a data structure is assembled out of common functor combinators , a corresponding type of one - hole contexts can be derived mechanically by rules that mirror the standard derivative rules learned in beginning differential calculus .
I ’ve been playing with functor combinators lately .
I was delighted to find that the data - structure derivatives can be expressed directly using the standard functor combinators and type families .
The code in this blog post is taken from the Haskell library functor - combo .
See also the Haskell Wikibooks page on zippers , especially the section called “ Differentiation of data types ” .
I mean this post not as new research , but rather as a tidy , concrete presentation of some of Conor ’s delightful insight .
Functor combinators
Let ’s use the same set of functor combinators as in Elegant memoization with higher - order types and Memoizing higher - order functions :
data Void a -- no constructors type Unit a = Const ( ) a data Const x a = Const x newtype Id a =
Id a data ( f :+ : g ) a = InL ( f a ) | InR ( g a ) data ( f :*: g ) a = f a :* : g a newtype ( g :. f ) a = O ( g ( f a ) )
Derivatives
The derivative of a functor is another functor .
Since the shape of the derivative is non-uniform ( depends on the shape of the functor being differentiated ) define a higher - order type family :
type family Der ( f :: (* → *) ) :: (* → *)
The usual derivative rules can then be translated without applying much imagination .
That is , if we start with derivative rules in their functional form ( e.g. , as in the paper Beautiful differentiation , Section 2 and Figure 1 ) .
For instance , the derivative of the constant function is the constant 0 function , and the derivative of the identity function is the constant 1 function .
If der is the derivative functional mapping functions ( of real numbers ) to functions ,
der ( const x ) ≡ 0 der id ≡ 1
On the right - hand sides , I am exploiting the function instances of Num from the library applicative - numbers .
To be more explicit , I could have written “ const 0 ” and “ const 1 “ .
Correspondingly ,
type instance Der ( Const x ) = Void -- 0 type instance Der Id = Unit -- 1
Note that the types Void a and Unit a have 0 and 1 element , respectively , if we ignore ⊥.
Moreover , Void is a sort of additive identity , and Unit is a sort of multiplicative identity , again ignoring ⊥ .
For these reasons , Void and Unit might be more aptly named “ Zero ” and “ One “ .
The first rule says that the a value of type Const x a has no one - hole context ( for type a ) , which is true , since there is an x but no a .
The second rule says that there is exactly one possible context for Id a , since the one and only a value must be removed , and no information remains .
A ( one - hole ) context for a sum is a context for the left or the right possibility of the sum :
type instance Der ( f :+ : g ) = Der f :+ : Der g
Correspondingly , the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of the functions ’ derivatives : :
der ( f + g ) ≡ der f + der g
Again I ’m using the function Num instance from applicative - numbers .
For a pair , the one hole of a context can be made somewhere in the first component or somewhere in the second component .
So the pair context consists of a holey first component and a full second component or a full first component and a holey second component .
type instance Der ( f :*: g ) = Der f :* : g :+ : f :*: Der g
Similarly , for functions :
der ( f * g ) ≡ der f * g + f * der g
Finally , consider functor composition .
If g and f are container types , then ( g :. f ) a is the type of g containers of f containers of a elements .
The a - shaped hole must come from one of the contained f a structures .
type instance Der ( g :. f ) = ( Der g :. f ) :*: Der f
Here ’s one way to think of this derivative functor : to make an a - shaped hole in a g ( f a ) , first remove an f a structure , leaving an ( f a ) - shaped hole , and then put back all but an a value extracted from the removed f a struture .
So the overall ( one - hole ) context can be assembled from two parts : a g context of f a structures , and an f context of a values .
The corresponding rule for function derivatives :
der ( g ∘ f ) ≡ ( der g ∘ f ) * der f
which again uses Num on functions .
Written out more explicitly :
der ( g ∘ f ) a ≡ der g ( f a ) * der f a
which may look more like the form you ’re used to .
Summary of derivatives
To emphasize the correspondence between forms of differentiation , here are rules for function and functor derivatives :
der ( const x ) ≡ 0 Der ( Const x ) ≡ Void der id ≡ 1 Der Id ≡ Unit der ( f + g ) ≡ der f + der g Der ( f :+: g ) ≡ Der f :+ :
Der g der ( f * g ) ≡ der f * g + f * der g Der ( f :*: g ) ≡ Der f :* : g :+ : f :*: Der g der ( g ∘ f ) ≡ ( der g ∘ f ) * der f Der ( g :. f ) ≡ ( Der g :. f ) :*: Der f
Filling holes
Each derivative functor is a one - hole container .
One useful operation on derivatives is filling that hole .
fillC :: Functor f ⇒
Der f a → a → f a
The specifics of how to fill in a hole will depend on the choice of functor f , so let ’s make the fillC operation a method of a new type class .
This new class is also a handy place to stash the associated type of derivatives , as an alternative to the top - level declarations above .
class Functor f ⇒ Holey f where type Der f :: * → * fillC :: Der f a → a → f a
I ’ll add one more method to this class in an upcoming post .
For Const x , there are no cases to handle , since there are no holes .
instance Holey ( Const x ) where type Der ( Const x ) = Void fillC = error " fillC for Const x : no Der values "
I added a definition just to keep the compiler from complaining .
This particular fillC can only be applied to a value of type Void a , and there are no such values other than ⊥ .
Is there a more elegant way to define functions over data types with no constructors ?
One idea is to provide a single , polymorphic function over void types :
voidF :: Void a → b voidF = error " voidF : no value of type Void "
And use whenever as needed , e.g. ,
fillC = voidF
Next is our identity functor :
instance Holey
Id where type Der Id = Unit fillC ( Const ( ) ) a =
Id a
More succinctly ,
fillC ( Const ( ) ) = Id
For sums ,
instance ( Holey f , Holey g ) ⇒ Holey ( f :+ : g ) where type Der ( f :+ : g ) = Der f :+ :
Der g fillC ( InL df ) a = InL ( fillC df a ) fillC ( InR df ) a = InR ( fillC df a )
or
fillC ( InL df ) = InL ∘ fillC df fillC ( InR df ) = InR ∘ fillC df
Products also have two cases , since the derivative of a product is a sum :
instance ( Holey f , Holey g ) ⇒ Holey ( f :*: g ) where type Der ( f :*: g ) = Der f :* : g :+ : f :*: Der g fillC ( InL ( dfa :* : ga ) ) a = fillC dfa a :* : ga fillC ( InR ( fa :* : dga ) ) a = fa :*: fillC dga a
Less pointfully ,
fillC ( InL ( dfa :* : ga ) ) = ( :* : ga ) ∘ fillC dfa fillC ( InR ( fa :* : dga ) ) = ( fa :*:) ∘ fillC dga
Finally , functor composition :
instance ( Holey f , Holey g ) ⇒ Holey ( g :. f ) where type Der ( g :. f ) = ( Der g :. f ) :*:
Der f fillC ( O dgfa :* : dfa ) a = O ( fillC dgfa ( fillC dfa a ) )
The less pointful form is more telling .
fillC ( O dgfa :* : dfa ) =
O ∘ fillC dgfa ∘ fillC dfa
In words : filling of the derivative of a composition is a composition of filling of the derivatives .
Thoughts on composition
Let ’s return to the derivative rules for composition , i.e. , the chain rule , on functions and on functors :
der ( g ∘ f ) ≡ ( der g ∘ f ) * der f Der ( g :. f ) ≡ ( Der g :. f ) :*: Der f
Written in this way , the functor rule looks quite compelling .
Something bothers me , however .
For functions , multiplication is a special case , not the general case , and is only meaningful and correct when differentiating functions from scalars to scalars .
In general , derivative values are linear maps , and the chain rule uses composition on linear maps rather than multiplication on scalars ( that represent linear maps ) .
I ’ve written several posts on derivatives and a paper Beautiful differentiation , describing this perspective , which comes from calculus on manifolds .
Look again at the less pointful formulation of fillC for derivatives of compositions :
fillC ( O dgfa :* : dfa ) =
O ∘ fillC dgfa ∘ fillC dfa
The product in this case is just structural .
The actual use in fillC is indeed a composition of linear maps .
In this context , “ linear ” has a different meaning from before .
It ’s another way of saying “ fills a one - hole context ” ( as the linear patterns of term rewriting and of ML & Haskell ) .
So maybe there ’s a more general / abstract view of functor derivatives , just as there is a more general / abstract view of function derivatives .
In that view , we might replace the functor chain rule ’s product with a notion of composition .
A “ one - hole context ” is a data structure with one piece missing .
Conor McBride pointed out that the derivative of a regular type is its type of one - hole contexts .

Scientists have successfully regenerated the limb joints of animals with stem cells , giving hope to arthritis patients who need joints replaced .
In a new study in the Lancet , researchers from Columbia University Medical Center , the University of Missouri and Clemson University showed that they had regenerated limb joints of rabbits using the animals ' own stem cells .
Here 's how it works :
Researchers took out the end of the rabbit ’s forelimb joint .
Using laser scanning , they were able to reconstruct , using a computer , a 3 - D image of what the joint looked like .
Based on that image , they " printed " a scaffold that is the same shape of the joint , using a machine somewhat akin to a computer printer .
The scaffold is made of polymers that have tiny tunnels in them .
Next , the researchers put the scaffold into the place where the joint was .
They inserted a special peptide - part of a protein - inside the tunnels of the scaffold that recruits stem cells to regenerate the joint .
After growing the joint , the rabbits were able to move again normally , the study said .
This is the first time that limb joints have been regenerated from an animal 's own stem cells , not cells that were harvested elsewhere , said study co-author Dr. Jeremy Mao of Columbia University .
The animal 's ability to function again normally after growing the limb joint has also never been accomplished before .
Of course , this has not been yet shown in humans , and the researchers did not take into account the rehabilitation process that a patient would need to go through to get accustomed to the new joint , Mao said .
In rabbits , growing the joint took about three weeks on average - it could take longer in humans .
Currently , people with damaged joints must get a metallic replacement that lasts only 10 to 15 years .
Mao could not predict how many years away this joint replacement technology is for humans , as it depends largely on the regulatory process of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The next step would be to test it on a larger animal , perhaps a goat because goats also get arthritis .
Charles Ray Walker , a 59 - year - old homeless man , has turned a grim patch of land off the L.A. River in Boyle Heights into an unlikely exhibition of his tastes , quirks , obsessions and comic observations .
But few have done so with Walker 's flair .
His meticulously arranged found objects suggest a junkyard designed by Santa 's elves or a post - apocalyptic Disneyland .
There 's even a faint echo of large - scale specimens of over - the - top folk art , such as Daniel Van Meter 's Tower of Wooden Pallets in Sherman Oaks or Simon Rodia 's world - famous Watts Towers .
Walker 's raw materials are discards of every description : sea shells , marbles , SpongeBob figures , a Pillsbury doughboy , an Osama bin Laden puppet in camouflage , the Grim Reaper .
Posters , traffic signs ( " No Smoking — Stop Your Motor , " says one ) and other detritus contribute to the surreal atmosphere .
President Barack Obama struck an optimistic tone over the ongoing oil disaster Monday afternoon , saying that " things are going to return to normal " on the stricken Gulf Coast after much pain and frustration , and that the polluted waters will eventually be in better shape than before the leak began .
In the most extreme ( and , one could argue , most consistent ) version of this [ exceptionalist ] tale , non-Western parts of the world are less than human -- and they are subhuman by choice .
They are immoral , and sometimes even evil .
Since we represent the good and they represent the evil , we are surely entitled to improve them , by invasion and bombing if necessary .
If they do not threaten us today , they might at some indeterminate time in the future .
And while we might kill many innocent civilians in our campaign of civilization , those who survive will be infinitely better off than they would have been otherwise .
Besides , how " innocent " can any of them be -- since they are members of inferior , less than fully human civilizations , and since they are so by choice ?
[ T ]he situation in Iraq is now being held up as a model , a goal , for Barack Obama 's massive expansion of the war and occupation in Afghanistan .
Obama himself has called the " surge " in Iraq " an extraordinary achievement , " and has at every turn promoted and propagated the myth that George W. Bush 's escalation of a hideous war of aggression was a resounding success .
This myth is based on one thing only : the fact that the peak of the ghastly death rate produced by the American occupation dropped to a somewhat less horrific level .
But as countless experts and analysts have pointed out , this drop had very little to do with the addition of some 28,000 American troops .
The guerrilla war against the US in Iraq ceased because the Sunni community was being slaughtered by Shia death squads .
" Judging by the body counts at the time in the Baghdad morgues , three Sunnis died for every Shia , " Dr Michael Izady , who conducted a survey of the sectarian make - up of Baghdad for Columbia University 's School of International Affairs , is quoted as saying .
" Baghdad , basically a Sunni city into the 1940s , by the end of 2008 had only a few hundred thousand Sunni residents left in a population of over five million . "
Defeated in this devastating sectarian civil war , the Sunni ended their attacks on US troops and instead sought their protection .
The " surge " of 28,000 extra US troops who arrived in the summer of 2007 had a marginal impact on the outcome of the fighting .
On June 14 , this year , an interpreter for the US army called Hameed al - Daraji was shot dead as he was sleeping in his house in Samarra , a city 60 miles north of Baghdad .
In some respects there was nothing strange about the killing , since 26 Iraqi civilians were murdered in different parts of the country on the same day .
As well as working periodically for the Americans since 2003 , Mr Daraji may have recently converted to Christianity and unwisely taken to wearing a crucifix around his neck – a gesture quite enough to make him a target in the Sunni Arab heartlands .
What made Iraqis , inured to violence though they are , pay particular attention to the murder of Mr Daraji was the identity of his killer .
Arrested soon after the body was discovered , his son is reported to have confessed to his father 's murder , explaining that his father 's job and change of religion brought such shame on the family that there was no alternative to shooting him .
A second son and Mr Daraji 's nephew are also wanted for the killing and all three of the young men are alleged to have links to al - Qa'ida .
The story illustrates the degree to which Iraq remains an extraordinarily violent place .
Without the rest of the world paying much attention , some 160 Iraqis have been killed , and hundreds wounded , over the past two weeks .
Civilian casualties in Iraq are still higher than in Afghanistan , though these days the latter has a near - monopoly of media attention .
But the killing of Mr Daraji should give pause to those who imagine that the US occupation of Iraq somehow came right in its final years ...
...
American troops leave behind a country that is a barely floating wreck .
Baghdad feels like a city under military occupation , with horrendous traffic jams caused by the 1,500 checkpoints and streets blocked off by miles of concrete blast walls that strangle communications within the city .
The situation in Iraq is in many ways " better " than it was , but it could hardly be anything else , given that killings at their peak in 2006 - 2007 were running at about 3,000 a month .
That said , Baghdad remains one of the most dangerous cities in the world , riskier to walk around than Kabul or Kandahar .
...
Corruption explains much in Iraq – but it is not the only reason why it has been so difficult to create a functioning government .
Saddam Hussein should not be such a hard act to follow .
Part of the problem here is that the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein had revolutionary consequences because it shifted power from the Sunni Arab Baathists to the 60 per cent of Iraqis who are Shia and in alliance with the Kurds .
Iraq had a new ruling class rooted in the rural Shia population and headed by former exiles with no experience of running anything .
In many ways , their model of government is to recreate Saddam 's system , only this time with the Shia in charge .
It used to be said that Iraq was under the thumb of Sunni Arabs from Tikrit , Saddam Hussein 's home city north of Baghdad , while these days people in Baghdad complain that a similar tight - knit gang from the Shia city of Nasiriyah surrounds the Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
In many ways , Iraq is becoming like Lebanon , its politics and society irredeemably divided by sect and communal loyalties .
The outcome of the parliamentary election on March 7 could easily be forecast by assuming that most Iraqis would vote as Sunni , Shia or Kurds .
Jobs at the top of government and throughout the bureaucracy are filled unofficially according to sectarian affiliation .
In a crude way , this does give everybody a share of the cake , but the cake is too small to satisfy more than a minority of Iraqis .
Government is also weakened because ministers are representatives of some party , faction or community and cannot be dismissed because they are crooked or incompetent .
Going back to Baghdad last month , after being away for some time , I was struck by how little had changed .
The airport was still among the worst in the world .
When I wanted to fly to Basra , Iraq 's second biggest city and the centre of the oil industry , Iraqi Airways said they had only one flight during the week and they were none too certain when that would leave .
Violence may be down , but few of the 2 million Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria think it safe enough to go home .
A further 1.5 million people are Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) , forced out of their homes by sectarian pogroms in 2006 and 2007 and too frightened to return .
Of these , some half a million people try to survive in squatter camps which Refugees International describes as lacking " basic services , including water , sanitation and electricity , and built on precarious places – under bridges , alongside railroad tracks and amongst garbage dumps " .
A worrying fact about these camps is that the number of people in them should be shrinking as sectarian warfare ebbs , but in fact the IDP population is growing .
These days refugees come to the camps not because of fear of the death squads but because of poverty , joblessness or because the prolonged drought is driving farmers off their land .
If you have ever wondered how a serial murderer -- a murderer who is sane and fully aware of the acts he has committed -- can remain steadfastly convinced of his own moral superiority and show not even the slightest glimmer of remorse , you should not wonder any longer .
The United States government is such a murderer .
It conducts its murders in full view of the entire world .
It even boasts of them .
Our government , and all our leading commentators , still maintain that the end justifies the means -- and that even the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocents is of no moral consequence , provided a sufficient number of people can delude themselves into believing the final result is a " success . "
...
We can appeal all we want to " American exceptionalism , " but any " exceptionalism " that remains ours is that of a mass murderer without a soul , and without a conscience .
...
It is useless to appeal to any " American " sense of morality : we have none .
It does not matter how immense the pile of corpses grows : we will not surrender or even question our delusion that we are right , and that nothing we do can be profoundly , unforgivably wrong .
You may not regard the two propositions in my title as deserving of any special attention .
You may think , entirely correctly , that if we as Americans are special , it is only in the way that any human being is special : that each of us is unique and irreplaceable , that each of our lives , and the lives ofof us , demand reverence for the unrepeatable value of a person 's brief passage in this world .
And you may recognize , also correctly , that certain actions lead to destruction and loss in a manner and on a scale that forbid correction and amends , that on some occasions we can only accept the certainty of negative consequences that can not be avoided .
Human beings may be capable of remarkable , even wondrous achievement , but limits are inherent in existence itself .
Sometimes those limits mean that wounds will never heal , that the pain will never end .
If you view these observations as unremarkable , even mundane , that is because in certain crucial respects , you are an adult .
Such a healthy perspective -- " healthy " designating that which proceeds from demonstrable facts -- enables us to see the extreme nature of the delusions necessitated by an unquestioned belief in the myth of American exceptionalism .
Despite the events of the last decade , the myth remains the heart of American culture , of American politics , and of the American State .
Our politicians still regularly assure us that " America is the last , best hope of Earth , " and that " the American moment " will extend for the entirety of " this new century . "
Americans remain " the Good Guys : " The emphasis is not only on ' Good , ' but on : we areGood Guys in a way that no one else is , or can ever be .
" When we believe that America and Americans are unique and uniquely good in all of history , we will also believe that there is no problem we cannot overcome .
Our political leaders tell us this fable time and again ; many Americans are eager to believe it , in the manner of a damaged child who appeals to mysterious powers to vanquish the dangers lurking in the shadows of his room .
We witness this mechanism in connection with a wide range of problems , even when those problems reach the catastrophic level .

He expects , in fact hethat you take his word for it , that you believe him without question or challenge .
He demands that you This is the way our political leaders treat their subjects both abroad and at home .
( In addition to rejecting this method of forcible " persuasion , " I also reject such reassurances for further , more specific and compelling reasons , as do many others .
I recognize that we are provided only such information about the Gulf catastrophe as the government and BP , which are one and the same in this context , wish us to have .
We have close to no idea what is actually going on , or the damage that has already been inflicted and that may manifest itself in the future .
Moreover , I recognize the dangerous folly of entrusting any kind of solution to a crisis of this kind , or to the crisis of climate change however one may conceive it , to an inherently , fatally corrupted corporatist State .)
The pace of destruction on the domestic front is rapidly increasing at present .
But the greatest destruction wrought by the exceptionalist American State will still be found in the realm of foreign affairs .
The foundation of America 's murderous prescription for large parts of the rest of the world remains as I have identified it With this belief system as the unchallengeable foundation , a vast number of Americans render themselves completely unable to recognize the devastating consequences of the American State 's actions abroad .
Whenever those consequences threaten to announce themselves in an unavoidable manner , most Americans will explicitly deny or avoid them through an endless variety of stratagems .
When all else fails , their ultimate defense will be the cloaked restatement of the myth 's message : the lives of thosepeople are simply not of the same value as our own .
Such recognition must be disguised to a degree , for an explicit statement to that effect would shock certain sensibilities ( or certain people would at leastto be shocked ) .
But -- and this is the critical point -- when we consider the relevant facts , the continuing refusal to acknowledge what the American State has done and still does todayA terrifyingly awful example of this phenomenon is the disappearance of the nightmarish tragedy of Iraq from our national conversation .
Remember that Iraq never posed a serious threat to the United States , and that our leadersthat it posed no such threat .
Therefore , the U.S. invasion and occupation represent an ongoing series of war crimes .
This is not an arguable point in any respect .
Since it cannot be argued , it is ignored altogether .
And it is not just ignored , as malignantly evil as that would be by itself .
The American exceptionalist myth tells us that the United States is unique and uniquely It is not sufficient to ignore negative consequences of our actions : we must transform any and all negative consequences into a positive good .
This process has been rigorously followed for every American intervention ever undertaken ( going back to the Philippines , then with the American entrance into World War I , on into many interventions after World War II , on into Iraq and Afghanistan today ) , and the identical process has been well underway for several years in connection with Iraq in particular .
Chris Floyd identified the operation of this mechanism in December of last year
In that article , Floyd excerpted Patrick Cockburn , who identified this terrible truth :
We must always remember the scope of the horrifying effects of the U.S. invasion and occupation , including the murder of over a million innocent people , together with the all - encompassing devastation of an entire country as set forth in that same article .
Such is the limitless power of delusion on this scale : a blood - drenched tragedy of world - historical proportion becomes " an extraordinary achievement , " and a criminal war of aggression is transmuted by the alchemy of cultural myth - making into a " success . "
This is the evil to be found at the rotted heart of the myth : the United States does , it will lead to good andto good .
And all of it -- of it -- is a damnable , unforgivable lie .
Patrick Cockburn has written a new article about Iraq : " The Ruin They 'll Leave Behind . "
Let us leave aside the fact that the U.S.leaving , an issue I just recently discussed .
In light of the great value of Cockburn 's reporting , this is a comparatively minor point .
I urge you to read all of Cockburn 's piece .
Here are several key passages : Cockburn has much , much more
As deeply horrifying as these details are , perhaps it is that these facts are not hidden or completely inaccessible that is most unsettling .
What the U.S. has done -- death and ongoing suffering on a monumental scale , that " Iraq remains an extraordinarily violent place " and " is a barely floating wreck " -- can easily be known , if we seek to know the truth .
Yet almost none of our leaders will acknowledge the smallest part of this truth , and most Americans are unaware of almost all of it .
This reveals a notable danger in what is often held up as yet another singular virtue of the United States : that we have a " free " press , and that there is no official censorship .
As a result , people believe that theyknow the truth .
After all , no one is being actively prevented from telling even unpleasant truths .
Such simplistic appeals to what is supposedly another aspect of American virtue disregard the complex operations of cultural " truths " that are widely accepted .
It is almost impossible to imagine how official censorship could more successfully and comprehensively obliterate thetruth .
And I repeat : since people delude themselves that their leaders and mediatelling them the truth , they feel no need to seek further for it .
Moreover , facts such as those set forth by Cockburn , facts that are accessible to anyone if he wants to find them , have no reality for those whose identity and self - worth are critically tied to the myth of American exceptionalism .
It is the myth that is real ; facts that conflict with and undermine the myth rarely penetrate the consciousness of most Americans .
Such facts areadmitted by those who would lead the American State .
Even after the criminal catastrophe of Iraq , the myth prevails .
Death and devastation become " success " -- and that " success " then becomes another justification for yetcampaign of death and devastation in Afghanistan , and Pakistan , and then perhaps in Iran ... Some critics of American interventionism abroad point to signs that the same critics think indicate a willingness to more seriously question American foreign policy : the overextension of the American military , the serious , possibly irreversible weakening of the American economy generally , and the like .
Again , however , such facts , indisputable though they may be , fall into the category of facts that become non-facts when set against the power of the myth .
I have sometimes remarked that myths which assume importance in the manner of the exceptionalist myth constitute
It is crucial to appreciate that this is how it operates in psychological terms .
In a contest between a belief system which provides identity and self - worth and facts which threaten that identity and self - worth , it is frequently the facts which many people choose to discard .
Occasionally , when the destructive ( and - destructive ) effects of a belief system become sufficiently overwhelming , a person will decide to question and eventually dispense with the belief system .
The process can be agonizingly difficult .
Many people prefer to avoid it .
Most of us are familiar with the tragic story of the individual who refuses to give up the myth that he still believes provides him consolation and meaning -- even when clinging to the myth leads to his own death .
Countries can behave in the identical manner ; history provides numerous examples of the same tragedy on a national scale .
For the present , and for the United States , the myth commands the controlling position .
What will dislodge it ?
I 'm convinced that only widespread devastation visited on the U.S. itself , through economic collapse , natural ( or unnatural ) catastrophe , or a final war of unspeakably awful consequence , will finally force our leaders and many Americans to surrender the myth that has sustained them for so long .
And in such a case , it wo n't be a choice to acknowledge the truth at long last .
The devastation will be so immense that the myth will be rendered entirely irrelevant , a kind of unutterably grisly , sick , pointless joke .
I would be profoundly grateful to be in error on this point ; I do not think I am .
Even now , we could choose differently , but there are almost no signs that most Americans are willing to consider the possibility .
Certainly , our leaders are not .
And even if we do not make a different choice , we may have years and even decades before the worst consequences are felt .
It is impossible to know the details in advance given the huge number of variables involved .
For the moment , we are left with a nation and a government that is as I described it close to four years ago
Image caption Police say they have a " gut feeling " Raoul Moat remains near Rothbury
Two men are due in court later after being charged in connection with the search for suspected gunman Raoul Moat , who has been on the run for six days .
Armed officers are continuing to scour countryside around Rothbury , Northumberland , in their hunt for Moat .
The former nightclub bouncer is suspected of shooting three people , one fatally , on Tyneside over the weekend .
Police said the two men were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and possessing a firearm with intent .
They said Karl Ness , 26 , from Dudley , North Tyneside , and Qhuram Awan , 23 , from Blyth , Northumberland , were arrested on Tuesday in the Rothbury area .
Both are due to appear at Newcastle Magistrates ' Court .
They were arrested as police dealt with what they thought was a hostage situation amid fears Moat had kidnapped two men following the shootings .
The pair were subsequently arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder .
The search for Moat , 37 , intensified on Wednesday evening as police returned their focus to Wagtail Farm in Rothbury , which had previously been the subject of detailed searches by armed officers .
A team of officers led an associate of Moat , who was handcuffed and wearing a flak jacket , through fields and into the farm .
Northumbria Police said the man was helping to identify places
Moat was known to have previously visited .
Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Jim Campbell said : " The searches in this area have proved a particular challenge due to the open farmland and dense woodland and officers are continuing in their efforts today .
" I 'd like to reassure the public that we are doing everything possible to locate Moat and bring this investigation to a conclusion .
" Although much of the investigation centres on Rothbury , the events in this area are just one part of a complex investigation and activity continues across the force . "
Since going on the run , Moat has threatened to wage a vendetta against police after blaming the force for ruining his life .
Northumbria Police has repeatedly appealed to him to hand himself in , insisting officers want to apprehend him safely .
The force believes he is holed up in countryside around Rothbury .
Dozens of firearms officers have been dispatched to the area as the hunt for Moat , from the Fenham area of Newcastle , continues .
About 40 firearms officers from the Metropolitan Police have been sent to the area while the Police Service of Northern Ireland has sent 20 armoured cars .
Moat is alleged to have shot and injured his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , 22 , and killed her new partner Chris Brown , 29 , in Birtley , Gateshead on Saturday .
Pc David Rathband , 42 , was shot in his patrol car in Newcastle on Sunday .
Moat is also believed to have carried out an armed robbery at a fish and chip shop in Seaton Delaval , near Blyth , on Monday night .
Police located a black Lexus car linked to Moat in Rothbury on Tuesday and have since found a makeshift campsite where he is thought to have been living rough while on the run .
On Wednesday Det Ch Supt Neil Adamson , from Northumbria Police , said he had a " gut feeling " Moat was still in the Rothbury area .
Police believe Moat could be armed with one or two weapons and has access to ammunition .
A £ 10,000 reward has been offered for information that leads to his capture .

BOSTON  Standing in front of his tiny locker in the Red Sox ’ clubhouse , Daniel Nava pulled out his wallet and offered a reporter an old driver ’s license  one he has held on to since he was a sophomore in high school .
The license listed Nava at 5 feet 1 inch and 105 pounds , dimensions that were the product of careful strategizing by Nava , who for years had aspired to break the 100 - pound threshold .
“ I rounded all my numbers up , ” he said late last week .
“ If I put 100 , people would be like , ‘ You ’re 95 . ’
But if I put 105 , then they would be like , ‘ You ’re 100 . ’
How about that  three digits right there ! ”
Nava , who as a call - up at age 27 has been an unlikely spark plug in the Red Sox ’ injury - stricken lineup this season , needs no reminder that he did not always seem destined to be a major league player .
But if he wanted one , he could just look at that license  or at his unlikely baseball ascension .
Rep . Steve Scalise holds an Associated Press photo taken by Charlie Riedel of an oil - covered pelican , the state bird of Louisiana , as he questions BP CEO Tony Hayward during a congressional hearing June 17 , 2010 .
Oil spill visits get partisan
Rep. Steve Scalise ( R - La. ) wanted to fly 10 lawmakers down to the Gulf of Mexico to see the damage caused by BP ’s gigantic oil spill first hand .
House Democrats said no .
Advertisement
Scalise ’s trip was rejected for a variety of bureaucratic and logistical reasons , but it has also opened a new vein of partisan squabbling over who should be allowed to arrange a trip to view the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
Republicans want to be able to take trips using their office spending allowance .
But Democrats have heard from the Department of Homeland Security , which has asked that Congress organize trips through committees of jurisdiction , to avoid having to cater to a ton of individual lawmakers in a disaster zone , Democratic aides say .
GOP leaders say they ’ve heard nothing of this .
The squabbling over who gets to travel to the Gulf on whose dime is the latest sign that congressional oversight of the oil spill oversight from Capitol Hill has been bogged down by partisanship .
Congress has held upwards of 20 hearings on the disaster , often duplicative ones each week , as lawmakers struggle to grasp and fully realize the scope of BP ’s giant oil spill .
Scalise , who has already been to the Gulf on another codel , wants to organize a trip so lawmakers can fully grasp the impact before they vote on oil drilling regulations .
And he does n't want to do it through a committee , because the members do n't fit neatly into specific panels — they stretch across committee , and even partisan , lines .
About two weeks ago , Scalise requested to be able to use his Members Representational Allowance – a fund typically reserved for office expenses and travel back to the district – to go to the Gulf with a group of about 10 other lawmakers .
He sought permission from the House Administration committee , which regulates office account spending and would have to approve the trip .
After a few weeks , Scalise was ping - ponged between several committees .
Eventually , John Lawrence , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s ( D - Calif . ) chief of staff , told Scalise ’s chief that “ it was unlikely that the request would be granted ” by the House Administration Committee .
Republicans , however , say Rep. Bob Brady ( D - Pa. ) , who chairs the committee , has approved at least a dozen such trips in 2009 alone – something Democrats do n’t deny .
“ Unless there is some extraordinary reason to prohibit this trip – which has yet to be communicated to us – this is an unacceptable departure from past practices , ” said Rep , Dan Lungren of California , the top Republican on the administration committee .
“ This is an educational trip for members using their own representational budgets to see , first - hand , the devastating impact of the Gulf spill .
Our travel regulations permit this type of travel in support of our official representational duties , and unfortunately , this disaster is already having environmental and economical implications for the entire country – not just those districts represented by Members sitting on the House Energy and Commerce Committee . ”
Republicans say that Democrats are just trying to shield lawmakers from going to see the damage in the Gulf .
“ Every Member should see the result of eight years of failed Bush - Cheney energy policies that have done nothing to secure our energy future , ” said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill .
So for now , the Scalise visit remains unscheduled .
Sep 28 , 2020
This is a stressful , uncertain time .
The COVID - 19 pandemic has brought many significant changes to how we live daily life .
Social distancing , quarantine , and isolation can be overwhelming and may cause feelings of insecurity , confusion , hopelessness , and , ultimately , depression .
A group of neighbourhood kids selling parking spots on their front lawns during the Canadian Open have been warned by city bylaw officials to stop .
If they do n’t , they could be charged $ 25,000 .
According to residents of Princess Margaret Blvd. , two men driving a beige Toyota Prius pulled up late Thursday afternoon .
“ He flashed his badge and said , ‘ We will tolerate this in your driveway , but get the cars off your lawn , ’ ” said an angry Karen Howe , whose children Maura , 15 , and Connor , 18 , have been selling cold drinks and parking spots to those attending the tournament at St. George ’s Golf and Country Club .
She added the officer was “ so condescending it was unbelievable . . . it feels very David and Goliath . ”
Howe ’s children have been using four spots on their driveway and three on their lawn this week .
A stone ’s throw away from the course ’s main entrance , parking is $ 30 a day , $ 75 for three days or $ 150 for the entire week — a price scale agreed upon by about six other families on the street , also selling parking .
Just like Howe ’s son , Victoria Regan is raising seed money for university tuition .
She starts a degree at Ryerson in the fall .
A homemade sign drawn with marker outside her home reads : “ Please !
We want a higher education . ”
“ We ’re just kids , ” said the 18 - year - old .
“ We ’re not trying to cause any trouble . ”
Curtis Sealock , district manager for municipal licensing and standards , confirmed that a complaint from the area prompted Thursday ’s warning from municipal standards officers .
He said that while it is technically illegal to sell parking spots , “ we ’re not even going to go there , ” reiterating that his officers only warned against parking on front lawns .
Driveways are all right .
According to Sealock , if the residents of Princess Margaret Blvd. continue to park cars on their front lawns , they could be charged with the violation of a zoning bylaw , the maximum penalty for which is $ 25,000 for one offence and doubles to $ 50,000 for a second .
If found guilty , the courts would determine the penalty .
“ That is ridiculous , ” said Howe when the Star informed her of the potential consequence .
“ I would just love to see my 15 - year - old in a court of law defending a $ 25,000 fine . ”
For Howe , this latest development is especially frustrating .
“ This Canadian Open has come in and turned our lives upside down . . . the city has been complicit with St. George ’s in allowing them all kinds of transgressions such as closing a major artery in the city .
I practically have to show I.D. to get into my own driveway , ” she said .

“ We thought this parking was a neat little upside to the disarray that has become our lives .
And then to be bullied by a bylaw officer ? ”
Victoria ’s father , Larry Regan , agrees .
“ We have to put up with the construction , the road closures , yet they ’re coming and bugging us .
. . .
I said to ( the officers ) , ‘ The kids are just having a gas , ’ ” he said .
There is precedent for selling parking on front lawns in Toronto .
Neighbours of the Canadian National Exhibition have been doing so for about two decades with the help of a special bylaw , said Angie Antoniou , manager of traffic planning for the city of Toronto .
“ There are exemptions on some of the streets around the exhibition , ” she said , adding that it is the only place in the city where such an exemption exists for a special event .
As for the officer ’s curt demeanour , Sealock said it was the first time he had heard of it .
“ I ’m not defending , but we are an enforcement agency .
Whenever we come into a situation and enforce , normally people are not happy . ”
“ We received a complaint and responded to the complaint , ” he added .
Saturday and Sunday are the Canadian Open ’s two busiest days .
Will the residents of Princess Margaret Blvd. continue to park cars on their front lawns ?
“ The guys on the street are n’t sure what we ’re going to do right now , ” said Larry Regan .
Amazing China Graph of the Day
I ’ve been meaning to write something about Chinese wages for a while , but have n’t yet gotten around to it .
Hopefully I will soon , but in the meantime I think this editorial from the weekend ’s FT broadly gets it right .
The main takeaway is that this is exactly what we should expect to see given the country ’s phenomenal growth and development of recent years ; moreover , if we ’re serious about wanting to see rebalancing within China and the global economy , this is what we should * want * to see happening .
( I find it amazing how many American newspapers have been calling on the Chinese to let the yuan appreciate for years , then when news of wage increases hits the story becomes ‘ but this will make our ipods and computers more expensive ! ’
More on that to come . )
For now , I just want to share the below graph , hidden in the appendix of the World Bank ’s recently released Global Economic Prospects , showing metal consumption in China and the rest of the world :
Generally , when you see a graph of consumption of anything that is split between one country and the rest of the world , you ’d expect the two series to be measured on separate axes .
Not the case here .
Eyeballing from the graph , China now accounts for about 40 percent of the world ’s metal consumption .
Ridiculous .
I think this one graph might sum up the current state of the global economy better than any other .
More than anything , it shows that a decade ago , even though China was growing at 10 percent , it was still a small enough economy that it did n’t really affect the global picture .
But with China emerging as the soon - to - be - if - not - already second largest economy , that same 10 percent growth rate is reshaping the global economic landscape .
And when all other large economies are facing a prolonged slump , suddenly China is more or less the world ’s only growth driver – and if you ’re a metal exporter , your best friend .
If Joe Barton could suck up oil as fast has he can take the heat off everyone else , we ’d have this spill licked .
Think about it .
BP CEO Tony Hayward sat there blinking awkwardly as Barton proceeded to rescue Hayward from what was expected to be a day - long PR disaster for BP by taking all the heat on himself .
Then , remember , it was just 24 ago hours that all kinds of Republicans were trashing the $ 20 billion escrow fund as a “ shakedown . ”
Even House conservatives ’ 100 - member - strong study committee called it a “ Chicago - style shakedown . ”
But no matter .
Thanks to old Joe , the House GOP can make him the scapegoat instead , threatening to strip him of his seat on the Energy Committee for doing too good a job of parroting the party line .
The line from GOP flacks today was that Barton ’s apology for the escrow fund was completely different than their criticism of Obama for the escrow fund .
That ’s a distinction Dems will be happy to let Republicans try to make to voters all the way to November .
THE financial reform bill still awaits final touches from the Senate , but now that Congress appears to have agreed on most of the principles in the new legislation , mortgage borrowers can get a glimpse of future lending practices .
And here ’s the upshot : if you ’re a financially sophisticated borrower who does n’t mind taking risks with your money , the legislation may not be welcome .
But most other borrowers will enjoy some improved protections .
Many changes expected in the federal legislation wo n’t take effect for a year or more , according to John A. Courson , the chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association .
The federal government , for instance , must first establish a new regulatory body , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which would oversee consumer loans , among other things .
But in the meantime , many lenders have already begun changing their practices , Mr. Courson said , anticipating passage of the financial reform bill .
For instance , at least two categories of mortgage are already disappearing : interest - only loans and stated - income loans .
Mr. Courson explained that both loan types would almost certainly fall short of the government ’s definition of “ qualified ” mortgages , and , therefore , be quickly shunned by all lenders once the new law took effect .
Why are deflationistas like me worried about the possibility of deflation ?
In a word , history .
Back when I learned macroeconomics — this was when dinosaurs roamed the earth , we performed simulations using stone axes , and students still learned about fiscal policy — one thing we were taught was that if you plot unemployment against inflation , the economy tends to go through clockwise spirals : high unemployment leads to falling inflation , then inflation stabilizes and maybe rises again once unemployment comes down .
All of this was to be understood in terms of a Phillips curve in which actual inflation at any point in time depends both on the unemployment rate and on expected inflation , and expected inflation gradually adjusts in the light of experience .
These clockwise spirals were really clear in cases where a severe recession produced a spike in unemployment and disinflation .
Here ’s the slump of the mid-1970s :
And here ’s the slump of the early 1980s :
By the way , in both pictures I use core inflation over the previous year ; here ’s why .
Also , notice that there are occasional jinks and jogs in these pictures , since this is economics and data are far from perfect .
The point is to focus on the big picture
So now we ’re experiencing a slump that ’s deeper and longer than either of those episodes ; and we came into it with a much lower inflation rate than either previous experience .
Are we seeing another clockwise spiral ?
Yes :
How can you look at this record and not conclude that deflation is a very real risk ?
I have no idea where the complacency of many at the Fed comes from .
America 's job machine is stuck in neutral .
And that 's a worrying sign .
The number of Americans signing up for first - time unemployment benefits – a gauge of layoffs – surged to 464,000 last week , the Labor Department reported Thursday .
That was higher than a consensus of economists expected and slightly above the average for the year .
With first - time claims staying stubbornly high , it 's unlikely that unemployment will come down quickly .
If unemployed Americans do n't return to work , they can't spend , which slows the recovery .
There 's an outside chance that it stops recovery altogether .
" Initial unemployment claims hovering near the 450K mark have historically been consistent with weak labor market conditions characterized by 100 K or greater declines in nonfarm payrolls , " says Joshua Shapiro , an economist with New York economic consulting firm MFR , in a written analysis .
Yet , the government 's official employment numbers have been showing slowly rising private - sector employment .
" So , either the long - standing relationship between jobless claims and payroll employment has broken down , or the payroll figures are being overstated , " Mr. Shapiro writes .
" Our bet is on overstatement . "
Even if the numbers are n't being overstated , the outlook for job growth is weak .
At the end of 2012 , the United States will still be struggling with an unemployment rate between 7 and 7.5 percent , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke forecast in Senate testimony Wednesday .
And that may be optimistic .
" Most participants [ in the Fed 's policymaking committee ] viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal , and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside , " Mr. Bernanke said .

ST . LOUIS -- St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa says he supports Arizona legislation calling for tougher enforcement against illegal immigrants .
Opponents of the law have called for Major League Baseball to move the 2011 All - Star Game out of the state .
La Russa says Arizona has a problem that the national government has failed to remedy .
The manager , who lives in northern California , spoke this week before a game in St. Louis between the Cardinals and Arizona Diamondbacks .
" I 'm actually a supporter of what Arizona is doing , " La Russa said .
" If the national government does n't fix your problem , you 've got a problem .
You 've got to fix it yourself .
That 's just part of the American way . "
Gov. Jan Brewer signed a state law in April requiring police officers to question a person 's immigration status if there 's reasonable doubt he or she might be in the country illegally .
Dozens of St. Louis Tea Party members were at Busch Stadium to show their support of the Arizona immigration law , prompting La Russa to touch on the subject .
La Russa told reporters he encouraged the presence of different points of view , and said he believed the Tea Party 's stances were " correct " on " a lot of things . "

A green myth is on the march .
It wants to blame the world ’s overbreeding poor people for the planet ’s peril .
It stinks .
And on World Population Day , I encourage fellow environmentalists not to be seduced .
Some greens think all efforts to save the world are doomed unless we “ do something ” about continuing population growth .
But this is nonsense .
Worse , it is dangerous nonsense .
For a start , the population bomb that I remember being scared by 40 years ago as a schoolkid is being defused fast .
Back then , most women round the world had five or six children .
Today ’s women have just half as many as their mothers — an average of 2.6 .
Not just in the rich world , but almost everywhere .
This is getting close to the long - term replacement level , which , allowing for girls who do n’t make it to adulthood , is around 2.3 .
Women are cutting their family sizes not because governments tell them to , but for their own good and the good of their families — and if it helps the planet too , then so much the better .
This is a stunning change in just one generation .
Why do n’t we hear more about it ?
Because it does n’t fit the doomsday agenda .
Half the world now has fewer than the “ replacement level ” of children .
That includes Europe , North America , and the Caribbean , most of the Far East from Japan to Thailand , and much of the Middle East from Algeria to Iran .
Yes , Iran .
Women in Tehran today have fewer children than their sisters in New York — and a quarter as many as their mothers had .
The mullahs may not like it , but those guys do n’t count for much in the bedroom .
And China .
There , the communist government decides how many children couples can have .
The one - child policy is brutal and repulsive .
But the odd thing is that it may not make much difference any more .
Chinese women round the world have gone the same way without compulsion .
When Britain finally handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 , it had the lowest fertility in the world — below one child per woman .
Britain was n’t running a covert one - child policy .
That was as many children as the women in Hong Kong wanted .
What is going on ?
Family - planning experts used to say that women only started having fewer children when they got educated or escaped poverty — like us .
But tell that to the women of Bangladesh .
Recently I met Aisha , Miriam , and Akhi — three women from three families working in a backstreet sweatshop in the capital Dhaka .
Together , they had 22 brothers and sisters .
But they told me they planned to have only six children between them .
That was the global reproductive revolution summed up in one shack .
Bangladesh is one of the world ’s poorest nations .
Its girls are among the least educated in the world , and mostly marry in their mid-teens .
Yet they have on average just three children now .
India is even lower at 2.8 .
In Brazil , hotbed of Catholicism , most women have two children .
And nothing the priests say can stop millions of them getting sterilized .
The local joke is that they prefer being sterilized to other methods of contraception because you only have to confess once .
It may not be a joke .
Women are having smaller families because , for the first time in history , they can .
Because we have largely eradicated the diseases that used to mean most children died before growing up .
Mothers no longer need to have five or six children to ensure the next generation , so they do n’t .
There are holdouts , of course .
In parts of rural Africa , women still have five or more children .
But even here they are being rational — they need the kids to mind the animals and work in the fields .
But most of the world now lives in cities .
And in cities , children are an economic burden .
You have to get them educated before they can get a job .
And by then they are ready to leave home .
The big story is that rich or poor , socialist or capitalist , Muslim or Catholic , secular or devout , with tough government birth - control policies or none , most countries tell the same story : Small families are the new norm .
That does n’t mean women do n’t still need help to achieve their ambitions of small families .
They need governments or charities to distribute modern contraception .
But this is now about rights for women , not “ population control . ”
It is also true that population growth has not ceased yet .
We have 6.8 billion people today , and may end up with another 2 billion before the population bomb is finally defused .
But this is mainly because of a time lag while the huge numbers of young women born during the baby boom years of the 20th century remain fertile .
With half the world already at below - replacement birthrates , and with those rates still falling fast , the world ’s population will probably be shrinking within a generation .
This is good news for the environment , for sure .
But do n’t put out the flags .
Another myth put out by the population doom - mongers is that it ’s all those extra people that are wrecking the planet .
But that ’s no longer the case .
Rising consumption today is a far bigger threat to the environment than a rising head count .
And most of that extra consumption is still happening in rich countries that have long since given up growing their populations .
Virtually all of the remaining population growth is in the poor world , and the poor half of the planet is only responsible for 7 percent of carbon emissions .
The carbon emissions of one American today are equivalent to those of around four Chinese , 20 Indians , 40 Nigerians , or 250 Ethiopians .
How dare rich - world greens blame the poor world for the planet ’s perils ?
Some greens need to take a long , hard look at themselves .
They should remember where some of their ideas came from .
The granddaddy of demographic doomsters was Bob Malthus , an English clergyman who got famous by warning 200 years ago about population growth .
He believed that the world ’s population would keep increasing till it was cut down by disease or famine .
Back in the ferment of the Industrial Revolution , he was a favorite of the evil mill owners and a scourge on anyone with a social conscience .
Malthus hated Victorian charities because he said they were keeping poor people alive to breed .
Better that they die , he said .
He believed the workhouses , where the destitute ended up , were too lenient , and he successfully campaigned for a get - tough law known at the time as Malthus ’s Law .
The novelist Charles Dickens , a social reformer , attacked Malthus in several of his books .
When Oliver Twist asked for more gruel in the workhouse , that was a satire on Malthus ’s Law .
In A Christmas Carol , Ebenezer Scrooge was a caricature of Malthus .
In Hard Times , Thomas Gradgrind , the unfeeling headmaster of Coketown , had a son called Malthus .
I think Karl Marx , another contemporary , was spot on when he called Malthusian ideas “ a libel on the human race . ”
And we are seeing the truth of that today as , round the world , women are voluntarily cutting their family sizes .
No compulsion needed .
The population bomb is being defused right now — by the world ’s poor women .
Sadly , the consumption bomb is still primed and ever more dangerous .
Now that would be a proper target for environmentalists .

Stranded by the Icelandic volcano eruption , Hobbs had a month - long sojourn in Los Angeles earlier this year and recorded a pair of shows that rank among the finest illustrations of the depth of the local talent pool .
They are probably not appropriate for Pop & Hiss , but I posted them on my blog with links still available ( the second show is available here ) .
The statement that Hobbs released on her MySpace page is below the jump , complete with an outline of her future plans .
Her program will be missed .

Yesterday I resigned from BBC Radio1 , after an amazing multi-dimensional 14 - year career .
The great freedoms the BBC have given in me as a broadcaster have allowed me to help break so many confrontational artists as diverse as Slipknot and Skream , and of course , the whole genre of Dubstep in recent times .
My current Experimental show is in peak condition , it ’s never been stronger .
And although it ’s a very emotional decision to leave the show that I love so much , it ’s also an optimum moment to bow out , at the very top of my game .
My work for Radio1 on the Breezeblock , Rock Show , many fascinating documentaries about everything from David Bowie to Dubstep , on daytime , at festivals and award ceremonies , has been exceptionally rewarding .
These have been glory days not just for me , but for all the artists who have shared my BBC platform , and of course , the listeners everywhere from Beijing to Berlin , Baltimore to Blackpool , who shared a great passion for future sound .
I will continue to DJ live , work in film , and curate at Sonar festival in Barcelona .
I have also accepted a new job mentoring and teaching students at the University of Sheffield ’s Union Of Students radio station , TV station and the newspaper that operate out of their superb Forge Media Hub , which presents me with a really exciting new challenge .
My last show on BBC Radio1 will be broadcast : September 8th >>9th … Wednesday night >>

German man facing jail for having Hitler speech as his mobile ringtone
Adolf's on the line : A German man is facing jail over a ringtone featuring the voice of Hitler
A German man is facing up to six months in jail for having a speech by Adolf Hitler as his mobile phone ringtone .
The 54 - year - old had a Hitler speech - in which the Fuhrer pledged the ' destruction of world Jewry ' if Germany was ' dragged ' into war - programmed into his Nokia phone .
Passengers aboard a train in Hamburg heard the bizarre ringtone several times during a journey and reported him to police who seized him when the train stopped .
When he was taken into custody , police also found swastika stickers and a photo of Hitler on the telephone with the words : ' The greatest commander of all time ' .
He was charged with violating the German constitution which expressly forbids public displays of the Nazis and all their works .

Update :
The quoted paper is the Latin American Herald Tribune .
But there is a comment left by a supposed GM representative here which I highlight :
GM is NOT using U.S. Government Loans to Invest in Brazil Re : Robert Oak 's post on 1/19/09 , " GM using Bail Out Money to Invest in Brazil " ... The claims that General Motors is planning to invest $ 1 billion of U.S. federal aid money in its Brazilian operations is unequivocally wrong and without any basis in fact .
No monies from a U.S. government loan would be allocated to investments in Brazil .
In the case of Brazil , GM has $ 1 billion in investments that have been announced over the last two years .
These investments are fully financed by GM's Brazilian operations through local sources .
GM 's operations in Brazil are fully self - funded .

I think it 's very important to be accurate on such an obviously bombshell story so I will update this as I get more information .
In the interim , below is the original post .
U.S. taxpayer money .
All of that talk about workers , demanding the UAW give up concessions and this is what GM is doing with the money !
General Motors to Invest $ 1 Billion in Brazil Operations -- Money to Come from U.S. Rescue Program
General Motors plans to invest $ 1 billion in Brazil to avoid the kind of problems the U.S. automaker is facing in its home market , said the beleaguered car maker .
According to the president of GM Brazil - Mercosur , Jaime Ardila , the funding will come from the package of financial aid that the manufacturer will receive from the U.S. government and will be used to " complete the renovation of the line of products up to 2012 . "
" It would n't be logical to withdraw the investment from where we 're growing , and our goal is to protect investments in emerging markets , " he said in a statement published by the business daily Gazeta Mercantil .
Look at that !
On top of it GM is saying Brazil should n't cough up the money since they are trying to grow their economy !
Bail out money to GM should be immediately rescinded !
The Federal Court of Appeal has rejected the notion that internet service providers are broadcasters , likely ending a plan to introduce a new levy on internet users to pay for the creation of Canadian content online .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission in June asked the court to decide whether ISPs could be governed under the Broadcast Act , which would therefore require them to contribute to the creation of Canadian programming , as traditional broadcasters do .
On Wednesday , the court ruled that ISPs are not broadcasters because they only provide access to video content , which is generally supplied by third parties — such as broadcasters .
As long as the ISPs remain neutral in providing that access , they should continue to be governed only by the Telecommunications
Act , the court said .
" Because ISPs ' sole involvement is to provide the mode of transmission , they have no control or input over the content made available to internet users by content producers and as a result , they are unable to take any steps to promote the policy described in the Broadcasting Act or its supporting provisions , " said the decision .
" Only those who ' transmit ' the ' program ' can contribute to the policy objectives . "
Groups from the creative community , including the Canadian Film and Television Production Association , the Alliance of Canadian Cinema , Television and Radio Artists and the Directors Guild of Canada , had previously asked the CRTC to force ISPs to contribute 2.5 per cent of their revenue to help fund new media creation .
ISPs opposed the plan and said they were merely conduits for content , and that any new fees would be passed on to customers .
Internet providers cheered the court 's decision .
Michael Hennessey , head of regulatory affairs at Telus , summed up his feelings in one word on Twitter : " Awesome . "
University of Ottawa internet law professor Michael Geist said the decision all but kills the plan to impose new charges on ISPs and their customers .
" The case is a huge win for the ISPs and — subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada or a legislative change — puts an end to the ISP levy proposal , " he wrote on his blog .
Most “ economists ” are n’t
I ’ve always thought that an economist is someone who understands opportunity cost .
If there is one thing a first - year undergraduate economics course should teach , it ’s an understanding of this concept .
So it ’s alarming to discover that most members of a sample drawn from participants in the profession ’s most important conference are not , at least by my definition , economists .
Via Harry Clarke , I found this paper by Paul Ferraro and Laura Taylor ( guest registration or subscription required ) .
Ferraro and Taylor presented their volunteer subjects with this question :
Please circle the best answer to the following question : ‘ You won a free ticket to see an Eric Clapton concert ( which has no resale value ) .
Bob Dylan is performing on the same night and is your next - best alternative .
Tickets to see Dylan cost $ 40 .
On any given day , you would be willing to pay up to $ 50 to see Dylan .
Assume there are no other costs of seeing either performer .
Based on this information , what is the opportunity cost of seeing Eric Clapton ? ( a ) $ 0
( b ) $ 10
( c ) $ 40
( d ) $ 50 .
Take some time to think before looking over the fold
The correct answer is ( b ) , the net value to you of buying a ticket and attending the Dylan concert , which is your next best alternative .
This is n’t the easiest of opportunity cost questions , and , in a first - year undergraduate exam , it would distinguish those who ’d really learned the concept from those who ’d memorised the definition .
Still it ’s not that difficult , and does n’t involve any tricky thinking about information as in ( say ) the Monty Hall problem ( it ’s adapted from the intro textbook of Frank and Bernanke ) .
Allowing for the fact that some people can get jobs in economics with a good technical training but no real understanding of economics [ 1 ] , I ’d have expected maybe 70 per cent of grad students or PhD qualified economists to get it right .
In the Ferraro and Taylor study , the proportion choosing ( b ) was 21.6 per cent , the least of any answer and worse than if everyone had picked at random .
Since presumably some people did choose at random , this suggests that less than 20 per cent of “ economists ” are actually economists , at least by my definition .
fn1 . I blame game theory myself , but then I always blame game theory .
And opportunity cost reasoning is just as essential to game theory as to economics , even if its role is not so explicit .
