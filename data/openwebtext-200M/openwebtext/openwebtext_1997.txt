He feeds off the desire to attain those goals while delivering exceptional performance .
He struggles along the way , but that does n’t stop him .
Instead , it encourages him more by learning from his shortcomings .

Therefore , to keep him away from such negativity , he needs to not neglect his happiness .
The modern man is also positive about the way he looks .

Eat a variety of foods

Eat plenty of foods rich in carbohydrates
To be productive at home and work , our bodies need enough energy to sustain it through the day .
That is why it ’s important to eat plenty of foods rich in carbohydrates which you can get from cereals , rice , pasta , and bread .
However , you need not bulk up a lot on these ; rather , portion your carbohydrates properly and eat more on those that will increase your fiber such as wholegrain foods .
Include carbs in every meal so you ’ll have enough energy to finish the tasks you ’ve planned for today .
Replaced saturated fats with unsaturated fats
Aside from carbohydrates , fats are also essential in providing nutrients to our body .
However , not all fat is good fat — too much can lead to weight gain and can affect your cardiovascular health .
We ca n’t avoid eating foods with fat because it ’s necessary to have it in the body but what you can do is replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat .
This can be done by reading the labels of products and foods when you go grocery shopping .
You can even replace some meals with fish instead of meat .
Instead of frying , you can consider cooking your meals through steaming , boiling or baking .
Fruits and vegetables
Fruits and vegetables are crucial in providing enough vitamins , minerals , and fiber your body needs .
If you ’re not a big fan of vegetables , you can opt to start small by pairing it with some meat in every meal .
That way , you do n’t upset yourself with every single bite .
In time , your body and taste buds will get used to it .
A glass of fresh fruit juice can also provide some nutrients which you can do with the help of a juicer or squeezer .
Portion your food

However , too much of it will have negative effects on your health and body that is why you need to portion the amounts of food you eat .
It does n’t mean that you should skip a meal or do it because it will backfire into overeating .
Instead , pay attention to how much you consume in terms of calories , needed carbohydrates , fats , and fiber .
You can plan your meals and use smaller serving plates to portion your meals .
Exercise
It ’s time to get physical and burn those extra calories away .
It ’s difficult during the first few tries and your muscles will ache .
However , after a few weeks , you will notice the difference .
Exercising also helps with your heart and circulatory system .
You need not do an all - out workout for this .
You can go for a 20 - minute run or achieve 10,000 steps every day just by walking .
Keeping your body moving makes you active both physically and mentally to perform well .
Unhealthy Food That You Need To Kick Out Forever
You ca n’t help yourself once food cravings hit .
You ’ll suddenly have this uncontrollable desire to chow down on foods that feel good to the taste buds but are high in sugar .
If you want to live a healthier lifestyle , you need to kick out these kinds of foods .
Trust us , your body will thank you later .
Sugary Drinks
Just because it ’s just a drink does n’t negate the fact that it ’s added calories .
Too much sugar intake can lead to a lot of weight gain .
Other effects would be fatty liver complications that will result in diabetes and heart disease .
To avoid such results , just plain old water , soda water , black coffee , and tea are much healthier alternatives to sugary drinks .
Pizza
Commercial pizzas are considered unhealthy because of highly refined dough and toppings that are heavily processed ; not to mention the high caloric intake per slice as well .
A healthier alternative would be to make your pizza using homegrown or wholesome ingredients that are fresh and healthy .
White Bread
White bread can be healthy but just not in large amounts .
Consuming a lot of white bread may increase your blood sugar because it ’s low in fiber and other essential nutrients that your body needs .
White bread also has a lot of gluten and carbs .
If you ’re looking for a substitute , wheat bread is the way to go .
Fried , Grilled and Broiled Foods
The way you cook your food also affects the food you eat because they add more oils and unhealthy chemicals to your body .
Yes , they make food tastier and palatable , but not all good things mean they are good for your health .
Instead , other cooking methods such as boiling , stewing , blanching and steaming help keep the food ’s nutrients intact for your body to absorb better .
Pastries , Cookies , and Cakes
Sometimes , even the sweetest things can turn sour and by this , we mean that the sugary sweets you consume may lead you to have diabetes in the future .
These sugary sweets are made from refined sugar , wheat flour , and some additional fat like shortening .
They do n’t contain all the nutrients your body needs and only pile on the calories .
Yogurt , fresh fruit , and dark chocolate are healthier alternatives for your sweet tooth .
Kitchen Must - Haves You Need For Your Lifestyle Diet
Food should not be a mundane journey to a healthier you .
There are so many things you can experiment on with food and since we live in an innovative time , the way food is prepared has certainly evolved over the years .
With these food hacks and tricks , you can establish a consistent and fun diet that will get you going until you reach your goal .
Vegetable Chopper
Chopping veggies has never been this easy .
Instead of chewing them up with your teeth , you can now enjoy bite - sized or finely chopped vegetables to enjoy your meal .
You ’ll be enjoying salads , salsas and many other dishes with this available in your kitchen .
Nuts and Dried Fruits
If snacking is your thing then a healthy alternative is just the work .
These heart - healthy snackers are enjoyable down to the last nibble when your stomach is rumbling for a quick fix .
You can choose from a variety of dried fruits and nuts that are low in sulfate but will fill up your tummy with antioxidant fruits and protein - rich nuts .
Meal Prep Containers
We know you need to portion your meals according to your calorie - counted diet , so if you want to start your week right , prepping your meals beforehand will surely keep you on track .
With the use of meal prep containers , you can keep your portions under control while at the same time storing your meals in these durable and highly sealed containers to keep them fresh and yummy .
Juicer Machine
Help yourself to some healthy juice made from the comfort of your own home .
In just seconds , a whole fruit is squeezed into a thirst - quenching juice drink to give your body the nutrients it needs .
Clean Eating Books
The road to a healthy lifestyle with food and drinks will be a tough one .
The challenge will be new to your body and it will have to adjust to your new diet for a while .
Reading about clean eating can guide and educate you in your journey to a healthier you .
CONCLUSION
Now that we ’ve covered the different aspects of the modern men ’s lifestyle , you can see that he is the kind of man that takes care of himself .
Not only does he value his physical health but also his mental and social health as well .
He is driven towards success and that is why he is very focused on how he sees life and how he lives by it from what he drives , to what he eats , and to how he is willing to travel the world and gain more experience .
Now that is how you make a modern man out of you .
Half of the world 's human population is infected with Toxoplasma , parasites in the body — and the brain .
Remember that .
Toxoplasma gondii is a common parasite found in the guts of cats ; it sheds eggs that are picked up by rats and other animals that are eaten by cats .
Toxoplasma forms cysts in the bodies of the intermediate rat hosts , including in the brain .
Since cats do n't want to eat dead , decaying prey , Toxoplasma takes the evolutionarily sound course of being a " good " parasite , leaving the rats perfectly healthy .
Or are they ?
Oxford scientists discovered that the minds of the infected rats have been subtly altered .
In a series of experiments , they demonstrated that healthy rats will prudently avoid areas that have been doused with cat urine .
In fact , when scientists test anti-anxiety drugs on rats , they use a whiff of cat urine to induce neurochemical panic .
However , it turns out that Toxoplasma - ridden rats show no such reaction .
In fact , some of the infected rats actually seek out the cat urine - marked areas again and again .
The parasite alters the mind ( and thus the behavior ) of the rat for its own benefit .
If the parasite can alter rat behavior , does it have any effect on humans ?
Dr. E. Fuller Torrey ( Associate Director for Laboratory Research at the Stanley Medical Research Institute ) noticed links between Toxoplasma and schizophrenia in human beings , approximately three billion of whom are infected with T. gondii :
Toxoplasma infection is associated with damage to astrocytes , glial cells which surround and support neurons .
Schizophrenia is also associated with damage to astrocytes .
Pregnant women with high levels of antibodies to Toxoplasma are more likely to give birth to children who will develop schizophrenia .
Human cells raised in petri dishes , and infected with Toxoplasma , will respond to drugs like haloperidol ; the growth of the parasite stops .
Haloperidol is an antipsychotic , used to treat schizophrenia .
Dr. Torrey got together with the Oxford scientists , to see if anything could be done about those parasite - controlled rats that were driven to hang around cat urine - soaked corners ( waiting for cats ) .
According to a recent press release , haloperidol restores the rat 's healthy fear of cat urine .
In fact , antipsychotic drugs were as effective as pyrimethamine , a drug that specifically eliminates Toxoplasma .
Are parasites like Toxoplasma subtly altering human behavior ?
As it turns out , science fiction writers have been thinking about whether or not parasites could alter a human being 's behavior , or even take control of a person .
In his 1951 novel The Puppet Masters , Robert Heinlein wrote about alien parasites the size of dinner plates that took control of the minds of their hosts , flooding their brains with neurochemicals .
In this excerpt , a volunteer strapped to a chair allows a parasite to be introduced ; the parasite rides him , taking over his mind .
Under these conditions , it is possible to interview the parasite ; however , it refuses to answer until zapped with a cattle prod .
He reached past my shoulders with a rod .
I felt a shocking , unbearable pain .
The room blacked out as if a switch had been thrown ..
I was split apart by it ; for the moment I was masterless .
The pain left , leaving only its searing memory behind .
Before I could speak , or even think coherently for myself , the splitting away had ended and I was again safe in the arms of my master ...
The panic that possessed me washed away ; I was again filled with an unworried sense of well being ...
" What are you ? "
" We are the people ...
We have studied you and we know your ways ...
We come , " I went on , " to bring you peace .. and contentment - and the joy of - of surrender . "
I hesitated again ; " surrender " was not the right word .
I struggled with it the way one struggles with a poorly grasped foreign language .
" The joy , " I repeated , " - the joy of . . . nirvana . "
That was it ; the word fitted .
I felt like a dog being patted for fetching a stick ; I wriggled with pleasure .
Still not sure that parasites can manipulate the behavior of host organisms ?
Consider these other cases :
The lancet fluke Dicrocoelium dendriticum forces its ant host to attach to the tips of grass blades , the easier to be eaten .
The fluke needs to get into the gut of a grazing animal to complete its life cycle .
The fluke Euhaplorchis californiensis causes fish to shimmy and jump so wading birds will grab them and eat them , for the same reason .
Hairworms , which live inside grasshoppers , sabotage the grasshopper 's central nervous system , forcing them to jump into pools of water , drowning themselves .
Hairworms then swim away from their hapless hosts to continue their life cycle .
Not all science - fictional parasites are harmful ; read about the Crosswell tapeworm from Brian Aldiss ' 1969 story Super - Toys Last All Summer Long ( the basis for the Kubrick / Spielberg film AI ) , which keeps people who overeat from becoming obese .
Not to mention robots based on parasites .

NEVADA , Iowa , Oct. 3 — Twenty - four minutes after he began speaking in a small restaurant the other day , Fred D. Thompson brought his remarks to a close with a nod of his head and an expression of thanks to Iowans for allowing him to “ give my thoughts about some things . ”
Then he stood face to face with a silent audience .
“ Can I have a round of applause ? ” Mr. Thompson said , drawing a rustle of clapping and some laughter .
“ Well , I had to drag that out of you , ” he said .
Mr. Thompson is a former United States senator , television actor and Watergate investigator .
His entry into the presidential race was highly anticipated by many Republicans , who saw or hoped to see in him outsized political talent and a commitment to conservatism that would enliven a Republican field that many found lacking .
But as Mr. Thompson campaigned across Iowa this week , he was something other than the dynamic presence that some in his party have been yearning for .
Iowans saw a candidate who is subdued and sonorous , a laconic presence who spoke in soft monotone , threw few elbows and displayed little drive to distinguish himself from his opponents .
The War on the Unexpected
We ’ve opened up a new front on the war on terror .
It ’s an attack on the unique , the unorthodox , the unexpected ; it ’s a war on different .
If you act different , you might find yourself investigated , questioned , and even arrested — even if you did nothing wrong , and had no intention of doing anything wrong .
The problem is a combination of citizen informants and a CYA attitude among police that results in a knee - jerk escalation of reported threats .
This is n’t the way counterterrorism is supposed to work , but it ’s happening everywhere .
It ’s a result of our relentless campaign to convince ordinary citizens that they ’re the front line of terrorism defense .
“ If you see something , say something ” is how the ads read in the New York City subways .
“ If you suspect something , report it ” urges another ad campaign in Manchester , UK .
The Michigan State Police have a seven - minute video .
Administration officials from then - attorney general John Ashcroft to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff to President Bush have asked us all to report any suspicious activity .
The problem is that ordinary citizens do n’t know what a real terrorist threat looks like .
They ca n’t tell the difference between a bomb and a tape dispenser , electronic name badge , CD player , bat detector , or trash sculpture ; or the difference between terrorist plotters and imams , musicians , or architects .
All they know is that something makes them uneasy , usually based on fear , media hype , or just something being different .
Even worse : after someone reports a “ terrorist threat , ” the whole system is biased towards escalation and CYA instead of a more realistic threat assessment .
Watch how it happens .
Someone sees something , so he says something .
The person he says it to — a policeman , a security guard , a flight attendant — now faces a choice : ignore or escalate .
Even though he may believe that it ’s a false alarm , it ’s not in his best interests to dismiss the threat .
If he ’s wrong , it ’ll cost him his career .
But if he escalates , he ’ll be praised for “ doing his job ” and the cost will be borne by others .
So he escalates .
And the person he escalates to also escalates , in a series of CYA decisions .
And before we ’re done , innocent people have been arrested , airports have been evacuated , and hundreds of police hours have been wasted .
This story has been repeated endlessly , both in the U.S. and in other countries .
Someone — these are all real — notices a funny smell , or some white powder , or two people passing an envelope , or a dark - skinned man leaving boxes at the curb , or a cell phone in an airplane seat ; the police cordon off the area , make arrests , and / or evacuate airplanes ; and in the end the cause of the alarm is revealed as a pot of Thai chili sauce , or flour , or a utility bill , or an English professor recycling , or a cell phone in an airplane seat .
Of course , by then it ’s too late for the authorities to admit that they made a mistake and overreacted , that a sane voice of reason at some level should have prevailed .
What follows is the parade of police and elected officials praising each other for doing a great job , and prosecuting the poor victim — the person who was different in the first place — for having the temerity to try to trick them .
For some reason , governments are encouraging this kind of behavior .
It ’s not just the publicity campaigns asking people to come forward and snitch on their neighbors ; they ’re asking certain professions to pay particular attention : truckers to watch the highways , students to watch campuses , and scuba instructors to watch their students .
The U.S. wanted meter readers and telephone repairmen to snoop around houses .
There ’s even a new law protecting people who turn in their travel mates based on some undefined “ objectively reasonable suspicion , ” whatever that is .
If you ask amateurs to act as front - line security personnel , you should n’t be surprised when you get amateur security .
We need to do two things .
The first is to stop urging people to report their fears .
People have always come forward to tell the police when they see something genuinely suspicious , and should continue to do so .
But encouraging people to raise an alarm every time they ’re spooked only squanders our security resources and makes no one safer .
We do n’t want people to never report anything .
A store clerk ’s tip led to the unraveling of a plot to attack Fort Dix last May , and in March an alert Southern California woman foiled a kidnapping by calling the police about a suspicious man carting around a person - sized crate .
But these incidents only reinforce the need to realistically assess , not automatically escalate , citizen tips .
In criminal matters , law enforcement is experienced in separating legitimate tips from unsubstantiated fears , and allocating resources accordingly ; we should expect no less from them when it comes to terrorism .
Equally important , politicians need to stop praising and promoting the officers who get it wrong .
And everyone needs to stop castigating , and prosecuting , the victims just because they embarrassed the police by their innocence .
Causing a city - wide panic over blinking signs , a guy with a pellet gun , or stray backpacks , is not evidence of doing a good job : it ’s evidence of squandering police resources .
Even worse , it causes its own form of terror , and encourages people to be even more alarmist in the future .
We need to spend our resources on things that actually make us safer , not on chasing down and trumpeting every paranoid threat anyone can come up with .
This essay originally appeared on Wired.com .
EDITED TO ADD ( 11/1 ) : Some links did n’t make it into the original article .
There ’s this creepy “ if you see a father holding his child ’s hands , call the cops ” campaign , this story of an iPod found on an airplane , and this story of an “ improvised electronics device ” trying to get through airport security .
This is a good essay on the “ war on electronics . ”
EDITED TO ADD ( 11/25 ) : More examples of rediculous non-terrorism overreactions , and a story about recruiting firefighters to snoop around in peoples ’ houses :
Unlike police , firefighters and emergency medical personnel do n’t need warrants to access hundreds of thousands of homes and buildings each year , putting them in a position to spot behavior that could indicate terrorist activity or planning .

This analysis looks at how existing oil fields are apparently declining , and finds a trend suggesting those declines are worsening , though the reasons for this are not clear yet .
Note :
In the course of preparing this piece , there was a lot of back - and - forth on the Oil Drum editors - and - contributors list , and Khebab and I realized we were working on related analyses with broadly similar conclusions , and agreed to publish them on the same day .
I encourage you to read his piece also .
I began this post because JD of Peak Oil Debunked has recently reemerged from voluntary retirement ( possibly as a result of near $ 100 oil ) and was tweaking me about an old piece of mine from two years ago .
That analysis looked at several pieces of evidence for a " decline rate " at 8 % ( probably not all the same kind of decline rate ) and pointed out the scenario of adding known new capacity to an 8 % decline rate in existing production would be a bad thing .
JD notes that production since then has n't declined as fast as that scenario suggested .
I think he 's making the piece out to have taken a much more certain position than it really took ( it was a scenario , not a forecast , and I plotted several others ) .
Nonetheless , the tone of the piece now reads to me as too gleefully " Is n't this scary ? "
That is a fault I resolve to try and avoid in future .
I pretty much decided that whole style of bottom - up megaproject analysis was not very useful around that time after this look at Saudi megaprojects and production .
But , we know far more than we did in November 2005 and it seems to me that there are now interesting insights to be had from looking at the megaprojects and the various decline rates they imply .
In particular , one of the biggest things we know now that we did n't know then is that global oil production has been close to flat during that time , as prices have continued to go up and up .
The latest publicly available data looks like this :
Average daily total liquid production , by month , from EIA ( green ) and IEA ( plum ) , together with 13 month centered moving averages of each line , recursed once ( LHS ) .
WTI spot price ( blue - RHS ) .
Click to enlarge .
Graphs are not zero - scaled .
Source : IEA Oil Market Reports , and EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.4 .
The IEA line is taken from Table 3 of the tables section at the back of the OMR in the last issue for which the number for that month is given .
WTI spot price is from the EIA with November estimated from average of daily figures available so far .
As you can see the EIA , once you smooth out the month to month noise , shows global liquid fuel production as essentially flat since mid 2005 .
The IEA shows production continuing to increase to late 2006 , but being flat for the last year .
Since the world economy has been mostly healthy during that time , the price of oil has skyrocketed .
It 's less than six years ago that oil was still below $ 20 , but it 's now over $ 90 .
Obviously , we 'd very much like to know what the future holds .
One of the central factors in the future of oil production is the ability of the oil industry to bring on new capacity .
Economists generally believe that industry will respond to a period of high prices by bringing more supply to market , albeit with some lag since oil industry projects are large complex undertakings that take a number of years from inception to actual oil flowing into tankers .
A number of people attempt to enumerate such projects , and the best known of the enumerations that 's actually publicly available is a series by Chris Skrebowski , a long time oil market analyst and editor of Petroleum Review .
The reports each consist of a list of the projects with name , the year of first oil production , and the peak flow of liquid fuel expected from that project .
The reports in some cases have a tabulation of the new capacity , and conclude with some commentary on the implications for future oil supply .
What 's very interesting is that we now have four versions of Skrebowski's megaproject report , which gives us a much better ability to analyze trends .
The four I can find publicly available on the Internet are these :
After the date of the report , I 've noted the cutoff of minimum size of project included in the list .
This has changed over time , which is one source of methodological difference between the reports .
I 'll explore it further in a moment .
But I think the best way to get a quick feeling for the trends is the following graph ( based on an idea from Euan Mearns ) .
It shows the total amount of peak capacity anticipated to start production in each year , and does so for all four reports .
I have stopped the graph at 2010 , as the timeframe of interest in today 's analysis does not go past that .
New oil liquids capacity 2003 - 2010 as estimated from four different Skrebowski megaprojects reports : Jan 2004 , Oct 2005 , April 2006 , and Feb 2007 .
Data are from tabulations in reports , except from Jan 2004 report where projects were summed by this author .
Hat tip to Euan Mearns for the idea of plotting this data this way .
I think two points emerge clearly from this graph .
Firstly , megaproject analysis at present gets increasingly inaccurate after a year or two .
If you look at the years 2007 - 2009 , the various reports are in fairly significant disagreement about how much oil is going to come on stream in that year .
On the other hand , if you look at 2005 and 2006 , the 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 reports are in fair agreement .
So there seems to be a process in which the lists are fairly inaccurate several years out , but converge to a stable answer as we get to reporting on this year or next .
In the early years , 2003 to 2005 , when oil prices were lower , project totals tended to drop from the first estimate .
In recent and future years , project totals tend to grow with each passing report .
It may be in part that transparency in the industry is improving .
However , it also seems likely that high prices are causing additional capacity to materialize .
The other notable trend in the graph above is that it 's rising strongly - starting out at just over 1 mbd of new megaprojects coming on stream in 2003 , we rise to over 5 mbd of new projects currently anticipated in 2009 .
The overall trend is that new capacity per year is itself increasing at a little less than 1 mbd each year .
It 's hard to believe that this is n't a response to the high prices of the last few years .
I want to stress an important caveat before we move on .
The megaproject reports give the estimated peak flow from a project , but place it in the year in which it first delivers any oil .
It 's very likely that the production does not reach the peak value on day one , but instead ramps up over a period of months or even years .
For an example , look at the front side of the curve on this originally planned production curve for the White Rose field in Canada :
Originally planned production profile for White Rose oil field , Canada .
Source : Offshore Technology Magazine
However , in almost all cases , we have no information about the shape of the production profile of a new field project : just the date of first oil and the peak flow .
Thus we must adopt some convention of how to treat the dating of the flows , but this will inevitably introduce some error into any analysis , and we will need an argument that our conclusions are not obviated by any such error .
I would like to deal with another potential caveat , here , which is the changing size of the limit in the different megaproject reports .
Is this an important contaminating effect ?
To analyze this , I looked at the amount of capacity in the 2007 report , which with a 40 kbd limit is the most comprehensive .
I looked at the projects only through 2010 ( to limit the degree to which far off years might miss more small projects than big ones ) , and analyzed the fraction of capacity that would have been missed with the 2006 limit ( 50kbd ) , the 2005 project limit ( 75 kbd ) , and the 2004 project limit ( 100kbd ) .
Analysis of capacity in the Feb 2007 megaprojects report by size grade ( projects through 2010 only ) .
40 - 49kbd projects would only be included in 2007 .
Projects above 50 kbd would be included in the 2006 report also .
Projects above 75 kbd would have been included in the 2005 report .
Projects of 100 kbd and up would have met the criteria for all reports .
It turns out that the 2007 criteria would only increase capacity by 1 % over the 2006 criteria , and only by 5 % over the 2005 criteria .
Thus the change in size grade is a minor contribution to the growth in tabulated capacity from report to report .
Indeed , more generally , small fields are probably not a massive contribution to capacity .
I plotted the same list of fields in a histogram of the amount of capacity being added by each size grade of projects ( in 50 kbd wide bins ) , and then computed the cumulative density function from that .
Both are shown here :
Analysis of capacity in the Feb 2007 megaprojects report by size grade ( projects through 2010 only ) .
Top panel shows histogram of capacity by project size in 50 kbd bins .
Lower panel shows cumulative density function of capacity by project size .
Note the last bin on the left will be underestimated since report only includes projects over 40 kbd .
You can see that the left hand side of the distribution is trailing off sharply , and it's not very likely that the fact that the distribution has been cut off on the low side at 40 kbd has missed a huge fraction of capacity .
Before we dive into further detail , let me summarize the two qualitative facts that drive the analysis presented here .
I claim :
Global oil production has been recently flat .
New oil capacity brought on stream each year is rising rapidly .
Keep those in mind as we go forward .
Even if you disagree with me in detail here and there , I think that if you accept those two facts as basically fair descriptions of the big picture , you 'll end up being forced to accept some version of my conclusion .
To preview my argument , essentially I 'm going to say that since more and more capacity is coming on stream each year , but is only succeeding in keeping production flat , the other things that affect production , besides new tabulated megaprojects , must be getting steadily worse .
Let 's now drill into those facts in more quantitative detail , and you can see whether you are persuaded or not .
I first want to look much more carefully at the flattening of global production .
This implies that the rate of change of production over time has been getting lower .
To assess this , I looked at four different data series .
The reason for this is that different agencies and organizations disagree on the amount of oil produced each month .
Additionally , it 's possible to focus on narrower or broader definitions of oil ( whether or not to include very light liquids known as condensate , compounds that condense out of natural gas ( called NGLs ) , production from tar sands , biofuels etc ) .
I generally prefer only to draw conclusions which are not too sensitive to exactly which definition or series we look at .
An effect seen only in one series is probably not very robust .
Similarly , I do n't like to be too dependent on the values in any particular month ( since month - to - month production jumps around noisily ) , so I like to use some kind of average or trend - fitting as well .
The four global production series used in this analysis are shown as follows from Jan 2004 to the most recent month available publicly :
Average daily total liquid production , by month , from EIA Table 1.4 liquids ( green ) , IEA Table 3 all liquids ( plum ) , EIA Table 1.1 Crude plus Condensate ( teal ) , and Oil and Gas Journal crude oil ( blue ) , together with separate linear fits within each year for each series .
Click to enlarge .
Graph is not zero - scaled .
Source : IEA Oil Market Reports , EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1 and 1.4 , and Oil and Gas Journal .
The IEA line is taken from Table 3 of the tables section at the back of the OMR in the last issue for which the number for that month is given .
Since I 'm interested in rates of change , and how the rate of change is changing I 've also shown a linear trend for each series : I constructed a separate trend for each year .
As you can see , the series vary a little bit in their degree of optimism / pessimism .
The IEA total liquids series is the one that has been the most optimistic , and the EIA crude plus condensate series is the one that looks most like it 's already declining .
The other two are somewhere in between .
From that graph , I computed the next one , which shows an estimate for the rate of change of each production series over time .
I constructed estimates in two ways .
At year boundaries , I took the year on year change .
At mid-years , I used the slope of the straight line fit in that year .
Annualized change in production for four oil data series referenced previously .
The values at year boundaries are computed by differencing the forward year from the backward year .
The values at year middle are computed from the slopes of the regression lines .
Error bars are estimated from the spreads of the values for the difference series , and are rough .
Graph is not zero - scaled .
Click to enlarge .
As you can see , although the various series have some spread in their estimates , there 's little doubt that the rate of change headed rapidly to around zero by mid 2005 , and has since been hovering close to zero , but probably declining further at a slower rate .
I have also shown on the graph an average of the different rates of change , and an error bar for that average .
I will use small font for somewhat more technical points that some readers may prefer to skip .
The error bars are computed as the standard error derived from the four data points shown at each year and half - year .
These are not really statistical estimates , since the four data series are not random picks from some population , but rather different ways of defining oil and estimating the amount of it produced .
Nonetheless , if one thinks of these as more or less random picks from the abstract ensemble of reasonable procedures for analyzing this problem , I think the error bars are still meaningful for making rough estimates of the amount of uncertainty that can be imputed to our trends , and thus whether or not I have proven my conclusions adequately .
So with that , we can now compare the decelerating production with the accelerating new capacity on one chart .
This next shows the same production change as in the last chart , except I dropped the estimates from the original series , keeping just the average and the error bar .
Additionally , I introduced the amount of new megaproject capacity that is tabulated for each year .
Megaproject capacity for each year is taken from the latest report that has a figure for that year .
Capacity is credited at the end of the year it came on stream - thus the data point at 2004.0 is the 2003 megaproject capacity ( taken from the 2004 report ) .
Error bars are computed by taking the spread of the different reports in each year , and then using an RMS average to pool all years into a standard error bar .
As before , this should be taken as a useful rough indication of the general level of uncertainty in the problem , but not a precise statistical statement .
It may seem that this overstates the error bar , since earlier reports presumably have much less accurate tabulations than later ones .
However , given the potential issues with slow ramp up of flows , I prefer to leave them as large as they are .
It is possible that the entire megaproject capacity curve would really be shifted somewhat to the left or right if we fully understood the ramp - up profiles .
However , it seems hard to believe that the basic shape of it being a rapid rise would be erased .

This graph fleshes out and makes more quantitative my basic claim that production has been flattening at the same time that new capacity is increasing .
The implication of this is that the trends in things happening to production other than new capacity must be worsening .
Before we look at the specifics of that , let 's talk a little bit about terminology , since there is enormous potential for confusion here .
As soon as we start talking about decline rates , people mean at least three different things that it 's important we distinguish .
Firstly , if we were to watch production for a median oil well somewhere in a median oil field , and did n't do anything to it except fix mechanical breakdowns in the operation , chances are that its production would be somewhat less over time .
This would take many different forms - perhaps water would break through some strata in the rock into the well , perhaps pressure in the field would drop , perhaps the rock pores close to the well would become more clogged .
In an individual well , these various decline processes would be quite random and non-uniform .
However , if we imagine the thought experiment of doing this with all the oil wells in the world , or in some particular region of interest , presumably there would be some statistical averaging , and we could get an average rate of decline for the wells .
Some wells would be in good rock with a thick oil layer , and would barely decline at all .
Others might have a massive water breakthrough and experience almost 100 % decline .
But on average , there would be a certain percentage decline rate .
We might expect this to increase over time , as more of the world 's production assets are in a more mature state and more prone to problems of all types , but I 'm not aware of any work quantifying this increase .
Let 's call this quantity the petrophysical decline rate : the average rate at which well production would decline on an annual percentage basis if no corrective action were taken .
Now , in reality , the world 's oilfield operators are busy taking corrective actions of all kinds .
Wells are worked over or stimulated , water is shut - off down hole in various ways , new wells are drilled between the old ones , new zones are perforated that had previously been ignored , etc , etc .
So when we take a fixed collection of fields that have been developed at some date , the average change in their production will be different than the petrophysical decline rate .
Additionally , a variety of things affect production that are not directly related to oilfield operations , but affect them .
Weather causes shutdowns of facilities , as do fires , accidents , earthquakes , revolutions , societal collapses , wars , and the operation of economics .
In particular , the latter means that sometimes operators may deliberately shut in productive capacity and then sometimes they may turn on that capacity again .
Furthermore , the diligence with which they go about fixing up their oilfields and trying to offset petrophysical declines will be influenced by oil prices , and perceptions thereof .
Thus when we take a fixed set of oil fields and look at the change in it over time , there are a large number of factors that go into it , which we cannot easily separate out .
The petrophysical decline rate is only one of them - though certainly an important one .
So let 's call give this quantity a name too :
The base production growth / decline rate is the annualized percentage change in the production of some set of currently operating oilfields of interest due to all causes .
There is one more rate of change which interests us .
After the base production has done whatever it has done , the world ( or some region ) adds on new capacity in new fields , or previously undeveloped areas of existing fields large enough to be identifiable as separate new capacity projects .
It is this activity that the megaproject lists attempt to capture .
After the new capacity has been added onto the underlying base production of existing fields , we find out whether this was enough to grow production , or if in fact production declined .
So we define :
The net growth / decline rate is the annualized percentage change in the production of oil from all sources in the world , or some region of interest .
This last decline rate is the one society really cares about .
In my view it 's the central thing that controls how easily society can adapt to the peaking of global oil supply , and it is the one that Hubbert linearization says should worsen only very slowly .
However , the base production growth / decline rate is also of considerable interest , because it 's directly related to the net growth / decline rate via the new capacity .
So the worse the base production fares , the more new capacity is required to make up the difference .
The petrophysical decline rate would be of great interest too , but , as far as I know , we have no public data with which to assess it .
However , we can infer the base decline rate because we have public estimates of new capacity and also of production changes .
So let 's do that .
Taking the estimates I showed in the last graph for production change and new capacity one can compute the base production growth / decline rate over time via
and here it is :
Average percentage change annually in global base production ( prior to new capacity enumerated in megaproject lists ) .
See text for details .
Graph is not zero - scaled .
Click to enlarge .
It does n't really matter which series one uses to estimate production here , since the differences between them are proportionately much smaller than the other uncertainties in the problem , but I happened to divide by the EIA all liquids .
Megaproject capacity totals are interpolated linearly to the mid-year points , so the mid-year points are not fully independent of the year - end points ( the production change estimates are independent , however ) .
So , this graph summarizes quantitatively what I 've been talking about above .
Flat production in the face of increasing new capacity means that the base production must be doing worse and worse .
And indeed we see that base production has gone from increasing at over 2 % per year at the beginning of 2004 , to now decreasing at about 5 % per year .
And the trend has been close to linear over these ( almost ) four years - the base production growth / decline rate gets worse at about 2 % ( percentage points ) per year .
Now , I should emphasize here that it is not at all clear , at least to me , why this is happening .
Given the way I 've defined my terms , I 'm very confident that it is happening ( notice the trend is much larger than the error bars ) .
But what it means is less certain .
In particular , why this should be anything like a straight line is quite unclear .
I think most of this discussion will have to happen another time , but it 's worth making one point now .
The increases in base production in 2004 were due in large measure to the deployment of previously spare Saudi capacity , and also the Russian revival , ( which has largely not shown up as projects on the megaproject lists ) .
These increases were large enough to overcome petrophysical declines and even increase base production .
However , Saudi Arabia subsequently began to decline , and then has been roughly flat this year .
Russia has continued to increase , but more and more slowly .
So these things cannot explain most of the more recent acceleration in base decline .
Here are some other candidate hypotheses we might consider :
The petrophysical decline rate is worsening as some significant fraction of the world 's production base is getting more mature and running into serious problems .
The increase in megaprojects , and general cost inflation , is putting enough strain on industry capacity that routine maintenance operations are harder , and so it is more difficult to do the necessary work to offset petrophysical declines .
War / revolution / accident / weather / etc factors have been worsening significantly during these four years .
Some parties are keeping increasingly large amounts of production off the market deliberately ( and secretly ) .
Given that it 's presently mysterious why the base production decline is worsening , it 's hard to say for sure whether we should yield to the temptation to extrapolate that straight line further into the future .
Obviously , continued degradation in that quantity would be negative for the world economy , since at some point there just would n't be enough new projects to keep up with it .
To explore the space of possibilities , this final graph presents four scenarios for total liquids production through the end of 2009 .
Average daily total liquid production , by month , from EIA Table 1.4 liquids ( green ) , with moving average through August 2007 .
Also , three scenarios ( not forecasts ) illustrating ( red ) case of continued acceleration in base production declines with megaprojects as in 2007 report , ( orange ) an extra 1 mbd of projects in 2008 and 2mbd of projects in 2009 over and above report , and ( green ) extra projects as in orange scenario , plus base change rate stops accelerating and stays at current - 5.5 % value .
The red curve assumes that a ) the acceleration continues , with the same linear worsening of the base production decline rate , and b ) new capacity comes on exactly as the 2007 megaproject report shows .
As you can see , those assumptions cause the loss of about 5 mbd over the next two and a bit years of production ( about a 2 1/2 % net decline rate ) .
The orange curve assumes that a ) the acceleration continues as with the red curve , but , noting that the megaproject lists have been tending to grow with time lately , also assumes b ) that 2008 new capacity is 1 mbd more than the megaproject list , and that 2009 is 2 mbd more .
That leads to a net decline of closer to 1 % per year .
The blue curve assumes that a ) the acceleration stops , and base decline remains at the current 5.5 % per year , b ) new capacity comes on exactly as the 2007 megaproject report shows .
That leads to a net decline of a little less than 1/2 % / year .
Finally , the green curve makes the same assumptions about boosted new capacity as the orange curve , but like the blue curve supposes that the accelerating base decline stops , and decline stays at a fixed 5.5 % rate .
As you can see , that is enough to cause net production to grow , and postpone peak oil for some time longer .
Overall , while there remains a lot of uncertainty , seeing this acceleration of base declines makes me lean a little further in the direction that the Russian situation of slowing production increases in the face of greatly increased rig counts also hinted at .
Specifically , it suggests that perhaps by sometime in 2008 we will have unambiguous declines in total liquids production , rather than continued plateau .
I 'm not certain at this point , but that 's the direction I lean .
Marghi Dutton is 90 and losing her eyesight , but nothing was going to stop her from trekking to midspan of the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday with the anti-war group Code Pink : Women for Peace .
She joined a crowd of about 100 demonstrators dressed in hot pink hats , shirts and scarves and fought the wind to raise her sign : “ Impeach Bush and Cheney ! ”
“ My arms are aching , but I ’m getting energy from the drivers – so many are honking in support , ” she said .
Code Pink , a national grassroots peace movement inspired by Bay Area women , organized the protest to call for an immediate end to the war in Iraq and immediate impeachment proceedings against President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Protesters walked from the bridge to the Pacific Heights home of Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , set up camp , cooked one last carbohydrate - heavy meal and began a hunger strike .
About 40 gathered on some terraced steps near the senator ’s home , along with a half - dozen police officers .
“ We have about eight people who are going to stop eating , including me , ” Code Pink spokeswoman Nancy Mancias said .
On Wednesday , the group plans to relocate the hunger strike to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s home on Broadway , where they will urge the San Francisco Democrat to hold a town hall meeting with constituents .

I saw on reddit that today , January 10th , is Donald Knuth 's seventieth birthday .
Knuth is arguably the most famous living computer scientist , author of the seminal Art of Computer Programming series .
Here 's how serious Mr. Knuth is – his books are dedicated , not to his wife or a loved one , but to a computer :
This series of books is affectionately dedicated
to the Type 650 computer once installed at
Case Institute of Technology ,
in remembrance of many pleasant evenings .
Jeffrey Shallit compiled an excellent set of links commemorating the 70th birthday of this legendary figure :
The Genius of Donald Knuth : Typesetting with Boxes and Glue .
" I do n't know of any other software other than TeX implemented in the 1970s that remains absolutely and unquestionably dominant in its domain .
And the glue - and - boxes model of text layout was a piece of absolute genius - one of the most masterful examples of capturing an extremely complex problem using an extremely simple model .
It 's beautiful .
And it 's typical of the kind of thing that Knuth does . "
Opinion 86 " So Knuth is very right to worry about constants .
And he gets his hands dirty and does the coding all by himself , and he gave us such great programs as TeX , and its fully - detailed manuals .
He taught us by example the art of computer programming , and he modestly claims that it is art in the sense of the artisan rather than that of the artist .
But his perfect artisanship became the most refined of fine arts . "
Analyzing Algorithm X " Knuth was the first to use the phrase ' analysis of algorithms , ' at the 1970 ICM in Nice .
He popularized and extended O - notation ( previously used in functional analysis ) as an essential tool for algorithm analysis .
And his Art of Computer Programming set the standards for the field and is still well worth reading today . "
Volume 4 is already written ( in our hearts ) .
" But this being a lecture series , Knuth also fields questions from the audience about everything from sin and redemption to mathematical Platonism .
He has a habit of parrying all the really difficult questions with humor ; indeed , he does this so often one comes to suspect humor is his answer . "
difficult questions with humor ; indeed , he does this so often one comes to suspect humor his answer . "
Don Knuth is 70 " As a member of a community whose life is punctuated by twice - yearly conferences , what I find most inspiring about Knuth is his dedication to perfection , whatever time it might take to achieve it . "
Today is Knuth 's 70th birthday !!
" He was one of the first people to realize that an algorithm can be analysed in a mathematical and intelligent way without running it .
This is one of the most important starting points for computer science theory .
Perhaps even for computer science . "
Happy Birthday , Don Knuth !
" Don Knuth straddled both worlds effortlessly , gaining respect from 15 year old hackers and 50 year old researchers alike .
And that 's the most tremendous feat of all . "
Donald Knuth and Me : " Later , when I attended university , I began to understand Knuth 's wider influence .
Almost everywhere I turned , Knuth had been there before . "
For mainstream press coverage of Donald Knuth , Jeffrey recommends :
My very favorite thing about Mr. Knuth is that , despite the profound and enduring depth of his contributions to the field of computer science , he has a great sense of humor .
For proof , let 's go back in time .
Way , way back , to Mad Magazine # 33 , originally published in 1957 .
These images are from Absolutely Mad : 50 Years of Mad Magazine , a DVD - ROM containing ( almost ) every issue of Mad .
Surprisingly , the disc is n't encumbered by any bizarre DRM scheme ; every issue is a simple PDF file in a folder on the disc .
The resolution is n't as high as I would like , but I 'm not about to complain after paying thirty - three measly bucks for a nearly complete digital library of Mad .
( And now , even better , you can get extremely high resolution versions of early Mad Magazines from Comixology .
Sadly , it only goes up to issue # 23 at the moment . )
As a long time fan of Mad Magazine , I was delighted to discover that Donald Knuth contributed an article to Mad , " The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures " , while he was still in high school .
It 's a little difficult to read the introductory text that ties the article to Knuth , so I 'll quote it here .
When Milwaukee 's Donald Knuth first presented his revolutionary system of weights and measures to the members of the Wisconsin Academy of Science , Arts , and Letters , they were astounded ... mainly because Donald also has two heads .
All kidding aside , Donald 's system won first prize as the " most original presentation " .
So far , the system has been adopted in Tierra del Fuego , Afghanistan , and Southern Rhodesia .
The U.N. is considering it for world adoption .
This new system of measuring , which is destined to become the measuring system of the future , has decided improvements over the other systems now in use .
It is based on measurements taken 6 - 9 - 12 at the Physics Lab of Milwaukee Lutheran High School , in Milwaukee , Wis. , when the thickness of Mad Magazine # 26 was determined to be 2.263348517438173216473 mm .
This length is the basis for the entire system , and is called one potrzebie of length .
The Potrzebie has also been standardized at 3515.3502 wave lengths of the red line in the spectrum of cadmium .
A partial table of the Potrzebie System , the measuring system of the future , is given below .
I still subscribe to Mad Magazine ; the biting satire and political humor have n't aged a bit in the intervening fifty years .
I know it sounds crazy for a grown man to extol the virtues of what most charitably consider to be a kids ' humor rag .
But I 'm not the only one .
Just ask the Los Angeles Times ' Robert Boyd :
[ Mad Magazine ] instilled in me a habit of mind , a way of thinking about a world rife with false fronts , small print , deceptive ads , booby traps , treacherous language , double standards , half truths , subliminal pitches and product placements ; it warned me that I was often merely the target of people who claimed to be my friend ; it prompted me to mistrust authority , to read between the lines , to take nothing at face value , to see patterns in the often shoddy construction of movies and TV shows ; and it got me to think critically in a way that few actual humans charged with my care ever bothered to .
Programming algorithms are hard science , backed by some serious math .
Thanks for the reminder , Mr. Knuth , that computer science is indeed serious stuff , but it 's also a lot of fun .
Here 's to you – and to the enduring art of computer programming you introduced us all to .

Ahem .
Media Bloodhound is covering a fascinating breach of journalistic ethics .
ABC news discovered they could n't verify the credentials of their terrorism " analyst " Alexis Debat as having a degree from the Sorbonne , and it turned out he might have fabricated an interview with Barack Obama .
Perhaps most serious are questions as to when ABC was using Debat as an information source and when he was a reporter paid by the network .
It is clear that his producers loved some of the sensational stories he covered about " possible " post 9/11 terrorist plans .
It is also fact that Debat was on the payroll of ABC and a necon think tank at the same time .
[ Debat was ] quoted and used as a source for multiple post - 9/11 - related stories for the rest of 2001 and much of 2002 , finally officially earns the title “ ABC News consultant ” in addition to “ former French Defense Ministry official ” in a story about how Zacharias Moussaoui , the infamous “ 20th hijacker ” - according to “ French intelligence authorities , ” which in this case appears to be , well , Debat – was actually “ part of a second wave of suicide hijackings planned for early 2002 in Europe and the United States . ”

Is it any wonder that the blogs are taking over journalism ?
I can't imagine any blogger getting away with making up an interview with Barack Obama .
Blog readers would catch that before you could say " the audacity of hope . "
Perhaps viewers who get their news primarily from television are more passive and therefore have lower standards ?
Naah .
Update : Media Bloodhound has posted updated information on this story here ...
A Japanese - funded bridge under construction in southern Vietnam collapsed on Wednesday , killing up to 60 workers and injuring around 150 in the country 's worst such disaster .
A contractor with a Chinese company working on the bridge being built in Can Tho city said 60 people were killed .
State - run Vietnam TV said 48 casualties had been confirmed with scores unaccounted for .
One police officer reached by telephone said as many as 100 could be dead or missing .
President Bush endorsed Abu Risha on a recent visit
Abdul Sattar Abu Risha , 37 , led what was known as the " Anbar Awakening " , an alliance of Sunni Arab tribes that rose up against al - Qaeda in Iraq .
US President George Bush met and endorsed the sheikh last week in Iraq .
The White House , which has held up the movement in Anbar province as an example for the rest of Iraq , condemned his assassination as " an outrage " .
Later , President Bush is expected to announce that the US may pull some 30,000 US troops out of Iraq by the middle of next year - a move made possible partly by the progress in pacifying Anbar .
Abu Risha 's assassination will be a severe blow to the " Awakening " in Anbar , says the BBC's Hugh Sykes in Baghdad .
This is a spontaneous popular uprising against al - Qaeda , because , as you know , al - Qaeda killed our people
Abdul Sattar Abu Risha
US recruits Sunni volunteers Abdul Sattar Abu Risha
It may undermine the new movement against al - Qaeda in Iraq , he says , or it could strengthen resolve to resist the insurgents , who are regarded by an increasing number of people in Anbar as unwelcome invaders .
Abu Risha was killed , along with two bodyguards , by a roadside bomb planted near his home in Ramadi , the capital of Iraq 's western Anbar province .
" The sheikh 's car was totally destroyed by the explosion , " Ramadi police officer Ahmed Mahmoud al - Alwani told Reuters .
It has been reported that he was the number one target of al - Qaeda in Iraq , that several attempts had previously been made on his life , and that his father and at least one of his brothers were killed by insurgents .
Several top sheikhs in the same movement were killed in a bomb attack in Baghdad in June .
Al - Qaeda forced back
Abu Risha was the leader of the Anbar Salvation Council , also known as the Anbar Awakening , an alliance of clans which sided with US forces and the Iraqi government in order to try to reclaim Anbar province from al - Qaeda .
" This is a spontaneous popular uprising against al - Qaeda , because , as you know , al - Qaeda killed our people , " he told al - Arabiya TV this week .
Anbar province was once controlled by the insurgents , and was where they declared an " Islamic State of Iraq " .
It was one of the deadliest parts of Iraq for US troops .
But the tribal alliance managed to force the insurgents back and reduce violence in the province dramatically .
' Model ' for Iraq
The US held the group up as a success story and wants to use it as a template to organise Sunni tribes elsewhere .
Only on Monday , in his testimony to Congress , the top US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , said Anbar province showed how Iraq could throw off its violence and move forward .
" A year ago the province was assessed ' lost ' politically , " he said .
" Today , it is a model of what happens when local leaders and citizens decide to oppose al - Qaeda and reject its Taleban - like ideology . "
He said the number of attacks had fallen from 1,350 in the month of October last year to little more than 200 last month .
Abu Risha expressed the same sentiment only last week , saying : " I wish we could do in all the provinces of Iraq what we did in Anbar , which is that the people and the government come together . "

Local Pakistani TV shows video image of Bhutto assassins
Although rumors circulated about the exact cause of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 's death , local television reporters may have cleared up the details .
Dawn Network , a local Pakistani media outlet , just released still frame pictures of who they believe is the bomber and shooter that assassinated Bhutto .
According to Fox News , who aired the footage , the shooter is a male , aged 22 - 27 , and wearing dark sunglasses .
In the grainy , but visible pictures , one can see him holding a gun up to the officials head .
" We saw so many people at the rally holding their phones up and taking pictures of the event , " said a Fox News correspondent , " that it was bound to happen that somehow they would go and check those photos and see that they have , in fact , captured the moment she was shot . "
The photos might give clear evidence to Bhutto supporters , who claimed the government of President Pervez Musharraf mislead the public about cause of death as a way to divert attention away from the attack .
" Now that they have a photograph of the actual killer , " says Fox News , " it 's going to be a lot easier for them to trace who ... is behind the attack . "

When the government does not allow prices to float in real time in response to changes in supply and demand , then gluts and shortages are inevitable .
When shortages occur , due to prices that are capped or not allowed to move upwards sufficiently quickly , queues and / or spot shortages occur .
When the government decides it does not like this , the jack - booted thugs step in and we have government - enforced rationing .
California , famous for its stupidity in letting wholesale electricity prices float while capping retail prices and thus creating an economic disaster several years ago , is at it again in the electricity market :
What should be controversial in the proposed revisions to Title 24 is
the requirement for what is called a " programmable communicating
thermostat " or PCT .
Every new home and every change to existing homes '
central heating and air conditioning systems will required to be fitted
with a PCT beginning next year following the issuance of the revision .
Each PCT will be fitted with a " non-removable " FM receiver that will
allow the power authorities to increase your air conditioning
temperature setpoint or decrease your heater temperature setpoint to
any value they chose .
During " price events " those changes are limited
to /- four degrees F and you would be able to manually override the
changes .
During " emergency events " the new setpoints can be whatever
the power authority desires and you would not be able to alter them .
In
other words , the temperature of your home will no longer be yours to
control .
Your desires and needs can and will be overridden by the state
of California through its public and private utility organizations .
All
this is for the common good , of course .
I can't think of anything that better illustrates the tie between free exchange and freedom .
And by the way , how long before the greenies in the legislature suggest using this mechanism even when there are not shortages to turn down everyone 's air conditioner , just because they can .
Update : Exercise for the reader -- Figure out how , once this policy goes bad , the state of California will again blame Enron for their failure .

The group says the alleged sightings cannot be ignored
Project Blue Book , run by the US Air Force , was stopped in the late 1960s .
The group , which includes former military officers from seven countries , all say they have seen a UFO or have conducted research into the phenomenon .
However , the Air Force says nothing has happened in the past four decades to justify resuming investigations .
Every year thousands of people say they have seen UFOs in the United States and their claims are usually met with scepticism .
We want the US government to stop perpetuating the myth that all UFOs can be explained away in down - to - earth , conventional terms
Fife Symington
Ex -Governor of Arizona
But this panel of former military , government and aviation personnel from countries around the world has urged the US government to take such claims seriously .
The group say the apparent sightings of hovering orbs , glowing lights and high - speed spacecraft are a national security concern and should no longer be dismissed .
After the attacks of 11 September , the group said in a statement , it was no longer satisfactory to ignore radar returns that could not be associated with existing helicopters and other aircraft .
HAVE YOUR SAY Government investigations of the UFO phenomenon are ongoing and highly secret
Rob Fewster , Brussels
Send us your comments
The panel has called on the US military to re-open an investigation dormant since 1969 , called Project Blue Book , in which more than 12,500 UFO claims were investigated by the Air Force .
For now , it seems their pleas have fallen on deaf ears - the US Air Force says nothing has changed that would support a resumption of the investigation .
But those who believe they have seen UFOs , know they have influential supporters .
Among those on the panel is the former governor of Arizona , Fife Symington , and last month , the Democrat presidential candidate , Dennis Kucinich , said during a televised debate that he 'd seen a UFO .

Private security contractors …
Welcome to the new homeland security campus
From Harvard to UCLA , the ivory tower is fast becoming the latest watchtower in Fortress America .
The terror warriors , having turned their attention to “ violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism ” — as it was recently dubbed in a House of Representatives bill of the same name — have set out to reconquer that traditional hotbed of radicalization , the university .
Building a homeland - security campus and bringing the university to heel is a seven - step mission :
1. Target dissidents :
As the warfare state has triggered dissent , the campus has increasingly become a target gallery — with student protesters in the crosshairs .
The government ’s number one target ?
Peace and justice organizations .
From 2003 to 2007 , an unknown number of them made it into the Pentagon ’s “ Threat and Local Observation Notice ” system ( TALON ) , a secretive domestic spying program ostensibly designed to track direct “ potential terrorist threats ” to the Department of Defense itself .
Last year , via Freedom of Information
Act requests , the ACLU uncovered at least 186 specific TALON reports on “ anti-military protests ” in the U.S. — some listed as “ credible threats ” — from student groups at the University of California - Santa Cruz , State University of New York , Georgia State University , and New Mexico State University , among other campuses .
At more than a dozen universities and colleges , police officers now double as full - time FBI agents and , according to the Campus Law Enforcement Journal , serve on many of the nation ’s 100 Joint Terrorism Task Forces .
These dual - purpose officer - agents have knocked on student activists ’ doors from North Carolina State to the University of Colorado and , in one case , interrogated an Iraqi - born professor at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst about his antiwar views .
FBI agents , or their campus stand - ins , do n’t have to do all the work themselves .
Administrators often do it for them , setting up “ free speech zones , ” which actually constrain speech , and punishing those who step outside them .

The Dutch Blog on all things Auto has acquired themselves what appear to be the first renderings of the brand - new special edition Koenigsegg CCX - R .
So what makes the already announced but as - of - yet unrevealed Koenigsegg - egg - egg - gg so special ?
Well — this here CCX is biofuel - powered .
That 's right — so that means this red - on - black Special Edition model featuring a cast - aluminium V8 engine with sequential multipoint fuel injection and twin rotrex centrifugal superchargers is not only pretending to be environmentally friendly , it 's also a performance model — due to the biofuel having higher octane and cooling characteristics .
That means the power on this Veyron - dethroning supercar 's gone up to 1018 HP at 7200 rpm and the torque to 780 lb - ft at 6100 rpm — talk about a well - spiced Swedish meatball , right ?
On a side note , the Swedes would also like to point out the CCXR is the first homologated car currently in production to reach over 1000 BHP — not that they 're braggarts or anything .
Full flower - filled press release after the jump .
CCXR Flower Power
When thinking about supercars , one of the last things that spring to mind are their environmental friendliness .
Even though the very low and exclusive production volume of Koenigsegg can hardly be considered to have a measurable impact on the Co2 problem that global society is facing , it is an impressive statement that even a small and extreme company like Koenigsegg can afford to develop environmentally focussed solutions .
By following conscientious and forward thinking strategies , Koenigsegg has managed to create the Bio Fuel Powered CCXR - environmentally friendly 1200 with even more spectacular performance than the standard CCX .
These two almost conflicting results are made possible due to the simple fact that the ethanol in biofuel has the positive side effect of cooling the combustion chambers , as well as a higher octane value , well over 100 RON , which gives the high power .
Due to the fact that the biofuel has higher octane and cooling characteristics , the power has gone up to 1018 hp at 7200 rpm and the torque to 1060 nm at 6100 rpm .
It is natural to expect a substantial gain in power when optimizing the engine for E85 ( biofuel ) instead of Petrol .
Still the actual gain obtained even surprised the enthusiastic engineers at Koenigsegg .
Following the long term strategy of Koenigsegg , all previous CCXs will have the possibility to be converted by the factory to accept the biofuel option and reap the performance and environmental benefi ts of this wonderful and eco friendly fuel .
The CCXR Biofuel upgrade has been developed in - house on the factory 's engine dyno by the skilled technicians at Koenigsegg , led by Christian Koenigsegg , Marco Garver and Anders Hoglund from the Koenigsegg partner company Cargine Engineering .
Curiously enough the CCXR is the first homologated car currently in production to reach over 1000 BHP .
I was kind of bored driving down to San Jose recently , so I decided to come up with a cure for all diseases everywhere , mostly because I was tired of playing " slug bug " with myself .
I figured I 'd be able to maybe get started on the beginnings of a way to go about starting to address the issue , but as it turns out I came up with four perfectly workable solutions over the course of an hour and a half .
I can only conclude that the rest of you are incredibly lazy .

Here are my four different ways to end disease and suffering for all time .
Rats
Over and over again , I read about a treatment for AIDS or cancer that has a phenomenal success in laboratory rats , but when it finally gets around to the human - testing stage , it all falls apart .
Similarly , treatments have been shown to increase the intelligence and extend the lifespan of rats , and us two - leggers do n't appear to be getting a piece of that .
Apparently rats are incredibly easy to cure and enhance .
So I 'm thinking , why not help the rats help us ?
Let 's pour all our effort into curing rats of every disease and every affliction , extending their lives , enhancing their intelligence and otherwise making them superior to us in every way .
Then , presumably , these superintelligent rodents will be grateful enough that they 'll turn their mental prowess to the task of doing the same for us .
Unless they just lock us in cages and make us run mazes .
Placebos
Is it just me , or are we ignoring the implications of the placebo effect ?
If sugar pills and saline injections have some efficacy against practically every affliction known to man , maybe we 're wasting our time with all this " reproducible results " and " scientific integrity " folderol .
Perhaps , instead , we should be trying to develop the best placebo possible , testing one placebo against another – giving some subjects a placebo and others a placebo placebo – in order to determine the very most convincing nonsense we can muster .
I suspect that a few years from now we 'll be getting glowing pills the size of walnuts , administered by doctors with monocles and German accents , because the delivery is so darn convincing we 'll quickly get better .
Time
Some people have their bodies frozen , in hopes that they 'll be revived someday , after death has been eradicated .
Others just freeze their head , assuming that by then growing a new body will be easy and / or peasy .
I figure , as long as we 're assuming that future generations are going to have ludicrously unlikely technology , we may as well go all the way and assume that they 're not even going to need your head .
Let 's just assume that they 'll be able to look back into the past and pluck your unique vibrational frequency from the timestream to revive you .
They might not want to revive dead people without permission , though , so you 'll need to register at my new site , please - pluck - my - frequency - from - the - timestream.com , for a nominal fee so they 'll know in the future that you want this done .
That way you can go to your death assured that it will merely be a minor setback .
Warcraft
I can already think of one place where all disease , and indeed death itself , is only temporary : World of Warcraft .
And yet , social convention holds that such miracles are n't worth much , because Warcraft is n't " the real world . "
I say our priorities are screwed up .
Why not just pick the better world , the one where all suffering is impermanent and you never age , even if you stop paying the subscription fee , and call that the real world ?
Then our characters in the game can laugh at the losers who are obsessed with such unimportant trifles as raising children , going to work and possessing working genitals .
Sure , people will still get incurable diseases , just not real people .

Chapter One : The Plan Against Oil Explosions and flames suddenly shattered the quiet afternoon at Thomas Edison 's West Orange , New Jersey laboratory complex .
Time and date : 5:20 p.m. , Wednesday , December 9 , 1914 .
Upon hearing the blast , a stunned Edison ran from his laboratory and into the courtyard .
There the famous inventor watched with astonishment as his film repository suddenly erupted in flames .
A moment later , Edison 's fire alarm gongs began clanging violently , echoing distress throughout the eighteen - structure complex .
Scores of employees scrambled down the stairs of their offices , across the compound , and toward the street as intense flames raced through the " fireproof " buildings .
Blast after blast , fiery outbreak after fiery outbreak , like a flaming barrage from within , spreading from the rear and then left and right , closing in from the front , and everywhere in between , most of Edison 's grounds soon became an inferno .
As though on an incendiary rampage , the fires systematically devoured the contents of Edison 's headquarters and facilities .
Quickly , carefully , intrepidly , Edison and his wife pulled his most important papers from their offices and raced out to safety .
Everything seemed to burst into blaze in just moments .
The phonograph recordings and motion picture materials burned out of control .
Wait .
Not the batteries .
Save the batteries .
Edison dashed across the street to the storage battery building and ordered his private fire brigade to protect that first .
With bravado , Edison himself directed much of the firefighting .
Not until midnight was most of the fire put down .
Some buildings continued burning until 2:00 p.m. the next day .
The flames were so intensely hot that one employee who tried to deploy a fire extinguisher was " burned to a crisp with a fire extinguisher alongside of him . "
Few understood the voracious fire 's extraordinary speed and broad destruction .
Ten buildings completely burned to the ground .
All but Edison 's lab and the storage battery building were reduced to fire - ravaged rubble .
It was hypothesized that a random spark from a switch in the film department suddenly ignited the surroundings .
Yet it was as though the fire erupted all at once from everywhere across the fireproofed compound in building after building , and even across the walkways .
Certainly Edison 's complex was filled with every form of flammable chemical and material .
But no one could explain certain " funny capers , " as they were termed .
Reports soon documented that for some reason " in one of the little low red buildings , they found 2,000 gallons of very high proof alcohol that was n't damaged . "
What 's more , investigators " also found on some of the floors cans of gasoline that did n't even ignite .
The flames swept right over the top of them .
Corners in the concrete building were n't even touched with fire . "
Some rooms emerged without any fire damage at all .
How did the fire spread from fireproof concrete building to fireproof concrete building ?
Everyone assumed it was the wooden window frames and their heat - broken panes .
But no one could explain the massive blaze that destroyed much of Edison 's life work .
The majority of the $ 7 million property loss was not insured , precisely because the concrete buildings were considered so impervious to fire and because a private on - premises fire brigade was always on duty .
Edison 's dreams -- past , present , and future -- were now reduced to char and ash .
A lifetime of invention had succumbed in the twinkling of an eye .
Standing amidst the scorched ruins and smoldering memories , a smoke - battered yet still strong and undefeated Edison emerged to bravely and boldly announce to gathered reporters , " Although I am over 67 years old , I 'll start over again tomorrow . "
But in truth the disaster was not only the final blow to Edison the man , but also to a bold venture by two titans of American invention and entrepreneurship -- Thomas Edison and Henry Ford .
Their plan was to blunt the world 's irrepressible and growing appetite for oil and the internal combustion machine .
If successful , Edison and Ford - - in 1914 - - would move society away from the ever more expensive and then universally known killing hazards of gasoline cars : air and water pollution , noise and noxiousness , constant coughing and the undeniable rise in cancers caused by smoke exhaust particulates .
Thus in 1914 , the two great men of American innovation joined forces to give the world the gift of a cleanly powered and wirelessly energized world where every home and factory generated , and every city block transmitted , its own on - site electricity .
Eventually they envisioned that all power would come from clean , renewable sources , such as wind , that would quietly churn independent of great energy companies .
Their goal was nothing less than the death of the internal combustion machine and the birth of a clean , empowered , and independent civilization .
Why not ?
At the beginning of the twentieth century , thousands of clean , quiet , and easy - to - operate electric taxicabs , passenger cars , and delivery trucks coursed through city streets across America - - from Boston to San Francisco .
But electric vehicles and the batteries that made them run became ensnared in corporate scandals , fraud , and monopolistic corruption that shook the confidence of the nation and inspired automotive upstarts .
This corruption infected all who came close after the nineteenth - century bicycle monopoly teamed up with the emerging twentieth - century electric battery monopoly in league with Wall Street 's most rapacious stock manipulators .
Called " the Lead Trust , " this cartel tried to control all transportation in America and eventually the world - - not for the good of mankind , but for the betterment of their private bank accounts .
Adventurous advocates of the rumbling , smoking , gasoline - burning internal combustion machine rebelled and claimed they could go farther and faster than most electric vehicles .
They falsely argued that the noise and rattle , as well as the smoke and sensation of oil - burning cars , were proof of the innate superiority of internal combustion .
The noisier , the smellier , the smokier the better , they insisted .
What 's more , gasoline and gasoline cars in the first years of the twentieth century was far cheaper than the heavy price - fixed lead batteries and expensive , elitist electric cars produced by the Lead Trust .
In some cases , gasoline was as cheap as water .
A willing public impressed with the muscular nature of internal combustion in tandem with an aphasic public policy chose the smoking , choking automotive populism of gasoline cars .
But then the upstart internal combustion industry joined its own nemesis , the affluent battery combine , to jointly kill electric vehicles and create a new monopoly of oil - burning cars that smoked like dragons to rule the roads to the exclusion of any other automobile save the ones that bore their license .
Indeed , they conspired that no man , small or great , rich or poor , could buy or sell or transact in automotive commerce without their mark .
From 1907 to 1911 , Henry Ford had fought a public war of litigation against the new high - priced internal combustion carmaking supercartel .
He was determined to create his own simple and affordable version of an internal combustion automobile .
Ford won .
His wrenching victory allowed Ford to place a cheap , mass - produced $ 600 Model T in barns and garages across the country , making his rendition of the gasoline car the everyman vehicle of choice .
This too helped accelerate the demise of electric cars .
But by 1912 , Ford had changed his mind about internal combustion .
He saw the whole concept as a device of monopolist manufacturers dependent upon a deadly and massively polluting energy source subject to constant financial and supply manipulations .
Edison agreed .
He was always fascinated by motive power and always knew electricity could prevail over internal combustion .
Edison believed that only electricity -- independently generated and wireless -- could ensure American independence .
He wanted to literally convey all power to the people -- whether they were stationary or moving .
A system of charging electric vehicles at home , right from the socket , along with public battery - fueling stations , was devised , this to be supplemented everywhere with curbside electrical recharging hydrants as common as parking meters .
Discharged batteries would be swapped out for fresh ones at service stations in less than 75 seconds , enabling long - distance travel .
The country was more than ready .
True , the sound and fury of internal combustion had long been hypnotic .
But the trance was rudely being interrupted by an upwardly spiraling cost of oil .
By fall 1912 , a shortage of refined supply had boosted gas prices some 75 percent over the previous year .
Oil was no longer a " negligible " expense .
The September 18 , 1912 , edition of Horseless
Age published a three - page article exploring fuel alternatives in view of the shortage .
The opening sentence set forth the problem .
" The recent sudden rise in the price of gasoline , following gradual increases during the past several years , all over the world , together with the enormous number of automobiles , commercial cars and other users of this fuel , has called attention again to the fuel question in a marked manner .
Whereas the previous retail price of 16 cents a gallon seemed high enough , it now retails all over New York City at from 18 to 22 cents ...
A year ago , it could be had at 14 retail , and as low as 10 cents wholesale .
This represents a rise of about 75 per cent within a year . "
A gallon of gasoline that cost 22 cents was equal to a twenty - first - century gallon costing $ 5 .
One 1912 tank of gasoline could easily exceed two day's wages of the average factory worker who assembled such cars .
Vehicular growth was vastly outstripping gasoline production .
The number of autos had increased from 300,000 in 1910 to 700,000 in 1912 .
In the year before 1912 alone , some 200,000 cars had been purchased ; that represented a one - year vehicle increase of some 66 percent .
During the same time , crude oil supplies increased by less than 4 percent from 209.5 million barrels to 217 million barrels .
Prices continued to skyrocket even as automobiles became more popular .
In many cities , a " gasoline war " was declared , that is , a battle to keep prices down .
New York was particularly hard hit by increases because of its monumental auto growth and telescoping consumption .
Whereas gas sold for 15 to 18 cents per gallon in Connecticut and Massachusetts , in metropolitan New York the cost was 20 to 25 cents .
The New York Times reported the problem this way : " In spite of plans and undoubted intentions to build more automobiles in the present year than ever before , it is not denied that the motor industry , as well as the motorcar owner , faces a most serious problem and possible setback in the soaring price of gasoline .
It is predicted that gas will reach 40 cents or more a gallon in the coming summer . "
Forty cents would equal $ 8 in twenty - first century money .
What 's more , the environmental damage was beginning to accrue in palpable ways .
Billows of smoke from tailpipe exhaust combined with clouds from railroad engines and industrial smokestacks to darken the air and burn the lungs .
Oil and grease effluent from garages swirled into rivers , poisoning the water .
Hydrologists were concerned that groundwater was becoming irreparably toxic .
Petroliferous runoff into the sewer systems of major cities was causing urban explosions .
New York 's Explosives or Combustible Commission declared " an absolute need to prevent the flowing of waste gasoline and oils from garages into the city sewers . "
Periodically , such sewers would simply ignite .
The New York Times reported one such incident under the banner " Sewer Explosion Terrifies a Block . "
The explosive force was so great that one manhole cover was hurtled " over the roof of a five - story building . "
Electrics suddenly became popular again .
After years of stagnation , the electric vehicle industry was experiencing resurgence .
In 1910 , the Electric Vehicle Association of America formed to bring car manufacturers and utilities together to promote their common interest in battery - run automobiles .
As the price of gasoline escalated 75 percent in the prior year , membership in the association experienced a concomitant rise , from 197 manufacturing companies in 1911 to 317 by the third annual convention on October 8 , 1912 .
The steep increase in electric vehicle adoption was becoming obvious to many , especially in trucking .
In New Jersey , the Public Service Corporation would soon announce it had seen a 1,000 percent increase in electric vehicles since 1911 .
In 1911 , only 30 electric trucks were in use ; two years later that number soared to 304 , plus 206 battery - powered pleasure cars .
In Massachusetts , registrations of electric trucks went from 227 to 389 the next year , a 71 percent jump .
In fact , in 1913 , Ford and other leading Ford Motor Company executives purchased for their wives the popular and sporty Detroit Electric .
Ford bought a second Detroit Electric and presented it to Edison as a Christmas gift .
Momentum for electric vehicles continued in 1913 as Ford and Edison posed for an advertisement in the Saturday Evening Post .
" Henry Ford and Thos A. Edison buy the Detroit Electric " read the banner headline ensconced above book - ended pictures of each man proudly standing beside his dapper new electric car .
The subhead beckoned , " How would you like to have these Master Minds Help you Choose Your Electric Car ? "
Three columns of copy testified to the world that both Ford and Edison believed that the electric was the best automotive choice .
By 1913 , Edison had announced the result of some 50,000 experiments conducted during seven painstaking years - - a radical new energy self - sufficient home .
He called it the " Twentieth Century Suburban Residence . "
Ostentatiously overstuffed with every modern gadget and appliance from a coffee percolator to a washing machine , from room heaters and coolers to phonographs and tiny movie projectors , the mansion was an electric marvel .
Every device and system , basement to roof , was powered by batteries replenished continuously by a small - scale on - site household electrical generator .
The New York Times , September 15 , 1912 : " The Powers of Darkness have suffered another rout �
For Mr. Edison has perfected a combination of gasoline engine , generator , and storage batteries by which , for a modest expense , every man can make his own electricity in his own cellar , utterly and for all time independent of the nearness or farness of the big electrical companies .
He can buy a farm in the Middle West or New England �
He can erect a tent in the desert , if he is so minded , and still read himself to sleep at night under a convenient electrical chandelier , and shave himself the next morning with water heated on an electrical stove . "
The first fully operational self - sufficient home was Edison 's own grand mansion at Llewellyn Park , New Jersey .
The pocket generating plant was a narrow and compact machine , designed to be situated either in the yard , in a shed , or in the basement .
Its cost : as little as $ 500 , although it came in larger and more expensive sizes capable of supplying greater - scale housing and could one day be networked to power factories .
Initially , the generators would operate off of a small tank of gasoline that periodically needed to be refilled .
Clearly , this temporarily retained the tether to petroleum .
But Edison planned to switch from dependence on a modicum of weekly gasoline to small residential windmills .
Self - sufficiency would no longer be a vision for tomorrow , but a reality .
Finally , in 1914 , it was happening .
The automobile revolution , which had begun as an electrical phenomenon , would return to the concept advanced nearly a generation earlier .
The world could become a cleaner , quieter , more efficient place , drawing its strength from electricity .
The American spirit of independence would be achieved not only by permitting mobility but by enabling stunning individual self - sufficiency .
How perfect would be the vindication if Ford and Edison now collaborated to mass - produce an automobile that would be better than internal combustion , better than lead battery power -- better than both .
Edison considered the replacement of both the reviled lead battery in electric vehicles and the gasoline motorcar to be his own nickel - iron Type A battery .
Newspapers coast to coast hailed the achievement of nickel and iron .
The Detroit Free Press typically bannered : " Edison Perfects Storage Battery , New Battery Will Revolutionize Car Systems . "
But would Edison batteries be mass - produced cheaply enough to replace the internal combustion machine ?
Ford 's plan was nothing less than astounding .
He committed to building some 12,500 such vehicles monthly in just the first year .
Moreover , to avoid any suggestion of a combine , Edison would be allowed to sell his dynamic new batteries to any electric vehicle manufacturer .
Ford , a man of great wealth and almost no outside investments , bankrolled the ramp - up of Edison 's production lines .
The pioneer automaker provided Edison an immense order fortified with the certainty of cash payment .
This would in essence finance the project , an undertaking so gigantic that it dwarfed all other prior electric vehicle output combined .
Edison prepared a stockholder letter .
His scribbled notes confirmed , " We have an order from the Ford Auto Co for about 4 million dollars worth of battery per year .
They build next year 150,000 autos . "
Between Edison 's money and Ford 's infusion , an estimated $ 1.75 million was funneled into the new enterprise -- an amount that equals about $ 350 million in twenty - first - century money -- just as a start - up .
On January 9 , 1914 , speaking from New York 's Hotel Belmont , the mercurial Ford told swarms of reporters about his plan to mass - produce Edison - powered electric vehicles selling as cheaply as $ 500 to $ 700 .
Beaming his admiration for the inventor , Ford declared , " I think Edison is the biggest man in the world today .
I even live on Edison Avenue in Detroit . "
At the same time , Ford , a man considered one of the wealthiest in America , made clear he intended to die poor .
" It is a disgrace to die rich , " he told reporters .
" I do not expect to leave any vast fortune to my relatives because I do not believe they would know how to use it . "
Ford believed the new electric vehicle enterprise might not be profitable at first , but he did not care .
He and Edison just wanted to change the world .
Ford went on to reveal that he and Edison had actually been " working for some years " on the vehicle to ensure it would be " cheap and practical . "
He added some specifics : " The car we propose to build will contain battery equipment weighing 406 pounds , and the entire car will weigh but 1,100 pounds .
It will run for 100 miles [ without recharge ] .
The cost will be about $ 600 to the public , " he said , quipping , " How does that compare with the great , heavy and expensive electric cars ? "
News about the cheap Ford - Edison electric automobile streaked across America like a meteor shower .
Dozens of newspapers ' headlines lit up brightly with the bold promise , as did every auto showroom , carmaker office , and American family household that had craved an automobile but was precluded because of high oil or battery prices or reliability problems .
Would Ford and Edison be allowed to succeed ?
If they did , it would overturn everything the two men had previously stood for -- big internal combustion machines and big utility companies -- and replace it with everything they now stood for -- clean , self - generated independent electricity .
The answer was seeded long before 1914 , centuries earlier when timber was the greatest power in the world and therefore the protected realm of monarchs who controlled it to govern their realms and conquer the realms of others .
Timber was worth killing for because it was the secret behind the earliest making of metal , the stuff of wealth and weaponry .
When the trees became too scarce , the monarchs turned to monopolists and corporate scoundrels for a new burning substance , this one not green but black .
It was coal .
Thus , the first private international energy cartel began in England centuries ago with a secretive Newcastle order called the Hostmen .
The Hostmen powered the Industrial Revolution but poisoned the air and water as part of their bargain .
The coal cartel gave rise to later generations of energy monopolists who built great steam railroads that further poisoned the environment and spread cancer to those who lived near .
Anyone who stood in their way to find cleaner alternatives was ruthlessly defeated by the men of wealth and power who defended their brand of energy and transportation .
When the electric vehicle took hold at the end of the nineteenth century , circumstances -- both popular and predatory -- combined to replace battery cars with internal combustion , and in the process replaced clean technology with burning oil .
This oil was brought from faraway places at great risk so men could travel noisily down the street .
Then the forces of internal combustion conspired against electric rail transportation within the cities and between the cities , leaving only petroleum engines and exhaust in their triumphant wake .
Now all the polluted clouds have gathered and created the petropolitical and ecocidal thunderstorms that overshadow the twenty - first century .
In their constant war with electricity , the forces of internal combustion have always won .
How did it happen ?
How did the world choose the other way , and who chose that way for the world ?
How did corporations and governments addict the world to oil and subvert the alternatives ?
How can the multimillennial ravages of bad energy be undone today before more war , terrorism , petropolitical blackmail , and climate change collapse our way of life around us ?
Why has it not been done already ?
What can be done today to stop our high velocity advance toward the brink ?
The answer lies first in understanding the chain of explosions that constitute the past , the present , and the future of mankind 's own grandly self - inflicted never - healing wound : internal combustion .

Here 's our selection of some of the world 's funniest signs and bizarre translations of the English language , in an exclusive preview of Doug Lansky 's new book , Signspotting 2 , which is published by Lonely Planet next month .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- State Department investigators promised Blackwater guards immunity from prosecution for last month 's deadly shooting of 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad , according to officials familiar with the matter .
That could potentially complicate any attempt to bring criminal charges in the case , the officials said .
The Justice Department and FBI refused comment on the investigation , which the State Department announced in early October .
Blackwater also declined comment .
" They were told their statements can't be used against them , " said one U.S. government official .
" But this does n't necessarily mean charges can never be brought against these guys . "
A second official called the limited immunity " surprising and confusing " and questioned the authority of the State Department 's diplomatic security investigators to unilaterally make immunity decisions .
" I can understand there would be a lot of very unhappy people , " said a third official , an experienced investigator who said decisions are not usually made without consultation with federal prosecutors .
All the officials refused to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on this sensitive issue .
An FBI team has been in Baghdad investigating the September 16 killings by security contractors hired by the State Department to protect American diplomats in Baghdad .
Security contractors have immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation in Iraq .
North Carolina - based contractor Blackwater USA says its guards came under fire while protecting a State Department convoy and acted properly in self - defense .
Iraqi authorities have called the killings " premeditated murder . "
The State Department had no official comment .
But one senior State Department official said it is unclear what transpired , " but whatever it was , it was not something that was sanctioned by the senior management of the State Department . "

Project Management Blogs : How to Run Your Project on the Web
Posted by nitzan on Thursday , September 6th , 2007
Project management has been given a huge boost by internet tools .
The biggest improvements for me came from the fact we can collaborate so easily across geography , time zones and computing platforms .
Now though we have grown with the web technologies to the point where we have tailor - made services plus innovative ways of using other tools that work very well but were never intended to be used that way .
The most prominent of these latter categories of tools are blogs .
Blogs are easy to set up and use , can be secured with simple password protection or hosted behind corporate firewalls .
Check out these ways blogs might be used for project management :
Progress Report Blogs – A large part of project management is communication , and blogs are an obvious way of communicating with a project team .
Team members can follow progress by visiting the blog , subscribing via RSS or with email updates .
Messages can be categorized , so for example a programmer can take note of just the technical bulletins and requirements updates .
This opt - in method has the benefit people are not barraged by unwanted and distracting emails .

Discussion Blogs –
If feedback or a consensus is required the comment area can be called into play .
This has the added benefit of centralizing discussions with an audit trail ; you can see who said what and when .

Once you are using the web you have all the web has to offer to utilize .
Rather than all text all the time , why not demonstrate and explain using audio , video , and interactivity ?
For example you might deploy a new software release and explain how it works with a video screen cast walk - through .

Team Blogs – Most blogging software will allow you to register users and give them appropriate permissions .
The simplest permission you will want to give is the ability to comment .
Thinking further though you might want them to post their own content .

Jonah harrumphs at Frank Rich 's column yesterday , with a nice bit of anti-boomer rage but a somewhat desperate swipe that Rich 's worry about a " quiet coup " is " paranoid nonsense " and " shameful . "
Really ?
Jonah should take a look at Charlie Savage 's extraordinarily good " Take - Over : The Return Of The Imperial Presidency . "
At least one very smart conservative has praised it .
The facts are as follows : this president believes that he is not ultimately subject to the rule of law in waging war since 9/11 ; he believes he can ignore any laws passed in this respect - even those passed with veto - proof majorities if necessary - by signing statements , whose frequency has soared under the Cheney - Bush presidency ; he believes that the parameters of the include the territory of the United States and every citizen of the United States ; he believes he has the right to seize any individual in this country or the world without charging them and hold them indefinitely or subject them to kangaroo military courts where basic due process protections are absent ; he has clearly authorized the torture of many individuals using this power , while redefining the word torture against the plain meaning of the term in law and in English .
He has done all this with barely any real push - back from the Congress and only minimal interference from the Supreme Court which he has bolstered with Justices who uphold great deference to the executive branch in wartime .
And all these emergency powers - sanctioned by the notion of an emergency and defended with references to previous emergencies ( such as the Civil War and the Second World War ) - are , unlike in the past , indefinitely awarded to the executive branch , because this war is against an amorphous entity that by definition cannot surrender .
And so we have transformed emergency powers - controversial even under those circumstances - into the permanent balance of power in American democracy .
We have gone immediately to the most extreme position - a president empowered to do anything to defend the nation - and made it permanent .
Just as we have taken the one - in - a - million moral ( not legal ) sanction to torture , and made it a normal , legal avenue of executive branch interrogation , subject to no checks except those imposed by the torturers themselves .
I do not believe these facts are in any significant dispute , however blinkered NRO " conservatives " want to remain .
The current Republican candidates ( apart from Ron Paul and , to some extent , McCain ) all support this new protectorate in place of a presidency .
If this is not a quiet coup , what would be ?
And why should conservatives , of all people , support and enable this assault on the constitution and individual liberty , in the name of a war against an abstract enemy that will never be defeated ?
Has anybody ever read " Nineteen - Eighty - Four " ?

Rupert Murdoch signalled a seismic shakeup of his global media empire last night , putting his son James in pole position to succeed him and moving the editor of the Times and the chairman of his UK newspaper arm to oversee his Wall Street Journal acquisition .
In a series of dramatic moves expected to be confirmed today , James Murdoch , 34 , will stand down as chief executive of BSkyB and take up a new role overseeing all News Corp 's media operations in Europe and Asia .
Simultaneously Robert Thomson , the editor of the Times , will move to New York to become publisher of the Wall Street Journal , replacing Gordon Crovitz , when Murdoch 's audacious swoop for parent company Dow Jones closes next week .
Thomson 's move was widely predicted but the announcement of News International chairman Les Hinton , a respected fixture in the UK newspaper market and one of Murdoch 's most trusted lieutenants , as chief executive of Dow Jones was more of a surprise .
Hinton , executive chairman of News International , holding company for the Times , Sunday Times , Sun and News of the World , has been a huge influence on the British newspaper empire and plays a key role in appointing editors and deciding strategy .
The move was triggered yesterday when Dow Jones 's chief executive , Richard Zannino , announced he would leave the company when the acquisition by News Corp is approved on Wednesday .
James Murdoch will take control of his father 's UK newspaper empire , ticking the one box he lacked in terms of experiencing the spread of a global corporation that began with a modest family Australian newspaper business .
James 's role in charge of News Corp 's European and Asian assets will also give him control of Sky Italia and the Star TV network in Asia .
He will also take over from his father as non-executive chairman of BSkyB , where he is considered to have done a good job in his four years at the helm .
He has boosted subscriber numbers when most expected them to stall , expanded into broadband and pushed the company 's green credentials .
As well as shoring up its position as a provider of premium movies and sport , he has broadened the company 's appeal .
But he has also shared his father 's knack for provocation , swooping for a 17.9 % stake in ITV in a move that enraged rival Virgin Media and could yet lead to sanctions by the regulatory authorities he has frequently railed against .
Rupert Murdoch 's decision to step down as chairman of Sky breaks his formal link with the company on which he bet the farm in 1989 and almost went bankrupt as a result before going on to revolutionise British broadcasting .
Jeremy Darroch , the current
Sky finance director , will take over as chief executive .
BSkyB sources were keen to stress that the impetus for James to remain as chairman came from the non-executive directors on the board such as Lord Rothschild and Lord Dinton rather than him or his father .
Thomson , who has been in the Times editor 's chair since 2002 after being lured from the Financial Times , played a key role in the acquisition of the Wall Street Journal .
Murdoch enlisted him to help persuade the Bancroft family that he would not interfere in day to day editorial matters .
The frontrunner to replace him is James Harding , the Times business editor , who is known to be close to James Murdoch .
Steven Yount , president of the staff union at Dow Jones , told the Guardian that there was little surprise in the newsroom at the change : " It was only a matter of time - if you spend $ 5 bn buying something , you want to put your own man in to run the thing . "
He said he hoped that Hinton and Thomson would invest in content .
" I certainly hope that there is an unshakeable commitment to the excellence and quality of journalism that the Journal 's been known for hundreds of years , " he said .
Employees at Dow Jones have expressed concern about editorial independence under Murdoch .
Lachlan Murdoch , James ' elder brother , was considered the most likely heir but dropped out of the race in 2005 .
His sister Elisabeth runs her own successful independent production company , Shine .
News Corp refused to comment last night .
The Sinking Dollar ' The Strong Euro Is Destroying Jobs '
The strong euro -- and weak dollar -- is making it increasingly difficult for European companies to do business overseas .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke with German government economic advisor Peter Bofinger about the dangers of an unfettered euro and what the European Central Bank should do .
Tancredoism — a hard line on immigration — is abetted by an absence of Party leadership and by Bush ’s unpopularity .

Once upon a time , John McCain was favored to win the Republican nomination .
His straight - talking appeal and his cultivation of the Republican Party ’s right wing put him first — at least in the early conventional wisdom .
Then , last summer , his campaign seemed to spontaneously combust in a puff of fund - raising troubles and staff intrigue .
But McCain has slowly made his way back into contention .
The usual line is that he has done it by being “ the old McCain , ” the one that New Hampshire voters ( and many journalists ) fell for during his 2000 Presidential run .
Unlike Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , or Rudy Giuliani , the former New York mayor , two of his chief competitors , he holds a press conference after nearly every campaign event .
Just before a recent trip to South Carolina , he invited a dozen reporters for lunch at his Arlington , Virginia , campaign headquarters ( on the thirteenth floor , naturally ) .
Rather than trying to woo religious conservatives , an awkward alliance at best , McCain is focussing more on his natural base of independents ( in New Hampshire ) and veterans ( in South Carolina ) .
Instead of trying to run a by - the - numbers conservative campaign , he is emphasizing issues on which he has taken what he believes to be principled but unpopular positions .
He is the only one in the Republican field who seems eager to talk about Iraq .
“ My friends , here ’s the news , ” he told a small crowd in Seneca , South Carolina , a few days after returning from Thanksgiving with the troops .
“ We are winning in Iraq .
We are winning in Iraq .
We are winning in Iraq . ”
Over lunch in Arlington , McCain had given the stock explanation for what caused last summer ’s difficulties .
“ The problem , which was my problem , was that our fiscal expectations were n’t met by reality , ” he said — in other words , he could n’t raise enough money .
But the next day , as I travelled with McCain around South Carolina , he told me that his campaign ’s brush with death had less to do with fund - raising than with his role in championing the ambitious immigration - reform bill , supported by the White House , that died in Congress this year .
“ It was n’t the budgetary problems .
That was an inside - the - Beltway thing , ” he said , referring to press coverage of his campaign ’s setbacks .
McCain gets animated whenever he discusses the immigration issue .
After a town - hall meeting in Anderson , South Carolina , he recalled how the Irish were discriminated against in America .
As he quoted a placard that hangs on the wall of an aide ’s office ( “ Help Wanted — No Irish Need Apply ” ) , he jabbed his finger in the air with such emphasis that he knocked my voice recorder to the ground and erased our conversation .
“ It was immigration ” that hurt his campaign , he said when he continued , after a series of apologies on both sides .
“ I understand that .
I was told by one of the pollsters , ‘ We see real bleeding . ’ ”
There were two major factions in the immigration debate in Congress .
A bipartisan coalition wanted a bill that included tough border - security measures , which everyone favored , as well as more controversial provisions concerning temporary - worker permits for undocumented aliens and a way for them to attain citizenship .
Conservatives , led by Tom Tancredo , a Colorado congressman and Presidential candidate , demanded a bill that dealt only with security .
McCain seems torn by how to address the issue , and he makes a small but telling concession to the Tancredo faction when he argues that security legislation must indeed come first .
“ You ’ve got to do what ’s right , O.K. ? ” he told me .
“ But , if you want to succeed , you have to adjust to the American people ’s desires and priorities . ”
During another conversation , when I asked McCain what he had learned from the arguments about immigration , he said , “ I think the main lesson is that Americans had no trust or confidence in the government .
So when we said , as part of this comprehensive solution , we need to secure the borders , add temporary workers , and address the twelve million people here , they just did n’t believe us , O.K. ? ”
He argued that the mismanaged response after Hurricane Katrina , the Washington corruption scandals such as those involving the lobbyist Jack Abramoff , and unchecked government spending had undermined public confidence .
“ So what you have to do is prove to them that you ’re going to secure the borders .
And then I think that at least most of them — except for the Tancredos , who want to stop all immigration — would say , ‘ O.K. , I ’m going to address these other issues . ’ ”
McCain ’s standard answer to immigration questions is that he “ got the message . ”
But every so often this practical McCain , bending to the mood of the primary electorate , gets shoved aside by the quixotic McCain , the one who never seems happier than when he ’s championing a lost cause .
At one stop in South Carolina , at Clemson University , a student engaged McCain in an argument about whether his plan rewarded illegal immigrants for breaking the law .
McCain was by then in a combative mood .
Minutes earlier , a professor had asked about a piece of Internet - crime legislation that he argued would group terrorism researchers with actual terrorists .
“ Am I a terrorist ? ” the professor asked , his querulous tone suggesting that McCain had n’t answered the original question .
The questioner was wearing tennis shoes , jeans , a pink polo shirt , and a gray blazer , and McCain looked at him carefully .
“ With those sneakers , you ’re not a snappy dresser , ” McCain replied after a pause , as audience members gasped and laughed .
“ That does n’t mean you ’re a terrorist .
Though you terrorize the senses . ”
To the student with the immigration question , McCain patiently explained that some illegal immigrants had faced unusual circumstances , and he mentioned a woman who has lived in the United States for decades and has a son and a grandson serving in Iraq .
When the student said that he wanted to see punishment meted out to anyone who has broken the law , McCain stopped trying to find common ground .
“ If you ’re prepared to send an eighty - year - old grandmother who ’s been here seventy years back to some country , then frankly you ’re not quite as compassionate as maybe I am , ” he said .
Next question .
McCain could stop discussing the controversial parts of his immigration plan or he could drop his support for them altogether , admitting that he was simply wrong , as Romney has done with abortion and other issues .
I asked McCain about Romney , who had once expressed support for the comprehensive legislation backed by the Bush Administration — it sounded “ reasonable , ” he ’d said — but now rails against it as “ amnesty . ”
McCain said , “ Both he and Rudy had the same position I did .
In fact , Rudy was even more liberal .
But , look , if that — ” He paused and shrugged .
“ I do n’t want to be President that bad . ”
Later that night , at the CNN / YouTube debate in St. Petersburg , Florida , immigration declared itself the dominant and obsessive issue of the Republican primaries , and the issue also clarified some essential differences among the candidates .
The two formerly moderate Northeasterners , Romney and Giuliani , taunted each other about who was tougher on illegal immigrants .
On the other side were McCain and Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , who told their opponents that illegal immigrants “ need some of our love and compassion ” ( McCain ) and that “ we are a better country than to punish children for what their parents did ” ( Huckabee ) .
The Romney - Giuliani exchange prompted Tancredo , whose platform calls for restrictions even on legal immigration , to giddily declare that his opponents were trying to “ out - Tancredo Tancredo . ”
A week before today ’s 61st anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by the Red Army , Landeszeitung Lüneburg , a local newspaper in Germany , ran an article about the deportation of a Sinti boy from Lüneburg to Auschwitz .
The article was accompanied by a large red ad from one of the biggest energy companies in Germany bearing the tagline ( roughly translated ) : “ E.ON provides today for the gas of tomorrow ! ”
Click for a larger version .
The paper later published an apology to the author , readers , and energy company for the ad placement , claiming they had not checked the content of the ad .

This is a kind of article that you 'd never read in The Wall Street Journal .
If you liked Freakonomics , you 'll love this article :
For years , backpacks crammed with cash have slipped north into Canada , followed closely by hockey bags packed with premium marijuana skating south into Montana .
A favorable exchange rate ( not long ago , one American dollar bought one and a half Canadian dollars ) made the smuggling profitable , and thus popular .
But last month , for the first time in more than 30 years , the two currencies were at par , matched in value , and Sunday a Canadian dollar bought $ 1.06 U.S .
The financial tables have turned , and global economics have done what U.S. law enforcement could not : Capitalism has stopped the smugglers in their tracks .
Call it Marijuanomics 101 .
America borrows itself deep into the hole , ratchets up its trade deficits , buries itself beneath subprime mortgage debt , devalues its dollar with interest - rate cuts , and the currency plunges .
Meanwhile , Canada ’s economy booms on oil , foreign investors turn north for stability , and the “ Loonie ” — Canada ’s dollar , named for the bird on the coin — hits a 50 - year high .
Suddenly , it ’s far more expensive to buy Canadian exports , legal or otherwise , and smuggling profits disappear .
“ It ’s very simple , ” said Stephen Easton , professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , B.C. “ Canadian marijuana production costs are met in Canadian dollars , and those are worth more now . ”
Previously , he said , pot growers could produce a pound of potent “ B.C. bud ” for about $ 2,000 Canadian and , with the exchange rate , smugglers buying with U.S. currency could sell it for a hefty profit south of the border .
In those days , an American dollar in Canada was like a 50 percent discount card , and there ’s nothing like a wholesale discount to bolster retail profits .
Production costs remain in the range of $ 2,000 Canadian , Easton said .
But with the currencies at par , the profit margin is completely gone , unless Montanans are willing to pay 50 percent more for the prime northern bud .
A smuggler ’s risks and transport costs are no longer offset by profit .
“ The upshot is that the Canadian marijuana is now less competitive against marijuana grown elsewhere , ” Easton said .
“ This is a cost - driven business .
With exports no longer viable , the British Columbia marijuana industry has certainly taken a hit , so to speak . ”

It looks like a scene from a paradise island ... a little green boat bobbing on a sea tinged pink by the setting sun .
Try to dive into those inviting waves , however , and you could end up in something of a mess .
For the sea is actually smoked salmon .
The rocks and pebbles are brown soda bread and potatoes , while the sand is sugar and the trees dill .
The boat is a pea pod .

Even the sky is food - a thin slice of salmon with a light shining through it for the sun .
These amazing images come from a series of pictures called Foodscapes , created using simple kitchen ingredients .
Made entirely from vegetables , meat , dairy and fish produce , the lifelike scenes range from a broccoli forest to a mushroom field .
They are the work of Carl Warner , a 44 - year - old photographer from Kent who has spent the last few years developing his style .
Each scene is photographed in separate stages to stop the food wilting and then put together on a computer .

Mr Warner said : " I begin by drawing a conventional landscape using classic compositional techniques because I need to fool the viewer into thinking it is a real scene .
" It is the realisation of what the real ingredients are that brings a smile , and for me that 's the best part .
" Although I 'm very hands on with my work , I do use model makers and food stylists to help me create the sets .
" Normally I set them up on an 8ft wide by 4ft deep table top , though the foreground is only about 2ft across and the background 8 ft across . "

He added : " I think the smoked salmon sea has been one of the most successful items in terms of its closeness to the real thing .
" My favourite scene has to be the broccoli forest .
" It was the first one that went from my head to my sketch book to the finished image as a smooth process of realisation .
It also raised the bar on how realistic I could make them look . "

WASHINGTON , Nov. 16 — Senate Republicans today easily blocked an effort by Democrats to act on a war spending bill that would have provided $ 50 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , but would have required that troop withdrawals from Iraq begin within 30 days .
The bill had numerous other strings attached a well , including a goal of completing re-deployment from Iraq by mid-December 2008 and a narrowing of the Iraq mission to focus on counter - terrorism and training of Iraqi security forces .
The vote today was the latest attempt by Democrats to force President Bush to shift his war strategy , but they were able to muster only 53 of the 60 votes needed to cut off debate and move to a vote ; 45 senators voted against the measure .
A Republican counter - measure , which would have provided $ 70 billion for the military operations with no strings attached , also failed .
A federal judge has handed the MPAA a resounding victory in its copyright infringement lawsuit against TorrentSpy .
Judge Florence - Marie Cooper entered a default judgment against Justin Bunnell and the rest of named defendants in Columbia Pictures et al. v. Justin Bunnell et al. after finding that TorrentSpy " engaged in widespread and systematic efforts to destroy evidence " and lying under oath about said destruction .
The MPAA sued TorrentSpy and a handful of other BitTorrent sites in February 2006 as part of its crackdown on piracy .
TorrentSpy mounted a vigorous defense , including a countersuit it filed against the MPAA in May 2006 , but behind the scenes , the court documents paint a picture of a company desperately trying to bury any and all incriminating evidence .
After receiving the complaint , TorrentSpy 's admins tried to bury their tracks as best they could , according to Judge Cooper 's ruling .
One of the defendants , Wes Parker , asked TorrentSpy 's moderators to come up with a plan to keep the site 's forums free of piracy and the discussion thereof .
Another moderator suggested creating a hidden forum and moving all of the incriminating content there , and Parker gave her the go - ahead .
Admins also replaced the names of copyrighted works posted in the forums with references like " [ some movie 1 ] " ; some of those edits were made months after the original post .
TorrentSpy also failed to provide the MPAA with full IP addresses of its users , testifying under oath that they were not available .
Conversations on the forums between the moderators paint a different picture , however .
A March 2006 conversation between a couple of moderators showed that users could be banned by IP address , and moderators testified that full IP addresses were logged until April 2007 .
Judge Cooper ordered TorrentSpy to begin ( or resume , as the case may be ) logging its users ' IP addresses and turn them over to the MPAA .
Since the IP addresses were temporarily present in RAM , reasoned the judge , the site could be forced to keep logs of them .
Just two weeks later , TorrentSpy belatedly began filtering copyrighted content , and , two months after that , began blocking searches by users in the US .
The defendants ' actions led the MPAA to file a Motion for Terminating Sanctions in August , the motion that the judge ruled on last week .
In addition to the actions outlined above , TorrentSpy committed a few other sins in the eyes of judge , and she believed that they had the effect of making it much more difficult for the MPAA to make its case .
" Plaintiffs have convinced the Court that their ability to prove their case has been inalterably prejudiced by Defendants ' willful spoliation of evidence , making terminating sanctions the only effective recourse , " wrote Judge Cooper .
" The Court has concluded that Defendants ' conduct constitutes spoliation and second , that termination of the case in favor of Plaintiffs is the proper sanction . "
In other words , game over , and the MPAA won — but because of TorrentSpy 's actions after the lawsuit was filed , and not on the merits of the case itself .
TorrentSpy has announced its intention to appeal , but its conduct makes a reversal unlikely .
It had to happen .
President Bush ’s bungling of the war in Iraq has been the talk of the summer .
On Capitol Hill , some of the more reliable Republicans are writing proposals to force Mr. Bush to change course .
A showdown vote is looming in the Senate .
Enter , stage right , the fear of terrorism .
Yesterday , the director of national intelligence released a report with the politically helpful title of “ The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland , ” and Fran Townsend , the president ’s homeland security adviser , held a news conference to trumpet its findings .
The message , as always :
Be very afraid .
And do n’t question the president .
Certainly , the report ’s conclusions are disturbing .
Nearly six years after 9/11 , terrorism remains a huge threat .
Al Qaeda has replaced leaders killed or captured by the United States , regrouped in its former home base in the tribal lands on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border and is trying to use affiliated terrorists in Iraq “ to raise resources and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives . ”
If the report is given an honest reading , it is a powerful rebuke to Mr. Bush ’s approach to the war on terror .
It vindicates those who say that the Iraq war is a distraction from the real fight against terrorism — a fight that is not going at all well .
The owner of a hair salon is being sued for religious discrimination for refusing to hire a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf .
Sarah Desrosiers , 32 , says she turned down Bushra Noah as a junior stylist to maintain the image of her salon , which specialises in " urban , funky " cuts .
She told Miss Noah , 19 , she needed her staff to display their hairstyles to the public .

But the devout Muslim insisted that wearing her headscarf was essential to her beliefs .
Miss Noah , who has been rejected for 25 different hairdressing jobs after interviews , is suing Miss Desrosiers for more than £ 15,000 for injury to her feelings plus an unspecified sum for lost earnings .
Miss Desrosiers , who set up the Wedge salon in King 's Cross , North London , 18 months ago , says she faces financial ruin if she loses the case .
She denies any discrimination and insists it is an " absolutely basic " job requirement that cus-Yesterday , Miss Desrosier said : " When a potential client walks past on the street , they look into a salon at the stylists to get an impression of what haircut they are going to get there .
" The image I have built my salon on is very urban , funky , punky .
That is the look I am going for .

" If an employee were wearing a baseball cap or cowboy hat I would ask them to remove it at work .
" It has nothing to do with religion .
But I now feel like I have been branded a racist .
My name is being dragged through the mud . "
She went on : " This girl is suing me for more than I earn in a year .
" I am a small business and have only had my salon a year and a half .
If I lose this lawsuit , my business will fold . "
In legal papers setting out her employment tribunal claim , Miss Noah alleges she was discriminated against at her interview in March and wrongly turned down for a job she was capable of doing because of her headscarf .
Yesterday , she said : " The advertised job of junior assistant stylist was perfect for me .
I did NVQs in hairdressing at college and have 18 months experience at a salon in Ealing Broadway .
" On the phone , Sarah sounded very keen on me because of my experience and qualifications .
I sent her my CV and she invited me in a few days later for a trial day .
" But when I got there , she looked at me in shock .
She started making excuses about wanting someone who lived locally but I knew it was my headscarf .
" She said , ' You really should have told me that you wear a headscarf ' .
She asked if I wore it all the time and I said , ' Yes ' .
She asked if I would take it off for work and I said , ' No ' .
" Wearing a headscarf is very important in my religion and is non-negotiable .
It is about showing your modest side . "
Miss Noah added : " I am Britishborn and I know the urban , funky look .
Just because I wear a headscarf does not mean I do not follow the latest trends and fashions .
" Afterwards , I felt so devastated and depressed .
It has always been my ambition to be a hairdresser but I have given up now after being rejected 25 times .
" It is always because of my headscarf , whether they say it or not .
" I just thought that Sarah should not be allowed to get away with it and that if I do n't stand up for myself , no one else will . "
The case will be heard at the Central London Employment Tribunal in January .

Hello , following some discussions on the list ( re. multiple namespaces in file ) as well as a short discussion on IRC regarding not being able to do " use yeti::xml : : DomDocument as DomDocument ; " - I do not see any point in having namespaces at all .
And my excuses for the somewhat longish mail ...
Some arguments : 1 . As it is impossible to do " use XXX as NativeClass " we get to the point where we'd have to namespace new internal native classes otherwise we might introduce BC breaks .
AFAIK , we 've always said that PHP reserves the globals space for it's own use ( see also : http://www.php.net/manual/en/userlandnaming.rules.php).
In case we do add new classes ( an example could be DateTimeSpan ) , they should of course follow the same format as already existing classes in the extension ( DateTime , DateTimeZone ) .
However introducing the new class DateTimeSpan might break people 's code that do things like : <? php use myNamespace :: DateTimeZone as DateTimeZone ; ?> feature versions of people would then show : Fatal error : Cannot use myNamespace :: DateTimeZone as DomDocument because the name is already in use .
It would be silly to require to have to do this : - Create a class PHP :: Date :: TimeSpan -
In your scripts : use PHP :: Date :: TimeSpan
But with the current implementation , this seems to be the only non-BC breaking solution .
If we chose * not* to require this silly namespacing of internal classes , users instead have to do this : <? php use myNamespace :: DateTimeZone as myDateTimeZone ; ?>
Basically prefixing the classnames ...
This you can already do just fine without namespaces .
2 . You have to import every class yourself .
You can currently not do : use myNamespace : :* as * ; // or similar syntax I understand why this is not implemented ( runtime vs. compile time ) , but it is a bit of a pain in the ass if you use lots of classes from your own library f.e.
3 . We keep bickering over using { } or not , multiple namespaces in a file or not ... etc .
I understand that people want more flexibility , but also we need a * simple * to explain implementation .
With the current implementation I see the following problems here : - You can't stick multiple namespaces in one file - Unlike other constructs in PHP that mark executable blocks , namespaces do n't use { }. -
The " namespace " keyword at the start of a file is somewhat magic , because it can only appear as first element in your script .
4 . What is wrong with simple prefixes in the first place ?
Both PEAR_* , Zend_* , ezc* , and ezp * are perfectly acceptable markers for different ' namespaces ' .
We could optionally create a registry on php.net for this to avoid conflicts .
With all the above considerations , especially my first point , I still have not heard any good reason why namespaces in the current implementation are actually useful - or what particular case they solve ... so I am wondering , are they really useful ?
I come now to the conclusion that they are not , and for myself ( and most likely my work projects ) I would have to decide not to go with namespaces , but instead stick with the 3 letter prefixing .
Something that I have totally no problem with , as it is nice and easy .

The ordination of gay Bishop Gene Robinson divided Anglicans
Delegates of the San Joaquin diocese in Fresno voted 173 - 22 to secede .
It follows years of disagreement with Church authorities triggered by the consecration of a gay bishop in 2003 .
The Episcopal Church is the US wing of the 77m - member Anglican Communion , which is threatened by a deep split between conservatives and liberals .
The Episcopal Church says that in recent years 32 of its 7,600 congregations had left , with another 23 voting to leave but not taking the final step .
San Joaquin is the first of the Church 's 110 dioceses to complete the split .
In a later vote , the diocese accepted an invitation to join the province of the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America .
' Contrary to teachings '
" This is the first time , I believe , that a diocese has finally said ' enough ' in terms of the liberal theology of the Episcopal Church , " said Bishop John - David Schofield of the San Joaquin diocese ahead of the vote .
Anglican leaders in many parts of the world were angered by the consecration of openly - gay Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire in 2003 .
Conservative churchgoers believe active homosexuality is contrary to the Anglican Communion 's teachings , which are rooted in the Bible .
However , liberal Anglicans have argued that biblical teachings on justice and inclusion should take precedence .
We got an email from The California Nurses Association :
The California Nurses Associaton are working with the family of Nataline Sarkisyan , a 17 year old from Northridge , California , who is lying in the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center hoping that CIGNA will approve the liver transplant she desperately needs .
You heard that right , folks .
A seventeen - year - old needs a LIVER TRANSPLANT and the insurance company is making up their mind whether to pay for it .
And certain presidential candidates think we should all be required to buy " affordable coverage " from these people .
Bless their hearts .
At a minimum , can you go read and comment on nyceve 's dkos diary on this situation to help build a tsunami of public anger and embarass Cigna into approving this medically - necessary treatment ?
Cigna ?
I got yer embarrassment right here .
Please recommend and comment at the Kos Diary and digg this story .
And thanks .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) FANTASTIC news !
Apparently , Cigna 's offices were flooded with phone calls and all the work that CNA / NNOC coordinated to support Nataline paid off as Cigna decided late this afternoon to reverse its previous denial .
...( I ) t is deplorable and appalling that CIGNA needed to have hundreds of people pounding on their doors and besieging them with calls to take the humanitarian step they should have done long before today , " said Geri Jenkins , RN , a member of the CNA / NNOC Council of Presidents , who spoke at the Glendale rally .
Nataline 's mother , Hilda Sarkisyan , expressed her profound thanks to CNA / NNOC .
" We could n't have done this without you helping us to stand up against this insurance company and forcing them to finally do the right thing .
It is not right in this country for it to take a rally , a protest , and a major press conference to get an insurance company to listen . "
" Every politician who thinks the answer to our healthcare crisis is more insurance should stop and think about Nataline Sarkysian , " said ( CNA / NNOC Executive Director Rose Ann ) DeMoro .
" Insurance is not care .
Paying for insurance coverage is not the same as assuring you will receive appropriate care , even when recommended by a physician as it was for Nataline .
Insurance corporations profit by denying care to the sick , and that is no way to run a humane healthcare system . "
UPDATE # 2 : A heartbreaking end to the story .
Literally as Cigna was reversing their position , Nataline took a turn for the worst .
Her family opted to remove her from life support and she passed away this evening .
Our hearts and prayers go to her family .
Games and Math go really well together , although a lot of people do n't make that connection .
Math really can be fun if some of its principles are taught through games .
We see this in quite a number of free and commercial video games that teach math concepts , typically through solving arithmetic problems .
In this article I present 8 games of a different variety .
They use paper and pencil , are free , are easy to learn , and teach logical thinking and strategy that involves looking ahead .
They 're great fun and they can usually be played by young and old alike .
And , I 've bet there are some games on my list that many of you have never heard of .
After reading this list you may realize that many of the games that we typically buy we can easily make ourselves with paper , pencil , index cards , and maybe some dice .
For the games that require graph paper read on to learn how to easily generate your own on your computer with a free web - based program and then print them out .
Here 's my list .
Please let us all know of others paper and pencil games you know of .
1. Battleship .
This is a great two - player game that gives practice in grids and their related coordinate system .
Each player secretly draws ships on a grid .
Different ships have different dimensions .
Then each player has to guess all of the coordinates of each of the opponent 's ships .
There 's a popular commercial version of this game but you can make your own games with graph paper and pencil .
You can save yourself some money on graph paper by printing your own using the great free graph paper web - site .
Wikipedia has instructions for playing battleship .
2. Sprouts .
This is an incredibly fun two person game , with very simple rules and devel oping a strategy for the game serves as a great exploration for the mathematically inclined .
The game involves connecting dots with curves while not violating some basic conditions .
This game was popularized by Martin Gardner .
I wrote a review of the CD that contains all of Gardner 's articles from 30 years of his column in Scientific American .
The CD is a remarkable source of many many Math games and diversion , including a number on this list and I highly recommend it for the mathematically curious .
It 'll take me years to explore only a fraction of its content .
You can learn to play sprouts from this Wikipedia article .
3. Bulls and Cows .
This is the precursor to the game of Mastermind , whose object is to guess the opponent 's secret code .
Each player makes up their own numeric code and give hints to the opponent about the number of correct digits , either in the correct position ( called a " bull " ) or in the wrong position ( " cow " ) .
Once again , Wikipedia has instructions .
You , could , of course , play the full - blown version of Matermind with paper and pencil using these Wikipedia instructions .
Bulls and Cows and Mastermind are very interesting games from the perspective of developing a strategy , especially one that can be programmed into a computer .
4. Nim .
Nim is another two - player game popularized by Martin Gardner .
There are a number of variations to this very basic game with a strategy that 's straightforward to implement , once it 's learned .
The game involves players taking turns removing objects from one of a number of heaps of similar objects .
Each player must take one or more objects from only one of the heaps .
The player who is forced to take the last object loses .
While this is , strictly speaking , not a paper and pencil game , it can be played on paper if one represents objects and heaps as lines surrounded by circles .
Lines can be crossed out as they are " removed " from a heap .
If one has toothpicks or matches on hand the game can certainly be more easily played with those as objects .
More information about nim can be found in .... Wikipedia .
5 . Hex .
Here 's another game popularized by Martin Gardner that 's not strictly a paper and pencil game but can easily be turned into one .
The game is played on a board made up of hexagons .
The goal is to connect your playing pieces from one side of the board to the other while keeping your opponent from doing the same .
Read the instructions for play at Wikipedia then make and print your own hex graph paper for the board using the free hexagonal graph paper generator , use symbols for each of the two players , like O and X , instead of colored pieces and you 're set .
6. Connect Four .
Here 's a game that can be easily turned into a paper and pencil game with a small amount of imagination and paying attention to " gravity " during play .
The goal is for two players , taking turns , to connect four disks of their color in a row .
Using graph paper one can make a board .
Then , during play , keep the rule in mind that you must place a piece " on top " of other pieces , just as if you had dropped them into one of the slots in the board game .
Yes , Wikipedia gives instructions .
7. Racetrack .
Racetrack is a game I have very fond memories of playing in high scho ol .
It was written about by Martin Gardner although I 'm not sure that it 's particularly well - known .
It 's a fantastic game for learning very basic physics principles of vectors , velocity and acceleration .
But , do n't let the physics scare you .
You wo n't notice any physics or Math here unless you 're looking for it .
The game is played by two people , using a sheet of graph paper on which one of the players draws a " racetrack . "
The players " move " around the track , drawing line segments to mark their movement , following simple rules , and trying not to " crash " .
This really is an amazing game !
Read all about it , rules and variations , in Wikipedia .
8. Dots and Boxes .
This is a very simple game , suitable for the younger ones .
Using graph paper each of two players taks turns drawing line segments connecting two adjacent corners .
The goal is to make boxes .
The player who is able to make the most boxes wins .
The game is easy to play and a little bit of strategy goes a really long way .
See Wikipedia 's article for instructions , strategy and variations .
One other game , which I wo n't count in this list ( a free bonus ! ) is one I wrote about before , a fun arithmetic game that sparks exploration .
It 's another paper and pencil game that helps kids to enjoy exploring simple patterns with numbers .
There you have it .
8 really fun games ( plus the bonus game ) , no expensive purchases , all easy to learn and easy to play .
Plus , there 's a tremendous depth to these games .
Play them , enjoy them , and figure out their strategies .

The interesting web page is one that gives instructions for a novel game called Connect Capture . ]
Germany : Huge security operation exposed in wake of G8 summit
By Marius Heuser
20 June 2007
The G8 summit in Heiligendamm in northern Germany , held June 6 - 8 , has come and gone .
It is only now that the meeting of world leaders at the Baltic Sea coast is over that a full picture is emerging more clearly of the massive security operation that accompanied it .
The large - scale police raids against summit protesters in May , the 12 - kilometre security fence surrounding the location , and the largest mobilisation of German police ( 17,000 ) since the end of the Second World War made the headlines .
However , there were other critical aspects of the security operation that received scant attention by the media .
This includes the deployment of the army and air force against demonstrators , the detention for several hours of demonstrators in metal cages reminiscent of the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , and numerous attacks on the right to protest .
When one looks at the security operation as a whole , a picture emerges of a gigantic rehearsal for a civil war , an operation that was systematically prepared for over a year and a half , and whose methods and measures either tested or fully overstepped legal boundaries .
German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( Christian Democratic Union — CDU ) has consistently campaigned to permit the deployment of the military inside Germany , but his efforts have been rebuffed so far by both parliament and the German Constitutional Court .
However , he was finally able to test his proposals during the G8 summit .
Claiming it was merely a matter of providing “ administrative assistance , ” Tornado surveillance planes previously used in Afghanistan flew at 150 metres above the protesters ’ camp taking photographs .
This was probably also the rationale for the many armoured scout vehicles stationed around Heiligendamm .
Some of the 1,100 army soldiers deployed were also used against demonstrators .
Given this massive security operation , the violent clashes between the police and demonstrators that occurred on June 2 in Rostock can be seen in a new light .
Pictures of stone - throwers and exaggerated reports of police injuries served to justify the security measures and the brutal reaction of the police against peaceful demonstrators .
In a June 7 article ( See “ Anti -G8 demonstration violence in Rostock : questions and contradictions ” ) , the WSWS questioned the degree to which undercover police agents played a role in the clashes .
We referred to media reports stating that undercover agents had systematically infiltrated protest groups since the start of the year .
It has since become known that the police also infiltrated the so - called anarchist “ black bloc ” group .
In one case that has come to light , demonstrators were able to unmask and identify one of these persons as a police officer .
As a result , the Mecklenburg police admitted that some of its members were operating in plainclothes .
Security preparations for the G8 summit were initiated one and a half years ago by the Interior Ministry of Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania , when it established the Special Assembly Organisation ( BAO ) , known as “ Kavala , ” to prepare and coordinate the largest police operation in the history of postwar Germany .
Kavala is the name of a northern Greek city , which , like Heiligendamm , is also known as the white city on the sea .
By March 2007 , Kavala had 367 police officers .
During the G8 operation , they were accompanied by a further 570 administrative staff .
The methods used by Kavala against demonstrators are not those of a democratic state , but rather one under martial law .
This found its most extreme expression in the construction of an internment camp , in which more than 1,000 people were held under oppressive conditions .
The reports , photos and video footage of this camp that found their way into the public domain are shocking .
In sweltering conditions , demonstrators were held for hours on end in cages that were erected inside a large hall .
Every drink of water , every visit to the toilet had to be requested and was registered in writing .
The pictures were distressingly reminiscent of the US prison camp at Guantanamo .
According to estimates by the Republican Association of Lawyers ( RAV ) , 95 percent of those held were arrested without a reason .
Most of them were released immediately after finally appearing before a magistrate .
According to their lawyers , those who were able to have their cases heard quickly only managed to do so because they wanted to escape the inhuman conditions .
The RAV issued the following description of the situation inside the camp : “ Metal cages were built inside a large industrial hall on premises owned by Siemens , each one holding up to 20 people .
The temporary cells were approximately 25 square metres in size and the interiors could be seen from all sides , including from above .
Men and women were placed in adjacent cells , where they could see one another .
Those detained had to sleep on the floor , on 1 - centimetre - thick rubber mats .
The hall was permanently lit at night and was under constant video surveillance .
In addition , police regularly patrolled the cells from above .
It was not possible for the detainees to have showers .
They only received a piece of bread , a slice of meat and when requested , water .
The police not only had to document every visit to the toilet , but every time a detainee had some water . ”
Eyewitnesses provided further details of the inhuman treatment inside the cells .
One inmate wrote on the Indymedia web site that he had to wait hours to see a doctor who used a non-sterile needle to prick his finger to determine his blood - sugar level .
After the magistrate discharged him , he still had to remain another seven hours in custody .
One woman reported being threatened ; police took out their batons and amused themselves by pretending to beat her ( see http://de.indymedia.org/2007/06/183093.shtml).
Another casualty of the massive police operation was the right to demonstrate .
The clashes provoked in Rostock between protesters and police were used by the German Constitutional Court to justify banning a march to Heiligendamm , permission for which had been granted in October of last year .
In their ruling , the judges explained that although the actions of the police had bordered on illegality , the high number of police injuries and the immense damage done to property meant the demonstration had to be banned .
However , without court approval , Kavala prevented other peaceful and approved demonstrations from taking place .
On the Monday before the summit , police attempted to prevent a registered demonstration for immigrant rights from occurring .
The Kavala public relations department later said that police had suspected 2,500 anarchists were among the protesters .
This announcement was contradicted by the police officer in charge at the scene , who said that no crime had been committed by the demonstrators .
Nevertheless , he received an order from above to prevent the protesters from marching .
In the end , the officer was told to break up the march .
Another method used to torpedo democratic rights was the use of violence against peaceful demonstrators .
During the conflict in Rostock on June 2 , the police repeatedly moved rioters in the direction of protesters and used tear gas and water cannon against those who were not involved .
Although the police apprehended hardly any of the perpetrators , many demonstrators reported arbitrary violence used against peaceful protesters .
A photo sent to the RAV , which later appeared in the media , documented the brutality of the police .
It showed a demonstrator lying on the ground with a white T - shirt tightly wrapped around his head .
Standing around him are heavily armed police .
The anonymous eyewitness who took the photo reported that the victim was struck down by police and his head banged against the pavement several times .
The police placed the T - shirt around his head and neck .
The police engaged in an orgy of violence , the witness said .
On Thursday , June 7 , a completely peaceful blockade of the western gate of the perimeter fence was dispersed with water cannons , tear gas and batons .
Numerous victims reported receiving serious injuries , and two had to be carried from the scene .
The injuries were not accidental but deliberately inflicted .
A woman was blinded in one eye because the water cannons had not been aimed at the demonstrators ’ legs , but at their heads .
One protester wrote on the Indymedia web site that he had been assaulted during police questioning .
The police had made serious threats to him , saying , “ ‘ I would really love to smash your lights out , it would be worth the complaint , ” followed by , “ If you do lodge a complaint , we ’ll strike you from the list , take you to a forest and no one will notice anything ” ( see : http://de.indymedia.org/2007/06/183412.shtml).
These reports are not just isolated cases .
The RAV summarised : “ Some of our clients ’ faces were still black and blue as a result of the beatings they had received while in custody .
This caused magistrates to ask worried questions . ”
In addition , hundreds of people were banned from demonstrating altogether .
For many , it was enough just to be wearing wear sunglasses or a scarf .
Many of these bans were later viewed as disproportionate by the Constitutional Court .
Many were banned for several days , and even from the entire city and surrounding area .
Arbitrary and brutal searches were also conducted .
On the Tuesday before the demonstration in Rostock , police stopped and searched an entire bus filled with protesters .
When the police could not find anything incriminating , all 42 passengers were taken into custody and treated as criminals .
Among them were a one - and - a - half - year - old baby and her mother .
All were finally released from the internment camp at midnight .
Medics , journalists and lawyers were systematically prevented from conducting their work , in some cases violently .
The RAV reported that Dietmar Sasse , a lawyer on his way to see his clients in the internment camp , was stopped by police and his car searched .
He was hit and dragged over the road for 100 metres .
On the same day , another lawyer was violently separated from his client who had just been arrested .
The freelance photographer Daniel Rosenthal was arrested without cause and was only later released after appearing before a magistrate .
In order to divert attention from the violent acts of the police , to deceive the public and to justify the massive security operation , the police and media spread a web of disinformation .
Kavala , for example , released absurd figures about the violent clashes that occurred on June 2 , claiming that 3,000 violent culprits had attacked police , injuring 433 of them , 30 seriously .
Later , it was revealed that only two police officers needed medical attention in hospital , the common standard for considering whether somebody has been seriously injured .
Many police were injured after the wind blew their own tear gas back towards them .
The figure of 3,000 violent offenders also seems to be plucked out of the air .
In the numerous video accounts of the demonstrators that have been posted on the Internet , only a small number of rioters can be seen , totalling perhaps just a few hundred .
The 3,000 number seems to be based on the number of those in the so - called black bloc from which the rioters came , but who were under no circumstance all rioters .
Many demonstrators in this group were only concerned about the treatment of illegal immigrants and sought to demonstrate peacefully .
The organisers of the black bloc had made their position against violence clear during the demonstrations .
From the very beginning , the tactics of the police were based on confrontation .
Eyewitnesses reported seeing “ anarchists ” who did not appear to fit the usual profile for such protesters and who later disappeared in the direction of the police lines .
The police later confirmed that undercover agents were working among the demonstrators .
On Wednesday , during a blockade of a checkpoint , activists recognised a police officer from Bremen dressed in the black clothes of the black bloc and mixing among them .
According to Henning Oben from the BlockG8 group , this officer , along with four others , had previously encouraged anarchists from the Czech Republic to perform violent acts .
When the five men were confronted by protesters , four of them fled .
The officer from Bremen was , however , detained and handed over to police , then mixing in with their ranks .
The spokesman for Kavala , Ulf Claassen , initially rejected all such accusations .
He was quoted by Spiegel Online , saying , “ The fact is that we are not missing any officers .
They are not Kavala police officers . ”
In his opinion , this sort of thing “ does not belong in a democratic state .
It would be unacceptable and unreasonable . ”
Demonstrators reacted by threatening to publish pictures of the officer if the police did not admit that he was in fact an undercover agent .
In a press release on the Friday during the summit , the Mecklenburg police finally admitted that the man was in fact a police officer from Bremen who was active as an “ undercover agent . ”
The press release stated : “ The operation of such civilian forces is part of the de-escalation strategy and serves exclusively to help identify violent demonstrators . ”
There is no reason to believe the police version rather than the eyewitness reports .
The police only admitted that an officer from Bremen was working in the demonstrators ’ midst after the scale of the evidence proved incontrovertible .
Claassen had earlier attempted to justify this avoidance of the truth .
After the press release admitted the operation of undercover agents , he explained , “ This is the new state of things .
What I said yesterday , concerned yesterday .
What I say today , concerns today . ”
During the week of the summit , the police systematically issued and spread false reports .
The strategy of the police could not have succeeded if not for the assistance provided by the media .
After the street battles in Rostock , radio , television and the press were filled with horror stories about the events at Rostock harbour .
They described “ civil war conditions , ” in which demonstrators had fought the police with “ untold brutality . ”
The tabloid Bild newspaper even ran the headline “ Do you want to cause deaths , you crazies ? ”
Even the liberal media like the Frankfurter Rundschau and the Tageszeitung uncritically repeated the police reports .
Hardly a single commentator questioned the myth of the police ’s “ de- escalation ” strategy .
The media simply repeated nearly every police untruth .
It was only after the end of the summit that critical comments started to appear .
The media campaign took a bizarre form regarding a speech given by the well - known anti-globalisation critic and winner of the Right Livelihood Award , Walden Bello .
Bello said to demonstrators assembled at the end of the march : “ Two years ago , they said we should n’t bring the war into the discussion .
We should just concentrate on fighting poverty .
But I say :
We have to bring the war in here .
For without peace there can be no fight against poverty . ”
While Bello had said that the Iraq war should be made a theme of the demonstrators , the German Press Agency ( DPA ) went on to characterise him as a “ spokesman of the militant scene , ” putting the following words in his mouth : “ We have to bring war into this demonstration .
We can achieve nothing by peaceful means . ”
This quote spread like wildfire throughout the media ; Spiegel - Online even used it as the title for one of their articles .
Other newspapers embellished their stories , using the false quotation to embellish their own fantasies .
The Schweizer Zeitung wrote : “ One of the 3,000 militants , according to police estimates , climbed onto the stage with the slogan : ‘ We have to bring war into this demonstration . ’ ”
Even though the speech was posted online as a video within minutes and Attac publicly repudiated the false quote , it took three days until the DPA corrected the article and apologised to demonstrators .
VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - The Queen Charlotte Islands off Canada ’s Pacific
Coast were rattled by the third strong undersea earthquake in less than a week on Wednesday , but no damage or injuries were reported .
The 6.1 magnitude quake was centered about 185 km ( 116 miles ) south - southeast of Queen Charlotte City , British Columbia , and 626 km ( 391 miles ) northwest of Vancouver , according to Environment Canada .
It did not prompt a tsunami warning .
The earthquake - prone region was hit by two 6.5 magnitude undersea quakes on Saturday , neither of which caused damage in the relatively unpopulated area .
So , I ’ve been sitting around for the last day or so feeling all depressed .
In part because Obama lost in New Hampshire and my dreams of a tidal wave of unity sweeping the nation were dashed but mostly because of my lack of faith in the system .
As has been reported elsewhere , Clinton performed significantly better in precincts that were counted by the Diebold optical scanning machines than she did in precincts that counted votes by hand .
After a long history of disliking Diebold strongly and a short period , prior to New Hampshire , of being nervous about their involvement , it was a kick in the guts to see those results .
The most stressful thing is that the results might be 100 % accurate , but I have no way to know that .
So that got me to thinking .
And thinking .
I should have been sleeping , I just could n’t stop thinking about it .
I have come to the conclusion that the secrecy of the process is the problem .
If secrecy ’s the problem , let ’s provide an option to remove the secrecy .
Let ’s allow allow people to vote publicly if they choose .
In my proposed system , if you want to vote secretly , nothing changes .
You do everything just like you would right now .
You walk into the polling place , your name gets checked off and you go do your thing .
However , and this is where it gets interesting , if you want to publish your vote , you go through a different process .
Your vote gets associated with your name / ID number / whatever , you get a printed receipt with details identifying you and how you voted .
Your name goes up on a big , public screen for you to cross check against your receipt and off you go happy that , once again , you ’ve done your bit to protect democracy .
There can be as many levels of verification here as are necessary , I have n’t really thought about it that much .
The important thing is that your vote is recorded publicly and that you verify the vote that is recorded .
There does n’t seem to be any downside for the people who do n’t wish to have their vote published .
They ’d be in the same situation they ’re in now .
That being said , I think that many , many people would happily publish their vote to safeguard their democratic system .
I would .
Most young people I know would do it in a heartbeat .
In fact , I ca n’t think of anyone who would n’t have their vote published .
Anyway , it ’s really not that different than having political signs in the front yard of your house , is it ?
When you have bumper stickers or posters or signs , people know who you voted for anyway .
This way not only will others know who you voted for , you will finally be confident that you know who you voted for .
I have received a couple of criticisms of this idea and I think they ’re both pretty weak .
Firstly , someone claimed that votes could be bought because the buyer would be able to verify the sale .
This could feasibly happen on a small scale , but it just would n’t be worth it .
If we look at the New Hampshire situation , we ’re talking about a discrepancy of tens of thousands of votes .
For a vote buying scam to be a serious threat you need to convince me that someone can make contact with tens of thousands of individuals , offer money for their votes , pay the money after the election and not come to the attention of any authorities anywhere .
So , when it comes to vote buying , I ai n’t buying it .
The second concern was about voter intimidation .
If people ’s votes are public then they can be threatened , or strong - armed into voting a certain way .
Again , I ’m not buying .
The numbers of people involved are the issue again .
You need to be able to make a credible threat against tens of thousands of individuals and not have anyone report the blackmail to the authorities .
That ’s simply unrealistic .
I think the problem here is that people are sweating the small stuff at the expense of the massive .
Yes , you might have some tiny incidents of voter manipulation , but there will be vastly less potential for vote manipulation than exists today , under the broken , secret system .
Shine the light in , let the cockroaches scurry away .
Down with secrecy !

You ’ve done all the right stuff , but your site does n’t look or work as it should in the latest browsers .
Article Continues Below
You ’ve written valid XHTML and CSS .
You ’ve used the W3C standard Document Object Model ( DOM ) to manipulate dynamic page elements .
Yet , in browsers designed to support these very standards , your site is failing .
A faulty DOCTYPE is likely to blame .
This little article will provide you with DOCTYPEs that work , and explain the practical , real–world effect of these seemingly abstract tags .
WHY A DOCTYPE ?#section2
Per HTML and XHTML standards , a DOCTYPE ( short for “ document type declaration ” ) informs the validator which version of ( X ) HTML you ’re using , and must appear at the very top of every web page .
DOCTYPEs are a key component of compliant web pages : your markup and CSS wo n’t validate without them .
As mentioned in previous ALA articles ( and in other interesting places ) , DOCTYPES are also essential to the proper rendering and functioning of web documents in compliant browsers like Mozilla , IE5 / Mac , and IE6 / Win .
A recent DOCTYPE that includes a full URI ( a complete web address ) tells these browsers to render your page in standards –compliant mode , treating your ( X ) HTML , CSS , and DOM as you expect them to be treated .
Using an incomplete or outdated DOCTYPE — or no DOCTYPE at all — throws these same browsers into “ Quirks ” mode , where the browser assumes you ’ve written old - fashioned , invalid markup and code per the depressing industry norms of the late 1990s .
In this setting , the browser will attempt to parse your page in backward –compatible fashion , rendering your CSS as it might have looked in IE4 , and reverting to a proprietary , browser –specific DOM .
( IE reverts to the IE DOM ; Mozilla and Netscape 6 revert to who knows what . )
Clearly , this is not what you want .
But it is often what you ’ll get , due to the preponderance of incorrect or incomplete DOCTYPE information this article hopes to correct .
( Note : The Opera browser does not play by these rules ; it always attempts to render pages in standards –compliant mode .
Go , Opera !
On the other hand , Opera does not yet offer solid support for the W3C DOM .
But they ’re working on it . )
{ Ed : Since this article was first published , Opera has delivered the DOM - compliant Opera 7 browser.}
WHERE HAVE ALL THE DOCTYPES GONE ?#section3
Since DOCTYPES are vital to the proper functioning of web standards in browsers , and since W3C is a leading creator of web standards , you might expect W3 C ’s website to provide a listing of proper DOCTYPEs , and you might also expect to be able to find this information quickly and easily in a single location .
But as of this writing , you can ’t .
{ Ed. Prompted in part by this article , the W3C now lists standard DOCTYPEs on its site .
You will find the listing a few screens into the W3C tutorial , “ My Web site is standard .
And yours ? ” }
W3.org is not A List Apart , WebReference , or Webmonkey .
It ’s not intended to help web designers , developers , and content folks get up to speed on the latest technological recommendations and practices .
That ’s not its job .
W3C does publish a series of tutorials , though most web developers are unaware of it .
Mainly , though , W3 C ’s site houses a collection of proposals , drafts , and Recommendations , written by geeks for geeks .
And when I say geeks , I do n’t mean ordinary web professionals like you and me .
I mean geeks who make the rest of us look like Grandma on the first day She ’s Got Mail . ™
You can search for DOCTYPEs all day at w3.org without finding one page that lists them all .
And when you do hunt down a DOCTYPE ( generally in relation to a particular Recommendation or Working Draft ) , it ’s often one that wo n’t work on your site .
Scattered throughout W3 C ’s site are DOCTYPEs with missing URIs , and DOCTYPEs with relative URIs that point to documents on W3 C ’s own site .
Once removed from W3 C ’s site and used on your web pages , these URIs point to non–existent documents , thus fouling up your best efforts and the browser’s .
For instance , many sites sport this DOCTYPE , copied and pasted directly from w3.org :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " DTD / xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
If you look at the last part of the DOCTYPE ( “ DTD / xhtml1- strict.dtd ” ) , you ’ll see that it is a relative link to a document on W3 C ’s site .
Since that document is on W3 C ’s site but not yours , the URI is useless to the browser .
The DOCTYPE you ’d actually want to use is :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
Notice that the latter DOCTYPE includes a complete URI at the end of the tag .
Since the tag provides a valid location on the web , the browser knows where to find it , and will render your document in standards –compliant mode .
DOCTYPES THAT WORK #section4
So what DOCTYPEs should we use ?
Glad you asked .
The following complete DOCTYPEs are the ones we need :
HTML 4.01 Strict , Transitional , Frameset#section5

NEXT STEPS #section8
How can you help improve support for standards on the web ?
Besides bookmarking this page ( and copying and pasting these DOCTYPEs for your own use ) , if your web editor inserts DOCTYPEs , you might want to check them out and compare them to the list above .
Many well –intentioned software makers have cut and pasted incomplete DOCTYPEs from W3C into their software .
Result : when you use these programs ’ built–in functionality to insert DOCTYPEs in your pages , the browsers go into Quirks mode , undoing all your hard work .
It ’s worth contacting the folks who make your favorite authoring package , showing them the proper DOCTYPEs , and politely requesting them to address this issue in an incremental upgrade .
( In some cases , you may also be able to modify your editor yourself . )
COMING SOON #section9
We have every reason to believe that W3 C ’s site will soon sport a handy listing of accurate , usable DOCTYPES and other essential information in an easy –to–find location .
In fact , Karl Dubost , Conformance Manager of W3 C ’s Quality Assurance team , contributed to the information in this little article .
Likewise , when The Web Standards Project relaunches ( real soon ) , it will also provide this information .
{ Ed. note : The Web Standards Project relaunched in late 2002.}
But sites are being designed and built every day , and you need this information now — so there it is .
Happy authoring and rendering !
CIA may have more interrogation tapes , detainee 's lawyer suggests John Byrne
Published : Tuesday December 11 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This White House tacitly approved destruction of CIA waterboarding tapes , former official says Contrary to the official CIA line , the lawyer for a captured prisoner revealed that her client reported seeing videocameras in interrogation rooms and on the wall of the prison in 2003 -- a year after the CIA said interrogations had stopped , suggesting there may be yet more tapes .
" The former prisoner who reported seeing cameras , Muhammad Bashmilah of Yemen , was seized by Jordanian intelligence agents in 2003 and turned over to the C.I.A. , according to an investigation by Amnesty International , the human rights advocacy organization , " the New York Times reported Tuesday .
" He was flown from Jordan to Afghanistan in October 2003 and held there until April 2004 , when he was flown by plane and helicopter to a C.I.A. jail in an unidentified country , Amnesty found .
Mr. Bashmilah and two other Yemeni men held with him were flown to Yemen in May 2005 and later released . "
" Meg Satterthwaite , a director of the International Human Rights Clinic at New York University who is representing Mr. Bashmilah in a lawsuit , said Mr. Bashmilah described cameras both in his cells and in interrogation rooms , some on tripods and some on the wall , " the paper added .
She said his descriptions of his imprisonment , in hours of conversation in Yemen and by phone this year , were lucid and detailed .
This comes in contrast to a statement from CIA Director Gen.
Michael Hayden , who told agency employees in a message Tuesday that videotaping stopped in 2002 ,  after officials determined that its documentary reporting was full and exacting , removing any need for tapes . 
What 's more , the White House was pressed by the agency on numerous occasions as to whether the existing tapes -- showing waterboarding of detainees -- should be kept .
Even after two years of debate among government agencies , the White House declined to order the CIA to retain videotapes showing hundreds of hours of interrogations of two terror suspects , according to officials who spoke under condition of anonymity in Tuesday 's New York Times .
 They never told us ,  Hell , no ,  the source , described as a former senior intelligence official , said .
 If somebody had said ,  You cannot destroy them ,  we would not have destroyed them . 
The White House and the Justice Department advised against destroying the tapes in 2003 .
But after two years of inter-agency deliberation and CIA pressure on the White House to deliver a clear answer , the tapes were destroyed after clearance from lawyers from the CIA 's clandestine service .
Jose Rodriguez , the former chief of the then - Directorate of Operations , authorized the tapes destruction .
The official quoted said Rodriguez destroyed the tapes because he was concerned for the safety of the CIA agents shown on the recordings .

I could never quite put my finger on what was so troubling about the guy , however his sagging numbers rendered it a minor curiosity .
But his sudden and stellar rise among the GOP 's pack of Grim Reapers made it a trifle more disconcerting ; and then , yesterday morning , appearing on " This Week , " he cleared it up for me .
Mike Huckabee is a lying weasel .
Sure , he'd have to be some measure of a lying weasel to make it in presidential politics , but Huckabee lies with an artfulness that would make Dick Nixon envious , and probably has Bill Clinton convinced that it comes from something in Hope , Ark . 's water .
He 's so damn good at it .
You instinctively suspect he 's lying as you listen to him , but his lying is so melded with nuggets of homey ingenuousness , the two become indistinguishable and fold into only the latter .
But yesterday he tripped himself up , right smack on national television .
Asked by George Stephanoupolos if the bizarrely evil Dick Morris is consulting the candidate , Huckabee hummed and hawed as though Morris was merely a passing acquaintance .
" Dick ’s one of the smartest political minds , as you well know , " said Huckabee , describing Morris in a way in which the interviewer would likely differ , seeing that Stephanopoulos , in his White House memoirs ( All Too Human ) , chose to characterize this smart political mind as a " small sausage of a man " with " the look of a B - movie mob lawyer " -- and , in Stephanoupolos ' most succinct estimation , simply an " insincere prick . "
Huckabee then kicked in gear the toothy grin and downhome , aw - shucks evasiveness : " I ’ve known Dick for , gosh , almost , I guess , 18 , 17 years ....
But Dick is not available for doing political consulting work .
Frankly , I wish he was , because he ’s a brilliant political mind , and I still consider him a friend .
I run into him from time to time , or I may talk to him .
But I probably talk to 30 , 40 journalists a week .
Most of them I talk to more than I talk to Dick Morris , and I have n’t talked to him in a while . "
Well , Nixon did n't " consult " with Donald Segretti or the White House Plumbers , either .
But Mike , you do n't have to just " wish " that Morris were available for consulting work , because , as the Politico reports , your own staff says he is .
In fact , Mike -- and this is indeed embarrassing for both of us , having to remind you like this -- the Politico says you 've had " private conversations with Dick Morris , according to [ your own ] aides . "
And the paper names them .
" Here is what is known : Morris and Huckabee confer with one another , according to two top Huckabee advisers — campaign manager Chip Saltsman and [ pollster and media consultant ] Dick Dresner . "
The latter of that staffing twosome seems less than happy about it .
Said Dresner , " A lot of people think he ’s a brilliant guy .
But for every three ideas he has , one is brilliant , one will get you in jail and one is just a mess . "
Already , Mike , welcome to the mess .
Because Morris obviously asked you to keep a lid on your relationship -- since he bloviates for Fox News and scribbles for the New York Post ; both without disclosing he 's pimping for you -- and you were dumb enough to go along with his self - serving request .
Welcome , as well , to the big leagues , Mike .
Your front - runner status in Iowa lasted all of about three minutes before you collapsed on national television into a tangled lie .
And now we also know who 's behind those unctuous TV ads you 're running that play the religion card against former front - runner Mitt Romney , who , if he 's half as sly as he seems , will pounce on the issue of rancid religious bigotry that you and Dick Morris so blatantly handed him .
You were never much more than vice - presidential material for Rudy , and your answer on his latest scandal -- that the provable charges were but a " cheap shot " -- showed you 're still shooting for pretty much just that .
And your stand on some of the issues -- such as favoring a constitutional amendment on marriage and the elimination of the income tax -- could be written off merely as everyday synaptic dysfunction , Republican - style , to survive the radical primaries .
Nevertheless for a while you had something going there with the smiling , joking , straight - talking , I 'm - just - myself honesty shtick , which was deceptively refreshing .
But you blew it in no time flat -- demonstrating on national television that you 're just another lying weasel .
Elegant code is often efficient .
Think of the heap data structure , for example , which always remains exactly as sorted as it needs to be , making it perfect for modelling priority queues .
It ’s both elegant and efficient — and dazzlingly so .
This article discusses the relationship between elegance and efficiency in more depth , and asks the question : Can inefficient code ever be elegant ?
First , we should consider what ’s meant by “ elegant code ” .
Anthony Williams discusses this very subject in a recent blog post ( which is what got me thinking about it in the first place ) .
Up front he admits the search for elegance is subjective and that the factors he lists are all “ my opinion ” .
He also points out his list is not exhaustive .
Nonetheless , it ’s a good starting point , and I ’d like to build on it .
Let ’s start by summarising his list here .
Factors affecting the elegance of software Does it work ?
Is it easy to understand ?
Is it efficient ?
Short functions
Good naming
Clear division of responsibility
High cohesion
Low coupling
Appropriate use of OO and other techniques
Minimal code
I ’m not sure this list completely nails elegance .
For a start , there ’s no mention of appearance — the way the code actually looks , on screen , or in print — which in my opinion is fundamental .
Elegant code looks clean , balanced , self - consistent .
That ’s one of the reasons I like Python : it ’s hard to get away with poorly laid out code .
Scheme , with its minimal syntax , also wins here .
Java stands a good chance of doing well on this front too , thanks to a clearly stated set of coding conventions and excellent IDE support for applying these conventions .
I ’d also say that appropriate and even cunning use of the language ’s standard libraries can add to code ’s elegance .
Williams hints at this with his mention of Minimal Code , though minimalism covers many other things .
As an example , if you ’re using C++ , you should take the time to become familiar with the standard library , and use it whenever possible .
It works .
It ’s efficient .
In fact it embodies pretty much everything Williams lists , with a few notable exceptions ( no one could describe std : : string as minimal , and std:: auto_ptr is notoriously slippery ) .
Use the standard library and you ’ll save yourself code and time , and your own code will be the more elegant for it .
Let ’s return to Scheme to illustrate my point about cunning use of standard libraries and consider exercise 2.46 from the Wizard Book .
Exercise 2.46 .
A two - dimensional vector v running from the origin to a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an x-coordinate and a y - coordinate .
Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor make - vect and corresponding selectors xcor-vect and ycor-vect .
In terms of your selectors and constructor , implement procedures add - vect , sub-vect , and scale - vect that perform the operations vector addition , vector subtraction , and multiplying a vector by a scalar .
An obvious solution would be to model the 2 - D vector as a pair .
( define make - vect cons ) ( define xcor - vect car ) ( define ycor - vect cdr ) ( define ( add - vect v w ) ( make - vect (+ ( xcor-vect v ) ( xcor-vect w ) ) (+ ( ycor - vect v ) ( ycor- vect w ) ) ) ) ( define ( sub - vect v w ) ( make - vect (- ( xcor-vect v ) ( xcor-vect w ) ) (- ( ycor-vect v ) ( ycor- vect w ) ) ) ) ( define ( scale - vect s v ) ( make - vect (* s ( xcor-vect v ) ) (* s ( ycor-vect v ) ) ) )
An elegant alternative builds on Scheme ’s support for complex numbers .
; ; represent 2 - D vect using a complex number ( define make - vect make - rectangular ) ( define xcor - vect real - part ) ( define ycor - vect imag - part ) ( define add- vect +) ( define sub-vect -) ( define scale - vect *) ;; some other vector operations come for free ( define magnitude - vect magnitude ) ( define make - vect - from - polar - coords make - polar ) ( define angle - vect angle )
Elegance and beauty are not the same , though perhaps elegant forms a subset of beautiful .
Elegance carries the additional connotation of simplicity , which itself correlates with minimalism .
If I were forced to select the single item from Williams ’ list most closely aligned to elegance , I ’d go for minimalism : allowed my own choice , it would be simplicity .
Williams notes a couple of ways you can remove to improve :
avoid unnecessary layering
eliminate duplication
We ’ve already added :
use standard libraries
Kevlin Henney gives minimalism more careful attention in a series of articles .
Omit Needless
Code promotes :
Code that is simple and clear , brief and direct .
Henney illustrates his points with some elegant examples which reinforce my own claims about the C++ standard library
As an example , the common task of counting words in a text file or stream can be reduced to a single statement of executable C++ code [ Henney2001c ] when built on the appropriate abstractions : typedef std::istream_iterator<std::string > in ; std::cout << std::distance(in(std::cin ) , in ( ) ) ;
Want to count characters instead ?
typedef std::istreambuf_iterator<char > in ; std::cout << std::distance(in(std::cin ) , in ( ) ) ;
Or lines ?
typedef std::istreambuf_iterator<char > in ; std::cout << std::count(in(std::cin ) , in ( ) , '
' ) ;
These fragments are all compact and fluffless , crisp and essential .
Efficiency comes high on Williams ’ list , right after correctness , which should n’t be a surprise to anyone who writes code for a living .
Surely code which does n’t run fast enough is about as useful as code which does n’t work ?
You could even note that efficiency is yet another aspect of minimalism : in this case , it ’s the machine ’s resource consumption you ’d like to reduce .
I ’m not convinced , though .
It ’s true , many of the most elegant algorithms happen to be efficient too — and may even have arisen from the quest for efficiency .
Thus the standard quicksort algorithm has virtually no space overhead , and as a general purpose sorting algorithm , really ca n’t be beaten .
Similarly the heap , as already mentioned , is a lean clean implementation of a priority queue .
But I do n’t think elegance implies efficiency .
I ’d even suggest that something could be elegant but of no practical use , at least not on today ’s hardware .
The downside of efficiency is that it can be at odds with simplicity and minimalism .
Consider the sad fate of boost : : lexical_cast , a general purpose conversion function .
If I go back to early Boost releases I find code which reads like this .
Excerpt from lexical_cast.hpp , Boost 1.22 template < typename Target , typename Source > Target lexical_cast( Source arg ) { # ifndef BOOST_NO_STRINGSTREAM
std::stringstream interpreter ; # else std:: strstream interpreter ; // for out - of - the - box g++ 2.95.2 # endif Target result ; if (!( interpreter << arg ) || !( interpreter >> result ) || !( interpreter >> std::ws ).eof ( ) ) throw bad_lexical_cast ( ) ; return result ; }
For brevity I ’ve omitted file headers , include guards and the unexceptional definition of boost :: bad_lexical_cast .
Even with these present , the file runs to just 68 lines long , and provides an elegant example of what generic C++ code can do .
The body of lexical_cast itself is a readable one - liner , tainted only by a preprocessor workaround for non-compliant compilers .
Wind forwards to 2007 , and this small stain has spread across the entire library , which , after tuning for correctness , portability and efficiency now weighs in at well over 1 K lines of code .
Here ’s a flavour of the latest greatest lexical_cast , which is far too long to include in its entirety .
Excerpt from lexical_cast.hpp@1.36 namespace detail // lcast_put_unsigned { //
I 'd personally put lcast_put_unsigned in .cpp file if not // boost practice for header - only libraries ( Alexander Nasonov ) .
template < typename T , typename CharT > CharT * lcast_put_unsigned ( T n , CharT * finish ) { CharT thousands_sep = 0 ; #ifdef BOOST_LEXICAL_CAST_ASSUME_C_LOCALE
char const * grouping = " " ; std :: size_t const grouping_size = 0 ; #else std::locale loc ; typedef std::numpunct < CharT > numpunct ; numpunct const& np = BOOST_USE_FACET ( numpunct , loc ) ; std:: string const& grouping = np.grouping ( ) ; std::string::size_type const grouping_size = grouping.size ( ) ; if ( grouping_size ) thousands_sep = np.thousands_sep ( ) ; #endif std::string::size_type group = 0 ; // current group number char last_grp_size = grouping [ 0 ] <= 0 ? CHAR_MAX : grouping [ 0 ] ; // a ) Since grouping is const , grouping [ grouping.size ( ) ] returns 0 . // b)
It 's safe to assume here and below that CHAR_MAX // is equivalent to unlimited grouping : #ifndef BOOST_NO_LIMITS_COMPILE_TIME_CONSTANTS
BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(std::numeric_limits<T>::digits10 < CHAR_MAX ) ; #endif char left = last_grp_size ; do { if ( left == 0 ) { ++ group ; if ( group < grouping_size ) { char const grp_size = grouping [ group ] ; last_grp_size = grp_size <= 0 ?
CHAR_MAX : grp_size ; } left = last_grp_size ; -- finish ; * finish = thousands_sep ; } -- left ; -- finish ; int const digit = static_cast < int > ( n % 10 ) ; int const cdigit = digit + lcast_char_constants < CharT >:: zero ; * finish = static_cast < char >( cdigit ) ; n /= 10 ; } while (n ) ; return finish ; } }
I ’m not saying that the changes to boost : : lexical_cast are bad : after all , users of the library get software which does the right thing more often and more quickly — all without any client - side changes .
That ’s one of the benefits of using a layered software stack .
Rather , I present this as an example of the tension between efficiency and elegance .
Somewhere along the line , an elegant piece of code got buried .
It ’s also interesting that , in this case , even “ does - it - work ” counteracts elegance .
We noted that boost::lexical_cast@v1.22 became tainted in its eagerness to work with legacy compilers .
The current version makes far greater concessions .
It ’s a reminder — as if any were needed — that we programmers have to keep our feet on the ground and aim for pragmatic solutions .
Perfection is rarely possible , elegance occasional .
We ’ve demonstrated the tension between elegance and efficiency , but could blatantly inefficient code ever claim to be elegant ?
The original elegant implementation of lexical_cast may not have been optimally tuned for all possible inputs ( it ’s meant to be generic code , after all ) , but it could hardly be described as inefficient .
We ’re going to develop some code which I ’ll claim is elegant despite being inefficient .
To get us started , let ’s consider another problem we can skin in more than one way : how do we determine if a book forms a lipogram ?
( A lipogram is a piece of text written avoiding the use of a particular character , the letter E for example , and full length books really have been written — and even translated — which adhere to this constraint . )
We ’ll pose the problem in C ++.
Here ’s the function prototype .
#include < string > # include < vector > typedef std:: string word ; typedef std::vector < word > book ; //
Return true if the input text avoids using any characters // in ' avoid ' , false otherwise .
//
Example call : // bool const lipo = is_lipogram ( text , " Ee " ) ; bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) ;
What we have here might be seen as a loop within a loop within a loop : for each word in the book , for each character in that word , check against each character in the string of characters to be avoided .
A match against an avoided character means we know our book is n’t a lipogram , and we can return false ; but if we reach the end of our book without such a match , we can return true .
We can code this up :
typedef word : : const_iterator word_iter ; typedef book :: const_iterator book_iter ; bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) { //
Handle edge case -- empty book if ( text.empty ( ) ) { return true ; } //
Handle edge case -- nothing to avoid if ( avoid.empty ( ) ) { return true ; } for ( book_iter w = text. begin ( ) ; w != text.end ( ) ; ++w ) { for ( word_iter c = w -> begin ( ) ; c != w->end ( ) ; ++c ) { for ( word_iter a = avoid.begin ( ) ; a != avoid.end ( ) ; ++a ) { if ( * c == * a ) { return false ; } } } } return true ; }
This painstaking chunk of code reads like a direct transcription of the way an unfortunate human proof - reader might approach the task , one finger tracking through the text , word by word , character by character , another finger repeatedly working through the characters to be avoided .
It fails the elegance test on a number of counts :
Not minimal .
The edge cases do not merit special treatment .
Normal processing of the ( nested ) main loop handles empty inputs just fine .

Failure to use the standard library .
The std :: string class is big enough to support searches for characters in a string directly , allowing us to remove a couple of layers of nesting .
The class is big enough to support searches for characters in a string directly , allowing us to remove a couple of layers of nesting .
Clumsy .
The function has four separate exit points .
Perhaps none of these charges seem too bad in such a small function , but small functions have a tendency to grow into larger ones , and flaws , in particular , scale rapidly .
Here ’s a standard - library - aware improvement .
bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) { for ( book_iter w = text. begin ( ) ; w != text.end ( ) ; ++w ) { if ( w->find_first_of ( avoid ) != std::string ::npos ) { return false ; } } return true ; }
Many programmers would leave it at that , but I still prefer to re-cast this particular variant as follows :
bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) { book_iter w = text. begin ( ) ; while ( w != text.end ( ) && w->find_first_of( avoid ) == std::string::npos ) { ++w ; } return w == text.end ( ) ; }
Rather than exit as soon as we detect a character in the avoid string , we keep reading as long as there ’s text to read and we ’ve avoided such characters .
There ’s not much in it , especially in such a small function , but my preference is to simplify the control flow .
We can remove the explicit iteration from our code by using the std :: find_if algorithm , which accepts a predicate .
In this case we want to find the first word which is n’t itself a lipogram .
Combining the std::not1 function adaptor with a hand - written class deriving from std::unary_function < std::string const , bool > does the job .
This code demonstrates proper use of the STL predicates and adaptors , but it also reaches the limits of my personal comfort zone for using C++ in a functional programming style .
The price paid for avoiding explicit iteration is just too high ; clever though this code may be , I do n’t find it elegant .
When I first coded up lipogram_word_tester , it derived from std::unary_function < word const & , bool > .
This turns out to be wrong , or at least , it failed to compile with a typically cryptic diagnostic , and I ’m still not sure why !
// Simple functor for use in lipogram algorithms class lipogram_word_tester : public std::unary_function <word const , bool > { public : // Constructor .
Caches a copy of the ' avoid ' parameter .
lipogram_word_tester ( word const & avoid ) : avoid( avoid ) { } //
Function operator returns true if the word being tested // omits characters from the ' avoid ' string , false otherwise .
bool operator ( ) ( word const & to_test ) const { return to_test.find_first_of( avoid ) == std:: string ::npos ; } private : // Private cache of characters to avoid .
word const avoid ; } ; bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) { lipogram_word_tester const word_test ( avoid ) ; return find_if ( text.begin( ) , text.end ( ) , not1 ( word_test ) ) == text.end ( ) ; }
I would expect all four functions presented so far to be similarly efficient in terms of memory , stack , CPU cycles .
A recursive solution may require more stack : it depends on the compiler .
We ’ve now got two functions , and although each comprises just a single expression , the expression forming the body of the recursive helper function , is_lipo ( ) , is tricky .
I would n’t recommend this implementation .
bool is_lipo ( book_iter wb , book_iter we , word const & avoid ) { return wb == we || wb->find_first_of( avoid ) == std:: string ::npos && is_lipo ( ++wb , we , avoid ) ; } bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) { return is_lipo ( text.begin( ) , text.end ( ) , avoid ) ; }
Our final alternative is a clear winner on the three fronts which led us to reject our original implementation : it ’s brief , it leans heavily on the standard library , it has just a single exit point — in fact , is just a single expression .
bool is_lipogram ( book const & text , word const & avoid ) { return accumulate ( text.begin ( ) , text.end ( ) , std::string ( ) ).find_first_of( avoid ) == std::string::npos ; }
Does it qualify as elegant ?
I ’d say so , yes .
Sadly , though , its inefficiency rules it out as a heavy - duty lipogram checker .
The std :: string class is not designed for repeated addition — which is what std :: accumulate does .
Actually none of the C++ lipogram checkers are much use , except in the case when we ’re certain our book is written in 7 - bit ASCII .
A lipogram which avoids the letter E should also avoid its various accented forms : é , è , ê , ë , É , È , Ê , Ë , …
A heavy - duty lipogram checker needs to work in Unicode and , for C++ at least , will have to establish some ground rules for input encoding schemes .
The current C++ standard ( C++98 ) has little to say about Unicode .
We ’d be better off using a more Unicode aware language , such as Java .
Python allows us to create a character stream which accumulates all the characters in all the words , but yields them lazily .
The function below uses itertools .
chain to flatten the input words ( which themselves may be a stream or an in - memory collection ) into a character stream .
The built - in all function reads exactly as far into this stream as it needs to .
In other words , we ’ve got a Python counterpart to our final C++ algorithm which is both efficient ( efficient for Python that is ! ) and equally happy with Unicode and ASCII .
import iterools def is_lipogram ( words , avoid ) : return all ( ch not in avoid for ch in itertools .
chain ( * words ) )

Mounting federal earmarks fund ' scores ' of religious groups Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday November 1 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Earmarks setting aside federal funds for religious organizations -- including Christian groups openly focused on conversions and missionary work -- are on the rise in appropriations bills in both the US House and Senate .
According to analysis from Roll Call , which reviewed the contents of appropriations bills in the 2008 fiscal year , " scores of religious organizations across the country are being singled out ... from earmarks for local Catholic Charities USA organizations to funding for research programs at private universities to faith - based drug treatment and jobs programs . "
Although the paper points out that the bulk of the money for such groups is specifically funneled to secular projects , some of the funds are targeted at organizations " whose primary mission is evangelical . "
The uptick in such earmarks has some activist organizations , such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State , concerned about a perceived increase in the blurring of the lines between religion and government .
" The trend of earmarking federal funding for faith - based organizations is a real problem , " Dana Sher , the group 's state legislative counsel , told Roll Call .
" Under the Constitution , government funding cannot be used to endorse religion ; it can not be used for religious activities ; and it can not be used to construct buildings for religious purposes . "
Other watchdog organizations are also critical of the practice , citing what they believe are inherent dangers in Congress hand - picking faith - based causes it deems worthy of funding .
" Earmarks are about picking winners and losers , and it gets more touchy when religion comes into it , " Steve Ellis , the vice president for programs of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense , said .
" That starts raising red flags . "
One earmark , proposed by Sen. David Vitter ( R - LA ) consisted of a " $ 100,000 provision to fund a science education program by the Louisiana Family Forum , " according to Roll Call .
" The LFF has long opposed the teaching of evolution - only science curricula in state schools , and the grant would have gone toward a project to encourage schools to teach creationist theories of development as well . "
Vitter later bowed to pressure from the ACLU and others , removing that specific earmark .
Americans United for the Separation of Church and State also highlights government funding for the the Christian ministry World Impact , Inc. , which received $ 1.9 million in earmarked money this year " from California , Kansas and Missouri Members of the House and Senate . "
On its website , World Impact describes itself as " a Christian missions organization dedicated to ministering God 's love in the inner cities of America .
Its purpose is to honor and glorify God and delight in Him in the inner cities by knowing God and making Him known . "
The group also provides tutoring , vocational training and drug treatment programs .

Lately , quite a few people have been asking me about roadkill .
So I ’m going to say a few words about it .
Not that I eat it that much .
At most it constitutes 1 - 5 % of my diet throughout the year .
Also , I would rarely if ever actively go out searching for it .
Nevertheless , what I do want to say about roadkill is in large measure addressed by this wonderful video that I found on the web recently .
Have a look first before we get down to some waffle and something more useful : the practicalities and pitfalls of roadkill eating .
Why eat roadkill ?
Why indeed ?!
Does eating roadkill simply represent a somewhat quirky or peculiar dimension to the forage / freegan / self - sufficient lifestyle ?
Maybe .
For me it ’s a simple equation : I love animals therefore I do n’t eat them ( roadkill excepted ) .
I do n’t want them killed for me to eat , nor do I wish to kill them .
Of course , no doubt a strong intellectual argument could be used to support this position on moral grounds , or we could talk about it from a spiritual point of view , relating it to such concepts as karma and ahimsa– maybe some other time .
The truth is I am sentimental ; it ’s an emotional thing .
Huge Fearnley - Whittingstall has written about roadkill ( see his A Cook on the Wild Side p.47 ) and about meat in general .
See , for instance .
His position is one that I can understand and respect .
His emphasis is on good animal husbandry , welfare and respect and , although you may think that , ultimately , killing an animal for food is not in the least bit respectful of that animal it can , in a sense , be so - at least relatively speaking .
For me the least hypocritical position , and the position that gives you the greatest connection to , and understanding of the animal you wish to consume , is to only eat animals that you yourself have hunted and killed .
Emotionally , though , I can not do it !
Perhaps , though , the future is heading not towards a reconnection with the food , including meat , that we eat , but a radical and horrific disconnection .
Is this what we really want ?
Anyway , occasionally I do like to eat meat .
Also ….. , the fact is , I am very fond of our native wildlife and am extremely distressed at the number of animals and insects needlessly killed every day – needlessly killed due to human greed , recklessness , laziness , lack of awareness or concern and general environmental exploitation and mismanagement .
At the same time , I find myself similarly distressed and concerned by our consumer society ’s insatiable thirst and craving for cheap but , again , relatively speaking , nutritionally valueless , food .
And so , two ideas collide and generate a surprising idea : eat roadkill .
It ’s not factory farmed or pumped full of antibiotics .
It is fresh , local , seasonal and nutritionally rich .
The most common finds are pheasant , squirrel , rabbit , fox , hedgehog , badger , moorhen , hare etc .
This is certainly the case where I live , in Kent .
And , really , it ’s not so unusual to be eating such things – historically anyway .
In his book British Food : An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History , Colin Spencer records , amongst other things , the regular consumption of badgers , door mice , rats , hedgehogs , song thrush , blackbird , wheatear and sparrow throughout the Middle Ages ( p.15 ) .
These days it is only fairly arbitrary , though powerful , dietary taboos that prevent us from eating such creatures .
I recently delved in to a book by Frederick Simoons called Eat Not This Flesh : Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present .
It discusses a number of such common taboos and is well worth reading .
What ’s good to eat and what ’s not :
The best places to find roadkill are on stretches of road that you travel along daily .
If it was n’t there the previous day then it ’s probably good to eat today .
But , for goodness sake , do n’t put your foot down to deliberately try and kill something .
In fact if you are walking or cycling roadkill is easier to find .
This is because many animals when hit are injured rather than killed outright .
Consequently , they manage to reach the cover of grass and shrub by the roadside .
Some animals , even if killed on impact , though dead , manage to kick their way into the grass verge by the sheer force of their spasmodic death throes .
The slower pace of walking or cycling allows such animals to be noticed .
Specimens need to be intact and , at the height of summer , not more than a day old ; that time extending to three to four days in the colder winter months .
If there is fresh blood on the road , this is a sign of recent death and , hence , freshness .
Similarly , with respect to birds , if there are feathers blowing around the road this is the sign of a recent hit .
In my experience – although I stand to be corrected – rigor mortis tends to set in 6 - 12 hours after an animal is killed .
So , if you pick an animal up and it is as stiff as a board but still plump and fresh looking , this is a good sign .
Also , if on a cold day the animal feels warm then , clearly , this is a strong indicator of recent death .
Bad signs include : dull looking eyes , rotten smell , visible maggots or fly eggs around the eyes mouth / beak , rupture of the intestines , signs of sickness , or , suspicious death .
If you see 5 badgers on the road within 200 metres , chances are a farmer is illegally killing them and putting them on the road to look like roadkill .
Of course , some animals may have been legally poisoned , so it is worth asking local farmers if they are using poisons .
As for bird flu…… .
I need to look into this .
Finally or perhaps it should be , firstly , before even considering inspecting a dead road - side animal for eating it is sensible to familiarise yourself with certain relevant laws , especially the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 .
Of course , the Act also covers such birds as swans .
As native wild birds , swans enjoy statutory protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally injure , take or kill a wild swan .
The Act similarly protects the eggs and nests of swans .
It is an offence to take or possess the egg of a wild mute swan , or to damage or destroy the nest of a mute swan whilst in use or being built .
Unfortunately , swans and their nests are sometimes a target for vandals .
Anyone seeing an offence against swans or other wildlife is encouraged to contact their police Wildlife Liaison Officer through their local police station .
Source : Swans wildlife information leaflet ( 2002 )
Under the Countryside Act and Rights of Way Act 2000 , people who kill swans face a maximum £ 5,000 fine and / or six months in prison .
NOVEMBER 19 -- A late - night flower bed raid has prompted Bill Nye the Science Guy to obtain a temporary restraining order against a California woman whom the television personality appeared to have married last year .
Nye , 51 , last week secured the TRO against Blair Tindall , who admits that she poured weed killer in the garden of the Los Angeles home she once shared with Nye.
According to a Los Angeles Superior Court filing by Nye ( a copy of which you 'll find here ) , Tindall , dressed in black , appeared in his backyard at 11:30 PM on Labor Day , and " fled on foot when I called her name . "
Tindall ,
Nye claimed , dropped two large bottles that had been " filled with some sort of solvent " and " may have been emptied on my garden from which I get food produce . "
In a second filing , Nye reported that the herbicide is " quite toxic " and claimed that he feared Tindall might have squirted him in the eyes with it had he been closer to her .
For her part , Tindall , a 47 - year - old writer , describes the flower assault as a " foolish , sophomoric act of poor judgment " that came in the midst of her having a series of personal and family problems .
In a November 13 declaration , Tindall strongly denies being a threat to Nye , whom she accuses of " emotional cruelty . "
Nye , she stated , proposed marriage less than three months after meeting her in late - 2005 , and the pair appeared to have been wed last February in an impromptu ceremony officiated by Pastor Rick Warren ( of " The Purpose Driven Life " fame ) .
However , within weeks of the nuptials , Tindall noted , the newlyweds learned that " our marriage license was returned as invalid . "
It was then , she added , that Nye ordered her not to move into the Studio City home they had just purchased .
The " faux marriage , " Tindall added , left her heartbroken and distraught and led to the " dreadful moment " in the garden of " a man who no longer loved me . "
Nye and Tindall are next due in court December 20 in connection with the restraining order application .

FAILING sub - prime mortgages have claimed their first US bank — online lender NetBank was shut down by US Government regulators at the weekend .
Soaring defaults of home loans given to poor - quality borrowers in the US have closed dozens of mortgage companies and stressed British bank Northern Rock , but web - only lender NetBank is the first federally regulated bank in the US to go to the wall .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) was named receiver by the Office of Thrift Supervision , NetBank 's primary regulator .
With about $ US2.5 billion ( $ A2.8 billion ) in assets , NetBank is the 58th - largest bank failure in FDIC history .
The more I play with the new breed of VCS tools , the more I appreciate them .
The older generations ( CVS , SVN ) look increasingly archaic , supporting a computing and development model that seems unsustainable .
Yet most of us lived with those tools , or something similar , for most of our development - focused lives .
When I speak of the new breed , the two standouts ( to me ) are Git and Mercurial .
There are some other interesting ones , particularly Darcs , but Git and Mercurial seem to have the most steam and seem fairly grounded and stable .
Between those two , I still find myself preferring Git .
I ’ve had some nasty webs to untangle and Git has provided me with the best resources to untangle them .
Those webs are actually all related to CVS and some messed up trunks and branches .
Some of the code lives on in CVS , but thanks to Git , sorting out the mess and / or bringing in a huge amount of new work ( done outside of version control because no one likes branching in CVS and is afraid of ‘ breaking the build ’ ) was far less traumatic than usual .
One of those messes could have been avoided had we been using Git as a company ( which is planned ) .
One of the great things these tools provide is the ability to easily do speculative development .
Branching and merging is so easy .
And most of those branches are private .
One big problem we have with CVS is what to name a branch : how to make the name unique , informative , and communicative to others .
And then we have to tag its beginnings , its breaking off points , its merge points , etc , just in case something goes wrong ( or even right , in the case of multiple merges ) .
All of those tags end up in the big cloud : long , stuffy , confusing names that outlive their usefulness .
It ’s one thing to deal with all of this for an important branch that everyone agrees is important .
It ’s another to go through all of this just for a couple of days or weeks of personal work .
So no one does it .
And big chunks of work are just done dangerously - nothing checked in for days at a time .
And what if that big chunk of work turned out to be a failed experiment ?
Maybe there are a couple of good ideas in that work , and it might be worth referring to later , so maybe now one makes a branch and does a single gigantic check - in , just so that there ’s a record somewhere .
But now , one ca n’t easily untangle a couple of good ideas from the majority of failed - experiment code .
“ Oh ! ” they ’ll say in the future , “ I had that problem solved !
It ’s just all tangled up in the soft - link - experimental - branch in one big check in and I did n’t have the time to sort it out ! ”
I speak from personal experience on that last one .
I ’m still kicking myself over that scenario .
The whole problem turned out to be bigger than expected , and now there ’s just a big blob of crap , sitting in the CVS repository somewhere .
With a distributed VCS , I could have branched the moment that it looked like the problem was getting to be bigger than expected .
Then I could keep committing in small chunks to my personal branch until I realized the experiment failed .
With smaller check- ins , navigating the history to cherry - pick the couple of good usable ideas out would have been much easier , even if everything else was dicarded .
I would n’t have to worry about ‘ breaking the build ’ or worry about a good name for my branch since everyone else would end up seeing it .
I could manage it all myself .
This is the speculative development benefit that alone makes these tools great .
It ’s so easy to branch , MERGE , rebase , etc .
And it can all be done without impacting anyone else .
One thing that I often hear when I start advocating distributed VCS ’s is “ well , I like having a central repository that I can always get to ” or “ is always backed up ” or “ is the known master copy . ”
There ’s nothing inherant in distributed VCS ’s that prevents you from having that .
You can totally have a model similar to SVN / CVS in regards to a central repository with a mixture of read - only and read / write access .
But unlike CVS ( or SVN ) , what you publish out of that repository is basically the same thing that you have in a local clone .
No repository is more special than any other , but that policy makes it so .
You can say “ all of our company ’s main code is on server X under path / pub/ scm / … ” .
And unlike CVS ( or SVN ) , really wild development can be done totally away from that central collection .
A small team can share repositories amongst themselves , and then one person can push the changes in to the central place .
Or the team may publish their repository at a new location for someone else to review and integrate .
Since they all stem from the same source , comparisons and merges should all still work , even though the repositories are separate .
Imagine this in a company that has hired a new developer .
Perhaps during their first three months ( a typical probationary period ) , they do not get write access to the core repositories .
With a distributed VCS , they can clone the project (s ) on which they ’re assigned , do their work , and then publish their results by telling their supervisor “ hey , look at my changes , you can read them here … ” where here may be an HTTP or just a file system path .
Their supervisor can then conduct code reviews on the new guys work and make suggestions or push in changes of his own .
When the new developers code is approved , the supervisor or some other higher developer is repsonsible for doing the merge .
It ’s all still tracked , all under version control , but the source is protected from any new - guy mistakes , and the new - guy does n’t have to feel pressure about committing changes to a large code - base which he does n’t yet fully grasp .
But perhaps the most killer feature of these tools is how easy it is to put anything under revision management .
I sometimes have scripts that I start writing to do a small job , typically some kind of data transformation .
Sometimes those scripts get changed a lot over the course of some small project , which is typically OK : they ’re only going to be used once , right ?
This past week , I found myself having to track down one such set of scripts again because some files had gotten overridden with new files based on WAY old formats of the data .
Basically I needed to find my old transformations and run them again .
Fortunately , I still had the scripts .
But they did n’t work 100 % , and as I looked at the code I remembered one small difference that 5 % of the old old files had .
Well , I did n’t remember the difference , I just remembered that they had a minor difference and I had adjusted the script appropriately to finish up that final small set of files .
But now , I did n’t have the script that worked against the other 95 % .
When I did the work initially , it was done in such a time that I was probably using my editors UNDO / REDO buffer to move between differences if needed .
Now if I had just gone in to the directory with the scripts and done a git init ; git add . ; git commit sequence , I would probably have the minor differences right there .
But I did n’t know such tools were available at the time .
So now I had to rewrite things .
This time , I put the scripts and data files under git ’s control so that I had easy reference to the before and after stages of the data files , just in case this scenario ever happened again .
I did n’t have to think of a good place to put these things in our CVS repo .
I just made the repository for myself and worried about where to put it for future access later .
With CVS / SVN , you have to think about this up front .
And when it ’s just a personal little project or a personal couple of scripts , it hardly seems worth it , even if you may want some kind of history .
Actually , that is the killer feature !
By making everything local , you can just do it : make a repository , make a branch , make a radical change , take a chance !
If it ’s worth sharing , you can think about how to do that when the time is right .
With the forced - central / always - on repository structure of CVS and SVN , you have to think about those things ahead of time : where to import this code , what should I name this branch so it does n’t interfere with others , how can I save this very experimental work safely so I can come back to it later without impacting others , is this work big enough to merit the headaches of maintaining a branch , can I commit this change and not break the build ….?
As such , those systems punish speculation .
I notice this behavior in myself and in my colleages : it ’s preferred to just work for two weeks on something critical with no backup solution , no ability to share , no ability to backtrack , etc , than it is do deal with CVS .
I once lost three days worth of work due to working like this - and it was on a project that no one else was working on or depending on !
I was just doing a lot of work simultaneously and never felt comfortable committing it to CVS .
And then one day , I accidentally wiped out a parent directory and lost everything .
Now , in a distributed VCS , I could have been committing and committing and could have lost everything anyways since the local repository is contained there : but I could have made my own “ central ” repository on my development machine or on the network to which I could push from time to time .
I would have lost a lot less .
There are so many good reasons to try one of these new tools out .
But I think the most important one comes down to this : just get it out of your head .
Just commit the changes .
Just start a local repository .
Do n’t create undue stress and open loops in your head about what , where , or when to import or commit something .
Do n’t start making copies of ‘ index.html ’ as ‘ index1.html ’ , ‘ index2.html ’ , index1 - older.html ’ ‘ old/index.html ’ , ‘ older/index.html ’ and hope that you ’ll remember their relationships to each other in the future .
Just do your work , commit the changes , get that stress out of your head .
Share the changes when you ’re ready .
It ’s a much better way of working , even if it ’s only for yourself .

Security maven Mary Landesman is in the midst of piecing together a who - done - it involving the infection of hundreds of websites that are generating an enormous amount of traffic .
Or maybe it's a how - done - it .
Either way , she 's mostly drawing blanks .
Landesman is a researcher for ScanSafe , a company that monitors the web surfing of employees at large companies and provides them with real - time intelligence about what sites are spreading malware .
When a client visits a site that has already attacked someone else , the service automatically blocks the site from loading in the end user 's browser .
Viewing some seven billion web requests per month , company researchers see a fair amount of internet gremlins .
Over the past four days , 15 per cent of the blocked malicious traffic has come from just a few hundred sites , which appear to be legitimate ecommerce destinations that have been compromised by attackers .
This prompted Landesman to do some digging , and what she uncovered is unlike anything she 's seen before .
For one thing , the sites themselves are hosting the malware , which is then foisted on visitors .
Most of the time attackers are unable to gain such a high degree of control over the sites they hack , so they redirect end users to servers under the control of bad guys and use them to drop malicious payloads .
" I 'm stumped , " Landesman says .
" This is a very different method of infecting the user .
I want to find out how they 're doing it and what is the common link between these sites . "
So far , Landesman and other researchers have found no visible thread that ties the disparate group of mom-and - pop sites together .
With addresses such as dubai.
travel - culture.com , operationultimategoal.com and directline - citybreaks.co.uk , the sites are mostly based in the UK , but some also hail from India , Brazil and elsewhere .
They do n't use the same web host , and while most use web serving software from Apache , the versions vary widely , making it unlikely that attackers are exploiting a vulnerability in that program .
The outbreak coincides with another mass infection in progress that 's infected tens of thousands of pages , including those of Boston University , security provider Computer Associates , and agencies from the state of Virginia and the city of Cleveland .
It infects websites running Microsoft 's Internet Information Server web program and the company 's SQL database with links the redirect users to servers in China .
The malicious sites then try to install keylogging software and other nasties .
As massive as that infection is , it 's responsible for less than one per cent of the malicious traffic that ScanSafe has blocked over the past four days , a small fraction compared with the mystery sites Landesman is tracking .
The sites exhibit other intriguing characteristics .
They attempt to infect visitors with a javascript file with a randomly generated name that changes each time a person visits the site .
Accessing paddingtoncourt.com , for example , ( we do n't recommend readers try this ) might result in the insertion of a script referencing a file titled xxxxx.js , which is dynamically created at paddingtoncourt.com/xxxxx.js .
A different visitor might encounter a file titled yyyyy.js served from paddingtoncourt.com/yyyyy.js .
The constant flux makes it impossible for researchers to access the script responsible for delivering the payload or running Google searches that might provide a more comprehensive list of other sites that might be affected .
The script looks for various vulnerabilities specific to the visiting OS , and when it finds one pulls a .
Mov file from the domain dedicated .abac.net .
That in turn invokes a file from bds.invitations.fr , which installs a backdoor on end users ' machines .
Victims are unlikely to know they 've been infected because the installation is clear and seamless , and the malware uses few PC resources .
At last check , only three of 33 antivirus programs detected the malware , which appears to be a derivitive of the Rbot Trojan .
" This is pretty nasty , " Landesman says .
" It 's a new type of compromise , and a pretty significant one . "
And so far very little is understood about it .
Below is a more comprehensive ( though not exhaustive ) list of the sites identified as infected .
If you can help shed some much - needed light on these attacks , please leave a comment below or contact your reporter using this link .

Amber Alert Scientists Discover Ancient Meat - Eating Mushroom
Researchers at Berlin's Humboldt University may have discovered something new in ancient amber : the oldest known carnivorous fungus .
It survived by trapping tiny worms on its sticky appendages .
Data from the Japanese Hinode spacecraft have confirmed that a set of long - theorised magnetic waves help power the solar wind that drives charged particles to the frigid boundary of the solar system .
Called Alfven waves , they play an important role in accelerating the solar wind to speeds of around 2 million mph , according to results published in the journal Science .
" Until now , Alfven waves have been impossible to observe because of limited resolution of available instruments , " said Alexei Pevtsov , a Hinode scientist in Washington , DC " With the help of Hinode , we are now able to see direct evidence of Alfven waves . "
Hinode was launched in September 2006 , the latest spacecraft trying to unravel long - standing solar mysteries , such as the origin of the sun 's huge magnetic field , and the explanation behind the fact that the sun 's atmosphere is nearly a million degrees hotter than the surface .
Even babies may be good judges of character
In a study that suggests people may begin evaluating one another for trustworthiness even earlier than believed , researchers showed infants a demonstration in which different shapes played the good guy or the bad guy .
Then the infants were allowed to choose one to play with .
The good guy won almost every time .
In the case of Circle , a small wooden character with big eyes , that would be Triangle , who helped him when he was struggling up the hill not Square , who gave him a good shove back down .
Of course , when the roles were reversed and Triangle was cast as the hinderer , the infants preferred Square .
After repeated demonstrations , the infants , 6 and 10 months old , were presented with the helper and the hinderer .
They almost always reached for the helper .
The study appears in the November 22 issue of Nature ; the lead author is J. Kiley Hamlin of Yale .
A co-author , Karen Wynn , a psychology professor at Yale , said the study showed that even at an early age , people are assessing those around them .
" It 's important for them to make a judgment about who might be a friend and who might be a potential foe , " she said .

BAGHDAD , Nov. 19 — Five months ago , Suhaila al - Aasan lived in an oxygen tank factory with her husband and two sons , convinced that they would never go back to their apartment in Dora , a middle - class neighborhood in southern Baghdad .
Today she is home again , cooking by a sunlit window , sleeping beneath her favorite wedding picture .
And yet , she and her family are remarkably alone .
The half - dozen other apartments in her building echo with emptiness and , on most days , Iraqi soldiers are the only neighbors she sees .
“ I feel happy , ” she said , standing in her bedroom , between a flowered bedspread and a bullet hole in the wall .
“ But my happiness is not complete .
We need more people to come back .
We need more people to feel safe . ”
Mrs. Aasan , 45 , a Shiite librarian with an easy laugh , is living at the far end of Baghdad ’s tentative recovery .
She is one of many Iraqis who in recent weeks have begun to test where they can go and what they can do when fear no longer controls their every move .

The World Chess Championship is being held now in Mexico City .
It began on September 12 , and is scheduled to finish on September 30 .
Unlike some of the World Championships of the past , this one is a tournament between eight players rather than a match between two .
The eight players are Vladimir Kramnik ( the current world champion ) , Viswanathan Anand ( the world ’s highest rated player ) , Levon Aronian , Alexander Morozevich , Peter Leko , Boris Gelfand , Peter Svidler and Alexander Grischuk .
In the picture above Kramnik ( to the right ) is playing Anand ( to the left ) , while Gelfand ( between the players ) and Grischuk ( behind Anand ) observe .
All of these players play at a fantastically high level ( the general level of human chess players has steadily improved with time ) , but sadly fewer people pay attention now that computers play even better .
The only one of these grandmasters that I ’ve personally played against is Peter Svidler , in the 1995 New York Open .
I was doing very well in that tournament , and had a chance to win a large prize , but then I played Svidler with the Black pieces , and he crushed me .
The memory is actually not so bad , because it was very interesting to play him and to talk to him afterwards ( he was 19 , but it was already clear that he could potentially challenge for the world championship ) , and I nevertheless achieved a norm for my international master title in that tournament .
The World Championship tournament is a double - round robin , so it will last 14 rounds .
After nine rounds ,
Anand leads with a record of 6 - 3 , followed by Gelfand with 5 - 4 , Leko , Grischuk , and Kramnik with 4.5 - 4.5 , Aronian and Morozevich with 4 - 5 , and Svidler with 3.5 - 5.5 .
Today Kramnik plays
Anand with the White pieces ; he ’ll need to win to have much chance of catching him .
But even if Kramnik does not win , he ’s guaranteed a match against the world champion in 2008 .
( UPDATE : Anand held Kramnik to a hard - fought draw in round 10 , and then followed up with a win against Morozevich in round 11 , so with three rounds to go , he holds a substantial 1.5 point lead over Gelfand , and looks likely to become the next World Champion . )
( UPDATE 2 : Anand has won the world championship , with Kramnik and Gelfand tying for second place .
The cross-table of the results is below ) :

To learn more about the tournament , you might start with Macauley ’s rather artistic coverage of the first game between Kramnik and Anand in round 3 .
More videos of this type head are at macauley.blip.tv .
You might also head over to the excellent chess web - site The Week in Chess for news and annotated game scores , and the ChessVibes blog for many on - the - scene videos ( often including instructive post - game interviews with the players ) and the games in an easy - to - use Java player ( I already pointed to some remarkable videos from earlier this year at ChessVibes in a previous post . )
But perhaps the most interesting coverage of the World Championship tournament for intermediate or stronger chess players is by the Internet Chess Club , which has a team of strong grandmasters presenting annotated game videos .

Brazil has developed expertise in deep - sea drilling in recent years
The Brazilian government says huge new oil reserves discovered off its coast could turn the country into one of the biggest oil producers in the world .
Petrobras , Brazil 's national oil company , says it believes the offshore Tupi field has between 5bn and 8bn barrels of recoverable light oil .
A senior minister said Brazilian oil production had the potential to match that of Venezuela and Saudi Arabia .
Petrobras delivered its estimate after analysing test results .
' New reality '
The state - controlled company says the results show high productivity for gas and light oil - the best quality oil - which is more valuable and cheaper to refine .
Petrobras says the find has the potential to move Brazil into a position where it is one of the top ten oil reserves in the world .
Brazil currently has proven oil reserves of 14 billion barrels , over half of which have been discovered in the past five years .
The news , which led to a sharp rise in company shares , was also given an enthusiastic welcome by the government .
The senior minister in charge of the cabinet , Dilma Rousseff , said if the deposits turned out to be as significant as first thought , it would place Brazil in the same league as Venezuela and countries in the Arab world .
With a reserve like this , the country could be transformed into an exporter of petroleum , she said .
" This has changed our reality , " she said .
Most of Brazil 's oil is heavy and found at great depth but even so its reserves have almost doubled in the last ten years , as has output .
Some analysts say this latest find raises the interesting scenario of offering a new source of supply to the United States , reducing its dependence on Venezuela , a country with which it has such a fraught relationship .
With the Tupi field potentially equal to 40 % of all oil ever discovered here , it seems by any standards a significant moment for Brazil .
" If the best - case scenario happens , this discovery would make Petrobras ' reserves overcome those of Shell and Chevron , " said Felipe Cunha , an analyst with brokers Brascan .
Petrobras controls 65 % of the firm which has the exclusive licence to explore and extract oil from the Tupi field in the Santos basin , about 180 miles south of Rio de Janeiro .
British firm BG and Portugal 's Galp Energia hold minority stakes in the business .
Reserves have also been found in the more northerly Campos and Espirito Santo basins .

Group Calls Action Unconstitutional and Discriminatory
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
ALBUQUERQUE - The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of New Mexico filed a lawsuit in federal court today on behalf of several New Mexico residents and advocacy organizations who were made to stand more than 150 yards away from the site of a fundraiser being attended by the president as they peacefully protested the views of the administration , while a group of people expressing support for President Bush were allowed to stand only a few feet from the fundraiser site .
“ People who disagree with the president have as much a right to be heard as those who wish to praise him , " said Catherine Crump , staff attorney with the ACLU .
“ The unequal treatment of the ACLU ’s clients violates their constitutional right to free speech . ”
On August 27 , 2007 , President Bush was in New Mexico to attend a fundraiser for Senator Pete Domenici at the home of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque Mayor Larry Abraham .
In anticipation of the presidential motorcade , several individuals , including the ACLU ’s clients , gathered along the street leading to the mayor ’s house holding signs expressing their disapproval of the Iraq War .
According to the ACLU ’s lawsuit , law enforcement officials forced the peaceful protestors to stand 150 yards away from the motorcade route , on the opposite end of the street from where the president would arrive , where they were blocked from the president ’s view by a wall of parked police cars and officers on horseback .
A group of people holding a banner reading “ God Bless George Bush !
We Pray for You ! ” was allowed to stand only a few feet from the fundraiser site , in plain view of the motorcade .
“ Law enforcement officers gave Bush supporters front row seats and made those who disagreed with the president stand behind a wall of cars and horses , ” said Peter Simonson , ACLU of New Mexico Executive Director .
“ Officials went to great lengths to shield the president from viewing the people who disagreed with him , which just is n’t how a free society should operate . ”
The New Mexico lawsuit comes in the midst of an ongoing challenge by the ACLU to a White House policy that unlawfully excludes individuals perceived to be critical of the administration from public events where President Bush is present .
The policy is laid out in the official Presidential Advance Manual , which includes a section called “ Preparing for Demonstrators . ”
In that section , the manual directs members of the presidential advance team working at the site of a presidential appearance to “ work with the Secret Service and have them ask the local police department to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed , preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route . ”
The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of Jeanne Pahls , Rebecca Wilson , Alma Rosa Silva Banuelos , Carter Bundy , Merimee Moffitt , Laura Lawrence , Stuart T. “ Terry ” Riley , Mary Lou “ Mitzi ” Kraft , Jason Call , and the organizations Stop the War Machine and CODEPINK Women for Peace , Albuquerque chapter .
Attorneys in the lawsuit are Catherine Crump , Chris Hansen and Josh Hsu of the national ACLU and George Bach of the ACLU of New Mexico .
The ACLU ’s complaint is available online at :
www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/33653lgl20080115.html

This month the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange , representing 90 percent of the state ’s growers , announced that it will not allow any of its members to collect the extra penny for farm workers .
Reggie Brown , the executive vice president of the group , described the surcharge for poor migrants as “ pretty much near un-American . ”

Migrant farm laborers have long been among America ’s most impoverished workers .
Perhaps 80 percent of the migrants in Florida are illegal immigrants and thus especially vulnerable to abuse .
During the past decade , the United States Justice Department has prosecuted half a dozen cases of slavery among farm workers in Florida .
Migrants have been driven into debt , forced to work for nothing and kept in chained trailers at night .
The Coalition of Immokalee Workers — a farm worker alliance based in Immokalee , Fla . — has done a heroic job improving the lives of migrants in the state , investigating slavery cases and negotiating the penny - per - pound surcharge with fast food chains .
Now the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange has threatened a fine of $ 100,000 for any grower who accepts an extra penny per pound for migrant wages .
The organization claims that such a surcharge would violate “ federal and state laws related to antitrust , labor and racketeering . ”
It has not explained how that extra penny would break those laws ; nor has it explained why other surcharges routinely imposed by the growers ( for things like higher fuel costs ) are perfectly legal .
The prominent role that Burger King has played in rescinding the pay raise offers a spectacle of yuletide greed worthy of Charles Dickens .
Burger King has justified its behavior by claiming that it has no control over the labor practices of its suppliers .
“ Florida growers have a right to run their businesses how they see fit , ” a Burger King spokesman told The St. Petersburg Times .
Yet the company has adopted a far more activist approach when the issue is the well - being of livestock .
In March , Burger King announced strict new rules on how its meatpacking suppliers should treat chickens and hogs .
As for human rights abuses , Burger King has suggested that if the poor farm workers of southern Florida need more money , they should apply for jobs at its restaurants .
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) finalises its landmark report for 2007 , we look at 10 of the arguments most often made against the IPCC consensus , and some of the counter - arguments made by scientists who agree with the IPCC .
1. EVIDENCE THAT THE EARTH'S TEMPERATURE IS GETTING WARMER IS UNCLEAR
Sceptic Counter
Instruments show there has been some warming of the Earth 's surface since 1979 , but the actual value is subject to large errors .
Most long - term data comes from surface weather stations .
Many of these are in urban centres which have expanded in both size and energy use .
When these stations observe a temperature rise , they are simply measuring the " urban heat island effect " .
In addition , coverage is patchy , with some regions of the world almost devoid of instruments .
Data going back further than a century or two is derived from " proxy " indicators such as tree - rings and stalactites which , again , are subject to large errors .
Warming is unequivocal .
Weather stations , ocean measurements , decreases in snow cover , reductions in Arctic sea ice , longer growing seasons , balloon measurements , boreholes and satellites all show results consistent with the surface record of warming .
The urban heat island effect is real but small ; and it has been studied and corrected for .
Analyses by Nasa for example use only rural stations to calculate trends .
Recently , work has shown that if you analyse long - term global temperature rise for windy days and calm days separately , there is no difference .
If the urban heat island effect were large , you would expect to see a bigger trend for calm days when more of the heat stays in the city .
Furthermore , the pattern of warming globally does n't resemble the pattern of urbanisation , with the greatest warming seen in the Arctic and northern high latitudes .
Globally , there is a warming trend of about 0.8C since 1900 , more than half of which has occurred since 1979 .
2. IF THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE WAS RISING , IT HAS NOW STOPPED
Sceptic Counter
Since 1998 - almost a decade - the record , as determined by observations from satellites and balloon radiosondes , shows no warming .
1998 was an exceptionally warm year because of the strong El Nino event .
Variability from year to year is expected , and picking a specific warm year to start an analysis is " cherry - picking " ; if you picked 1997 or 1999 you would see a sharper rise .
Even so , the linear trends since 1998 are still positive .
3. THE EARTH HAS BEEN WARMER IN THE RECENT PAST
Sceptic Counter
The beginning of the last Millennium saw a " Mediaeval Warm Period " when temperatures , certainly in Europe , were higher than they are now .
Grapes grew in northern England .
Ice - bound mountain passes opened in the Alps .
The Arctic was warmer in the 1930s than it is today .
There have been many periods in Earth history that were warmer than today - if not the MWP , then maybe the last interglacial ( 125,000 years ago ) or the Pliocene ( three million years ago ) .
Whether those variations were caused by solar forcing , the Earth 's orbital wobbles or continental configurations , none of those causes apply today .
Evidence for a Mediaeval Warm Period outside Europe is patchy at best , and is often not contemporary with the warmth in Europe .
As the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) puts it : " The idea of a global or hemispheric Mediaeval Warm Period that was warmer than today has turned out to be incorrect " .
Additionally , although the Arctic was warmer in the 1930s than in the following few decades , it is now warmer still .
4. COMPUTER MODELS ARE NOT RELIABLE
Sceptic Counter
Computer models are the main way of forecasting future climate change .
But despite decades of development they are unable to model all the processes involved ; for example , the influence of clouds , the distribution of water vapour , the impact of warm seawater on ice - shelves and the response of plants to changes in water supply .
Climate models follow the old maxim of " garbage in , garbage out " .
Models are simply ways to quantify understanding of climate .
They will never be perfect and they will never be able to forecast the future exactly .
However , models are tested and validated against all sorts of data .
Over the last 20 years they have become able to simulate more physical , chemical and biological processes , and work on smaller spatial scales .
The 2007 IPCC report produced regional climate projections in detail that would have been impossible in its 2001 assessment .
All of the robust results from modelling have both theoretical and observational support .
5. THE ATMOSPHERE IS NOT BEHAVING AS MODELS WOULD PREDICT
Sceptic Counter
Computer models predict that the lower levels of the atmosphere , the troposphere , should be warming faster than the Earth 's surface .
Measurements show the opposite .
So either this is another failing of the models , or one set of measurements is flawed , or there are holes in our understanding of the science .
Lower levels of the troposphere are warming ; but measuring the exact rate has been an uncertain process , particularly in the satellite era ( since 1979 ) .
Readings from different satellites need to be tied together , and each has its own problems with orbital decay and sensor drift .
Two separate analyses show consistent warming , one faster than the surface and one slightly less .
Within the uncertainties of the data , there is no discrepancy that needs to be dealt with .
Information from balloons has its own problems but the IPCC concluded this year : " For the period since 1958 , overall global and tropical tropospheric warming estimated from radiosondes has slightly exceeded surface warming " .
6. CLIMATE IS MAINLY INFLUENCED BY THE SUN
Sceptic Counter
Earth history shows climate has regularly responded to cyclical changes in the Sun 's energy output .
Any warming we see can be attributed mainly to variations in the Sun 's magnetic field and solar wind .
Solar variations do affect climate , but they are not the only factor .
As there has been no positive trend in any solar index since the 1960s ( and possibly a small negative trend ) , solar forcing cannot be responsible for the recent temperature trends .
The difference between the solar minimum and solar maximum over the 11 - year solar cycle is 10 times smaller than the effect of greenhouse gases over the same interval .
7. A CARBON DIOXIDE RISE HAS ALWAYS COME AFTER A TEMPERATURE INCREASE NOT BEFORE
Sceptic Counter
Ice - cores dating back nearly one million years show a pattern of temperature and CO2 rise at roughly 100,000 - year intervals .
But the CO2 rise has always come after the temperature rise , not before , presumably as warmer temperatures have liberated the gas from oceans .
This is largely true , but largely irrelevant .
Ancient ice - cores do show CO2 rising after temperature by a few hundred years - a timescale associated with the ocean response to atmospheric changes mainly driven by wobbles in the Earth 's orbit .
However , the situation today is dramatically different .
The extra CO2 in the atmosphere ( 35 % increase over pre-industrial levels ) is from human emissions .
Levels are higher than have been seen in 650,000 years of ice - core records , and are possibly higher than any time since three million years ago .
8. LONG - TERM DATA ON HURRICANES AND ARCTIC ICE IS TOO POOR TO ASSESS TRENDS
Sceptic Counter
Before the era of satellite observation began in the 1970s , measurements were ad -hoc and haphazard .
Hurricanes would be reported only if they hit land or shipping .
Arctic ice extent was measured only during expeditions .
The satellite record for these phenomena is too short to justify claims that hurricanes are becoming stronger or more frequent , or that there is anything exceptional about the apparent shrinkage in Arctic ice .
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment project notes that systematic collection of data in parts of the Arctic began in the late 18th Century .
The US National Hurricane Center notes that " organised reconnaissance " for Atlantic storms began in 1944 .
So although historical data is not as complete as one might like , conclusions can be drawn .
And the IPCC does not claim that global warming will make hurricanes more frequent - its 2007 report says that if anything , they are likely to become less frequent , but more intense .
9. WATER VAPOUR IS THE MAJOR GREENHOUSE GAS ; CO2 IS RELATIVELY UNIMPORTANT
Sceptic Counter
The natural greenhouse effect keeps the Earth 's surface about 33C warmer than it would otherwise be .
Water vapour is the most important greenhouse gas , accounting for about 98 % of all warming .
So changes in carbon dioxide or methane concentrations would have a relatively small impact .
Water vapour concentrations are rising , but this does not necessarily increase warming - it depends how the water vapour is distributed .
Water vapour is essentially in balance with the planet 's temperature on annual timescales and longer , whereas trace greenhouse gases such as CO2 stay in the atmosphere on a timescale of decades to centuries .
The statement that water vapour is " 98 % of the greenhouse effect " is simply false .
In fact , it does about 50 % of the work ; clouds add another 25 % , with CO2 and the other greenhouse gases contributing the remaining quarter .
Water vapour concentrations are increasing in response to rising temperatures , and there is evidence that this is adding to warming , for example in Europe .
The fact that water vapour is a feedback is included in all climate models .
10 . PROBLEMS SUCH AS HIV / AIDS AND POVERTY ARE MORE PRESSING THAN CLIMATE CHANGE

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A judge on Tuesday ordered the Bush administration to explain whether the CIA violated a court order by destroying videotapes of the harsh interrogations of two terrorism suspects .
Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden speaks to reporters upon his arrival in the Capitol for a meeting with the House Appropriations Committee 's Select Intelligence Oversight Subcommittee hearing on CIA interrogation programs , in Washington December 13 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy , who in 2005 had ordered the government to preserve information on prisoner mistreatment at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , scheduled a court hearing on the tapes for Friday , overriding government objections .
Lawyers for a group of Guantanamo Bay inmates contesting their detention had requested the hearing to learn whether the government had complied with the preservation order .
They cited reports that information obtained from the interrogations implicated five unnamed Guantanamo detainees .
“ We hope to establish a procedure to review the government ’s handling of evidence in our case ... and generally to require an accounting from a government that has admitted that it destroyed evidence , ” said David Remes , an attorney for the group of inmates .
He declined to comment on whether he believed any of his clients were implicated during the interrogations .
The CIA on December 6 disclosed that it had destroyed hundreds of hours of interrogation tapes , prompting an outcry from congressional Democrats and human rights activists .
The sessions recorded on the tapes were believed to have included a form of simulated drowning known as waterboarding , which has been condemned internationally as torture .
The CIA said it destroyed the tapes lawfully and did so out of concern for the safety of agents involved if the recordings were ever made public .
The White House has repeatedly denied the United States tortures terrorism suspects .
The Justice Department declined to comment on the judge ’s hearing order but the department last week urged Kennedy not to investigate the videotapes .
It said the detainees ’ lawyers gave no evidence the interrogation subjects -- suspected al Qaeda operatives Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri -- were at Guantanamo at the time .
U.S. President George W. Bush announced in September 2006 that Zubaydah , Nashiri and 12 other high - value detainees had been transferred from secret CIA prisons to Guantanamo .
But Remes said it was possible the interrogation suspects had been at Guantanamo initially , then transferred away and returned .
“ It ’s a classic non-denial denial , ” he said of the government ’s argument .
The Justice Department also said that in light of other government probes into the videotapes , a judicial inquiry into the destruction was inappropriate .
The Justice Department and CIA are conducting an initial probe of the destruction .
However , the government has sought delays in congressional attempts to investigate the destruction .
“ Plainly the government wants only foxes guarding this henhouse , ” Remes wrote in a court filing .
Gyanendra became king after the notorious 2001 palace massacre
Under the deal , Nepal will be declared a republic after a general election has been held next year and a new constituent assembly established .
The Maoists pulled out of the government in September , demanding an immediate end to the monarchy .
The latest deal was signed by Nepal 's main parties , including the Maoists .
But no date has been set for the ex-rebels to rejoin the government .
Milestone
The six - party ruling alliance and the Maoists said in a statement : " Nepal will be a federal democratic republic nation and the decision will be implemented after the first meeting of the constituent assembly . "
The Maoists have not stopped using violence from time to time
Elections for the new 601 - member assembly are due to be held in April .
The BBC's Nepal correspondent Charles Haviland says that , while a milestone , the move is no surprise .
The Maoists walked out of the government three months ago , vowing not to return unless the royal system was scrapped .
They have now secured what they wanted , even though the other parties in the ruling coalition had said , up to now , that voters should decide on the issue via the new assembly , our correspondent adds .
Analysts say that many Nepalis will be happy to have a republic .
Unpopular monarchy
The monarchy 's popularity has sunk since the death of the well - loved King Birendra in a notorious palace massacre of 2001 .
Efforts by his brother , Gyanendra , to tackle the Maoist insurgency led to a worsening of the country 's human rights situation .
Analysts say the king lost popular support after his decision in 2005 to sack the government and assume absolute power - only to back down after huge protests .
The Maoists called a ceasefire after the king ended his controversial direct rule in April 2006 and restored parliament .
Political parties - who were then in opposition and are now in government - had promised to work with the Maoists as a prelude to bringing them into government .
The political crisis came amid a rise in ethnic and religious tension , as regional groups strove to assert their authority in advance of the elections .
More than 13,000 people died during Nepal 's decade - long insurgency , many of them civilians caught in cross - fire with security forces .

At least 48 Iraqis were killed or found dead and 88 more were wounded in the latest round of violence .
In Baiji a significant attack caused a large number of casualties .
Meanwhile , Mosul is considering digging a security trench around the city .
No Coalition casualties were reported .
The city of Baiji suffered two bombings .
The first one targeted the home of the anti-terrorism police department chief .
In that explosion , 11 were killed and 44 wounded when a suicide bomber detonated his cargo near the chief ’s house .
A separate car bomb struck the Masafi street police station where six people died and 15 more were hurt .
In Baghdad , a roadside bomb injured two police commandos in Harthiya .
A bomb targeting a U.S.patrol in Binoog left no casualties .

Last month on Craigslist.com , someone who described herself as a “ spectacularly beautiful ” 25 - year - old placed a personal ad seeking a husband who made at least $ 500,000 a year , because “ $ 250,000 wo n’t get me to Central Park West . ”
As her post hit the blogs , it received a scathing response from a man who said he fit her description and told her that her proposition was a bad business deal .
“ In economic terms , you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning asset , ” he wrote , because “ your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity . ”
Last week , this exchange spilled over into the e-mail world , where the it turned into a popular item to send to friends as a joke .
The difference between this and other outrageous share - mail messages , however , was that instead of remaining anonymous , its ostensible author signed his name and the company where he worked , which happened to be the investment banking division of JPMorgan Chase .
This detail , which may have provoked nearly as much mirth as the contents of the exchange , made the correspondence either more or less credible .
Would someone with a big job at a prestigious company really have linked his name to a message that read in part :
“ You ’re 25 now and will likely stay pretty hot for the next 5 years , but less so each year .
Then the fade begins in earnest .
By 35 stick a fork in you ! ”
Pointing to a OLPC Peru future
This just in via the Boston Globe : One Laptop Per Child is selling XO laptops like hotcakes !
Nicholas Negroponte has just announced a OLPC Peru sale :
[ T ]he government of Peru has signed a contract to purchase 260,000 of the $ 188 machines .
" It was notarized five minutes ago , " he said , adding that the Peruvian order will make it easier for the foundation to sign up more countries to the program .
" It 's momentum . "
Negroponte also said Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has purchased 50,000 of the machines for distribution in his country .
" He 's an old friend , and he 's been involved in this from the beginning . "
Negroponte is smiling now
Adding to his momentium is an scaled down OLPC Mexico
Now while that is n't the 250,000 XO laptops Slim promised earlier , it 's better than a Nigeria , where OLPC 's partner is now pushing Classmates with Windows and OLPC is fighting a patent infringement lawsuit
But back to the good news .
I think OLPC has sold 600,000 XO laptops in the past two months :
Congratulations , One Laptop Per Child !
While its not the 10 million that Nicholas Negroponte promised in 2006 , it 's a damn good start .

The following letter is addressed to the millions upon millions of Baby Boomers who are about to retire from their jobs over the next few years .
It is written on the behalf of the generations of Americans begotten by the Boomers .
Dear Baby Boomers of America ,
At the close of this year and the opening of the next , your generation will officially begin to transform from a generation of working men and women into an older , retired generation .
This process is both natural and inevitable for all men who are blessed with the gift of longevity , and you should congratulate yourselves on the decades of hard work that partially contributed to the reward retirement will represent for you .
Before this process of retirement gets underway in earnest , however , we ( the younger generations of Americans who owe our existence to your generation ) , would like to offer this letter of thanks for some of the more important and indelible marks your generation has left on the nation we shortly stand to inherit .
These permanent historical marks left by your generation will undoubtedly be recalled by future generations with heartfelt thanks and approbation .
First , we would like to sincerely thank you for your indifference to the national debt over the last thirty years and the housing market over the past fifteen years .
You taught us that consumption by your generation today is justifiable no matter that the bill would be footed by our generations and our children 's generations .
Do n't bother to deny your role in the magnificent expansion of the national debt over the past thirty years and the astronomical expansion of the recent housing bubble .
Your generation , with its massive bulk , played the pivotal role in electing the politicians that kept on expanding the government 's debt , and the bulk of the members of your generation piled personal mortgage debt on credit card debt on home equity debt .
Yours is the first true generation of debt , and for this legacy of suffocating debt your generation shall long be remembered by future generations as they are forced to eventually pay it off .
Our generations have learned the important lesson that consumption today is all that matters — just leave the bill for whoever follows you , or beg the Fed to lower interest rates to create yet another unsustainable bubble in the market .
Three cheers for debt and the Boomers !
Related to this , we would also like to thank your generation for finally allowing the United States government to completely sever the tie between the U.S. dollar and gold in the 1970's .
While gold had been used as the primary currency of the civilized world since the dawn of time , your generation presciently saw through that scam and submissively allowed the U.S. government to replace that precious metal with something much more valuable ; namely , green paper embossed with solemn looking pictures .
Your generation hardly whimpered when the tie between the dollar and gold was finally cut , and for that gracious act of omission our generations have pockets loaded with base metal coins and wallets stuffed with reams of green paper to thank , as well as the current green - paper - created housing bubble and the recession it is about to cause .
Your generation was quick to recognize one of the most important economic facts imaginable : the more green paper that enters the American economy via the Fed and the Treasury , the higher will be our standard of living .
Green paper equals wealth !
You finally put to rest the old bugaboo that wealth comes from real savings and investment , clearing the way for a brave new world of wealth creation simply by printing paper .
If only there were even more green paper ( e.g. , a rate cut by the Fed this year ) , we would all have bigger and nicer houses !
Three cheers for green paper , and three more for the Boomers who passively allowed it to replace gold !
Along a similar vein , we would very much like to thank your generation 's failure to do away with Social Security and the other entitlement programs that make America so great today .
Previous generations had claimed that Social Security is nothing more than a ridiculous Ponzi scheme orchestrated by an inept and bankrupt socialist bureau that merely steals from the young in order to give to the old ; but your generation , in its wisdom , did nothing to reform or abolish this program .
Consequently , the tens of millions of you aging Boomers who are about to retire expect our young generations to meekly submit to the massive taxation that will inexorably be required to fund your Social Security checks .
Your generation has taught ours that it is a right for the elderly to take whatever they want from the working young ( no matter how irresponsible the elderly have personally been in saving for retirement ) .
You do n't have to worry , we wo n't mind working our hands raw to pay your tens of millions of Social Security checks ; on the contrary , we can't wait until we retire ourselves , so that we can take even more from our own grandchildren !
Three more cheers for Social Security , the Boomers , and the elderly stealing from the young !
Your generation has done a great deal more than that , moreover , to teach our generations about morality , and for which we are eternally grateful .
Your generation has taught ours that abortion , welfare , child support , and alimony are God - given rights ( and that we should simply ignore the horrendous effects of these policies on the American family ) , but smoking tobacco is one of the greatest evils in the history of the world .
While some might view your crusade against tobacco as revoltingly hypocritical ( since your generation smoked an heroic amount of relatively tax - free tobacco only a few decades ago — among other plants ) , we , on the contrary , view your paternalistic persecution of us young smokers as a great gift to mankind .
Do n't think for a moment that we will forget your beneficence in making tobacco so expensive and socially marginalized through taxation and regulation , for we young smokers will be constantly reminded of this gift as we toil away at our jobs in order to pay your Social Security checks without being able to afford the cigarettes that might make our work for you tolerable .
Three more cheers for abortion , alimony , welfare and the Boomers ' gift of smoker persecution !
Your generation is owed even more thanks for its total failure to do away with the war on drugs over the past three decades .
Your generation 's monstrous consumption of drugs in the 1960's is simply too well known to need recounting , but you fortunately came to your senses in the 1980's and did nothing to stop the government 's merciless persecution of younger generations of drug consumers .
Few indeed have been the Boomers who have fought for drug legalization since the 60's .
While this may at first glance appear to be yet another instance of the most vile form of hypocrisy imaginable , we younger generations do n't view your silence and indifference in that way .
On the contrary , we thank you for your silence while hundreds of thousands from our generations are carted away to prison for consuming the very same substances your generation grew famous for , because this has given us a giant and glorious police state that is required for these persecutions .
If only you had managed to create even more police and prisons !
Future generations will undoubtedly thank yours for standing idly by while the government of the United States violently persecuted your own children and your children 's children for doing the same things you did in the 60's .
Three more cheers for the indifferent silence of the reformed druggie Boomers !
Your generation has taught ours even more invaluable lessons with regard to war .
During the 1960's and 1970's many in your generation succumbed to the ridiculous idea that the Vietnam War was morally illegitimate , as was any pointless war that did not involve actual self - defense against an imminent threat .
Fortunately , your generation woke up from this anti-war delusion and remained silent or even cheered while Ronald Reagan invaded a slew of Latin American countries , George Bush Sr. invaded Iraq , Bill Clinton invaded Haiti , Bosnia , and Somalia , and George Bush Jr. invaded Afghanistan and Iraq .
( Thankfully , your generation was filled with numerous vociferous defenders of the current Iraq and Afghanistan wars , without whose support Bush Jr. never would have undertaken such pointless and costly invasions ) .
In fact , since the conclusion of the Vietnam War the U.S. has scarcely gone two years without fighting or invading some obscure country or another , and we have the passive acquiescence or open support of the Boomers to thank for it .
In short , through your passivity and open support your generation critically assisted in the transformation of America into the grand warmongering and widely despised nation it is today .
Future generations shall undeniably be eternally grateful for this as well — assuming that they live through the future wars that are likely to be engendered by your past belligerency .
Three more cheers for the post - Vietnam warmongering Boomers !
Fortunately , your generation did not restrict itself to growing the power of the U.S. government through warfare abroad .
On the contrary , your generation was instrumental in expanding the power of the U.S. government through wide - ranging gun control at home that has helped to make guns in America much more feared , expensive , and rare over the past thirty years .
Indeed , all previous generations of Americans viewed gun ownership as the last , best bulwark against government oppression , but not you Boomers !
On the contrary , you scored a double blow on individual liberty by not only helping to grow the size and power of the United States government in every conceivable sphere , but also helped to take away vast numbers of weapons with which our generations might have been able to fight government oppression in the future .
How can we express our gratitude for both helping to grow the government into the largest , most powerful , and most dangerous threat to our generations , and also disarming us ?
Suffice it to say , that it is impossible to thank you enough for these boons , and so we shall never thank you .
Three more cheers for disarmed and helpless grandchildren , an ever more powerful and dangerous State , and , of course , the Boomers who made this utopia possible !
You Boomers may be saying to yourselves , " We do n't deserve credit for these glorious advances for the homeland .
It was the government that was responsible for these acts , not us .
You should be praising the far - seeing and wise government of the United States rather than our generation . "
This attempt to shift the burden of responsibility onto the government would be wrong for at least two important reasons .
First , it was your behemoth generation of Boomers who played the pivotal role in electing the wise and virtuous politicians who have wrought these wondrous changes on America over the last three decades ( and who among us can doubt the virtue of the politicians elected by the Boomers over the last thirty years ? ) .
If your generation had not flexed its massive numerical muscle in the elections that brought us that cabal of virtuous politicians , these wonderful changes never would have been possible .
Second , and even more important , is the fact that you Boomers have almost universally rejected the libertarian principles of individual liberty , peace , and private property that this nation was founded upon and which acted in previous generations as a bulwark against the statist programs just discussed .
This country was founded upon two critical and related ideas : 1 ) that taxation and the State in general are horrendously dangerous threats to individual liberty , peace , and private property , and must be vigilantly battled at all costs , and 2 ) that private property and individual liberty are the greatest goods in the world — to be defended by force of arms and with our very lives , if necessary .
Yet , you Boomers almost universally rejected these principles .
You passively accepted whatever new taxes happened to come into existence ( there are now too many taxes for us young people to count , thank God ! ) , and you silently accepted the growth of the State in every conceivable direction .
If you had not rejected the libertarian principles of individual liberty , peace and private property , your politicians would never have been brazen enough to try the harebrained socialist schemes listed above .
In short , because you Boomers did virtually nothing to stop the progression of statism and economic interventionism over the past thirty years , your generation is responsible for the construction of the wonderful America you shall shortly bequeath to us ; a debt - ridden , tax - ridden , war - ridden , disarmed , heavily - policed , goldless and green - paper - flooded nation that is currently at war with two others and which is about to plunge into a gut - wrenching recession thanks to your green - paper - created housing bubble .
Indeed , your generation continues to do nothing to combat statism , warmongering and economic interventionism even unto today ( all of which are nearly perfectly embodied in the warmongering Giuliani and the socialist Clinton ; both of whom , if I am not mistaken , are Baby Boomers ) .
The vast , vast majority of Boomers , for example , flatly refuse to support virtuous and principled libertarians like Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul , and his intention to resurrect the principles of sound money , peace , individual liberty , and much , much , much smaller government .
So , do n't feign humility , and do n't try to shift the " ache of guilt , " ( to use a phrase from J. Glenn Gray 's excellent book The Warriors ) , onto the government .
It was your giant generation of warmongering , interventionist , statist , and oblivious Baby Boomers that is responsible for the creation of the debt - ridden and warmongering nation we stand to inherit .
Our generations have little to offer in remuneration for your final abandonment of the libertarian principles this country was founded upon .
( What , indeed , could we do to thank you for the existence of the massive and dangerous state that totally envelops our hapless young generations today ? )
We can only hope that the billions upon billions of hours of work we will be forced to do over the next ten years , by the government you have foisted on us ( in order to involuntarily pay the taxes that will fund your Social Security checks , buy your myriad Medicare - funded " legal " drugs , pay for your myriad and ridiculous welfare programs , pay down your national debt , pay off the bills from your wars , pay to imprison more pot smokers from our generations , pay the police to take away more of our guns , et cetera ad nauseam ) , will be sufficient to express our gratitude .
Tom Brokaw be damned — yours is truly " The Greatest Generation . "
Sincerely , Generations X , Y , & Etc .

The Best of Mark R. Crovelli
A detailed guide to understanding how muscles and bones interact , and how common injuries and conditions occur
GPS - based tracking devices do n't just help you figure out where you are and where you 're going , they might also help you avoid a speeding ticket .
Shaun Malone of California is contesting a speeding ticket in that state by arguing that his GPS - based tracking system shows that the officer 's radar gun was wrong .
Malone , a 17 - year - old who was clocked doing 62 MPH in a 45 MPH zone on July 4 of this year , has more than just a GPS on his side .
As the AP reports , his stepfather Roger Rude is a retired sheriff , and is pushing Malone to fight the ticket .
( As an aside , how awesome would it be to be Sherriff Rude ? )
Ironically , Malone 's parents had the GPS system installed in order to track the whereabouts and speed of their son , whom they readily admit has a lead foot .
In fact , he has already been grounded for having gone over 70 MPH after the GPS was installed .
Nevertheless , Malone 's parents say that the data on the day in question shows that their son was not speeding in the vicinity of where the ticket was issued .
While many GPS systems do n't log travel details extensively enough to be used as a defense against a moving violation , Malone 's car was outfitted with a device that could do just that .
According to Rude , all recorded plots on Malone 's route show him to be driving under the speed limit .
At the same time , Rude says , GPS - systems are clearly more reliable than radar systems , which , while good , are " not an infallible tool " and are subject to human error .
A Sonoma County traffic commissioner has to decide whether the GPS system can be accepted as a basis to challenge the ticket , but ex-sheriff Rude is prepared to push his case in court in the event of an unhappy outcome .
The debate is likely to come down to how often the GPS device calculated and reported ground speed .
Petaluma police lieutenant John Edwards told the AP that since GPS is satellite - based , there 's a delay involved , and that Malone may have sped up and slowed down in the window between measurements , which could be as long as 60 seconds .
GPS tracking systems like the one in Malone 's car are becoming an increasingly popular way for parents to keep tabs on their kids , an outgrowth of the initial use of such devices in car fleets and trucking .
Many consumer - oriented GPS navigation systems also have these capabilities , but Malone 's was hardcore : the system would even e-mail his parents in the event that he drove too fast .
This article deals with Home owner ’s insurance .
I have recently bought a house so this one “ really hits close to home ” , if you know what I mean : ) GoodHouseKeeping had these easy ways .
Shop around
While automobile insurance rates are expected to go down this year , homeowner policies will likely go up ( by about 4 percent ) .
So it pays to hunt for the best price .
The same Web sites that quote car insurance rates will also give you the cost of online home insurance coverage .
Ask about discounts
Many insurers cut rates by about 5 percent if the homeowner has burglar alarms , smoke detectors , or dead bolt locks .
Some give breaks to older people and to families in which no one smokes .
Do n’t over insure
If you bought enough coverage to equal the price you paid for the house , you may have too much insurance .
That ’s because your purchase price included the cost of the land , but even if your house burns down , you do n’t need to buy the land again .
So shrink your policy to the right amount : what it would cost to rebuild your home .
You can also cut costs by dropping coverage you bought for jewelry or other valuables that have decreased in value .
But do n’t under insure Building costs have soared in the past few years .
If you have n’t increased the size of your policy , you may not be able to replace your house if you ’re hit by a tragic fire , hurricane , or flood .
Ask your agent how much coverage you need today .
To hold down your cost , increase the deductible .
If you offer to pay up to $ 1,000 out - of - pocket for a claim , instead of $ 250 , you can save as much as 24 percent .
Choose your next home wisely
It is lovely to live near the ocean , but that ’s where insurance costs the most .
In hurricane zones , average premiums will soar 20 to 100 percent this year , reports the Insurance Information Institute .
And it ’s going to get worse .
Many insurers are n’t renewing policies for homes on the coasts .
Florida now has “ insurance refugees ” –people who ca n’t afford coastal coverage and are moving inland to higher ground .
No question about it : Ocean views are going to carry a heavy price .
Want the Best Deal ?
Price - Shop Online
Use all or some of these Web sites to collect cost information on the kind of auto and homeowners insurance coverage you want .
Then ask an insurance agent to beat the best rate you find .
Just as the Annapolis Middle East Peace Conference morphed largely into an exercise in lining up a coalition against Iran , so too is President George W. Bush ’s first visit to Israel quickly becoming the latest round of Tehran - bashing .
The trip , which was initially framed as an effort to jump - start peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians , is now officially described as having a regional objective , to “ diminish a potential threat posed by an Iran with a nuclear weapons capability ” through the creation of a joint Arab - Israeli Front .
It matters not that such a political melding is a fantasy somewhat akin to the Vietnamese “ third force ” invented by Graham Greene for his novel The Quiet American .
It was no coincidence that when Bush was greeted at the airport by Israeli President Shimon Peres , Peres carefully choreographed speech immediately referred to the threat posed by Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Bush , apparently unaware of the director of national intelligence ’s assessment that Iran has no active nuclear weapons program , agreed and went several steps further , excoriating Iran for its pursuit of an atom bomb , saying Iran is a “ threat to world peace , ” and warning that there would be “ serious consequences ” if U.S. warships were to be attacked .
At a stop in Abu Dhabi on Sunday , Bush again picked up his main theme , describing how Iran threatens the security of the entire world .
Bush ’s threatening comments , combined with the Jan. 6 encounter between Iranian vessels and three U.S. warships in the Strait of Hormuz , are a reminder that there are many on both sides who would like to see war .
Intelligence sources believe that the Iranian speedboats were under the command of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ( IRG ) al - Quds special operations force and that it is quite possible that the Iranians were trying to provoke a shooting incident .
The encounter involved Iranian speedboats apparently ignoring orders to back off or change course and also dropping objects into the water , forcing one ship to change course .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates initially appeared nonplused by the apparent storm - in - a - teakettle provocation , noting that there had been three or four similar exchanges in the past year .
The United States released two videos of the incident , including a recording of what it said was the verbal exchange between the two sides .
This initially appeared to generally confirm the Defense Department account , though the perspective of the camera does not make it possible to judge just how close the Iranian boats actually came to the U.S. warships .
It is not completely clear whether the U.S. vessels were in international waters , and the definition of international waters in the region is itself somewhat disputed .
At its narrowest the Strait of Hormuz is only 21 miles wide , half of which is claimed by Oman and the United Arab Emirates and half by Iran as territorial waters .
There is a generally recognized four - mile - wide commercial lane in the middle of the strait , one mile wide in each direction with a two - mile buffer in between , that is normally accepted as an international zone for ships moving between the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf .
In the international zone , there are accepted norms for ships avoiding contact with other ships , but the United States Navy has no preemptive right to fire on vessels that it considers to be threatening unless those vessels pose a clear and unquestionable threat .
The Iranian boats have the same right to access international waters as does the U.S. Navy , but they do not have the right to threaten another vessel by moving too close or too aggressively , though admittedly the definition of what constitutes a threat is subject to interpretation .
Iran also considers the strait to be unambiguously part of its territorial waters , the international commercial lane notwithstanding , and it has claimed in the past that all warships passing through must seek prior permission to do so .
Hence it felt that it was within its rights to challenge the U.S. presence .
The U.S. does not recognize the Iranian territorial claim and does not routinely declare to the Iranians that there are warships in the area  indeed , there is no mechanism to do so  but Navy ships generally identify themselves in responding to Iranian patrol boats whenever challenged .
The U.S. Navy video showed several images , including three small launches moving near a U.S. ship .
An audio recording included a voice from a U.S. ship telling one craft it was “ straying into danger and may be subject to defensive measures . ”
The U.S. also reported that the small craft responded : “ You will explode after a few minutes . ”
The “ explode ” is far from clear and the U.S.
Navy is now admitting that the radio contact might not have come from the Iranian boats .
It might even have been completely unrelated to the incident and not directed at the warships at all .
Iran has rejected the footage as fake , released its own version , and accused Washington of trying to stir up tension in the region .
There is speculation that the incident might have been staged to send a warning to the U.S. and its Gulf Arab allies on the eve of the Bush visit to the region , suggesting that Iran would aggressively defend its interests , but U.S. intelligence analysts believe that the provocative act was carried out by the IRG ’s al - Quds force for domestic political reasons .
It was primarily a response to conciliatory remarks made two days previously by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Khamenei suggested that there would be eventual dialogue and reconciliation with America , a position not shared by the Revolutionary Guard .
According to the CIA analysis , the al - Quds force might have been attempting to draw the U.S. into a military response , thus heightening tensions , strengthening its own political position through exploitation of the American “ threat , ” and thereby undermining Khamenei .
By this interpretation , the incident can be seen as the product of divisions in the Iranian government , and it is quite possible that the leadership in Tehran did not approve of the IRG provocation .
The U.S. response , which was generally restrained and far from being close to a shooting incident as presented in the media , reflected legitimate concern for the ships ’ safety in light of the 2000 bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen , in which a small craft loaded with explosives staged a suicide attack that killed 17 sailors and almost sank the ship .
Since the U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran and cannot discuss areas that could potentially lead to conflict , Adm. William Fallon of the U.S. Central Command has reportedly been seeking to set up incident - response protocols and a hotline with the Iranians to prevent a minor incident escalating into an act of war .
As is often the case , the soldiers and sailors are reluctant to rush into wars that the politicians like President Bush are much more inclined to embrace .
The lesson of the incident in the Persian Gulf , and the political hay that was made out of it by both sides , is that as long as the United States refuses to talk to Iran , the potential for something very small turning into something that would be devastating to both countries remains .
President Bush still apparently dreams of confronting Iran , even if the imploding situation in Pakistan makes it unlikely that he will risk doing so .
Israel makes no secret of the fact that it would like Washington to act , and Israel ’s wishes are seldom denied in Washington .
And then there are the hotheads on the Iranian side .
The U.S. national interest in the Middle East would be best served by marginalizing those who want war and beginning to negotiate seriously .
As Winston Churchill put it , “ To jaw jaw is better than to war war . ”
Fox guest claims CIA ' sabotaging our own War on Terror ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 17 , 2007 Print This Email This Fox News on Tuesday interviewed veteran Pentagon reporter Rowan Scarborough about his " startling allegation " that " elements within the CIA are sabotaging our own War on Terror . "
Scarborough , a former columnist for the Reverend Sun Myung Moon - owned Washington Times , is the author of Sabotage : America 's Enemies Within the CIA , which claims that " CIA bureaucrats are undermining President Bush and the War on Terror through disinformation , incompetence , and outright sabotage . "
" The CIA ... is the only agency I know that has a retired group of officers who formed together for the sole purpose of attacking Bush , " said Scarborough .
" The head of the organization goes around the country giving speeches about how the government did 9/11 . "
This was apparently a reference to Ray McGovern of Intelligence Professionals for Sanity , who has criticized the 9/11 Commission Report by saying that " to say that no one could prevent 9/11 was a bold - faced lie .
It basically let the president and everyone responsible off the hook . "
" That , I think , gives you a little peak inside to the bureaucracy at Langley and how anti-Bush it is , and how they will do things like leak the existence of programs or leak false allegations against Vice - President Cheney or John Bolton , " Scarborough added .
" You said that historically , the Pentagon seems to be more Republican , the CIA more Democratic --- er , more Democrat -- and they just do n't like Bush , " said the Fox host .
" And so they make up these stories , you say .
Is there ever hell to pay for them ? "
" I do n't know of any CIA officer who 's been disciplined for any of the failures of the CIA , " Scarborough responded .
" Of all the allegations that were lodged out of the CIA against Bush people , nobody were held to account for that . "
According to Scarborough , his book , which criticizes the CIA for its reluctance to cooperate with Doug Feith 's Office of Special Plans in its cherry - picking of intelligence during the run-up to the Iraq War , was inspired by " Peter Hoekstra , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee .
He wrote a private letter to Bush , warning him that the CIA was undermining what he was trying to do . "

DISSENT IN AMERICA TO BE RELABELED 'HOMEGROWN TERRORISM '
PART 1 of 2
By Steven Yates
December 2 , 2007
NewsWithViews.com
On October 23 , 2007 , the House of Representatives passed what may be the most dangerous bill ever to come down the pike .
This bill , like many of its predecessors on our steady march toward totalitarianism , sailed under the radar .
There was virtually no publicity or fanfare .
Now , the bill has gone to the Senate , and is in committee .
The bill is called the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ( H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 ) .
The language in this bill is so maddeningly vague it could mean anything .
It could therefore be tailored to attack any group opposing national and international policies that have the backing of the corporatist - governmental power system .
Consider the definition offered of ï¿½violent radicalization ï¿½ ( from Sec. 899A of the bill being referred to the Senate ) : ï¿ ½the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious , or social change .ï¿½
This definition alone ought to raise your hackles !
What counts as an ï¿½extremist belief systemï¿½ ?
What constitutes ï¿½violenceï¿½ ?
Either one is anyoneï¿½s guess , because nowhere in the bill is the word ï¿ ½extremistï¿½ defined , nor is ï¿½violence ï¿½ defined .
In practice , they will mean whatever federal bureaucrats or others calling the shots want them to mean .
What about ï¿½facilitating ï¿½?
This is a favorite word in todayï¿½s mushy political - correctese .
Does it mean ï¿½causingï¿½?
Or merely ï¿½encouraging ï¿½?
How much ï¿½encouragementï¿½?
Consider the definition offered for ï¿½homegrown terrorismï¿½ : ï¿ ½the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States or any possession of the United States to intimidate or coerce the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives .ï¿½
No examples of ï¿½homegrown terrorismï¿½ are offered .
One could understand a federal proscription against ï¿ ½the use ï¿½ of force or violence ï¿½ï¿½ assuming we know what these amount to .
But ï¿½planned ï¿½ use ?
What does this mean ?
ï¿ ½Planning ï¿½ involves thought , not action .
In such ways this bill kicks open the door to the officially sanctioned creation of thought crimes that can be smuggled in under ï¿½homegrown terrorismï¿½ and treated accordingly .
Some critics have therefore dubbed H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 as the Thought Crimes Act of 2007 .
They have spoken of the potential criminalization of dissent in America .
There is plenty more in this insidious bill that ought to scare the living daylights out of anyone defending basic freedoms recognized by our Constitution .
Sec. 899B of the bill is entitled ï¿ ½Findingsï¿½ and consists of nine numbered paragraphs ï¿½all of them legislative land mines .
There is no need to look at them all .
Consider ( 3 ) : ï¿ ½The Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens .ï¿½
Again , the bill offers no definition or examples of ï¿½terrorist - related propagandaï¿½ available over the Internet .
The phrase could therefore again mean anything those in power want it to mean .
Or consider ( 6 ) : ï¿½The potential rise of self radicalized , unaffiliated terrorists domestically cannot be easily prevented through traditional Federal intelligence or law enforcement efforts , and requires the incorporation of State and local solutions .ï¿½
Read between the lines .
H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 would accelerate the federalization and militarization of state and local police departments .
If this bill becomes law , expect more Taser attacks on ordinary people who havenï¿½t been charged with any crime , but refuse absolute obedience to cops acting like common bullies .
Those paying attention know that there has been an epidemic of such attacks this year , the most recent being on a driver in Utah who declined to sign a traffic ticket and wanted proof that he had been speeding ( innocent until proven guilty , correct ? ) .
If this bill becomes law , police militancy will increase , but with incidents sufficiently widely dispersed that few residents will detect the pattern , organize , and demand a stop to it .
Sec. 899C of the H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 would establish a National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Ideologically Based Violence within the legislative branch .
The Commission will consist of ten members appointed by federal officials including the president and the Secretary of Homeland Security .
The bill commands the Commission in mind - numbingly repetitious language : ï¿ ½Examine and report upon the facts and causes of violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence in the United States , including United States connections to non-United States persons and networks , violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence in prison , individual or ï¿½lone wolf ï¿½ violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence , and other faces of the phenomena of violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence that the Commission considers important .ï¿½
The Commission would convene and conduct ï¿½studies ï¿½ for 18 months .
Very possibly it will rely on such biased sources as the Marxist Southern Poverty Law Centerï¿½s Intelligence Project , which bills itself as the gold standard for monitoring ï¿½hate groupsï¿½ and ï¿½extremistï¿½ activity on U.S. soil .
During this period , grassroots political groups could find themselves compelled for their own protection to do the equivalent of background checks on new members and recruits .
Some would doubtless be spies sent by the SPLC or the federal government itself .
They would also have to watch what they send out via email , or place on their websites .
Big Brother would be watching ï¿½especially anything sent to or received from persons based overseas .
Sec. 899D creates a Center of Excellence for the Study of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism in the United States .
This Center would be ï¿½university - based , ï¿½ suggesting intent to pull academia into subservience .
The lure , of course , will be Homeland Security dollars .
The result will be more infiltration and more academic thought control , this time in the guise of the ï¿½war on terror .ï¿½
The Findings section ends : ï¿ ½Certain governments , including the United Kingdom , Canada , and Australia have significant experience with homegrown terrorism and the United States can benefit from lessons learned by those nations .ï¿½
Articlesï¿½on the Internet , of courseï ¿½have been appearing regularly on how the U.K is becoming a total surveillance state , with cameras watching the movements of civilians everywhere .
Is our government to emulate the U.K.?
All three societies are slightly further down the road to police - state conditions than we are .
Is that why they are suggested as good models for those who would carry out the mandates of H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 ?
Sec. 899E elaborates : ï¿½International Effortï¿ ½The Secretary shall , in cooperation with the Department of State , the Attorney General , and other Federal Government entities , as appropriate , conduct a survey of methodologies implemented by foreign nations to prevent violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism in their respective nations .ï¿½
In other words , our federal government is to study foreign police states in order to build a better police state on U.S. soil .
Only , however , ï¿ ½[t ] o the extent that methodologies are permissible under the Constitution ï¿½ï¿ ½
If anyone at the federal level except perhaps Ron Paul had read the bill , they would realize that by its very nature it is unconstitutional .
Nothing in the Constitution authorizes our federal government to model policies on those of governments elsewhere in the world ï¿½or to conduct the kind of domestic infiltrations and surveillance this bill would require .
Sec. 899 F , in light of all the above , is almost comical .
Are you ready ?
Here it comes : ï¿ ½The Department of Homeland Securityï¿½s efforts to prevent ideologically based violence and homegrown terrorism as described herein shall not violate the constitutional rights , civil rights , or civil liberties of United States citizens or lawful permanent residents .ï¿½
George Orwell couldnï¿½t have said it better !
Here is the million dollar question : what prompted this bill ?
The only event in recent years that can be labeled ï¿½homegrown terrorismï¿½ï¿½given the federal governmentï¿½s pronouncements as our only criterionï¿ ½was the destruction of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City .
The federal government executed Timothy McVeigh for that on July 14 , 2001 .
Even in that case there are unanswered questions .
But while Internet - based claims persist that McVeigh had accomplices other than Terry Nichols , none are officially recognized .
Other attacks on U.S. soil ( World Trade Center 1993 and , of course , the 9/11 attacks ) are blamed on foreigners .
So again : what prompted this bill ?
There is only one plausible answer .
H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 ï¿½s unnamed target is the independent Patriot movement .
By the ï¿ ½Patriot movementï¿ ½ I mean red- blooded Americans who proudly defend gun rights , and will tell you why : an armed populace is a free populace .
They have turned off their televisions and tuned out corporate - controlled media .
They have removed their children from government schools .
Many are men and women of modest means at bestï¿½some are living from paycheck to paycheckï¿ ½and are sick and tired of bromides on behalf of NAFTA / CAFTA / FTAA , ï¿½free tradeï¿½ and ï¿½globalization , ï¿½ when they have seen none of the supposed benefits .
They are aware that today savings are nonexistent , while bankruptcies and foreclosures are at all - time highs .

Turkey 's senior prosecutor filed a petition with the Constitutional Court today to close the country 's leading pro-Kurdish political party , the latest example of the government 's tense relationship with the Kurdish minority here .
That step quickly followed a decision by the court today to outlaw a related pro-Kurdish party that had preceded and given rise to the current one and that , in the court 's judgment , had ties to armed rebels .
Both developments underscored the profound wariness and suspicion with which many Turkish officials regard the country 's Kurds , as a war in Iraq potentially draws near .
Officials fear that a war would whip up demands for independence and even set off violence among Kurds in southeastern Turkey , near the Iraqi border .
That concern has weighed heavily on Turkish leaders during deliberations over whether to support an American - led military invasion of Iraq .
Expedition 5 Flight Engineer Sergei Treschev , left , and NASA ISS Science Officer Peggy Whitson share a meal aboard the International Space Station .
" My favorite space food was peanut butter .
I 'm not a big fan of it on the ground , but could n't get enough of it in space . "
Astronaut Peggy Whitson ,
Expedition 5 NASA ISS Science Officer Imagine being stuck in a house for months , not able to venture out to go to the grocery store whenever a particular food craving hits .
All that you have to survive on is already stowed in the pantry .
The items in this pantry have been predetermined long ahead of time , and if your taste buds happen to change , you are simply out of luck .
The Space Food Systems Laboratory at Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) in Houston does all it can to ensure the astronauts are happy when it comes to their meals .
Space Food Tidbits STS - 112 Mission Specialist Sandy Magnus plans to enjoy a tortilla with her lunch .
Flour tortillas are considered the favorite bread item of astronauts , because they do not give off crumbs .

" I 'd Like to See a Menu , Please " Living in Space - Space Food Eating at Cafe ISS - by Astronaut Ed Lu Thanskgiving in Space ' Mmm , Chicken ...'
Food choice is extremely important to astronauts , and the longer the flight , the more significant those choices become .
The meals are stowed pantry - style onboard Space Station , so crewmembers can eat food items in any order they wish .
For instance , if crewmembers want to have chicken three nights in a row , they can do that .
" Being on Space Station , so much of what is going on is beyond their control , " said Vickie Kloeris , JSC manager of Space Food Systems .
" And so food is just a comfort thing that they would like to feel they have some input on or some control over .
It 's just a big psychological thing -- I do n't know if we 've flown anyone to Station that has not been concerned about their food . "
Emilce ( Emmy ) Vest , Food Services director and executive chef for JSC , agrees that comfort food is of the utmost importance , especially when astronauts are in space .
" In situations where there is little outside stimulation and we 're somewhat lonely , food becomes more of a focus because it gives us sensual and chemical stimulation , " Vest said .
" We also crave the social payoff in ' breaking bread ' with our companions . "
The Space Food Systems Laboratory tries to vary the menus by allowing the crew to take bonus containers into space , in which they can request special , off - the - menu food items .
These usually include commercially available candy bars , cookies or crackers -- anything with a long shelf life .
Astronaut Steve Smith enjoys a meal in space .
Read more about mission menus .
Yet even with the special goodies sent to the Space Station ahead of time , astronauts inevitably return to Earth wishing that they could have had more food variety in space .
More variety -- especially fresh food items -- often shows up when a Russian Progress vehicle docks to the Space Station .
The unpiloted cargo spacecraft usually brings fresh items such as apples , oranges , grapefruits and other fruit items .
The Russians also include interesting foods that Americans do not typically eat .
" The Russians will fly things like raw onion and raw garlic , because that 's more a part of their culture than part of our culture , " Kloeris said .
" But it 's interesting because some of our American crewmembers have said that even though it did n't sound all that great ahead of time , it actually was nice to have it because it was something totally different . "
Happy Meals Choosing food items for Space Station crewmembers can also pose a challenge due to the fact that most crewmembers say that their tastes change while in orbit .
While Kloeris notes that there is no real scientific data to support that theory , there is plenty of anecdotal data .
Vickie Kloeris , JSC manager of Space Food Systems .
For instance , astronauts seem to like spicier foods and tart beverages such as lemonade in space , while on the ground those items are not as appreciated .
Astronaut Peggy Whitson 's personal account of food echoes that thought .
" When STS - 112 visited , I told the commander that I was n't opening the hatch unless they had salsa , " said Whitson , the Expedition 5 Space Station Science Officer .
" My favorite space food was peanut butter .
I 'm not a big fan of it on the ground , but could n't get enough of it in space . "
The Space Food Systems Laboratory learns more from each crew about how to keep long - duration flight astronauts happy with their menus .
And although food seems so basic to the ordinary person , it is much more important when you do not have ready access to a grocery store .
" Taste is one of the first senses with which we explore the world , " Vest said .
" There are a lot of chemical reasons for food to be a comfort mechanism .
However , our primitive brain is hardwired to equate food with ' home ' and safety .
When we 're hungry , we 're all two years old . "

Joe Klein wrote a column in which he stated the House FISA bill would :
give terrorists the same legal protections as Americans .
That is well beyond stupid .
What was way beyond stupid , of course , was Joe Klein himself , as Glenn Greenwald pointed out at the time .
Now , after telling 4 million Time subscribers that Democrats want to coddle terrorists , Klein does a mealy mouthed " correction " ( but just online , apparently ) .
And once again , Greenwald is there to slap him silly .
First of all , there 's the not insignificant point that Klein reported on legislation that he plainly did n't read .
Yet look at Klein 's first statement in his " correction " : I may have made a mistake in my column this week about the FISA legislation passed by the House , although it 's difficult to tell for sure given the technical nature of the bill 's language and fierce disagreements between even moderate Republicans and Democrats on the Committee about what the bill actually does contain .
One can debate whether Klein 's original , inaccurate claims about the House FISA bill in his Time article can fairly be called " lies " ( as opposed to inexcusably reckless inaccuracies ) .
But this statement by Klein in his " correction " unquestionably is a lie .
There is no confusion possible about whether the House bill -- as Klein originally wrote -- " would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court . "
Anyone who told that to Klein was lying .
All you have to do is read the House bill in order to know that .
Here is Section 2 of the RESTORE Act -- the very first section after the " Definitions " section : ' CLARIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF NON - UNITED STATES PERSONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ' Sec. 105A .
( a ) Foreign to Foreign Communications - ( 1 ) IN GENERAL - Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act , a court order is not required for electronic surveillance directed at the acquisition of the contents of any communication between persons that are not known to be United States persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information , without respect to whether the communication passes through the United States or the surveillance device is located within the United States .
Seems clear enough , right ?
Well , it would be to anyone who read the legislation , but it 's clear that Klein is n't depending on real reporting .
He 's letting Republican spin him .
But Klein , of course , never bothered to read the bill and still has n't ( even though he is published by Time to " report on " and opine about this bill ) .
Instead , even now , he says that he has spoken with both Republicans and Democrats , and while Democrats insist that what he wrote was false , " the Republican Committee staff disagrees and says [ his ] reporting is correct . "
In other words , Klein 's GOP source (s ) blatantly lied to him about what the bill does and does n't do in order to manipulate him into uncritically feeding Time 's readers the Rush Limbaugh Line -- namely , that Democrats are giving equal rights to Terrorists and preventing the Leader from eavesdropping on foreign Terrorists .
And Klein dutifully wrote down what he was told in Time without bothering to find out if it was true and without ever bothering to talk to any of the bill 's Democratic proponents .
And no Time Editor knew enough or cared enough to bother correcting any of it .
And thus , the unfortunate 4 million Americans who read and trust Time now think that the Democrats ' FISA bill does the exact opposite of what it actually does .
Modern journalism , " Time " style .
Of course , Klein has a history of dishonest hackery , and his editors , clearly fearful of the all - powerful Klein , continuously back up that hackery without requiring him to correct his constant errors in the print magazine , the better to maintain his pretense of competence .

Move over Barry , Roger now Baseball 's Biggest Jerk
Recommended Video :
Step aside , Barry Bonds .
You are no longer Baseball 's Biggest Jerk .
Sorry , Barry .
You had a great run but it 's time for you to relinquish your crown to Roger Clemens .
Goodbye , Johnny Flaxseed .
Hello , B12 Rocket !
You 've been a memorable Baseball 's Biggest Jerk , Mr. Bonds .
Years from now , when the greatest baseball jerks are saluted , their accomplishments will be described as Bondsian .
You 've left some big shoes to fill , but that wo n't be a problem for Clemens , because he 's like you - he keeps expanding .
The BBJ committee would ask you to make a public appearance to pass the torch to Clemens , but we'd be disappointed if you showed up .
Maybe you could videotape a tribute to him and forget to send it .
Or just tell us to go take a flying hike .
Privately , I think you 'd agree with the committee that Clemens is a worthy successor , although if you did , it would be the first time you 've agreed with a sportswriter .
So I wo n't ask .
It was shaping up as a close vote , but Mr. Clemens blew you out of the water with his phone call to his former trainer , Brian McNamee , whose son is gravely ill .
" He said his son was sick and dying , " Clemens said .
" That 's why I reached out . "
The last time someone reached out to me in such a warm and caring way , my urologist was snapping on a latex glove .
A couple of springs ago , Barry , you ordered the media to zoom in their cameras on your son to see the pain the media had caused him .
It was a memorable moment , but child - exploitation - wise , you can't carry Clemens ' jock .
Clemens kept the " reach out " portion of his call to McNamee mercifully brief , moving right along to the more important matter of Clemens ' sick and dying reputation .
Clemens neglected to mention to McNamee that the phone call was being taped , but my guess is that McNamee , knowing the kind of dude he was dealing with , suspected what was up .
Because both of them danced cleverly around the key issue of who 's lying about what .
It was hilarious !
If Clemens follows through with his threat to retire from baseball , he has a great future as a radio shock - jock , one of those guys who make the nutty prank phone calls .
But credit where credit is due , Barry .
Even though Clem has out - jerked you , he learned a lot from you .
It 's like he 's stealing your act .
McNamee , in the phone call with Clemens , offered to go to prison .
Imagine if McNamee and Greg Anderson wind up sharing a cell .
What a riot !
Speaking of comparing notes , maybe you and Roger some day will talk about how crazy it is that you both had trainers who were juicing their clients , yet neither trainer ever juiced his No. 1 client , even when that client was in career - crisis mode .
Barry , you and Roger are practically brothers .
You both experienced remarkable , stunning career resurgences in your late 30s .
Both of you have worked out hard all your lives , but both of you suddenly pumped on an extra 40 or 50 pounds of power muscle .
I heard a radio interview in which a sportswriter who has known Clemens for a long time said the basic difference between the two of you is that Clemens is a better teammate .
No way !
The writer gave an example of a time when Clemens ' teammate was drilled by the opposing pitcher and Clemens ' teammates , including the guy who got hit , begged Roger not to retaliate , because to do so would jeopardize the team 's chances of winning .
What did Clem do ?
He plunked the next batter he faced .
Because venting his anger , and being true to baseball 's ancient code , was more important to Clemens than winning a game his team desperately needed .
That 's a special teammate .
Barry , you always demanded , and got , preferential treatment .
No mandatory stretching with the team .
Extra clubhouse space for you and yours .
The right to leave the ballpark early and to veto pinch - hitting requests on a whim .
Clemens outdid you .
He demanded a contract allowing him to work only part of a season , and not requiring him to travel or be with the team , other than when scheduled to pitch .
When fans look for true jerkyness , Barry , that 's the kind of originality they appreciate .
It must be sad for you to give up your crown , but you have to tip it to the Rocket .
And remember , Barry :
If for any reason Clemens is unable to fulfill his duties as Baseball 's Biggest Jerk , we 'll be counting on you to make a comeback .

Maj Gen Tim Cross said Donald Rumsfeld ignored warnings
Maj Gen Tim Cross , who was the most senior UK officer involved in post - war planning , told the Sunday Mirror US policy was " fatally flawed " .
Maj Gen Cross said : " We were all very concerned about the lack of detail that had gone into the post - war plan . "
His comments came after Gen Sir Mike Jackson , head of the Army during the invasion , told the Daily Telegraph US policy was " intellectually bankrupt " .
The Ministry of Defence played down the comments by Sir Mike , now retired , saying he was entitled to express his opinion on his former job .
' Lack of detail '
In an interview published on Saturday , Sir Mike said a claim by the then US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld that US forces " do n't do nation - building " was " nonsensical " .
Maj Gen Cross , also retired , said he had raised serious concerns about potential post - war problems in Iraq with Mr Rumsfeld as well .
But he said Mr Rumsfeld " dismissed " or " ignored " the warnings .
" Right from the very beginning we were all very concerned about the lack of detail that had gone into the post - war plan and there is no doubt that Rumsfeld was at the heart of that process , " he said .
There is no doubt that with hindsight the US post - war plan was fatally flawed and many of us sensed that at the time
Maj Gen Tim Cross
" I had lunch with Rumsfeld in February in Washington - before the invasion in March 2003 - and raised concerns about the need to internationalise the reconstruction of Iraq and work closely with the United Nations . "
Maj Gen Cross , 59 , who was deputy head of the coalition 's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance , said he also raised concerns over the number of troops available to maintain security in Iraq .
" He did n't want to hear that message , " he said .
" The US had already convinced themselves that following the invasion Iraq would emerge reasonably quickly as a stable democracy . "
He added : " There is no doubt that with hindsight the US post - war plan was fatally flawed and many of us sensed that at the time . "
We do think there have been many mistakes made .
We would like to see a full - scale inquiry
William Hague , Shadow Foreign Secretary
Iraq militia ' freeze ' welcomed ' Frustration ' with UK in Basra
Politicians from across the spectrum have come out in support of Sir Mike 's comments , made ahead of the serialisation of his autobiography in the Telegraph .
Sir Malcolm Rifkind , Conservative former foreign secretary and defence secretary , told the BBC that Mr Rumsfeld was " incompetent " .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said the retired generals ' criticisms re-enforced the case for a full inquiry into the war and its consequences , and called for a report to be made to parliament in October .
Mr Hague told Sky News : " We do think there have been many mistakes made .
We would like to see a full - scale inquiry .
" I think some of the comments from one or two of the retired generals very much do strengthen the case for that and we want to see a full report when it gets back on Iraq . "
A Downing Street spokesman said there had already been three " pretty exhaustive " inquiries , and that the prime minister had recognised there were lessons to be learned .
But he said that the process needed to wait until the fighting was over .
' Extraordinary decision '
John Bolton , former US Ambassador to the UN , told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that Sir Mike had " read into a version of history that simply is not supported by the evidence " .
" And I can see where he'd have a parochial view from the military perspective .
I do n't think he saw some of the larger political debates .
" I 'm not saying that we got it right in Washington because I 've made my own criticisms .
His just happen to be way off the mark , very simplistic , I think in a sense limited by the role that he had . "
The Telegraph also reports that , in his autobiography , Sir Mike says the US approach to fighting global terrorism was " inadequate " as it focused on military power rather than diplomacy and nation - building .
The US Department of Defence said : " Divergent viewpoints are a hallmark of open , democratic societies . "
A spokeswoman for the US State Department said she would not comment on Sir Mike 's views .
His comments follow a series of critical remarks from US officials about the British attitude towards Iraq .
BBC defence correspondent Paul Wood said Sir Mike 's comments may put further strain on the British - US operation in Iraq .

Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms , I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species .
To this end , I hold M&M duels .
Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger .
I apply pressure , squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters .
That is the “ loser , ” and I eat the inferior one immediately .
The winner gets to go another round .
I have found that , in general , the brown and red M&Ms are tougher , and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior .
I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack - food world .
Occasionally I will get a mutation , a candy that is misshapen , or pointier , or flatter than the rest .
Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness , but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength .
In this way , the species continues to adapt to its environment .
When I reach the end of the pack , I am left with one M&M , the strongest of the herd .
Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well , I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars , A Division of Mars , Inc. , Hackettstown , NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A. , along with a 3×5 card reading , “ Please use this M&M for breeding purposes . ”
This week they wrote back to thank me and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms .
I consider this “ grant money . ”
I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament .
From a field of hundreds , we will discover the True Champion .
There can be only one .
Want to buy some M&Ms and try it yourself ?

This wide - angle photograph of the night sky shows the location of 55 Cancri , a star where astronomers have found a record - breaking five planets .
55 Cancri is located fairly close to us at 41 light - years away .
It lies in the constellation Cancer , and can be seen through binoculars on a clear night .
The constellation Orion can be seen to the lower right .
Scientists announced today the discovery of a fifth planet in a distant star system that now looks like a " cousin " to our own .
Known as 55 Cancri , the sun - like star harbors the most number of planets ever discovered outside our solar system .
" We now know that our sun and its family of planets is not unusual , " study team member Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California , Berkeley told reporters in a teleconference .
Four of the planets had been previously detected , but the existence of the fifth planet took 18 years to confirm .
It is about 45 times more massive than Earth and might be similar to Saturn in its composition and appearance .
55 Cancri is located 41 light - years away in the direction of the constellation Cancer and is visible with binoculars .
The system contains a clutch of four inner planets that are separated from an outer planet by a huge gap .
" We have n't found a twin of our solar system , because the four planets close to the star are all the size of Neptune or bigger , " Marcy said .
Although more than 250 extrasolar , or " exoplanets , " are now known , only one other star , mu Ara in the southern sky , is known to have four planets .
Astronomers expect many multi-planet star system to be found as technology improves .
Possibly habitable
The newest member of Cancri 55's family lies within the star 's habitable zone , the region around the star within which water can exist in its liquid state .
Though the planet is a giant ball of gas , liquid water could exist on other , currently undiscovered rocky planets in the system .
Marcy said he 's optimistic that continued observations will reveal a rocky planet around the star within five years .
Such a potentially habitable planet could reside in the nearly 700 million - mile ( 1.1 million - kilometer ) wide space that separates 55 Cancri 's four inner planets and its outer one .
" I would bet you that gap is n't empty , " said study team member Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University .
" What we see in our solar system is that we are full up on planets .
There are very few tiny windows where you can drop even a moon - sized object in and have it survive in a stable orbit .
Another possibility is that a moon in orbit around 55 Cancri 's newly confirmed planet could harbor liquid water , and perhaps life , the researchers say
" If there were a moon around this planet , it would have a rocky surface , " Marcy said .
" Water on it could in principle puddle into lakes and oceans , serving as the solvent for biochemistry .
' One small step '
Michael Briley , an astronomer at the National Science Foundation who was not involved in the study , said the discovery marks an " exciting step " in the search for worlds like our own
" To go from the first detections of planets around sun- like stars to finding a full - fledged solar system with a planet in a habitable zone in just 12 years is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the years of hard work put in by these investigators , " Briley said
Alan Stern , associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington who also was not involved in the study , said " it is amazing to see our ability to detect extrasolar planets growing .
" We are finding solar systems with a richness of planets and a variety of planetary types comparable to our own , " Stern said
The planets were found using the Lick Observatory and the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii using the so - called radial velocity , or " wobble , " technique , whereby the presence of planets are inferred by the way they gravitationally affect their parent star 's orbit .
The newest world will be detailed in an upcoming issue of Astrophysical Journal .
" Finding five extrasolar planets orbiting a star is only one small step , " Marcy said .
" Earth - like planets are the next destination . "

I realize now my video may have been seen as disrespectful , so I want to apologize here , and give you a second video with more detail of the Halo 3 swag unbagging .
Halo 3 fans who I disappointed last week , this video is for you .

Yeah , I 'm not really sorry .
I love Halo 3 , and all this Swag is great , but those fanboys are too rabid for my tastes .
For the record none of the stuff was broken or even remotely hurt after the stress test .
Real fanboys would know that master chief 's energy shield could absorb the impact .
( Obviously , the Xbox was taken out of its case . )
I 'm holding a contest called " Not Insane Halo 3 Fanboy "

GOP FILIBUSTERS ….
I see that Republicans have successfully filibustered two more bills today : one to give a House seat to the District of Columbia ( 57 - 42 ) and one to restore habeas corpus rights to terrorism suspects ( 56 - 43 ) .
That seems like a good excuse to rerun this chart that McClatchy put together a couple of months ago .
As you can see , Republicans are n’t just obstructing legislation at normal rates .
They ’re obstructing legislation at three times the usual rate .
They ’re absolutely desperate to keep this stuff off the president ’s desk , where the only choice is to either sign it or else take the blame for a high - profile veto .
As things stand , though , Republicans will largely avoid blame for their tactics .
After all , the first story linked above says only that the DC bill “ came up short in the Senate ” and the second one that the habeas bill “ fell short in the Senate . ”
You have to read with a gimlet eye to figure out how the vote actually broke down , and casual readers will come away thinking that the bills failed because of some kind of generic Washington gridlock , not GOP obstructionism .
So , for the record , here are the votes .
On the habeas bill , Democrats and Independents voted 50 - 1 in favor .
Republicans voted 42 - 8 against .
On the DC bill , Democrats and Independents voted 49 - 1 in favor .
Republicans voted 41 - 8 against .
Would it really be so hard for reporters to make it clear exactly who ’s responsible for blocking these bills ?
Ask The Question
Antiabortion activists in several states are promoting constitutional amendments that would define life as beginning at conception , which could effectively outlaw all abortions and some birth control methods .
The campaigns to grant " personhood " to fertilized eggs , giving them the same legal protections as human beings , come as the nation in January marks the 35th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion .
During those three decades , abortion foes have succeeded in imposing a variety of restrictions , such as waiting periods and parental notification for minors .
But there are still about 1.3 million abortions a year in the U.S .
Some activists say they are fed up with incremental steps -- and are not interested in waiting years , or possibly decades , for a more conservative court to revisit Roe .
Instead , they are out to change the legal status of embryos in hopes of forcing the Supreme Court to ban abortion .
" The concept that we 're going to elect judges who will change everything has failed , " said Brian Rohrbough , a former president of Colorado Right to Life .
" The logical thing is to start with personhood .
. . .
It 's the only legitimate tactic that does not involve a compromise . "
MATTHEWS : I have always wondered something about the pro-life movement .
If — if you believe that killing — well , killing a fetus or killing an unborn child is — is murder , why do n‘t you bring murder charge or seek a murder penalty against a woman who has an abortion ?
Why do you let her off , if you really believe it ‘s murder ?
O‘STEEN : We have never sought criminal penalties against a woman .
MATTHEWS : Why not ?
O‘STEEN : There have n‘t been criminal penalties against a woman .
MATTHEWS : Well , why not ?
O‘STEEN : Well , you do n‘t know the circumstances and how she ‘s been forced into this .
And that ‘s...
MATTHEWS : Forced into it ?
( CROSSTALK )
O‘STEEN : ... to be effective .
We ‘re out — we ‘re not out — we ‘re out to try to protect unborn children .
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : See , this is where the hypocrisy comes in , sir .
If it ‘s wrong to have an abortion , why do n‘t you criminalize it ?
( CROSSTALK )
O‘STEEN : I do n‘t think that ‘s the way you ‘re going to protect unborn children .
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : But , if you say it ‘s murder , why do n‘t you act on that ?
O‘STEEN : I think civil — I think civil penalties , aiming at the doctors , taking away their financial incentives .
We ‘re after what works to protect unborn children .
And that ‘s the goal .
MATTHEWS :
But the problem with all the states ‘ rights is , you just go to the next state .
And , if you outlaw it in America , you just go to Canada or Mexico or Dominican Republic .
Unless you penalize the person who has an abortion , I do n‘t see how you actually stop somebody from having one .
O‘STEEN : Well , I — I ‘m not — we have never sought criminal penalties against a woman .
I think it ‘s much — far more effective to take away the financial incentive of the abortion doctors that are doing this for profit and for money .
And we are — and our goal , remember , is to protect unborn children and to do what will work .
And it is a fact we have a federal system of government , yes .
MATTHEWS : Right .
O‘STEEN : Yes , we ‘re going to work for laws in all of the states .
And we will overturn Roe v. Wade .
And Fred Thompson would help do that .
MATTHEWS : Do you believe that abortion is murder ?
O‘STEEN : I believe it ‘s the killing of a human being .
Murder is a technical term .
And right now , unfortunately , it ‘s legal .
But it ‘s the killing of a human being .
MATTHEWS : But you do believe it ‘s murder ?
O‘STEEN : I believe it ‘s the killing of a human being , that ‘s the term .
MATTHEWS :
It just seems like you make a basic political judgment that would blame the doctor , when , in fact , these doctors do n‘t go door to door offering people abortion services .
The person who wants the abortion goes to a doctor and has the procedure done by the doctor .
Yet you put the onus on the doctor .
It just seems to be the strangest way to enforce a law .
O‘STEEN : Remember , that ‘s where the financial incentive is , and the physician knows what they ‘re doing .
How many women have been told this is a blob of tissue ?
This is n‘t really a human life ?
How are they pressured by men that want to escape their responsibilities , perhaps ?
What about a young girl that ‘s been impregnated by a male , where it ‘s a case of statutory rape ?
But the abortion doctor knows exactly what they ‘re doing .
They ‘re taking a human life .
And you will see Roe v.
Wade reversed and you ‘ll see respect for human life restored .
And Fred Thompson will help do that .
Hardball
He 's the head of " National Right To Life . "
I think we need to have this discussion .
Let 's debate it out in the open and " air both sides " because from where I sit it's the " pro-lifers " who have n't thought this thing through .
Nobody says they can't agitate against abortion and stand out there with their sickening pictures and try to dissuade women from doing it .
I will defend their right to argue against abortion forever .
But when they use the law to enforce their moral worldview they need to recognize that they can't have it both ways .
If fetuses are human and have the same rights as the women in whom they live , then a woman who has an abortion must logically be subject to the full force of the law .
It would be a premeditated act of murder no different than if she hired a hit man to kill her five year old .
The law will eventually be able to make no logical distinction .
Is everybody ready for that ?
Update :
Along these lines , Tim Russert 's questioning of Jim DeMint before the 04
election is a classic in evasion .
Unlike O'Steen , DeMint would n't even commit to prosecuting the doctor .
Of course there was a time when doctors were prosecuted , and i know one of
them .

Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox 360 games console got a big boost on Wednesday when Square Enix Co. Ltd. , the last major Japanese games developer not to have embraced the console , said it would release a title on the platform .
The game , called " Infinite Undiscovery , " was given a brief preview at a Tokyo news conference but few details of the role - playing game were announced .
Square Enix did n't share a release date .
" We are working to ramp up the action and create a dynamic , compelling next - generation RPG , " said Hajime Kojima , a producer from Square Enix .
The concept of the game is to play in a world that is constantly changing in real time .
Even when you pull up the menu screen the action wo n't stop on screen .
The debut of role - playing games like " Infinite Undiscovery " is key to Microsoft 's success in Japan .
Gamers here prefer RPG titles over the first - person shooter games that are popular in North America and Europe and the company 's original Xbox suffered in Japan because there was n't enough attractive software for local gamers .
" The genre will be RPG ( role playing game ) , the most popular in the Japan market , " said Takashi Sensui , general manager of the Home and Entertainment Division at Microsoft 's Japan unit , Microsoft Co. Ltd .
The support of a major publisher like Square Enix will likely help build buzz around the Xbox 360 in Japan .
The console has n't sold as well as the PlayStation 3 or the very successful Wii but has been doing much better in the marketplace than its predecessor , the original Xbox .
In the week from Aug. 27 to Sept. 2 sales of the console in Japan totalled 1,635 units , according to Media Create Co. Ltd .
That made it the number four console behind the Wii at 39,371 units , the PlayStation 3 at 18,068 units and the PlayStation 2 at 14,280 units .
Media Create receives actual sales data from around 3,000 stores across Japan and uses that to estimate nationwide sales .
Square Enix announced its support at an event where Microsoft also previewed upcoming games that will be on display at next week 's Tokyo Game Show .
Among the other games previewed was " Ninja Gaiden 2 , " a bloody role - playing game in which main - character Ryu Hayabusa slashes his way through a quest to save the human race .
The game , which will be published by Tecmo Ltd. , is a sequel to a title published for the Xbox and will be an exclusive title for the Xbox 360 .
" Our goal with Ninja Gaiden 2 is to create the world 's premier action game , " said Tomonobu Itagaki , leader of the Team Ninja studio that will produce the game .
He said there were between 10 and 20 features that developers wanted to put into the original Ninja Gaiden game but that never got in .
Now those features will be available on the new game .
Microsoft also gave " Lost Odyssey " a launch date .
The game , which had people at last year 's Tokyo Game Show waiting more than an hour to play a demo version , will be launched in Japan on Dec. 6 , in the rest of Asia in January 2008 and in North America and Europe in February 2008 .
The role - playing game is being published by Microsoft and will cost % 6,800 ( US$ 60 ) .
With currently available titles and new software combined there will be about 250 games available for the Xbox 360 by December , Microsoft said .
There was also some new hardware for the Xbox 360 .
The chatpad is a small keyboard that plugs into the controller and allows users to chat with others on Live Messenger through the console .
Microsoft also announced new controllers in pink and light blue .
The Tokyo Game Show begins on Thursday Sept. 20 and runs until Sept. 23 .
While most commentary on the new CNN presidential poll focuses on Mike Huckabee ’s poor showing against the major Democratic candidates , the Opinionator is struck by the good news the figures hold for two candidates who ’ve been on the outside looking in of late :
On the Democratic side , Edwards performs best against each of the leading Republicans .
In addition to beating Huckabee by 25 percent and McCain by 8 percent , the North Carolina Democrat beats Romney by 22 percentage points ( 59 percent to 37 percent ) and Giuliani by 9 percentage points ( 53 percent to 44 percent ) …
The poll also shows that Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona would do best against leading Democrats .
He beats Clinton by 2 percentage points ( 50 percent to 48 percent ) , ties Obama ( 48 percent to 48 percent ) and loses to Edwards by a smaller margin ( 8 points ) than the other Republican candidates do .
In addition to Huckabee , Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney lose to all three top Democrats in the survey .
Ross Douthat at the Atlantic has a good theory for Edwards ’s strong showing .
First of all , most voters ’ image of Edwards was formed in the ’ 04 race , when he ran as a more centrist candidate than he ’s become this time around ; thus despite having move steadily leftward over the last three years , he ’s still perceived as the least liberal of the Democratic front - runners by the general public .
…
Second , he ’s a Southern white male , and even if the percentage of swing voters who would rule out voting for a woman or a black man is relatively small ( and it might be large - ish ) , his race and sex alone would still presumably give him a slight boost .
Third , he ’s received considerably less press attention than Hillary and Obama over the last six months , and in a year when a generic Democrat would presumably trounce a generic Republican , he ’s presumably still a more “ generic ” figure than either of his better - publicized opponents , and thus a better vessel for undecided voters to pour their anti-GOP animus into .
Remember , perceived “ electability ” was what propelled John Kerry to victory in Iowa four years ago –­ the question for the Edwards campaign is whether the end result in ’04 soured early primary voters on the efficacy of that quality .
A Cambridge University academic has shattered conspiracy theories surrounding the September 11 terrorist attacks that took place in New York six years ago today with a new mathematical analysis of the collapse of the World Trade Centre .
Keith Seffen , a senior lecturer in Cambridge 's engineering department , used established engineering models to demonstrate that once the collapse of the twin towers began it was destined to be rapid and total .
While the causes that initiated the collapse of the towers are now well understood , engineers continue to speculate about the speed and totality with which the buildings were demolished during the fateful attacks .
Conspiracy theorists claim US government involvement in the catastrophic events that followed two planes being flown into the buildings .
They suggest " controlled demolition " was the reason behind the speed , uniformity and similarity between the collapse of both towers .
But according to Dr Seffen 's analysis of engineering principles , the way the towers collapsed was " quite ordinary and natural " .
" The World Trade Centre towers were designed to absorb an aircraft impact but an accidental one with much less fuel and speed , " he said .
" It is widely acknowledged that the impacts on September 11th were extraordinary , which led to consequences well in excess of the design capacity for the buildings .
The original design of both towers must be praised for standing as long as they did , saving more lives than might have been expected . "
Dr Seffen 's research showed many studies focused on the phase just before collapse begins .
" They rightly show that the combination of fire and impact damage severely impaired those parts of the building close to where the aircraft hit to hold the weight of the building above .
The top parts were bound to fall down but it was not clear why the undamaged building should have offered little resistance to these falling parts , " he said .
His new analysis , which will be published in the American Society of Civil Engineers ' Journal of Engineering Mechanics , calculates the average strength of a given storey of the building away from the impact area as it was being squashed flat .
This allowed him to define the " residual capacity " of the building , which he then used to develop a dynamic model of the collapse sequence , simulating the successive squashing of individual storeys based on the residual capacity already identified .
From this , Dr Seffen predicted that the residual capacity of both buildings was limited and once collapse had started it would take only 10 seconds for the building to go down .
This shows that the speed of the collapse as actually occurred was consistent with a " pancaking " effect caused by the dual impacts of the planes .
As such , the mechanics of this pancaking process were exactly the same as a controlled demolition , but starting from the top and moving downwards , he said .

The outfit is recognised globally
He 's got his own style and he sticks to it .
Father Christmas is the universally recognised symbol of the festive season in his traditional robes .
But the red suit and hat with the white fur trim have given rise to the belief among some that Santa 's togs were dreamed up by canny ad men who recast him in the soft drink maker 's corporate colours .
But while there 's some truth in the suggestion - Coke ran a campaign for 30 years featuring a jolly fat Santa - his colour scheme owes more to ecclesiastical vestments than a brainstorm on Madison Avenue .
The colours are widely thought to derive from the original Saint Nicholas , who was the Bishop of Myra in the 4th Century .
Red and white were the hues of traditional bishop robes , although some historians argue that he originally dressed in different colours .
THE ANSWER No. Santa 's outfit is believed to have been inspired by the Bishop of Myra in the 4th Century ... long before the soft drinks market realised its potential
He was famous for his kindness to children and generosity to the poor .
After he died the legend of Saint Nicholas grew and he is still remembered in some countries on 6 December .
" To this very day St Nicholas arrives in Holland each November , dressed in a bishop 's vestments , " says a spokesman for the St Nicholas Society .
" He rides through the streets to the enjoyment of thousands of onlookers , to begin his investigation into the behaviour of the children . "
In medieval England and for centuries afterwards , the figure of Father Christmas represented the spirit of benevolence and good cheer .
In the 19th Century Dutch emigrants took their story of a legendary gift - bringer called Sinterklaas to America , where he eventually became known as Santa Claus .
' Evolutionary creation '
But while the names and legends may differ , there was little variation in the red and white outfits worn .
However , over time the bishop cloak and mitre were replaced by the fur - trimmed suit .
There are records of Santa wearing various coloured costumes , but red was by far the most popular and became known as the quintessential Father Christmas outfit .
" Father Christmas is an evolutionary creation , influenced by folklore , legend and religion , " says Tom Glamon , whose research into Santa will win him the envy of children the world over .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
" He did n't spring to life at a certain time , fully formed and wearing a red and white suit .
It was n't really until the late 19th Century that the image now recognised across the world became set . "
In recent history the red and white suit has been fixed and standardised by certain publishing events and advertising campaigns .
Between 1863 and 1886 , Harper 's Weekly magazine ran a series of engravings by Thomas Nast .
He developed an image of Santa very close to the modern - day one .
From these engravings the concept of Santa 's workshop and the idea of writing letters to him also developed .
Coca - Cola 's involvement kicks in in the early 1930s when Swedish artist Haddon Sundblom started drawing ads for Coke featuring a fat Santa in a red coat trimmed with fur and secured with a large belt .
His drawings were used in the company 's festive advertisements for the next 30 years , well and truly cementing the image .
Of course , one sure fire way of putting the Coca - Cola story to rest would be to ask the man himself .
Unfortunately , this time of year finds him so busy he has been unable to return our calls .

At the Napoleon ’s Egypt blog : French complaints at loneliness and setbacks in Egypt .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China turned down a request for another U.S. Navy ship to visit Hong Kong amid a spat over a long - planned docking of the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier , the Pentagon said on Friday .
Washington has complained that China , at the last minute , blocked a visit by the Kitty Hawk and accompanying ships for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday last week .
Family and friends of crew members had flown in to meet their loved ones .
The United States has also complained China refused to let two minesweepers shelter from a storm in Hong Kong last week .
On November 22 , China made a late reversal of its decision to bar the Kitty Hawk but by then the ship was steaming away from Hong Kong and could not return , U.S. officials have said .
But when China told the United States it was reversing course , it also rejected a request for the USS Reuben James , a frigate with about 200 crew , to visit Hong Kong over the New Year holiday , a Pentagon spokesman said .
Also on November 22 , China told the United States it would not allow the next planned quarterly flight into Hong Kong by a C - 17 aircraft to support the U.S. consulate there , said the spokesman , Marine Corps Maj .
Stewart Upton .
China ’s actions have prompted speculation it wanted to show irritation over U.S. plans to help Taiwan upgrade its missile system and a meeting between President George W. Bush and exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama .
Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province and the Dalai Lama as a separatist trying to win independence for Tibet , which Chinese troops invaded in 1950 .
Having protested earlier in the week about the treatment of the Kitty Hawk and the minesweepers , the Bush administration made clear it now wanted to draw a line under the incidents .
“ This relationship is growing and maturing and this is something that two nations should be able to work through , and I do n’t think escalating it every day is necessary , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
“ This incident has not prevented us from being able to work with the Chinese . ”
The rejections mark the first time China has turned down a port visit by a U.S. Navy ship since 2004 , a U.S. defense official said .
The request for the Reuben James was made in October .
Some 50 U.S.
Navy ships visit Hong Kong every year , the official said , about the same amount as before Britain returned the territory to Chinese rule in 1997 .
The Kitty Hawk was accompanied by five vessels at the time of its planned visit to Hong Kong , the official said .
Officials had previously said it had eight accompanying ships .
( CNN ) -- Saudi King Abdullah has pardoned a rape victim who had been sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison in a case that sparked international attention , a Saudi newspaper has reported .
The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia 's strict Islamic law .
Al - Jazirah newspaper quoted a Saudi Justice Ministry official saying King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Hajj , the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca , begins in Saudi Arabia .
The victim 's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon , but considers it to be legitimate since it was announced in an official Saudi newspaper .
He thanked King Abdullah for the pardon , saying : " This fatherly care and noble gesture will help ( in ) lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring . "
" This is not something new because we know that the King was always generous in dealing with his people and the entire world , " the husband said .
" This week , we have two holidays to celebrate ; the Eid and this great news of the pardon . "
Saudi sources told CNN that the king 's pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid al - Adha festival that follows , which is normally when the Saudi monarch issues amnesty for prisoners .
Watch how Arab media is reporting the story . »
Saudi Arabia 's Justice Minister Abdullah Bin Mohammad al - Sheikh told al - Jazirah newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Saudi people , and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system .
The White House welcomed King Abdullah 's decision , but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that " this is obviously a matter for the Saudi Arabians and King Abdullah . "
A Saudi court ruled the 19 - year - old had an " illegitimate relationship " with a man who was not her husband , and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a " compromising situation , her clothes on the ground . "
The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married .
The case has drawn international attention , provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under strict Islamic law in Saudi Arabia .
The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman 's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March .

Romney ’s MLK trump card starts to look shaky
On Meet the Press over the weekend , Tim Russert pressed Mitt Romney on his church ’s history of racism .
As the host noted , the LDS Church did n’t allow black people to participate fully in church services until 1978 .
“ You were 31 years old , and your church was excluding blacks from full participation , ” Russert said .
“ Did n’t you think , ‘ What am I doing part of an organization that is viewed by many as a racist organization ? ' ”
Romney had heard this many times before , and immediately drew a distinction between his church ’s history and his family ’s history .
“ My dad marched with Martin Luther King , ” Romney said .
As the former governor sees it , his parent ’s work helps reflect his “ fundamental core beliefs . ”
He ’s done this quite a bit .
In his very high - profile speech on religion in America two weeks ago , Romney described “ American values , ” and bragged , “ I saw my father march with Martin Luther King . ”
But whether this actually occurred is now open to some question .
The Boston Phoenix looked into Romney ’s claim and “ can find no evidence that the senior Romney actually marched with King , nor anything in the public record suggesting that he ever claimed to do so . ”
Indeed , Mitt Romney never even claimed that his father marched with MLK until after his father passed away — “ not even when defending accusations of the Mormon church ’s discriminatory past during his 1994 Senate campaign . ” ( via Mr. Furious )
Asked about the specifics of George Romney ’s march with MLK , Mitt Romney ’s campaign told the Phoenix that it took place in Grosse Pointe , Michigan .
That jibes with the description proffered by David S. Broder in a Washington Post column written days after Mitt ’s College Station speech .
Broder , in that column , references a 1967 book he co-authored on the Republican Party , which included a chapter on George Romney .
It includes a one - line statement that the senior Romney “ has marched with Martin Luther King through the exclusive Grosse Pointe suburb of Detroit . ”
But that account is incorrect .
King never marched in Grosse Pointe , according to the Grosse Pointe Historical Society , and had not appeared in the town at all at the time the Broder book was published . [… ]
In fact , King ’s only appearance in Grosse Pointe , according to Berschback , took place after Broder ’s book was published .
That was for a March 14 speech he delivered at Grosse Pointe High School , just three weeks before King was assassinated .
But there was no march , and George Romney was not there .
Uh oh .
This 1968 Grosse Pointe appearance is the one that Romney spokesperson Eric Fehrnstrom initially insisted , in email exchanges with the Phoenix , was the event in question .
Fehrnstrom cited the Broder column and “ the Romney family recollection . ”
Of the many contemporaneous and historical records of the Grosse Pointe speech , none make any mention of George Romney ’s attendance .
It is unlikely , if not implausible , that his presence would have gone unnoticed : not only was he governor of the state , he had just , weeks before , dropped out of the race for President .
And , Mitt Romney would not have known about the event , let alone had a chance to “ see ” it .
He was at that time in the middle of his two - year mission for the Mormon church in Le Havre , France .
By his own description and others ’ , he was cut off from virtually all contact with his family ; and at the time , King ’s Grosse Pointe appearance was no more than local news .
The original mention , in Broder ’s 1967 book , of a Romney - King Grosse Pointe march might have resulted from an accidental conflation of several different events .
This revelation , if accurate , is likely to be a very unhelpful embarrassment to Romney , following similar flaps this week over Romney attending a Planned Parenthood fundraiser ( which contradicts some of his previous comments about his family ’s PP contributions ) and an NRA endorsement he cited that did n’t actually happen .
Stay tuned .
Update : I have a follow - up post , including the Romney campaign ’s response , here .
The gunman used a balcony to aim at victims , reports say
Eyewitness account
Robert Hawkins , 19 , from Bellevue , Nebraska , opened fire at the Westroads Mall in Omaha on Wednesday .
A woman who took him in after he left home said he left a note saying he was sorry for everything and did not want to be a burden to anybody .
Police say he probably fired more than 30 rounds from an SKS assault rifle .
Among the victims , six were employees of the Von Maur department store and two were customers , the head of Omaha police , Thomas Warren , said .
He said the gunman appeared to shoot at random and the incident was over before policemen , alerted by a 911 emergency call , could intervene .
Police have confirmed the existence of the suicide note , but not its contents .
Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman ordered flags throughout the state flown at half - mast with immediate effect .
Hawkins struck as the centre was crowded with Christmas shoppers , and witnesses spoke of people screaming and scrambling to find safe shelter .
In a statement , President George W Bush - who had visited Omaha earlier in the day - said he was " deeply saddened " by the shootings .

Witnesses said the gunman fired down on shoppers from a balcony on the third floor of the Von Maur store .

" A lady that I work with on the same floor , she happened to walk over to the [ central atrium ] and she was standing there and a gentleman walked up , and the shooter reached over the top on the third floor and shot the guy in the head . "
Witnesses spoke of trying to hide as they waited for police
In an e-mail to the BBC , one Omaha resident , called Julie , said that she had been in a restaurant next door to Von Maur department store when the shooting began .
" Someone came in to the restaurant and advised that someone was shooting in the mall and to get out .
Everyone started to run out of the small doors in Panera [ the restaurant ] , so we were able to get out very quickly .
" I heard screaming and loud shots being fired somewhere close by .
I got out of the mall before the local police department arrived . "
' Lost puppy '
Hawkins is said to have suffered from depression in the past , and recently lost his job at McDonald 's and broke up with his girlfriend .
US MASS SHOOTINGS IN 2007 Oct : Asa H Coon , 14 , shoots four people , injuring them , at his school in Cleveland , Ohio , before killing himself .
April : Cho Seung - hui , 23 , shoots 32 people dead on campus of Virginia Tech university , Virginia , then kills himself .
Feb : Sulejman Talovic , 18 , shoots dead five people and injures four at a mall in Salt Lake City , Utah , before being killed by police .
He was living with a friend 's family in Bellevue , an Omaha suburb .
His friend 's mother , Debora Maruca Kovac , told the Associated Press news agency that when he first came to live with them , " he was introverted , a troubled young man who was like a lost pound puppy that nobody wanted " .
She said he phoned her about 1300 on Wednesday , telling her that he had left a note for her in his bedroom .
She tried to get him to explain .
" He said , ' It 's too late ' , " and then hung up , she told CNN .
In the note , she said , Hawkins had written that " he was sorry for everything , that he did n't want to be a burden to anybody , he loved his family , he loved all of his friends " .
The note went on to say he wanted to be famous , she said .
The incident is the latest in a series of mass shootings in the US , which have reignited the debate in the US about gun ownership .
The Supreme Court will consider Americans ' right to bear arms early next year for the first time in nearly 70 years .

This A woman who says she was sexually assaulted by a U.S. State Department employee while working for Halliburton in Iraq has come forward to tell her story in public for the first time .
In the video below , ABC's Brian Ross talks with Jamie Leigh Jones , who accepted an offer to work in Iraq for Halliburton subsidiary KBR in 2005 .
Less than a week after arriving in Iraq , Baker alleges she was served what she believes was a drug - laced drink by a group of KBR men , blacking out and later waking up naked , bruised and bleeding .
An examination by an Army doctor confirmed her fears that she had been gang - raped .
After reporting the assault , Jones was stung by the indifference from KBR 's corporate office .
" It 's been two years , " says Jones , who believes there has been a cover - up of her case .
" I 've been waiting for justice for two years . "
Another woman who went to work for KBR in Iraq , Tracy Barker , alleges that a U.S. State Department official there attempted to rape her .
The official later stated to investigators that he had " gone too far , " but his case was declined for prosecution by the Justice Department .
" I 'm an American citizen being assaulted by a State Department employee , " charges Barker , " and nobody cares . "

Three recipients of controversial 11th - hour pardons issued by former President Bill Clinton in January 2001 have donated thousands of dollars to the presidential campaign of his wife , Democratic front - runner Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , according to campaign finance records examined by ABC News , in what some good government groups said created an appearance of impropriety .
" It 's not illegal , " Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , told ABC News .
" But , of course , it 's inappropriate and she should return the money .
It does raise the appearance that this is payback .
" One can only hope that she was n't yet aware of who made the donations , " said Sloan .
" We have raised over $ 65 million from over 200,000 people , " said Clinton campaign manager Howard Wolfson , adding sarcastically , " I appreciate your bringing the instance of this $ 5,300 and these three people to our attention . "
Pardonees Donate to Clinton
One of the pardonees who has become a donor to Sen.
Clinton is David Herdlinger , a former prosecutor in Springdale , Ark. , who , according to press accounts at the time of his pardon pleaded guilty in 1986 to mail fraud after taking bribes to reduce or drop charges against defendants charged with drunken driving offenses .
Now a life and business coach in Georgia , Herdlinger was pardoned by President Clinton in January 2001 ; he donated $ 1,000 to Sen.
Clinton 's presidential campaign in August .
Insurance agent Alfredo Regalado , who gave Hillary Clinton $ 2,000 , was pardoned by her husband for failing to " report the transportation of currency in excess of $ 10,000 into the United States , " according to the Department of Justice .
Allegedly Mishandled Government Secrets
John Deutch is a different case , having served as President Clinton 's CIA director .
Pardoned by President Clinton for charges he had mishandled government secrets -- but before the Department of Justice could file the proper paperwork against him -- Deutch , now a professor at MIT , gave Sen .
Clinton the maximum allowable donation , $ 2,300 .
Neither Herdlinger nor Regalado nor Deutch could be reached for comment .
" This is another argument for restoring the presidential public financing system , " said Common Cause 's Mary Boyle .
" Is there an appearance here that this is kind of a payback for the pardons ?
I 'm sure it could look that way for some people .
But they 're exercising their free and perfectly legal right to give a campaign contribution . "
Controversial Pardons
The 177 pardons and commutations President Clinton issued in the closing hours of his presidency in January 2001 ignited a firestorm of controversy , most especially the one issued for financier Marc Rich , considered the biggest tax cheat in history , whom Rudy Giuliani had successfully indicted as a U.S. attorney .
But other controversies more closely involved Hillary Clinton .
In August 2000 , during her first Senate run , Clinton met with the Hasidic community in New Square , where many members were working to obtain clemency for four members of their community who had been convicted of stealing tens of millions of dollars from the state and federal government .
The town overwhelmingly voted for Clinton , and in January 2001 , the four men were granted clemency .
Hillary Clinton had met with members of the community in August 2000 , but said the issue did not come up .
The subject of clemency was raised in a December 2000 meeting between President Clinton and Sen.- elect Clinton , and leaders of the village , but the outgoing - first lady said at the time she had no opinion .
In June 2002 , then - U.S. attorney James Comey closed an investigation into the matter with no action against anyone .
Clinton 's Brothers Paid
Hillary Clinton 's brother Hugh Rodham , was paid approximately $ 200,000 from Almon Glenn Braswell , whom President Clinton pardoned for mail fraud and perjury , as was Carlos Vignali , whose sentence for cocaine trafficking was commuted .
News of his involvement in the pardon controversy prompted an outrage in Washington , D.C .
" I knew nothing about my brother 's involvement in these pardons , " Sen .
Clinton said at the time .
" I knew nothing about his taking money for his involvement . "
The Clintons asked Hugh Rodham to return the cash , which he did .
Hillary Clinton 's brother Tony Rodham was paid $ 244,769 over 2 ½ years by a carnival company , United Shows of America , owned by Edgar and Vonna Jo Gregory .
The Gregorys had been convicted of bank fraud and were seeking pardons .
Tony Rodham has said he mentioned their pardon application to his brother - in - law , who ultimately granted the Gregorys a pardon .
But Rodham said he was not paid for anything having to do with the pardon .
The estate of the Gregorys sued Tony Rodham this year , saying $ 107,000 if the money he received was a loan .
Rodham and the estate settled the case in September .

Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer — except , of course , for the pigs and the dogs .
~ George Orwell , Animal Farm
The beginning of political wisdom is the realization that despite everything you ’ve always been taught , the government is not really on your side ; indeed , it is out to get you .
Sometimes government functionaries and their private - sector supporters want simply to bully you , to dictate what you must do and what you must not do , regardless of whether anybody benefits from your compliance with these senseless , malicious directives .
The drug laws are the best current example , among many others , of the government as bully .
Our rulers presently enforce a host of laws that combine the worst aspects of puritanical priggishness and the invasive , pseudo - scientific , therapeutic state .
They tolerate our pursuit of happiness only so long as we pursue it exclusively in officially approved ways : gin , yes ; weed , no .
Notwithstanding the great delight that our rulers take in tormenting us with their absurdly inconsistent nanny - state commands , they generally have bigger fish to fry .
Above all , the government and its special - interest backers want to take our money .
If these people ran a store , they might aptly call it Robberies R Us .
Their credo is simple and brazen : “ you have money , and we want it . ”
Unlike the sincere street criminal , however , the robber in official guise rarely puts his proposition to you in the blunt form of “ your money or your life , ” however much he intends to relate to you on precisely such terms .
( If you doubt my characterization of these intentions , test what happens if you steadfastly resist at every step as the brigands escalate their threats : first ordering you to pay , then billing you for unpaid balances plus penalties and interest , sending you a summons , and ultimately beating you into submission or killing you for resisting arrest .
Your sustained , open resistance always ends in the state ’s use of violence against you , in either your forcible imprisonment or your removal from the land of the living , after which your memory will be defamed by your designation as a criminal — governments never settle for mere brutality , but always supplement it with unabashed presumptuousness . )
When I say “ rarely , ” I do not mean that the authorities never carry out their plunder blatantly .
Throughout the land , for example , criminal courts , acting as de facto muggers , strip people of great sums of money in the aggregate by fining them for conduct that ought never to have been criminalized in the first place — drug - law violations , prostitution , gambling , antitrust - law violations , traffic infractions , reporting violations , doing business without a license , and innumerable other victimless “ crimes . ”
The predatory judges and their police henchmen care no more about justice than I care to live on a diet of pig pancreas and boiled dandelions .
They are simply taking people ’s money because it ’s there to be taken with minimal effort .
In this manifestation , government amounts to a gigantic speed trap .
The more common way for government officials to rob you , however , involves their seizure of so - called taxes , which take countless forms , all of which are purported to be collected in order to finance — mirabile dictu — benefits for you .
Such a deal !
You ’d have to be a real ingrate to complain about the government ’s snatching your money for the express purpose of making your world a better place .
Sometimes the “ political exchange ” into which you are hauled kicking and screaming rests on such a ludicrous foundation , however , that honesty compels us to classify it , too , as a mugging .
I have in mind such compassionately conservative policies as stripping taxpayers of hundreds of billions of dollars and handing the money over , for the most part , to rich people engaged in large - scale agribusiness and , sometimes , to landowners who do n’t even bother to represent themselves as farmers .
The apologies that the agribusiness whores in Congress make for this daylight robbery are so patently stupid and immoral that the whole shameless affair resembles nothing so much as the schoolyard bully ’s grabbing the little kids ’ lunch money and then taunting them aggressively , “ If you do n’t like it , why do n’t you do something about it ? ”
Every five years , when the farm - subsidy law expires and a new one is enacted , a few members of Congress pose as reformers of this piracy , but truly serious reforms never occur , and even the minor ones that come along from time to time prove unavailing , as the farm - booty interests invariably suck up “ emergency relief ” payments from the public treasury later on to make up for any shortfalls from the main subsidy programs .
Government sneak thieves , in contrast , fear that they may occupy more vulnerable positions than the agribusiness gang and similarly impudent special - interest groups cum legislators , so they dare not taunt the little kids so flagrantly .
Instead , they specialize in legislative riders , budgetary add - ons and earmarks , logrolling , omnibus “ Christmas tree ” bills , and other gimmicks designed to conceal the size , the beneficiaries , and sometimes even the existence of their theft .
At the end of the day , the taxpayers find there ’s nothing left in the till , but they have little or no idea where all of their money went .
Finding out by reading an appropriations act is next to impossible , inasmuch as these statutes are almost incomprehensible to everyone but the legislative insiders and their staff members who devise them and write them down in a combination of Greek , Latin , and Sanskrit .
For example , for many years , a single congressman from northeastern Pennsylvania — first Dan Flood and then Joe McDade — substantially enriched the anthracite coal interests of that region by inserting a brief , one - paragraph limitation rider in the annual appropriations act for the Department of Defense .
The upshot of this obscure provision was that Pennsylvania anthracite was transported to Germany to provide heating fuel for U.S. military bases that could have been heated more cheaply by using local resources .
This coals - to - Newcastle shenanigan was a classic sneak - thief gambit , a thing of legislative beauty , but every year ’s budget contains thousands of schemes that operate with similar effect , if not in an equally audacious manner .
Unlike the government sneak thieves , the government con men openly advertise — indeed , expect to receive great credit for — certain uses of the taxpayers ’ money that are represented as bringing great benefits to the general public or a substantial segment of it .
Surely the best example of the con man ’s art is so - called national defense , a bottomless pit into which the government now dumps , in various forms ( many of them not officially classified as “ defense ” ) , approximately a trillion dollars of the taxpayers ’ money each year .
The government stoutly maintains , of course , that all ordinary Americans are constantly in grave danger of attack by foreigners — nowadays , by Islamic terrorists , in particular — and that these voracious wolves can be kept from the door only by the maintenance and active deployment of large armed forces equipped with ultra-sophisticated ( and correspondingly expensive ) equipment and stationed at bases in more than a hundred countries and on ships at sea around the globe .
Without dismissing the alleged dangers entirely , a sensible person quickly appreciates that the threat is slight — just do the math , using reasonable probability coefficients — whereas the cost of ( purportedly ) dealing with it is colossal .
In short , as General Smedley Butler informed us more than seventy years ago , the modern military establishment , along with most of its blessed wars , is for the most part nothing but a racket .
Worse , because of the way it engages and co-opts powerful elements of the private sector , it gives rise to a costly and dangerous form of military - economic fascism .
Lately , the classic military - industrial - congressional complex has been supplemented by an even more menacing ( to our liberties ) security - industrial - congressional complex , whose aim is to enrich its participants by equipping the government for more effectively spying on us and invading our privacy in ways great and small .
Worst of all , despite everything that is claimed for the military ’s protective powers , its operation and deployment overseas leave us ordinary Americans facing greater , not lesser , risk than we would otherwise face , because of the many enemies it cultivates who would have left us alone , if the U.S. military had only left them alone .
( Yes , Virginia , they are over here because we ’re over there . )
The president routinely declares that the hugely increased expenditures and overseas deployments for military purposes since 2001 have reduced the threat of terrorism , but , in fact , terrorist incidents and deaths have increased , not decreased .
Although privileged elements of the political class gain from militarism and neo- imperialist wars , the rest of us invariably lose economic well - being , real security , and all too often life itself .
In 2004 , people who said that security against terrorism was their top concern voted disproportionately , by an almost 7 - to - 1 margin , for George W. Bush .
They had been conned .
Although the mugger , the sneak thief , and the con man are not the only types of government operatives , they make up a large proportion of the leading figures in government today .
The lower ranks , especially in the various police agencies , have a disproportionate share of the bullies .
No attempt to understand government can succeed without a clear understanding of these ideal types and each one ’s characteristic modus operandi .
With this understanding firmly in mind , you will remain permanently immune to the infectious swindle , “ I ’m from the government , and I ’m here to help . ”
The truth , of course , is the exact opposite : I say again , the government — this vile assemblage of bullies , muggers , sneak thieves , and con men — is not really on your side ; indeed , it is out to get you .

Sam Lutfi is Out , Spears Parents Calling Medical Shots
was reportedly not playing nice withparents , and TMZ is reporting that following Brit 's January 3 , 2008 hospitalization , she had her lawyer draft a document giving Lutfi control of medical decisions .
He stepped in early this morning and things got ugly before doctor 's opted to work with Brit 's parents rather than Lutfi .
He reportedly left the UCLA facility at 4:00 a .m. - and he was n't pleased to be odd man out .
According to reports , Britney is currently being held for 72 hours .
If she refuses medication , doctor 's can extend that commitment period to 14 days , and forcibly administer medications .
Tension at UCLA Medical Center was reportedly heated between Spears parents and Lutfi on what course of treatment was best for the troubled celebrity .
Brit 's parents , after consulting an attorney , have apparently gained back control and doctor 's are working with the parents in treating their daughter .
Jamie and Sam apparently got into a shoving contest early this morning before Brit 's pal headed for the hills .
Sad commentary that even with Britney finally in a medical facility , those who are supposed to love her most can't seem to get on the same page regarding her medical care .
Is it any wonder this poor woman has deteriorated so badly ?
Photos from early this morning show Lynne Spears in the same car with Adnan Ghalib and another showing them walking into the hospital together .
It appears that Lynne has joined alliances with Britney 's boyfriend , and sees Sam Lutfi as a threat to her daughter .
Global warming is threatening the survival of four penguin species in the Antarctic , conservationists warned today .
A new report from WWF , published at the UN conference on climate change in Bali , has found that global warming is occurring five times faster in the Antarctic peninsula than the rest of the world , and threatening the survival of the emperor , gentoo , chinstrap and Adélie penguins that breed on the continent .
Melting sea ice is destroying precious nesting grounds where the penguins raise their young , while over - fishing is making food increasingly scarce according to the report , Antarctic Penguins and Climate Change .
" As the ice melts , these icons of the Antarctic will have to face an extremely tough battle to survive , " said Emily Lewis - Brown , marine and climate change officer at WWF - UK .
" One of the coldest environments in the world is actually seeing some of the fastest rates of global warming , and unless action is taken to reduce global CO2 emissions , the future of many Antarctic species looks bleak . "
The Antarctic peninsula is warming five times faster that the average rate of global warming and the waters of Southern Ocean have become warmer as far down as 3,000 m , the report found .
Sea ice is now covering 40 % less area that it did 26 years ago off the west Antarctic peninsula .
This decrease has led to reduced numbers of krill , the main source of food for chinstrap penguins .
Some colonies of chinstraps have seen reductions in numbers of up to two - thirds because less food has made it more difficult for youngsters to survive , the report said .
The gentoo penguin has also seen numbers shrinking because it is increasingly dependent on the krill as its usual food sources have been depleted by overfishing , the report said .
And on the north - western coast of the Antarctic peninsula , populations of Adélie penguins have dropped by 65 % in 25 years .
The report said the penguins had been suffering from scarcer food supplies and encroachment by gentoo and chinstrap penguins which were taking advantage of higher temperatures where warming has been most dramatic .
Scientists are concerned for the Adélie , which lives on sea ice but needs the ice - free land to breed , where they line their nests with pebbles that they often steal from their neighbours .
The emperor penguin , the largest in the world , has seen some of its colonies halved in the past century as warmer temperatures and stronger winds force them to rear their young on increasingly thin ice , the report said .
The WWF said that in recent years sea ice had broken off early and many eggs and chicks had been blown away when they were too young to survive on their own .
The environmental charity warned that the emperor penguin was the most vulnerable of the Antarctic bird and mammal species in the face of climate change , as it needs stable , land - locked sea ice on which to breed because it is too clumsy to climb over icy coastal slopes .
The WWF is calling for the Bali summit to agree a process which will lead to comprehensive and fair emissions reductions after phase one of the Kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
Lewis - Brown added : " The UN climate change summit underway in Bali must agree a process now which results in comprehensive , ambitious , and fair global emission reduction targets beyond the current phase of Kyoto which ends in 2012 .
It 's vital that governments agree upon a clear , shared vision to keep global warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels . "
When an 8 - month - old boy swallowed a tablet of the club drug ecstasy , he developed seizures , an abnormally rapid heartbeat , and a high fever .
His mother brought him to University Children 's Hospital in Cologne , Germany .
She was not on drugs , and knew what had happened .
After checking his vital signs , the medical staff injected a small amount of diazepam ( Valium ) into the infant ’s rectum .
Within five minutes , the seizures had stopped .
Pediatricians then inserted a catheter into the boy ’s penis and used it to collect urine for a rapid drug test kit .
The boy was positive for ecstasy , amphetamine , and methamphetamine .
The doctors cooled the infant down , gave him fluids intravenously , and waited for the drugs to filter out of his body .
Six hours later , the child ’s body temperature and heartbeat had returned to normal .
During the following day , the physicians collected samples of the infant ’s blood serum for chemical analysis .
Those tests revealed that his body had destroyed half of the drug in six hours – far faster than an adult could do it .
In their correspondence to the European Journal of Pediatrics , Frank Eifinger , Bernhard Roth , Lars Kröner , and Markus A. Rothschild said that these events are rare , but when they happen it is essential to administer tranquilizers immediately .
The sedative medications ward off convulsions and brain damage .
Toward the end of their report , which became available online at the end of September , the doctors said that they do not know why children can survive doses of ecstasy that would be fatal for adults .
A table in the document described nine other infants that had ingested the club drug .
All of them survived .

He 's obviously an extremely talented writer and editor , and I guess some naked partisanship on the right is necessary to balance out Krugman .
But ideologically , having both David Brooks and Bill Kristol as the sole representatives of the right - of - center is to focus on a very small neocon niche in a conservative world that is currently exploding with intellectual diversity and new currents of thought .
There are about five " national greatness " conservatives out there .
Four of them now have columns in the WaPo or NYT : Kristol , Brooks , Krauthammer and Gerson .
Thank God , I guess , for the blogosphere .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Plague , the disease that devastated medieval Europe , is re-emerging worldwide and poses a growing but overlooked threat , researchers warned on Tuesday .

While it has only killed some 100 to 200 people annually over the past 20 years , plague has appeared in new countries in recent decades and is now shifting into Africa , Michael Begon , an ecologist at the University of Liverpool and colleagues said .
A bacterium known as Yersinia pestis causes bubonic plague , known in medieval times as the Black Death when it was spread by infected fleas , and the more dangerous pneumonic plague , spread from one person to another through coughing or sneezing .
“ Although the number of human cases of plague is relatively low , it would be a mistake to overlook its threat to humanity , because of the disease ’s inherent communicability , rapid spread , rapid clinical course , and high mortality if left untreated , ” they wrote in the journal Public Library of Science journal PloS Medicine .
Rodents carry plague , which is virtually impossible to wipe out and moves through the animal world as a constant threat to humans , Begon said .
Both forms can kill within days if not treated with antibiotics .
“ You ca n’t realistically get rid of all the rodents in the world , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ Plague appears to be on the increase , and for the first time there have been major outbreaks in Africa . ”
Globally the World Health Organization reports about 1,000 to 3,000 plague cases each year , with most in the last five years occurring in Madagascar , Tanzania , Mozambique , Malawi , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The United States sees about 10 to 20 cases each year .
More worrying are outbreaks seem on the rise after years of relative inactivity in the 20th century , Begon said .
The most recent large pneumonic outbreak comprised hundreds of suspected cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2006 .
Bubonic plague , called the Black Death because of black bumps that sometimes develop on victims ’ bodies , causes severe vomiting and high fever .
Victims of pneumonic plague have similar symptoms but not the black bumps .
Begon and his colleagues called for more research into better ways to prevent plague from striking areas where people lack access to life - saving drugs and to defend against the disease if used as a weapon .
“ We should not overlook the fact that plague has been weaponized throughout history , from catapulting corpses over city walls , to dropping infected fleas from airplanes , to refined modern aerosol formulation , ” the researchers wrote .
( Reporting by Michael Kahn ; Editing by Maggie Fox and Ibon Villelabeitia )
A number of the best internet commentators are discussing today ’s news that a few of the leading Congressional Democrats may have been – probably were – briefed about the administration ’s plans to torture ( waterboard , and maybe more ) suspected terrorists being held in secret CIA facilities abroad .
There ’s confusion about the facts , with few of the people allegedly briefed confirming the story .
Notably , however , it appears that of those briefed , only Rep. Jane Harman objected .
( Note that we ’re still at an early spin stage here — more facts about who said what to whom are likely to come out . )
The emerging consensus in the blogosphere seems to be that even if they had the presence of mind to object , the Representatives and Senators who were briefed were in a bind : as members of the Intelligence Committees or the leadership , they signed various secrecy pledges which stopped them from going public .
To go public , it seems to be agreed , was to “ jeopardize their careers and risk jail ” as Kevin Drum put it ; even so , Matthew Yglesias suggests that this called for civil disobedience , and that the representatives should have dared the administration to arrest them .
All this misses a critical aspect of our constitutional structure .
Thanks to the Speech and Debate Clause there was a way for any Senator or Representative who wanted to blow the whistle to do so in a way that involved no risk of jail or fines – at worst they might have lost their security clearances ( and even there the law is a little murky ) .
Article I , section 6 of the Constitution reads as follows ,
The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services , to be ascertained by Law , and paid out of the Treasury of the United States .
They shall in all Cases , except Treason , Felony and Breach of the Peace , be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same ; and for any Speech or Debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other Place .
No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time ; and no Person holding any Office under the United States , shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office .
( emphasis added )
The Speech and Debate clause has been interpreted to extend beyond floor speeches , e.g. to committee statements , but it unquestionably applies to floor statements .
Thus , it would have been possible for Rep. Harman , or Senator Rockefeller , or the others allegedly briefed to go to the floor , either during the times when members may speak on topics of their choice , or under one of the extraordinary mechanism for privileged statements , and denounce the Bush administration ’s determinate to torture helpless captives in secret offshore detention facilities .
I ’m not saying this would be easy or politically painless .
The political risks are obvious – and recall the Congress was being briefed not all that long after 9/11 .
But even without the national security angle or the political frenzy angle , there were also counterveilling issues of fundamental personal ethics As Rep.
Harman noted ,
“ When you serve on intelligence committee you sign a second oath — one of secrecy , ” she said .
“ I was briefed , but the information was closely held to just the Gang of Four .
I was not free to disclose anything . ”
Serious people take oaths like this seriously and are right to do so ; but before they took that second oath , they took a first one upon taking office in which they promised to “ preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States . ”
To the extent that the second oath allows the executive to muzzle members of Congress , it is unconstitutional under any theory , including not only the Speech and Debate clause , but also the Incompatibility Clause ( which forbids members of congress from serving in the executive branch ; a converse conclusion is that this clause forbids the executive branch from turning members of Congress into subordinates ) .
Although apparently too easily forgotten , the Speech and Debate Clause is , as Justice Harlan said in United States v. Johnson , 383 U.S. 169 , 178 ( 1966 ) ,
the culmination of a long struggle for parliamentary supremacy .
Behind these simple phrases lies a history of conflict between the Commons and the Tudor and Stuart monarchs during which successive monarchs utilized the criminal and civil law to suppress and intimidate critical legislators .
Since the Glorious Revolution in Britain , and throughout United States history , the privilege has been recognized as an important protection of the independence and integrity of the legislature .
The Supreme Court has limited the reach of the Speech and Debate Clause in some relevant respects .
In Doe v. McMillan , 412 U.S. 306 ( 1973 ) , the Court distinguished statements on the floor ( or in committee ) – which are and remain completely privileged – and their republication elsewhere .
In that case a committee print of one of its reports , issued in a routine manner by the Public Printer , contained allegedly defamatory statements about private citizens .
They sued for an injunction to prevent further publication , dissemination , and distribution of the report until the objectionable material was deleted , and sought damages .
The Court held that the Members of Congress and their staffs could not be sued due to the Speech and Debate Clause , since their actions had all been part of the ordinary legislative process .
But the Court also held the Superintendent of Documents and the Public Printer could be sued because they had no broader immunity than Members of Congress would have and their actions in publically disseminating the report outside Congress were not legislative acts , unlike voting , speaking on the floor or in committee , which are protected .
More troubling for third parties , however , is Gravel v. United States , 408 U.S. 606 ( 1972 ) .
Senator Gravel read key parts of the Pentagon Papers at a committee hearing , and then placed the full text of the 47 volumes of it into the public record .
That act , the Supreme Court held , was privileged , an argument it called “ incontrovertible . ”
But the Court refused to assume that once the material was in the public record it automatically followed that arrangements to republish them were inevitably legal , nor did at accept that Senator Gravel ’s attempts to find a publisher ( or his aide ’s , which they took to be the same thing for these purposes ) , fell under the Speech and Debate Clause .
Combine this holding with the administration ’s more recent and aggressive re-interpretations of the Espionage Act , which seek to extend it to reach the conduct of parties not holding clearances who share information that they acquire from someone who has one , and you begin to wonder whether newspapers that republished the floor speech might not face some legal attacks from the Justice Department .
Although I personally think that the First Amendment must protect a newspaper that republishes a member of Congress ’s statements on the floor , it is clear that the current administration has taken positions that would allow it to argue the contrary ; more to the point , although I think the newspapers would win such a case , even the main Pentagon Papers case , much less the Gravel case noted above , do n’t conclusively foreclose the government from arguing the contrary .
The question of security clearances is the murkiest part of the story .
The Bush administration has consistently taken the extreme position that it never has any legal duty to tell Congress anything .
It claims the power to ignore subpoenas .
It says that the President is the only judge of what he has to do , and any attempt to compel him is unconstitutional .
As early as 2001 the administration unilaterally revoked the security clearances of 91 Senators , arguing as GW Bush put it “ it ’s not in the nation ’s interest ” that they have access to information they could leak .
I believe that Congress could Constitutionally legislate to preserve the security clearances of members who disclose classified information on the floor .
As far as I know ( please correct me if I ’m wrong ) , Congress has never passed such a rule , and in its absence , I think it is within the power of the executive to choose to deny clearances to whistle blowing members of Congress .
That is a forward - looking loss of privilege rather than a legal disability of the sort that the Speech and Debate Clause protects against .
But legally , that ’s it .
A member of Congress who learned of torture plans and chose to tell the nation about them would face no other legitimate legal risk ; ( there was , with the Gonzales gang , the not inconsiderable possibility of an improper prosecution , but many of the key events here were when Ashcroft was Attorney General ) .
It would have taken great courage , and carried political risk , but our Constitution does provide a channel by which members of Congress can stand up and call the executive to account on its plans to torture someone in a secret CIA prison .
At the end of the day it was that courage , not the legal avenue to expose wrongdoing , which was in too short supply in Congress .
( I ’ve written the above in something of a hurry and think of it as a very preliminary attempt to explain the role of the Speech and Debate clause .
I welcome correction and amplification from those who may know more than I ; I would be particularly grateful for any insights regarding the granting and withholding of security clearances for members of Congress , a subject I am sure I have much to learn about . )
Victoria Beckham 's New Tattoo ( Photos )
, not to be outdone by tattoo crazy husband , is sporting a new tattoo on her wrist .
The tattoo was obvious yesterday when the celebrity was on hand for the launch of her new DVB demin line at Saks in Boston .
Posh is no stranger to body art on herself or her spouse .
She sport a tattoo running down her neck and upper back , on her lower back and on each wrist .
One wrist has her husband 's initials in fancy cursive style .
The other wrist was a simple roman numeral design prior to the recent addition of another tattoo below it .
Even magnified , it is hard to make out the script .
David Beckham has one entire arm encased in ink and the other arm partially covered .
This power couple seem to be really getting into the art form .
Daily Mail has a number of photos showing the couple 's collection .
You know what I find funny ?
When rules of a website say one thing and the founder of the website goes against everything the Terms of Service stand for .
Kevin Rose , I ’m talking to you .
I left this alone ( save for a comment on a recent submission of yours ) because I thought you might learn .
However , it ’s sadly not the case and clearly your fan base is clouding your judgment .
Allow me to point out two infractions made , perhaps intentionally , on your part .
Infraction # 1 :
Digg ’s FAQ ( Submitting Section , Question # 3 ) says that duplicate submissions are bannable violations .
Here ’s the exact wording :
# Is it a duplicate story if I submit a similar story but from a different source ?
That is n’t for us to decide .
Sometimes there is a better story from another news outlet .
We let our users determine that aspect of duplicate submissions .
It is , however , a duplicate story if you submit the same story from the same source .
We strongly discourage the submission of duplicate stories as it only steals credit from the first submitter .
If we find abusive duplicate submission behavior from users , their accounts may be banned .
The emphasis is obviously mine .
I personally have been a victim of duplicate submissions ( from the same exact URL ) at least four times — and the bottom line to the end user is that it sucks .
However , if you ’re Kevin Rose , you ’re apparently above the rules .
For illustrative purposes , I ’m linking to the submissions and including screenshots in case Digg decides to censor remove the links .
Thirty - five days ago , on October 4th , Graham ( cosmikdebris ) , who clearly has an interest in stories about science , submitted a story about stopping atoms to Digg ( and no , he did not ask me to write this — I am composing this independently of him ) .
As the original submitter , Graham ’s Digg submission had a unique URL : http://digg.com/general_sciences/Stopping_Atoms.
Four days later , Kevin found a reprint of the same story in ScienceDaily .
He thought it was Diggbait , so he submitted it to Digg .
His URL is appended with a _2 , which indicates that it was a duplicate submission : http://digg.com/general_sciences/Stopping_Atoms_2
The ironic thing is that Digg has a somewhat decent duplicate detection system .
If you submit duplicate stories within minutes of each other , the dupe checker may not notify you that you ’ve submitted the work of somebody else .
However , if you submit the story a few hours later or a few days later , Digg ’s system always asks you if you ’re sure that you have n’t submitted a dupe .
It is only when you ’re positive that you have n’t duplicated the submission that you may then proceed .
Apparently , Kevin ignored that duplicate warning and submitted the same story with the same title and description anyway .
Here are the resulting screenshots ( which I took earlier — just in case ) .
The original , first :
And here ’s the duplicate submission .
The comments are classic ; click on the image for a full - sized version :
Obviously , it looks like Mr. Rose made an error of judgment here .
I suppose that ’s fine if it happens — and yes , we ’re humans , so I can see this occurring every so often .
That ’s why I ignored it for 35 days .
Today , however , the infraction got a little more out of hand .
It began with the banning of a friend of mine for a social experiment he performed on Digg .
I now present you with …
Infraction # 2 :
On October 31st , my friend Erik created a Facebook group for Digg fans which was inspired by the extremely popular ( 3241 Diggs as of this writing )
Digg story about how Stephen Colbert ’s Facebook group was the fastest growing ever .
In an attempt to surpass that record , Erik created a Facebook group about Digg solely as an experiment with no malicious intentions whatsoever .
He submitted the Facebook group ’s URL to Digg to see if he could garner 1 million users on Facebook via networking .
Unfortunately , Digg ’s abuse team did n’t think so .
Here ’s what they were doing when the story hit the front page :
They were removing the story .
The URL now is dead .
This is a screenshot of the Digg moderators busy at work .
Here ’s a screenshot of the Facebook group ( which is alive and well ) :
Subsequently , Erik was banned from Digg with the following scathing attack :
Your account has been disabled for attempting to use Digg as a staging area to launch an attack .
This is explicitly outlined in the TOS you agreed to when you signed up .
Judging from your active history on Digg , it is apparent that you are very aware what constitutes a violation .
Your actions are far from innocent .
Actually , Digg , Erik is a 17 - year - old kid who is pretty damn innocent .
Before he got banned , the only thing he told me is that “ I ’m really excited about this and I hope it works . ”
Does his story look like a launching pad for an attack ?
I do n’t think so … and I ’d have left this small issue alone too , but then today came along .
This morning , Facebook came out with “ new product pages ” and Digg jumped at the opportunity to make a difference .
Mr. Rose created the official Digg Facebook group and , ironically , submitted the story ( linking directly to the Facebook group ) to Digg .
It ’s still there , my friends , and that story has accrued over 1000 votes so far .
Now if you ask me , I ’d say that Erik and Kevin had similar motives ( except that Erik probably did n’t care for the monetary gain of the Facebook ads whereas Kevin is all in it for the dough ) .
Both wanted to create a Facebook community to connect users to each other .
On one hand , Erik ’s group was construed as a severe DDOS attempt whereas Kevin ’s submission is construed as a way of making Digg money .
It , therefore , passed with flying colors .
After all , Kevin is the Digg founder , and who on his staff would question the motives of the guy ?
After all is said and done , none of this is quite fair to the end user .
I understand that Kevin Rose is the founder of Digg , and for that reason alone , he has a lot of my respect .
However , Kevin , you need to realize that your users are important and they drive your site ’s success .
If you did n’t have a userbase , you would n’t be where you are .
As such , please respect the user .
I do n’t fault you for wanting to be a star , but come on , Kevin — you know that you blatantly duplicated someone else ’s submission which is clearly against your own TOS , and you also should realize that it ’s not fair that someone got banned for doing the same thing as you !
Kevin , perhaps I ’m Digg ’s biggest vocal critic , and I would n’t be critical of the system if I did n’t care for Digg ’s success .
I like Digg — a lot .
Otherwise , I would n’t be so cognizant of these small things and have my own strong opinions on the new Digg .
Obviously , I ’ve invested a lot of time in using the service , but I ’m not sure if you are a strong user as you are the founder and have business to attend to .
This , ironically , relates somewhat to my recent blog post about not understanding the social communities that you ’re involved in : unless you ’re truly invested in the service , you wo n’t understand the mentality of the users who do spend considerable amount of time on Digg .
Colleges have Resident Assistants who adhere to the same rules as the students , and they live among their students so they ’re very much part of that community .
Kevin , I ’m afraid that you ’re not aware of the ongoing events at Digg , or you clearly do n’t have time to realize that you ’re just the founder of Digg ; you ’re not really a user like the rest of us .
And if you were , these things should not have happened .
I know you want more pageviews .
I know you want more members .
Kevin , I want to see Digg thrive and flourish too .
However , at the end of the day , if you disregard the voices of your users and ignore their pleas , you ’re not going to come out victorious .
That said , I advise you to try to focus on making Digg a win - win situation for everyone involved , including yourself .
Just do n’t forget about who uses the service regularly when it comes to the success that you ’ve had thus far .
Note : Diggers mentioned here who were the victims of inconsistent treatment under Digg ’s TOS were not involved with the creation of this post in any way and should not be understood as consenting to its publication .
How False Narrative Works Editor ’s Note :
Over the past couple of decades , the Republicans have benefited enormously from their ability to create and disseminate false narratives through the Right ’s large , well - financed media apparatus .
With mainstream journalists unwilling to challenge the false narratives – and thus put their careers at risk – American voters often go to the polls believing things that are almost the opposite of the truth .
In this excerpt from Neck Deep : The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush , the authors present a case study from Election 2000 : During Campaign 2000 , conservative groups were given wide leeway in smearing Democratic candidate Al Gore without being called to account , even when the Vice President was falsely portrayed as a traitor .

For instance , in the weeks before Election 2000 , Aretino Industries , a pro-Republican group from Texas , ran an emotional ad modeled after Lyndon Johnson ’s infamous 1964 commercial that showed a girl picking a daisy before the screen dissolved into a nuclear explosion .
The ad remake accused the Clinton - Gore administration of selling vital nuclear secrets to communist China , in exchange for campaign donations in 1996 .
The compromised nuclear secrets , the ad stated , gave China “ the ability to threaten our homes with long - range nuclear warheads . ”
But the ad – which aired in “ swing ” states including Ohio , Michigan , Missouri and Pennsylvania – was filled with disinformation .
The actual evidence was that the key breach in national security , contributing to the modernization of China ’s nuclear arsenal , occurred in the 1980s , not the 1990s .
In other words , the secrets were lost during the Reagan - Bush administration , not the Clinton - Gore administration .
The most important compromised U.S. secret that allegedly helped China ’s nuclear weapons program was the blueprint for the W - 88 miniaturized nuclear warhead , which was smuggled to the Chinese in 1988 , the last year of Ronald Reagan ’s presidency , according to documents later given to U.S. authorities by a Chinese defector .
China tested their W - 88 - style warhead in 1992 , the last year of the first Bush administration .
Therefore , the W - 88 secret was lost – and acted upon – before Bill Clinton and Al Gore took office .
Indeed , the only significant part of this nuclear - secrets case that happened during the Clinton - Gore administration was that a Chinese defector exposed the espionage breach in 1995 .
However , when the American public first learned of the compromised secrets a few years later , the Republicans applied fuzzy logic and a blurred chronology to transform the lost nuclear blueprints , apparently compromised on the Reagan - Bush watch , into an attack theme on Clinton and Gore .
Cox Report
This clever strategy could be traced back to a May 1999 report prepared by a Republican - controlled congressional investigation headed by Rep. Christopher Cox of California .
The so - called Cox report accused the Clinton - Gore administration of failing to protect the nation against China ’s theft of top - secret nuclear designs and other sensitive data .
When released on May 25 , 1999 – shortly after the Clinton impeachment battle had ended – the Cox report was greeted by conservative groups and the national news media as another indictment of the Clinton administration .
By then , the Washington press corps had long been addicted to “ Clinton scandals ” and viewed almost any allegation through that prism , regardless of the details .
The Cox report gave weight in the public ’s mind to the suspicion that there was something far more sinister behind earlier allegations that a Chinese government front had funneled $ 30,000 in illegal “ soft money ” donations to the Democrats in 1996 .
Cox pulled off his sleight of hand with barely anyone spotting the trick card up his sleeve .
The key ruse was to leave out dates of alleged Chinese spying in the 1980s and thus obscure the fact that the floodgates of U.S. nuclear secrets to China – including how to build the miniaturized W - 88 nuclear warhead – had opened wide during the Reagan - Bush era .
While leaving out those Republican time elements , Cox shoved references to the alleged lapses into the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
So , the Cox report ’s “ Overview ” stated that “ the PRC ( People ’s Republic of China ) thefts from our National Laboratories began at least as early as the late 1970s , and significant secrets are known to have been stolen as recently as the mid-1990s . ”
In this way , Cox started with the Carter presidency , jumped over the 12 years of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and landed in the Clinton years .
In the “ Overview ” alone , there were three dozen references to dates from the Clinton years and only five mentions of dates from the Reagan - Bush years , with none of those citations related to alleged wrongdoing .
Cox ’s stacking of the deck carried over into the report ’s two - page chronology of the Chinese spy scandal .
On pages 74 - 75 , the Cox report put all the information boxes about Chinese espionage suspicions into the Carter and Clinton years .
Nothing sinister is attributed specifically to the Reagan - Bush era , other than a 1988 test of a neutron bomb built from secrets that the report says were believed stolen in the “ late 1970s , ” the Carter years .
Only a careful reading of the text inside the chronology ’s boxes made clear that many of the worst national security breaches could be traced to the Reagan - Bush era .
[ One of the authors of the Cox report was I . Lewis Libby , a key neoconservative who would later become Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff and a figure in the Plame - gate scandal , the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson 's covert CIA identity . ]
Reagan Security Breaches
When federal investigators translated other documents turned over by the Chinese defector , they learned that the exposure of nuclear secrets in the Reagan - Bush years was even worse than previously thought .
According to a later Washington Post article , “ the documents provided by the defector show that during the 1980s , Beijing had gathered a large amount of classified information about U.S. ballistic missiles and reentry vehicles . ”
But major news outlets did n't spell out the significance of that timing .
Other evidence suggested that conscious decisions by senior Reagan - Bush officials may have put communist China in a position to glean these sensitive secrets .
The rupture followed a secret decision by Ronald Reagan ’s White House in 1984 to collaborate with Beijing on a highly sensitive intelligence operation .
The project was the clandestine shipment of weapons to the Nicaraguan contra rebels , in defiance of U.S. law and while the administration was denying to Congress that such shipments were occurring .
The point man for enlisting China into the off - the - books contra operation was Marine Lt. Col .
Oliver North , then assigned to Reagan ’s National Security Council staff .
Reagan ’s White House turned to the Chinese for surface - to - air missiles for the contras because Congress had banned military assistance to the rebel force and the contras were suffering heavy losses from Soviet - built attack helicopters deployed by Nicaragua ’s leftist Sandinista government .
Some of the private U.S. operatives working with North believed China was the best source for SA - 7 anti-aircraft missiles .
In his 1989 Iran - Contra trial , North described this procurement as a “ very sensitive delivery . ”
For the Chinese missile deal in 1984 , North said he received help from the CIA in arranging false end - user certificates from the right - wing government of Guatemala .
North testified that he “ had made arrangements with the Guatemalan government , using the people [ CIA ] Director [ William ]
Casey had given me . ”
But China balked at selling missiles to the Guatemalan military , which was then engaged in a scorched - earth war against its own leftist guerrillas .
To resolve this problem , North was dispatched to a clandestine meeting with a Chinese military official .
In fall 1984 , North enlisted Gaston J. Sigur , the NSC ’s expert on East Asia , to make the arrangements for a meeting with a Chinese representative , according to Sigur ’s testimony at North ’s 1989 trial .
“ I arranged a luncheon and brought together Colonel North and this individual from the Chinese embassy ” responsible for military affairs , Sigur testified .
“ At lunch , they sat and they discussed the situation in Central America , ” Sigur said .
“ Colonel North raised the issue of the need for weaponry by the contras , and the possibility of a Chinese sale of weapons , either to the contras or , as I recall , I think it was more to countries in the region but clear for the use of the contras . ”
North described the same meeting in his autobiography , Under Fire .
“ Back in Washington , I met with a Chinese military officer assigned to their embassy to encourage their cooperation , ” North wrote .
“ We enjoyed a fine lunch at the exclusive Cosmos Club in downtown Washington . ”
North said the Chinese saw the collaboration as a way to develop “ better relations with the United States . ”
Possession of this knowledge also put Beijing in position to leverage future U.S. policies .
While the details of a possible U.S. - China tradeoff are still unknown , the Reagan administration did authorize a broader exchange program between U.S. and Chinese nuclear physicists .
The Chinese were given access to the Los Alamos nuclear facility .
The Wen Ho Lee Case Los Alamos nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee first came to the FBI ’s attention in 1982 when he called another scientist who was under investigation for espionage , but Lee ’s contacts with China – along with trips there by other U.S. nuclear scientists – increased in the mid-1980s as relations warmed between Washington and Beijing , according to a New York Times chronology that was published n 2001 after George W. Bush had become President .
The Times reported that limited exchanges between nuclear scientists from the United States and China began after President Carter officially recognized China in 1978 , but those meetings grew far more expansive and less controlled during the 1980s .
“ With the Reagan administration eager to isolate the Soviet Union , hundreds of scientists traveled between the United States and China , and the cooperation expanded to the development of torpedoes , artillery shells and jet fighters , ” the Times wrote .
“ The exchanges were spying opportunities as well . ”
“ On September 25 , 1992 , a nuclear blast shook China ’s western desert , ” the Times wrote .
“ From spies and electronic surveillance , American intelligence officials determined that the test was a breakthrough in China ’s long quest to match American technology for smaller , more sophisticated hydrogen bombs . ”
In September 1992 , George H.W. Bush was still President .
In the early years of the Clinton administration , U.S. intelligence experts began to suspect that the Chinese nuclear breakthrough most likely came from purloined U.S. secrets .
“ It ’s like they were driving a Model T and went around the corner and suddenly had a Corvette , ” said Robert M. Hanson , a Los Alamos intelligence analyst .
Looking for possible espionage , investigators began examining the years of the mid-1980s when the Reagan - Bush administration had authorized U.S. nuclear scientists to hold meetings with their Chinese counterparts .
Though the American scientists were under restrictions about what information could be shared , it was never clear exactly why these meetings were held in the first place – given the risk that a U.S. scientist might willfully or accidentally divulge nuclear secrets .
China - gate
But the Chinese - espionage story did n’t gain national attention until March 1999 when The New York Times published several imprecise front - page stories fingering Wen Ho Lee as an espionage suspect .
During those chaotic first weeks of “ Chinagate , ” Republicans and political pundits mixed together the suspicions of Chinese spying and allegations about Chinese campaign donations to the Democrats in 1996 .
Clinton ’s Justice Department officials then overcompensated by demonstrating how tough they could be on suspect Wen Ho Lee .
Virtually no one in official Washington noted the logical impossibility of Democrats selling secrets to China in 1996 that China apparently had obtained a decade or so earlier during a Republican administration .
Instead , conservative groups grasped the political and fund - raising potential .
Larry Klayman ’s right - wing Judicial Watch sent out a solicitation letter seeking $ 5.2 million for a special “ Chinagate Task Force ” that would “ hold Bill Clinton , Al Gore and the Democratic Party Leadership fully accountable for election fraud , bribery and possibly treason in connection with the ‘ Chinagate ’ scandal . ”
The fallout from the spy hysteria kept spreading .
The 60 - year - old Wen Ho Lee was imprisoned on a 59 - count indictment for mishandling classified material .
The Taiwanese - born naturalized U.S. citizen was put in solitary confinement with his cell light on at all times .
He was allowed out of his cell only one hour a day , when he shuffled around a prison courtyard in leg shackles .
The case against Wen Ho Lee began to collapse , however .
Prosecutors accepted a plea bargain on September 13 , 2000 , with the scientist pleading guilty to a single count of mishandling classified material .
A furious U.S. District Judge James A. Parker complained that he had been “ led astray ” by the prosecutors and apologized to Lee for the “ demeaning , unnecessarily punitive conditions ” under which Lee had been held .
Parker ordered Lee released with no further jail time .
Still , the Cox report ’s suspicions about Clinton - Gore treachery lingered and reemerged during the final days of Campaign 2000 with the “ daisy ad ” remake .
The closing message was blunt : “ Do n’t take a chance , ” the ad said .
“ Please vote Republican . ”
In its appeal , the message was unintentionally ironic , since the worst compromises of nuclear secrets to China had occurred under Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
Bush , the team that would be restored to power if the voters followed the ad ’s advice .
George W. Bush ’s campaign also exploited the “ Chinagate ” suspicions , albeit a touch more subtly , by running ads showing Gore meeting with saffron - robed monks at a Buddhist temple in California .
So , millions of Americans went to the polls in November 2000 thinking that Gore ’s temple appearance and the Chinese nuclear spying were somehow linked .
The national news media – still bristling with hostility toward Clinton and Gore – contributed to the confusion by failing to explain to the American public in a timely fashion that the Chinese security breaches represented a Reagan - Bush scandal , not a Clinton - Gore scandal .

GOP front - runners turn down opportunity to blog for vets Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 20 , 2007

An organization representing veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan launched a new blog Tuesday , which will feature posts from some of the top presidential candidates .
Only one GOP contender -- maverick Ron Paul -- responded to VoteVets.org 's invitation to blog while five Democratic candidates answered the organization 's call .
VoteVets is a technically non-partisan group , but it works closely with mostly Democratic congressional candidates and aims to elect lawmakers who are " critical of the execution of the war in Iraq . "
In Tuesday 's first candidate post , former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards outlined his plans to bring home tens of thousands of troops stationed in Iraq and provide comprehensive healthcare to veterans .
" When our service men and women sacrifice so much to defend our freedom and secure peace around the world , we have a moral obligation to take care of them and their families , " Edwards writes .
The organization hopes its blog , VetVoice.com , becomes a clearinghouse for discussion of veterans ' issues as the presidential campaign continues .
Posts will be added to the site throughout the day Tuesday from Paul and Democratic candidates , Bill Richardson , Chris Dodd , Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
" It s heartening to know that the candidates who are posting think military and veterans issues are important enough to warrant a post on this new blog ,  Brandon Friedman , an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran , and vice chairman of VoteVets.org , said in a news release .
 VetVoice.com , we hope will become the hub on the web for those concerned about military and veterans issues , and where people can take a critical look at these issues , and proposed solutions .
Theres no better way to kick it off than to begin with posts from those who are seeking to be our Commander in Chief . "
Registered VetVoice users can post comments responding to each blog post that representatives of each campaign are expected to read , although organizers do not expect the candidates themselves to respond directly .
Edwards ' post includes links to detailed proposals on his campaign Web site -- such as his plan to combat post traumatic stress disorder -- and his pledge to avoid starting another unnecessary war with the military as stretched as it is now .
" As president , I will give service members more dwell - time at home , avoiding deployment patterns likely to lead to higher levels of PTSD , " he writes .
" I will also avoid reckless military decisions like a so - called " preventive war " with Iran that could hurt our troops and their families . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Deal or no deal ?
An online exchange between a woman looking for a husband who earns more than $ 500,000 a year and a mystery Wall Street banker , who assessed her potential for romance as a business deal , has cause quite an Internet stir .
A woman walks past the Louis Vuitton store in New York , February 15 , 2007 .
A woman 's online bid to find a rich husband in New York earning more than $ 500,000 a year has caused an Internet stir with a mystery Wall Street banker publicly assessing her hunt for romance as a business deal -- and a bad one at that .
REUTERS / Keith Bedford
The anonymous 25 - year - old woman recently posted an ad on the free online New York community Web site Craigslist , newyork.craigslist.org / , appealing for advice on how to find a wealthy husband .
“ I know how that sounds , but keep in mind that a million a year is middle class in New York City , so I do n’t think I ’m overreaching at all , ” the woman , who described herself as “ spectacularly beautiful ” and “ superficial , ” wrote .
“ I dated a business man who makes average around 200 - 250 .
But that ’s where I seem to hit a roadblock .
$ 250,000 wo n’t get me to Central Park West , ” she said , asking questions like “ where do rich single men hang out ? ”
The mystery banker , who said he fit the bill , offered the woman an analysis of her predicament , describing it as “ plain and simple a crappy business deal . ”
“ Your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity ... in fact , it is very likely that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you wo n’t be getting any more beautiful ! ” the banker wrote .
“ So , in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning asset , ” he said .
“ Let me explain , you ’re 25 now and will likely stay pretty hot for the next 5 years , but less so each year .
Then the fade begins in earnest .
By 35 stick a fork in you ! ”
“ It does n’t make good business sense to “ buy you ” ( which is what you ’re asking ) so I ’d rather lease , ” he said .
While the woman has since removed the ad from Craigslist , it -- along with the response -- has become a popular email joke that , bank JPMorgan Chase says , led to one of its bankers mistakenly being credited with writing the response .
Brian Marchiony , spokesman for JPMorgan Chase , said the banker did not write the response and that his email signature accidentally became attached to the ad and response when he forwarded it to friends and it then wound up on blogs .
Craigslist was not immediately available for comment , but a spokeswoman told The New York Times that “ it does look as if the post was made sincerely . ”

If Congress does follow through , the IRS will need to reprogram its systems - a process that will take 7 weeks from the day the patch becomes law .
" If the IRS must postpone accepting returns in the early part of the filing season in 2008 , it would delay the processing of returns and the issuance of the associated refunds , " the IRS Oversight Board noted in a Nov. 26 report .
The tax filing season is currently scheduled to begin Jan. 14 , 2008 .
Even if Congress were to pass a patch in the next week , the start date for tax season would push to Jan. 28 .
A patch would prevent the AMT - a tax originally intended for the very wealthy - from hitting roughly 21 million new taxpayers this tax year .
The average tax bill increase would be $ 2,000 unless a patch is passed , according to Treasury Department estimates .
Electronic filers who want their refund direct - deposited into their bank account typically receive their money between 10 days and 2 weeks after filing .
It takes 3 weeks if they want a check mailed to them .
Paper filers typically get their refunds within 35 days if they choose direct deposit , or about a week longer if they opt for a check .
Whether those intervals would grow and by how much , the IRS can't say yet .
But the later the IRS starts processing returns , the more likely it is that there will be a backlog of returns to get through .
If a patch is n't signed into law until , say , Christmas Eve , the filing season could be pushed to Feb .
4 . That would delay the processing of 15.5 million returns from which the agency is likely to issue 13.3 million refunds totaling more than $ 39 billion , according to the IRS Oversight Board .
If lawmakers wait until early 2008 to pass a patch , the numbers grow substantially from there .
If they wait until the week of Jan. 7 , the filing season wo n't get started until the week of Feb. 18 .
That would affect 38 million returns from which 32 million refunds worth $ 87 billion would be issued .
The delay on the Hill is about - what else ? - money .
There is still strong disagreement over whether to pay for the estimated cost of the patch - roughly $ 50 billion - by raising tax revenue elsewhere through so - called offsets .
As things stand now , the House has passed an AMT patch bill with offsets , but the Senate has yet to pass its own bill .
While there 's still a chance a patch will pass this year , the debate may be pushed into early 2008 .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said Monday that the Senate would address the AMT patch issue " as soon as we can , " according to " Tax Notes , " a publication of Tax Analysts .
Senator Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , meanwhile , indicated there may not be enough time this year for an AMT bill given the disagreement about the offsets .
Failure to reach a compromise by now also has introduced a lot of uncertainty into the planning of taxpayers who still are n't sure whether they 'll be on the hook to pay the AMT or not .
Comcast impersonates users ' computers to block internet file sharing David Edwards and Muriel Kane

This Comcast subscribers have been complaining since last summer that the country 's second - largest Internet service provider is deliberately cutting off peer - to - peer file sharing .
Now a study by the Associated Press has confirmed those reports .
Peer - to - peer networks can be used for unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials but also have many legitimate uses .
File - sharing is now estimated to account for as much as 90 % of Internet traffic , and many ISP 's attempt to preserve bandwidth by slowing it down .
The Associated Press found that Comcast is using an even more drastic method , which can prevent file - sharing almost entirely by sending fake messages to both computers involved in a peer - to - peer transaction , telling them to drop the connection .
Comcast is not blocking its subscribers ' downloads , only their uploads .
This means that non-Comcast subscribers all over the world who seek to access those files may be the ones hardest hit .
Posters at the technology geek website Slashdot generally believe that the real problem lies in the fact that ISP's have over - promoted bandwidth - intensive services beyond what the current infrastructure can handle and are now trying to artificially limit the use of those same services rather than acknowledging the need for upgrades .
The following video is from The Associated Press , broadcast on October 19 , 2007 .

( LifeWire ) -- Bad kissers -- we 've all locked lips with one : the lizard , the washing machine , the cannibal , the spelunker .
" I knew this girl that I 'll call Big Tongue , " recalls Craig Hinkle , 38 , a Westminster , California - based network administrator .
" Her tongue was massive , and she insisted on trying to put the entire thing in my mouth .
She was very forceful with it , and I started choking . "
You can guess that relationship did n't last .
And now , what Hinkle knows from experience is actually backed up by science : Bad kissers have little chance of getting to second base .
In a study published recently in the scientific journal " Evolutionary Psychology , " 59 percent of men and 66 percent of women said they 've been in the position of being attracted to someone -- until they kissed the person .
Check out some famous kissing »
" At the moment of the kiss , there 's a very complicated exchange of information ... that may tap into underlying evolved mechanisms " cluing us in on whether we 're genetically compatible , explains Gordon Gallup , co-author of the study and professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Albany .
" A kiss can be a deal - breaker in terms of whether a relationship will flower or flounder , so to speak . "
Rachel Myeroff , 26 , can attest to that .
On a second date with a guy , says the New York City - based sales manager , " he just went in for it and attached himself to me in the sloppiest , most horrible kiss ever .
He was just consuming my mouth .
I most definitely did not call him again . "

Gallup 's research suggests that men and women have different agendas when it comes to kissing , an act that occurs in 95 percent of human societies and is believed to have been first recorded in Vedic Sanskrit texts around 1500 B.C. in India .
For men , kissing is more often used as a means to an end -- namely , to gain sexual access .
Men also are more likely to literally kiss and make up , using kissing to attempt reconciliation .
Women on the other hand use kissing as a mate - assessment technique , Gallup notes .
They subconsciously evaluate mating potential from the chemicals in their partner 's saliva and breath , for instance .
Women also use kissing as a bonding gesture , as well as to monitor the status of the relationship .
If her partner 's kissing frequency or technique suddenly changes , that perhaps is a sign of his waning interest .
Other gender differences uncovered by Gallup 's research :
• Men show a greater preference for tongue contact and open - mouth kisses .
• Men are more willing than women to have sex with someone without kissing , as well as to have sex with someone they are not attracted to or consider to be a bad kisser .
• Women place more importance on kissing throughout a relationship , whereas men place less importance on it as the relationship progresses .
Improve your kiss
If you 've ever been told to kiss off after smooching someone beneath the holiday mistletoe , fear not .
Like other skills , one 's kissing technique can be improved upon .
Michael Christian , author of " The Art of Kissing " ( under the pen name William Cane ) , offers classes , and there 's a myriad of how - to books and DVDs .
To improve your technique , Christian suggests switching up your repertoire with different types of kisses :
• Vacuum kiss , in which you suck the air out of your partner 's mouth while kissing
• Neck kiss , in which you kiss up and down your partner 's neck
• " Lip - o - suction , " in which you kiss the upper lip while your partner kisses the lower lip , and then you reverse .
Bad kisses , on the other hand , are relatively easy to pinpoint .
" Bad kisses trigger the gag reflex , " Christian says .
" Bad kisses are also static and repetitious .
Varying the speed , intensity and style can help . "
Spontaneity also can help you get out of a slump .
" The best kisses are always the ones that happen accidentally , " observes New York City resident Benjamin Kayne , 25 , a digital media sales director .
" ( Planned kisses ) are just tedious , and I 'm sitting there thinking , ' Is this over yet ?

I think it 's important to put the revelations that Iran halted its nuclear " program in 2003 primarily in response to international pressure " in the context of the broader trends in US - Iranian relations that Gareth Porter ( among others ) have reported on .
Specifically , in 2003 we know that the Iranians attempted a diplomatic opening to the United States .
Porter reported that in exchange for actually getting something , Iran was prepared to abandon its nuclear program in a hard - to - reverse way :
To meet the U.S. concern about an Iranian nuclear weapons program , the document offered to accept much tighter controls by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in exchange for " full access to peaceful nuclear technology . "
It proposed " full transparency for security [ assurance ] that there are no Iranian endeavors to develop or possess WMD " and " full cooperation with IAEA based on Iranian adoption of all relevant instruments ( 93+2 and all further IAEA protocols ) . "
There have been some efforts to discredit what Porter , Flynt Leverret , and others have said about this attempted opening , but the NIE 's conclusions about Iran 's nuclear program seem to strongly support it .
With their secret enrichment activities exposed , the Iranian regime was reconsidering the utility of continuing such efforts in the face of international awareness and disapproval of them .
The Bush administration then decided to squander this opportunity and focus on saber - rattling and dreams of regime change .
But the thing about pressure is that you 've got to be willing to take yes for an answer instead of just blundering around .
Meanwhile , how outrageous is it that the best twelve months of alarmism from Bush & Cheney have come in the context of an environment where they 've long had access to the intelligence community 's assessment ?
Answer : Very outrageous .

Air Canada says a crew member was taken ill
A passenger said the pilot was carried from the plane shouting and swearing , saying he wanted to talk " to God " .
The flight from Toronto to Heathrow landed at Shannon airport after its crew declared a medical emergency .
Passengers flew on to London later .
Air Canada has confirmed that a crew member was unwell , but did not confirm he was suffering mental problems .
He basically said he wanted to talk to God
Sean Finucane
Passenger
" At no time were the safety of the passengers or crew in question , " said an Air Canada spokesman .
" The flight was met by medical personnel and the individual is now in care . "
Eight - hour delay
One of the passengers , Sean Finucane , said he saw the co-pilot being carried into the cabin in restraints .
" He was very , very distraught .
He was yelling loudly at times , " he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation .
" He was swearing and asking for God and very distressed .
He basically said he wanted to talk to God . "
Passengers were put up in hotels while another crew was found .
They eventually arrived in London eight hours late .
The first KDE 4 release will come along with several major changes compared to KDE 3.x .
While explanations for these changes have been posted at several places before there is a central list missing which explains the reasons to normal users .
This post lists some hot topics and tries to shed some light on the reasons behind certain decisions ..
KDE 4 will be a large step away from KDE 3 in several regards .
I already posted a short list of programs and services which will be replaced by something new .
However , that list did n’t say much about the reasons behind these decisions .
But with the ever closer coming release date of KDE 4.0 and new and easy ways of testing the newest builds many people in the last days asked questions at different places and occasions and wondered why beloved KDE 3 technologies will not appear in KDE 4 anymore , or why certain services have been exchanged against something new .
Even a friend of mine a normal users who do not follow the development of KDE 4 closely , raised some concerns .
Last but not least there are active discussions going on at the KDE planet about this topic atm .
This post sheds some light on the reasons behind some of the design decisions for the user point of view .
arts vs Phonon
That one is easy , and therefore it is good for a start : aRts , the KDE 3 soundserver was powerful , but simply unmaintained .
Despite its superior technology when it was introduced for the first time it was out - dated when KDE 4 development started – video support was for example missing , to begin with .
So arts would have required a major rewrite in almost every regard with many new features to add to get into a future - ready shape .
And there was no one really willing to do that .
At the same time other very capable and promising multimedia frameworks were available ( Xine , Mplayer ) or in heavy development and almost available ( Gstreamer ) .
Also , having a fixed dependency on arts only hurt KDE 3 to the end of its life time very much .
The KDE developers felt like that this should never happen again .
So it was decided that the best would be to write a wrapper .
And someone stepped up and did exactly this .
Phonon was born .
The question is of course if it turned out to be the right thing .
Time will tell , but the fact that Trolltech already decided to include Phonon in Qt 4.4 in some bits is very promising .
kcontrol vs systemsettings
That one is not that easy at all : kcontrol will be replaced by systemsettings , and several people do n’t like the new systemsettings .
Having said that , these people should have a second look at the moduls themselves : systemsettings just loads the modules of kcontrol .
So the frontend which offers the modules is different , while the modules stay the same ( but are of course also improved for KDE 4 ) .
The reason behind this move has to do with development power and also wishes from the users : systemsettings was introduced with Kubuntu for their modified KDE version .
Many users indeed liked it since – for them – it was more polished , usable and easier to understand .
kcontrol , on the other hand , did n’t have a maintainer .
Of course , long time KDE users had mixed feelings – people like me , who never really got the hang with kcontrol like systemsettings , others are more used to kcontrol .
But in the end the mass of the users of the system tool will be users .
Normal users , not power users or developers .
And after all I ’ve read about both configuration tools it looks like that most normal users do n’t really care since the functionality is basically the same and the modules are the same .
So , they do n’t really care , plus there is no maintainer for one of two solutions , leaves us with the other solution .
Oxygen
This one is tricky : Oxygen is most visible by the used iconset and the theme , and the above mentioned friend mentioned that he did n’t like the new theme .
In contrast , I prefer to have a very bright , almost milky theme and I do n’t need much contrast ( what for anyway ? ) .
But we are both power users , and we do know that switching to another theme is done in just a few seconds .
And the new theme engine is very powerful !
But for the average user it has to be pretty – and for these people a milky theme with not too much contrast seems to be equivalent to the term “ good design ” .
Additionally , some of the top KDE designers have a similar feeling and also wanted to test there abilities in that field ( I guess ) .
So the decision was there .
And why not ?
Every power user should n’t bother with any theme or icon dislikes because he / she also knows kde - look.org .
So the only thing which has to be made sure is that KDE 4.0 comes along with a set of different icon sets and themes to please more than just one user base .
Or maybe just with GetHotNewStuff buttons .
And as a personal note , because I was asked this quite often : the big icons inside Dolphin which can be seen on several screenshots are there because it looks better on a screenshot .
Of course I would never use such big icons , and of course Dolphin does not force such big icons , and of course it is not part of the look of KDE 4 to have big icons !
Kicker vs Plasma
KDE 4 ’s panel is a hot topic which was also discussed between several KDE developers the last days .
The problem is that the current Plasma replacement for kicker is not on pair with kicker feature wise .
So why was kicker dropped and something new created instead of just improving kicker ?
The reason is that kicker was already broken years ago : the code was hardly readable , and new introduced features often introduced bugs and problems at other places .
Also , kicker was as flexible as a mountain : several projects which aimed at adding a cool new feature to kicker in the end copied the code base and started to rework it on their own – they forked kicker .
And that would not have been necessary when kicker would have a better design for such improvements .
But kicker was created for KDE 2.0 ( ! ) , at a time when no one would have thought that some years later applets would be embedded in the panel as well as in the desktop .
Or that there are indeed several ways to provide panel functions and not just the 90s like static attempt ( think of MacOS like approaches , etc. ) .
In contrast , KDE 4 will have a long life cycle , and therefore all code must be maintainable for a long time – and for other developers .
So the options were to either totally rework kicker from the basic design through the entire code base up to the applet part to check if parts can be shared with Superkaramba .
Or a replacement could have been provided .
But , and that is important : there was no way to simply keep kicker , because it was not in a maintainable state for KDE 4 .
The decision was as usual done by the people who provide the code : people decided to merge the desktop with the panel and provide everything from one point .
That was quite a bold decision , and a lesson to learn : while Plasma makes great improvements every day , it was and probably still is one of the most criticized features of KDE 4 .
There are still some bits missing until it is ready for release .
From a user point of view it will be something new to get used to – some features of KDE 3 ’s kicker will most certainly be missing .
Of course , all the basic panel stuff will be there , but it will still be an entirely new panel .
Nothing more , nothing less .
You must get used to it , and it will take time – at least a bit time , even a Plasma panel is still a panel .
However , one of the advantages of the new technology is that it was designed to be much more flexible than the old one .
So in the long term you can expect various of customization feature coming up .
And even if there will be new ideas to implement the basic panel functions these will not require you to replace the current panel but will ( well , hopefully ) simply build upon it – unlike KDE 3 ’s kicker replacements .
So even revolutionary new ideas might integrate into the original system without much work .
And in case you worry about the current design : it is not final .
Plasma is themable and it is not yet said how the final version will look like .
Maybe it will even be significant different from the current design to distinguish itself from the Beta / RC design .
KMenu vs Kickoff
Another source of hot emotions :
The problem here is that KDE 3 ’s classical menu ( 90s style ) will be replaced by a Kickoff port which was originally developed by OpenSuse / Novell and used in recent OpenSuse distributions .
People who are used to the classical menu style either by older Windows releases or by KDE 3 ’s menu will be at least confused when they first use Kickoff .
Many of them got annoyed since it does not behave like other menus .
So , why the change at all ?
Again , one part of the answer is the code base of the old solution : it was , according to the developers , ugly .
Additionally , Novell spent quite some money and time on the question how a menu actually should look like usability wise .
They checked back with users ( like , real people , not computer people 😉 ) and tried to figure out what actually is usable .
Most people like the classical menu because they are used to – that has nothing to do how well this type of menu is actually suitable to the task .
And usability wise it is totally nuts to navigate such menus with a mouse !
( Do I have to add that I do n’t use menus at all as long as I can avoid it ?
Long live Alt +F2 ! )
So they started developing Kickoff – with average or new users in their mind .
In the end the situation was that usability wise Kickoff was a strong improvement to the old menu .
It does n’t matter if you disagree with that personally , because that has nothing to do with the figures gathered in a scientific test .
Also , there was developer power there to port Kickoff .
And they did .
Originally , there was even another menu planed , but that was delayed .
So the situation is quite nice for new users .
It sucks a bit for power users , but for them Plasma will maybe save the day : with Plasma it should be fairly easy to replace the menu by another one .
Indeed , there is already another menu / application launcher in development , Lancelot .
Also , it was mentioned that it should not be too difficult to implement an old - style menu , for the people who love the stone age ( 90s ) but want to distinguish themselves from apes ( command line or Alt + F2 ) .
Konqueror and Dolphin ( “ and ” , not “ vs ” )
Dolphin will be KDE 4 ’s new file manager .
And many people raised concerns about that .
Especially the power users fear that Konqueror might get neglected now , which would be horrible .
And I agree , btw. , that such a thing would be horrible : Konqueror is the swiss army knife for everything file management related .
It is * the* tool for power users .
So , first of all , why was Dolphin introduced at all ?
The first reason is that Dolphin , formally a third party development , got quite some attention and was very popular especially when KDE 4 development started .
The second reason , and the developers realized it when Dolphin became that popular , is that many users just want to have a simple file manager and not a swiss army knife for file management .
Also , there was a chance to improve Konqueror ’s file management by inviting Dolphin ’s developers : Konqueror will use Dolphin ’s file management engine to manage files .
This will improve Konqueror ’s abilities in this regard – and will make sure that Konqueror will not fall behind ( that is the mighty technology of KDE 🙂 ) .
Of course it is not bad to keep an eye on Konqueror ’s development to make sure that no one forgets it due to the excitement for Dolphin .
But recent news show that there Konqueror is polished and equipped with new features .
Closing thoughts
This list covers the most important topics .
There are of course more things which are occasionally discussed , but this list is a good first start I guess .
Also , the list is already quite long 😉
I do however want to add that most of the information here are the impression I got from reading blogs , commit digests , comments , etc.
Remember , I ’m not a KDE developer .
So if I forgot an important reason or mixed something up , please leave a comment and I will alter the text here .
Also , some of the reasons depend on interpretation and personal point of view of the developers , so some people might disagree with the point of view and the reasons offered here .
In such cases you are also welcomed to highlight your point of view in the comment section .
The opinion of another shrill hysteric ?
Just David M. Walker , the Comptroller General of the United States and head of the GAO :
In a speech today at the National Press Club , he said , " If the federal government was a private corporation and the same report came out this morning , our stock would be dropping and there would be talk about whether the company 's management and directors needed a major shake - up . "
Walker urged greater transparency and accountability over the federal government 's operations , financial condition , and fiscal outlook ...
" The federal government 's fiscal exposures totaled approximately $ 53 trillion as of September 30 , 2007 , up more than $ 2 trillion from September 30 , 2006 , and an increase of more than $ 32 trillion from about $ 20 trillion as of September 30 , 2000 , " Walker said .
" This translates into a current burden of about $ 175,000 per American or approximately $ 455,000 per American household . "

Biden stands by impeachment threat ; Bush has ' damaged us ' like no other administration has Mike Aivaz and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday December 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) appeared on MSNBC's Hardball and reiterated that he would seek the impeachment of President Bush were he to invade Iran without the permission of Congress .
Biden , a Democratic candidate for the White House himself , was asked by host Chris Matthews if he stood by his earlier comment regarding the impeachment of the president .
Biden said yes , explaining it as " a warning . "
" The president has no constitutional authority to take this nation to war against a country of 70 million people , unless we 're attacked or unless there is proof that we are about to be attacked , " said Biden .
" And if he does ... I would move to impeach him .
" This administration has damaged us to a degree that no other administration has in American history , " the senator remarked .
" We have no credibility . "
Excerpts from the transcript of the video , found in full here , follow : # Matthews : Senator Biden , I know you 've been the foreign affairs expert for the Democratic Party .
Were you snowed ?
Were you shocked to hear we do not face a weapons system under production in Iran ?
Biden : No. I never believed we were .
And I said it .
I 've been trying to engage Iran way back five years ago with Dick Lugar and others , trying to engage them .
Look , this is not -- you know , if this were n't so deadly earnest -- this is n't about curiosity , it 's about credibility .
This administration has damaged us to a degree that no other administration has in American history .
We have no credibility , Chris . ... ... Biden :
We have added to the urban legend in the streets of all the Muslim capitals in the world that this is a war against Islam .
We have made it more difficult for every moderate Muslim leader , from Karzai on , to be able to deal directly with us .
This is incredibly devastating to our interests in the Middle East , from Iraq through Pakistan , as well as our credibility around the world .
It is going to cost us in a way that no one 's calculating it .
The good news is it makes it harder for these cowboys to go to war .
The bad news is we have been further damaged , and that hurts America 's interests in a big way .
...
Biden : I do n't know what President Bush thinks , but I think he 's bought hook , line and sinker the Cheney rationale that the only way for us to be able to be dominant in the 21st century is to use our overwhelming power in the face of the moral disapprobation of the rest of the world , threaten the rest of the world and that 's how we avoid war in the future .
I think these guys are irresponsible .
But the thing that angers me the most ... is how incomprehensible it is for anyone to think that the president did not know that his intelligence agencies did n't believe what he was saying .
I believe that 's why these guys came out with now 16 American intelligence agencies uniting , saying , I 'm not going to wear the jacket again on this one .
...
MATTHEWS : ... I want to ask you about something you 've been involved with .
You said that if the president of the United States had launched an attack on Iran without congressional approval , that would have been an impeachable offense .
BIDEN : Absolutely .
MATTHEWS : Do you want to review that comment you made ?
Well , how do you stand on that now ?
Do you think ...
BIDEN : Yes , I do .
I want to stand by that comment I made .
The reason I made the comment was as a warning .
... I got together and brought a group of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I 'm going to deliver to the whole United States Senate , pointing out the president has no constitutional authority to take this nation to war against a country of 70 million people , unless we 're attacked or unless there is proof that we are about to be attacked .
And if he does -- if he does -- I would move to impeach him .
The House obviously has to do that , but I would lead an effort to impeach him . #
A 72 - year - old man is due to become the father of his own " grandchild " by acting as a sperm donor for his daughter - in - law .
The case is thought to be the first of its kind in the UK .
The government 's fertility watchdog said there was a " handful " of men over 65 on the sperm register , but some fertility experts are worried that the couple are being subjected to undue risks because the sperm is likely to have many genetic mutations accumulated during the donor 's life .
" By the time you get to 70 the risks are significantly stacked that there will be errors in there , " said Allan Pacey at the University of Sheffield , who is secretary of the British Fertility Society .
" That could lead to failure of the procedure .
It might mean a greater chance of miscarriage . "
The child would also be at greater risk of genetic diseases such as Down 's syndrome and autism , he added .
" My professional advice would be donors should be under the age of 40 wherever possible , but there are always going to be exceptional circumstances . "
After failing to have a child naturally the couple sought fertility treatment and discovered sperm problems .
Doctors at their Harley Street clinic offered to provide sperm from an anonymous donor , but the couple wanted to use a member of their own family .
" We have made the decision on the basis that the couple have special requirements in that donor sperm is not acceptable to them , " said Kamal Ahuja of the London Women 's Clinic .
" That applies to many , many groups of people - some religions [ such as Islam ] do n't condone the use of donor sperm .
In this particular case there was a mixture of reasons . "
The decision was referred to the clinic 's ethics committee , which considered whether going ahead would be in the long term - interest of the child .
The wife 's mother - in - law has agreed to the procedure .
According to guidance from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority , sperm donors cannot be older than 45 " unless there are exceptional reasons " .
Of the nearly 6,000 men on the donor register only around 300 are over this age .
Guidelines from the British Andrology Society are even more conservative , citing 40 as the recommended upper age limit .
" The age limit does n't apply in quite the same way [ in this case ] because they have said we want that person for family reasons .
The clinic would have to make a clinical decision based on is this a suitable treatment , " said a spokesperson for the HFEA .
It is not uncommon for families to use a sperm donor from within their family - often a brother - so that the child will have genetic ties with his or her " father " , but this is thought to be the first case of a grandfather acting as a sperm donor .
The family have not yet decided whether they will tell the child who his or her genetic father is , although the clinic is encouraging them to be open about that .
" That 's their personal decision , " said Dr Ahuja .

BBC News political reporter
Ms Jolie was rebuffed by the Italian prime minister
The wife of Brad Pitt came to New York earlier this year to talk to the Italian prime minister about the plight of the developing world .
But he refused , haughtily saying : " I 've never heard of a politician getting in trouble by not meeting an actress . "
It was , in an age of ever - increasing invitations to celebrities to become involved in politics , a remarkable put - down .
UK politicians would , it seems , kill for the chance to be associated with such A - list tinseltown glamour .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown , for one , has already discussed global education with Ms Jolie and basked in the afterglow of some kind comments from her .
' Youth issues '
The age of the celebrity political adviser is well and truly here .
As billionaire talkshow host Oprah Winfrey tours the US promoting presidential hopeful Barrack Obama , lesser lights of the showbiz world are being courted by all the main parties in the UK .
But what " advice " do they offer ?
One of the first things Nick Clegg announced after being elected Liberal Democrat leader was that 60 - year - old musician Brian Eno - of Roxy Music and other fame - would be briefing him on " youth " issues .
He said : " I 'm announcing that Brian Eno , from outside politics , will start giving me advice on how we can make this country a country more fit for young people .
I do n't care who I have to go to to try to make this agenda work
Bob Geldof
Anti-poverty campaigner
" Because I think it 's not just children who 've got particular or special needs .
We 're failing thousands and thousands of children who just have committed no crime other than being born into poverty . "
" Outside politics " is a place our elected representatives want to reach .
Last month , GMTV host Fiona Phillips said she had turned down an offer from the prime minister to advise him on campaigning , particularly on health issues .
Asked about this , Downing Street said the government would " welcome all men and women of talent " .
All parties would say the same .
Tycoon and star of The Apprentice Sir Alan Sugar has accepted an invitation to advise Mr Brown on business .
Kirstie Allsopp has been courted by the Tories
Musician Feargal Sharkey has headed a government taskforce on promoting live music since 2004 .
Kirstie Allsopp , the goddess of TV property shows and sworn enemy of the government 's home information packs , agreed earlier this month to advise the Conservatives on ways of making buying and selling houses less stressful .
And singer Billy Bragg became so involved in constitutional issues that he put forward detailed plans in 2004 for reforming the House of Lords , which were taken seriously by ministers .
Politicians gain from being photographed and associated with popular figures from outside the Westminster village .
' Agenda '
Celebrities , in turn , hope to get their message - often on a single issue - across , and possibly influence policies .
Bob Geldof , the former Boomtown Rats frontman and face of Live Aid , agreed in 2005 to become a consultant to the Conservative working group on global poverty .
But he said : " I do n't care who I have to go to to try to make this agenda work . "
Mr Geldof added : " If I can be of benefit to help set other parties ' policies then I will do it . "
Earlier that year , TV chef and school dinners campaigner Jamie Oliver held talks with Labour and the Conservatives , but declared himself politically neutral .
Politicians , by their very nature , court publicity , as do celebrities .
' Step too far '
Last year ,
Tory leader David Cameron invited the US rap artist Rhymefest for tea at the House of Commons to discuss the effects of violent lyrics .
Labour MP Stephen Pound called the meeting a " step too far " in attempting to gain the youth vote .
But the rapper responded : " I do n't see him doing nothing .
Yo , Pound !
Where you at ?
You ain't meeting with nobody .
" You get somebody who wants to talk and discuss and you 're going to criticise them ?
And you wonder why the people do n't vote ?
Y'all cowards , man . "
There , in a nutshell , is the dilemma .
Is taking advice from celebrities a cynical voter - pleasing ploy , with politicians merely pretending to listen ?
Or is it a genuine attempt to engage with the world outside politics ?
Whichever it may be , if Angelina Jolie comes knocking in Westminster , do n't expect too many party leaders to reject her offer as quickly as Mr Prodi .
I 'm sure Bill O'Reilly will denounce this effort by one of Britain 's leading polling groups to get a handle on how much death and destruction Bush 's war has brought to the Iraqi people .
More than one million Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict in their country since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , according to research conducted by one of Britain 's leading polling groups .
The survey , conducted by Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) with 2,414 adults in face - to - face interviews , found that 20 percent of people had had at least one death in their household as a result of the conflict , rather than natural causes ... read on

As Walter Murch once said – “ Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level and enjoy it , but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and persistence that any art form does ” .
The editing in film often goes unnoticed .
However , if one does not notice the editing , then it is doing its job .
The editor works on the subconscious of the viewer , and controls “ the story , the music , the rhythm , the pace , shapes the actors ’ performances , ‘ re - directing ’ and often re-writing the film during the editing process , honing the infinite possibilities of the juxtaposition of small snippets of film into a creative , coherent , cohesive whole . ”
Wikipedia
10 . Cidade De Deux – City Of God
A brilliant use of jump cutting and cutting between two different sets of action .
This is incredibly technical editing at it ’s best .
It is particularly spectacular because it is at the very start of the film , as it has to introduce the main characters .
9. Platoon – Spoiler
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFjCEGPel_U
This very famous sequence in film is on the list because of the use of Adagio for Strings , a very slow moving piece of music , set to such fast and brutal action .
It uses such simple imagery and enhances it to incredible effect by using slow motion and close - ups sparingly .
8. One Flew Over The Cuckoo ’s Nest
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWKvIcfp16s
This sequence shows how the editor can slowly and subtly move the viewer into the scene .
Watch how the camera is cropped closer and closer to the characters between each take .
The editor also knows exactly who to cut to at any time , choosing to cut to McMurphy only to allow the viewers to ‘ breathe ’ during the intense argument .
7. Silence of the Lambs
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfrHehFzVtk
Again , an excellent example of how the editor can move closer to the faces of the characters .
In this famous scene , the camera starts at one side of the room , and ends up almost up the nose of Hannibal Lecter , finally deciding to go inside the bars of the cell to make Clarice seem vulnerable .
6. 12 Angry Men – Spoilers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYAuzs-AxXA
Sometimes the best editing is to just leave it alone .
This scene shows great editing by giving as much screen time to Lee J. Cobb ’s monologue .
However , the editor also works on the viewers subconscious , by showing him alone and isolated in the frame , whilst showing other juror ’s in pairs .
The editing also crops closer to him later in the scene , making it seem even more powerful and important .
5 . The Battleship Potemkin
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euG1y0KtP_Q
Absolutely revolutionary editing !
This scene , the famous baby carriage down the stairs scene , has been copied and spoofed numerous times , most notably in ‘ The Untouchables ’ .
It uses the simple technique of continually cutting to a baby carriage in danger , to build tension and create a sense of impending doom .
4. Raging Bull – Spoiler and violence
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvtOkDSZRA4
You ’ll have to ignore the strange commentary over this clip ( it was the only one YouTube had ) .
One of the most famous boxing scenes in film history .
It shows La Motta ’s isolation , despair and fragility from the world , as he becomes a man without hope .
The editing reflects this by including only the sound of cameras , and continually showing La Motta bouncing against the ropes in slow motion .
It also expertly moves between fast and slow cutting , to build the tension towards the final punch .
3. Saving Private Ryan – violence
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y1YL9C8Hfw
Simply incredible editing on a hugely technical scale .
This scene deserves its place on the list simply as a technical achievement by itself .
However , the editor manages to create fear against an unseen enemy .
He also borrows the same technique used in ‘ Raging Bull ' ( see above ) by moving between fast and slow cutting .
This is used on the beach when all war sounds are drained out and Tom Hanks looks hopelessly across the war - torn landscape .
2. The Insider
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_zky83BizQ
This is the kind of editing that you would never notice unless you were looking .
In this scene , the editor breaks the 180 - degree rule intentionally to create disorientation to the viewers ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180_degree_rule).
I have never seen this done to such great effect as it is done here .
It also cuts between the two characters effortlessly and moves closer to the characters to subconsciously involve the viewers .
1. The Conversation
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc2sNtH39bU
Here we go , undoubtedly in my opinion the greatest editing sequence ever put to film .
It parallels between two different conversations at once , one in the park and one in which Harry Caul listens to the audio and argues with his employee ( played by the late John Cazale ) .
The sequence involves phenomenal editing just to mix two different scenes into one without disrupting the flow .
It also comments on how Harry Caul will willingly spy on another person , but still try to respect their privacy .
The intruding eye of the flashback helps to counteract his morals , making him seem foolish and alone at the end of the scene .
Notable Omissions : Bullitt – the car chase , Marathon Man – torture scene , Traffic – end scene , A Clockwork Orange – fight scene , Heat – bank robbery .

The TSA is now tied with the IRS for least popular government agency in America , according to an AP poll .
They 're even less popular than FEMA — the bunglers who brought you the Hurricane Katrina disaster .
In 2007 , I spent many , many hours in TSA lines .
I went through dozens of secondary screenings .
I had toiletries stolen from me .
I had a TSA agent break a one - day - old , $ 400 camera at a checkpoint in September ( and then had the TSA 's insurer deny my claim on it ) .
The TSA also broke a watch of mine — dropped it during a swabbing ( Update :
It turns out the camera was broken by a private security staffer from CAS , the contractor at the SFO checkpoints ) .
The litany of TSA complaints laid out in the AP poll read like my travel diary since 2001 .
How does any of this make us safer ?
Take away our liquids , leave us with our laptop batteries .
Screen us before we get to the terminal — but leave hundreds of people bunched up in the security queue , in a handy , bomb - friendly knot .
Short of knocking us out and tying us up , they 're not going to render us harmless .
And , as one man wrote to the TSA : " Have terrorists succeeded in making us that scared of each other ? "
Take , for example , a mother and daughter traveling out of the Dallas / Fort Worth airport on Sept .
4 . In an e-mailed complaint to TSA , the mother said the TSA screener was rude and inconsiderate .
While she was in secondary screening , the mother was made to face away from her daughter .
" Someone could have taken my daughter , " the woman wrote .
" I understand you have to have security , but your people do n't need to be rude !!! "
On Sept. 3 , a man leaving Orlando , filed a lengthy complaint because he said a screener touched him " like no man ever has – not even my doctor . "
" This type of bodily inspection , privately or publicly , is undignified , " he wrote .
" Have terrorists succeeded in making us that scared of each other ? "
Nearly 9,000 such complaints flowed into TSA between January and October of this year , and the agency made a selection of them available at the request of The Associated Press .
Screeners are " just rigid , intransigent , inflexible , unpleasant , and they always have the fact that they 've got the security of the nation that they 're falling back on , " said David Stempler , president of the Air Travelers Association .
Stempler said he has no way of telling whether TSA has addressed any of the hundreds of complaints it receives each month .

Oxfam : 85 percent of the world is priced out of the drug industry 's market
While pharmaceutical companies are often portrayed as cunning entrepreneurs , they dont always make perfect business decisions .
So says Oxfam , whose new report suggests that drug firms are ignoring a potentially mammoth market by failing to make drugs affordable for people in the developing world .
To date , 85 percent of the world 's population is priced out of the industry 's market , the report says , and the anti-poverty charity suggests prices for essential medicines need to be tiered , in line with people 's ability to pay . 
" The industry is operating in a short - sighted way ,  Oxfam 's head of research Sumi Dhanarajan told the BBC , because it could gain enormous benefits from emerging markets , including lower development costs and cheaper manufacturing .
Yet instead it continues to blindly use the same strategies in poor countries . "
Many of the world 's biggest drug firms have done next to no research on illnesses that affect the worlds poor .
According to Oxfam ,  Between 1999 and 2004 , there were only three new drugs targeted at diseases affecting the developing world out of 163 drugs brought to market . 
Sick citizens of developing countries could certainly use the drugs .
One million people die of Malaria every year while 2 million people perish annually from TB .
Pharmaceutical companies contend that high prices are necessary to finance research and development , which accounts for billions of dollars a year .
" High taxes " and pharmacists and dispensing doctor mark - ups also push medicine prices higher , they suggest .

As the hopeless but energetic presidential campaign of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) builds momentum in name recognition , fundraising and cross-ideology appeal , media conservatives are beginning to attack Paul in earnest .
Republican consultant David Hill condemns the candidate ’s “ increasingly leftish ” positions .
Syndicated columnist Mona Charen calls Paul “ too cozy with kooks and conspiracy theorists . ”
Film critic and talk radio host Michael Medved looks over Paul ’s supporters and finds “ an imposing collection of neo - Nazis , white Supremacists , Holocaust deniers , 9/11 ‘ truthers ’ and other paranoid and discredited conspiracists . ”
For the most part , these allegations strike me as overblown and unfair .
But , for argument ’s sake , let ’s say they ’re not .
Let ’s even say that Paul has the passionate support of the Legion of Doom , that his campaign lunchroom looks like the “ Star Wars ” cantina , and that many of his top advisors actually have hooves .
Well , I would still find him less scary than Mike Huckabee .
While many are marveling at Paul ’s striking success at breaking out of the tinfoil - hat ghetto , Huckabee ’s story is even more remarkable .
The former Arkansas governor and Baptist minister is polling in second place in Iowa and could conceivably win there .
He ’s still a long shot to take the nomination and a pipe dream to take the presidency , but Huckabee matters in a way that Paul still does n’t .
One small indicator of Huckabee ’s relevance :
His opponents in the presidential race are attacking him while the field is ignoring Paul like an eccentric who sits too close to you on the bus .
Advertisement
So what ’s so scary about Huckabee ?
Personally , nothing .
By all accounts , he ’s a charming , decent , friendly , pious man .
What ’s troubling about The Man From Hope 2.0 is what he represents .
Huckabee represents compassionate conservatism on steroids .
A devout social conservative on issues such as abortion , school prayer , homosexuality and evolution , Huckabee is a populist on economics , a fad - follower on the environment and an all - around do - gooder who believes that the biblical obligation to do “ good works ” extends to using government -- and your tax dollars -- to bring us closer to the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth .
For example , Huckabee has indicated he would support a nationwide federal ban on public smoking .
Why ?
Because he ’s on a health kick , thinks smoking is bad and believes the government should do the right thing .
And therein lies the chief difference between Paul and Huckabee .
One is a culturally conservative libertarian .
The other is a right - wing progressive .
Advertisement
Whatever the faults of the man and his friends may or may not be , Paul ’s dogma generally renders them irrelevant .
He is a true ideologue in that his personal preferences are secondary to his philosophical principles .
When asked what his position is , he generally responds that his position can be deduced from the text of the Constitution .
Of course , that ’s not as dispositive as he thinks it is .
But you get the point .
As for Huckabee -- as with most politicians , alas -- his personal preferences matter enormously because ultimately they ’re the only thing that can be relied on to constrain him .
In this respect , Huckabee ’s philosophy is conventionally liberal , or progressive .
What he wants to do with government certainly differs in important respects from what Hillary Clinton would do , but the limits he would place on governmental do - goodery are primarily tactical or practical , not philosophical or constitutional .
This is n’t to say he -- or Hillary -- is a would - be tyrant , but simply to note that the progressive notion of the state as a loving , caring parent is becoming a bipartisan affair .
Indeed , Huckabee represents the latest attempt to make conservatism more popular by jettisoning the unpopular bits .
Contrary to the conventional belief that Republicans need to drop their opposition to abortion , gay marriage and the like in order to be popular , Huckabee understands that the unpopular stuff is the economic libertarianism : free trade and smaller government .
That ’s why we ’re seeing a rise in economic populism on the right coupled with a culturally conservative populism .
Huckabee is the bastard child of Lou Dobbs and Pat Robertson .
Advertisement
Historically , the conservative movement benefited from the tension between libertarianism and cultural traditionalism .
This tension -- and the effort to reconcile it under the name “ fusionism ” -- has been mischaracterized as a battle between right - wing factions when it is a conflict that runs through the heart of individual conservatives .
We all have little Mike Huckabees and Ron Pauls sitting on our shoulders .
Neither is always right , but both should be listened to .
I would not vote for Paul mostly because I think his foreign policy would be disastrous ( and because he ’d lose in a rout not seen since Bambi versus Godzilla ) .
But there ’s something weird going on when Paul , the small - government constitutionalist , is considered the extremist in the Republican Party while Huckabee , the statist , is the lovable underdog .
It ’s even weirder because it ’s probably true : Huckabee is much closer to the mainstream .
And that ’s what scares me about Huckabee and the mainstream alike .

US researchers have taken a leaf out of nature ’s book to develop a polymer - based system that can heal itself when it becomes damaged .
The material relies on an underlying network of vessels - similar to blood capillaries - that carry a healing agent to areas on the material ’s surface that become damaged .
Unlike previous self - healing systems that relied on capsules of agent buried in the polymer and which became depleted after one use , the new system can respond to damage at the same point many times over .
Nancy Sottos ’s team at the University of Illinois used a technique called direct - write to create an epoxy - resin base infused with a network of interconnected horizontal and vertical channels 200
m in diameter .
These channels were filled with low - viscosity , monomeric dicyclopentadiene - the healing agent .
A solid epoxy resin layer was deposited on top of the vascularised substrate .
Grubbs ’ catalyst , benzylidene - bis( tricyclohexylphosphine ) dichlororuthenium , was incorporated into this outer coating .
’ After damage occurs at the coating , healing agent wicks from the microchannels into the crack (s ) through capillary action , ’ the researchers report in the journal Nature Materials .
’ Once in the crack plane the healing agent interacts with the catalyst particles in the coating to initiate polymerisation , rebonding the crack faces autonomically .
After a sufficient time period the cracks are healed and the structural integrity of the coating restored .
As cracks reopen under subsequent loading the healing cycle is repeated . ’
The ability of the system to heal itself repeatedly is significant .
Previous work with self - healing systems involved the use of capsules of healing agent embedded within the polymer substrate .
These could only be used once before being spent .
The Illinois team likens the system to that found in nature .
’ Healing in biological systems is accomplished by a pervasive vascular network that supplies the necessary biochemical components , ’ they noted .
’ A cut in the skin triggers blood flow from the capillary network in the dermal layer to the wound site rapidly forming a clot .
Owing to the vascular nature of this supply system minor damage to the same area can be healed repeatedly . ’
Ian Bond , of the aerospace composites research group at the University of Bristol , UK , is impressed .
’ In the world of high - performance materials such as aerospace , where there are many safety - critical aspects , the idea of self - healing materials is very attractive if you can make it work , ’ Bond told Chemistry World .
’ This study moves the subject of self - healing forward into a situation where you can have repeated healing , something that has not been demonstrated up to this point . ’
The concept of ’ vascularising ’ a polymer substrate is also intriguing , he said .
’ This could lead to many more applications , such as thermal management .
The idea of a vascular network in these materials is very interesting in its own right . ’

A man cuts through a sausage in Germany in a file photo .
Staff at a German butcher 's shop were shocked to discover a customer had hidden two sex toys in their sausages for transport to Dubai , police said Wednesday .
REUTERS / Alex Grimm
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Staff at a German butcher ’s shop were shocked to discover a customer had hidden two sex toys in their sausages for transport to Dubai , police said Wednesday .
“ It was two latex dildos with a natural look , ” said a spokesman for police in the southwestern city of Mannheim .
After shopping there earlier in the day , the man , who spoke broken English , returned to the butcher ’s with two large “ Schwartenmagen ” sausages .
He asked a shop assistant to wrap and cool them until he departed for Dubai the next day .
But the assistant noticed the goods had got heavier and alerted police .
Officers discovered the man , who was about 50 , had removed some of the meat and packed the dildos inside .
“ He could have used a loaf of bread , ” the spokesman said .
“ It ’s not against the law here .
But obviously I ca n’t speculate on what customs in Dubai will have to say about it . ”
One of the oft - repeated mantras of those trying to prop up the official story of 9/11 is that " no one could have foreseen it " .
Is that true ?
According to MSNBC , " There have been a slew of reports over the past decade of plots to use planes to strike American targets " .
In 1994 , the government received information that international terrorists " had seriously considered the use of airplanes as a means of carrying out terrorist attacks " ( see also this article ) .
In 1998 , U.S. officials received reports concerning a " Bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New York and Washington , areas . "
Officials received reports that al Qaeda was trying to establish an operative cell in the United States and that bin Laden was attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training in conjunction with his plans to strike U.S. domestic targets .
Indeed , the report concluded that " a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive - laden plane . . . into the World Trade Center " .
A 1999 report for the National Intelligence Council warned that fanatics loyal to bin Laden might try to hijack a jetliner and fly it into the Pentagon ..

Saturn ’s moon Iapetus is one of the most mysterious objects in the Solar System .
It ’s shaped like a football , has a strange ridge that runs along most of its equator , and it ’s got vastly different hemispheres .
One side is as white as driven snow , and the other side is dark as tar .
Scientists think they ’ve at least got an answer for this last mystery .
Even before humans sent spacecraft to Saturn , astronomers have known there ’s something bizarre about Iapetus .
Its brightness changed significantly depending on its facing towards the Earth .
Follow up observations with spacecraft , like Voyager and Cassini showed that this was because half the moon is covered in snowy white material , while the other half is dark as night .
During its most recent flyby , NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft confirmed that Iapetus is warm enough on the dark side – 127 Kelvin ( - 230 F ) – that water vapour can slowly release from water ice .
This vapour then travels around the moon , and freezes back down onto the white side .
This process of vaporization and accumulation is called “ thermal segregation ” .
So where does the dark material come from ?
Astronomers think that it did n’t originate on Iapetus , but instead came from the surrounding outer moons .
As Iapetus goes around its orbit , this darker material piles up on the leading hemisphere .
The material heats up the surface of moon , allowing it to release the water vapour which then reforms on the other side .
Scientists describe this as a runaway process .
Once it got going , both hemispheres went to extremes .
The water completely boiled away from the dark side , and then accumulated on the bright side .
You do n’t see shades of grey , just black and white .
Thanks to Cassini ’s recent flyby , planetary geologists think they ’re getting a handle on the moon ’s strange football shape and the equatorial ridge too , but those will come with future research papers .

I 'm also interested in the use of computers in pre-college education ; I used to be a high school teacher , and was involved in the development of the Logo programming language .
More recently I 've been helping develop the Snap ! language ( see below ) .

Build Your Own Blocks ( a /k/a BYOB ) is an extended version of Scratch , a drag - and - drop programming language for kids from MIT .
I 've been working on it with Jens Mönig , adding higher order functions and true object inheritance for first - class sprites , to support an undergraduate - level introductory computer science course .
We have established such a course at Berkeley , and are working on spreading it to other colleges and high schools through teacher preparation and support efforts .
This project really excites me — sneaking the ideas of Scheme into the visual metaphor of Scratch ! ( at the right is λ. )
The Beauty and Joy of Computing is Berkeley 's computer science course for non-majors , and also , in somewhat different form , a high school CS course intended for a wide audience , including the kids who have not traditionally viewed themselves as CS nerds .
In addition to programming in Snap ! , it includes a strong component of the social implications of computing .
The high school version is being developed in collaboration with EDC , a nonprofit R&D company with long experience developing K - 12 curricula .
It is College Board endorsed as meeting the requirements for the new AP CS Principles exam .

Manual Scavenging : Nations Shame
By Sunil Kuksal
18 December , 2007
Combat Law
T he social , cultural and economic realities of modern India unfold a series of paradoxes .
While a parliamentary law bans the manual scavenging and the government approves projects to wean the underprivileged section away from this dehumanising occupation , cruel caste apartheid and brutalising poverty perpetuate the practice .
Furthermore , neo-liberal economic policies restrict alternative possibilities of having a dignified livelihood .
The term ‘ manual scavenging ’ describes the daily work of manually cleaning and removing human faeces from dry ( non-flush ) latrines across India .
Workers , mostly women and young boys , are also referred to as ‘ night soil workers ’ , a Victorian euphemism that hides the repugnance of the word ‘ shit ’ .
In India , manual scavenging is a caste - based occupation carried out by dalits .
The manual scavengers have different caste names in different parts of the country : bhangis in Gujarat , pakhis in Andhra Pradesh , and sikkaliars in Tamil Nadu .
These communities are invariably placed at the bottom of caste hierarchy , as well as of dalit sub - caste hierarchy .
Using a broom , a tin plate and a drum , they clear and carry human excreta from public and private latrines , more often on their heads , to dumping grounds and disposal sites .
Though considered illegal , manual scavenging is forced onto dalits by caste pressure .
Scavengers earn anywhere between Rs 20 to Rs 160 a month and are exposed to the most virulent forms of viral and bacterial infections that affect their skin , eyes , limbs , respiratory and gastrointestinal systems .
Official figures show that there are still 3.43 lakh scavengers in the country .
A 2002 report prepared by the International Dalit Solidarity Network , including Human Rights Watch ( United States ) , Navsarjan , ( Ahmedabad , Gujarat ) , and the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights ( NCDHR ) , gave estimates of one million dalit manual scavengers in India .
ActionAid India ’s random survey in 2002 of six states , Madhya Pradesh , Andhra Pradesh , Orissa , Uttar Pradesh , Rajasthan and Bihar , claimed that manual scavengers were found in at least 30,000 dry toilets .
The scavengers belong to the valmiki community and its sub-sects — badhai , charmkar , barguda and bherva .
The survey found that the scavengers face severe discrimination even from other dalits .
Teashop owners in some villages still keep separate , often broken , utensils to serve valmikis .
The national commission for safai karamcharis , a statutory body , pointed in its reports to the use of dry latrines and continued employment of manual scavengers by various departments of the Union of India , particularly the railways , the department of defence and the ministry of industry .
While states like Haryana deny employing manual scavengers , other states like Andhra Pradesh employ them through municipalities .
The practice is on in almost all states , including Bihar , Maharashtra , Jammu & Kashmir and even Delhi .
The Indian railways is one of the largest employers of manual scavengers .
Mahatma Gandhi raised the issue of the horrible working and social conditions of bhangis more than 100 years ago in 1901 at the Congress meeting in Bengal .
Yet it took about 90 years for the country to enact a uniform law abolishing manual scavenging .
The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines ( Prohibition ) Act , 1993 punishes the employment of scavengers or the construction of dry ( non-flush ) latrines with imprisonment for up to one year and / or a fine of Rs 2,000 .
Offenders are also liable to prosecution under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ( Prevention of Atrocities ) Act , 1989 .
This
Act to eradicate a pernicious practice that only dalits were subjected to , aims at restoring the dignity of the individual as enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution .
Given the high prevalence of the illegal practice , the government launched a national scheme in 1992 for identifying , training , and rehabilitating safai karamcharis and allotted substantial funds for this purpose .
However , only a handful of scavengers benefited , and the scheme ’s failure is evident in that there remain more than one million manual scavengers in India .
The Act , first enforced in Andhra Pradesh , Goa , Karnataka , Maharashtra , Tripura , West Bengal and all the union territories , made it obligatory to convert dry latrines into water - seal latrines ( pour - flush latrines ) .
It was expected that the other states would adopt the Act by passing an appropriate resolution in the legislature under Article 252 of the Constitution .
A petition filed in the Supreme Court in 2003 pointed out that the practice persists in many states of the country , and particularly in public sectors like the Indian railways .
The petitioners sought the enforcement of fundamental right of persons engaged in this practice guaranteed under Article 17 ( right against untouchability ) read with Articles 14 , 19 and 21 , that guarantee equality , freedom , and protection of life and personal liberty , respectively .
They urged the Supreme Court to issue time - bound directions to the Union of India and the various states to take effective steps to eliminate the practice of manual scavenging , and to formulate and implement comprehensive plans for rehabilitation of all persons employed as manual scavengers .
As the hearing of a public interest petition filed by the safai karamchari andolan , six associated organisations and seven individual manual scavengers , in the Supreme Court has revealed , the number of manual scavengers has increased from 5.88 lakhs in 1992 to 7.87 lakhs .
Unofficial surveys estimate that over 12 lakh manual scavengers , of whom 95 percent are dalits , are thrust with the task of this ‘ traditional occupation ’ .
They are considered untouchables by the higher castes and are caught in a vortex of severe social and economic exploitation .
During the recent hearing of the case the Supreme Court issued an interim order directing every department / ministry of central and state governments to file an affidavit within six months through a senior officer who would take personal responsibility for verifying the facts .
If the affidavit proclaims manual scavenging in a particular department , or public sector undertaking or corporation , then it should indicate a time - bound programme with targets for liberating and rehabilitating all manual scavengers .
The court warned the governments against making false statements in these affidavits .
The interim order was an expression of the court ’s impatience with dilatory and insensitive responses from various states and the Centre to the petition .
The railways , in its affidavit , admitted that there are approximately 30,000 passenger coaches fitted with open - discharge toilets .
The affidavit stated : “ A proposal to fit totally sealed toilet systems is also under consideration and various technologies , e.g. biological / vacuum / filtration , etc , shall be tried out .
However , no firm dates / time frame can be given for introduction of such system at this stage . ”
The railways claimed that without facilities to make platform tracks concrete and provide washable aprons at all important stations , on track manual scavenging cannot be eradicated .
The railways is perhaps the biggest violator of the Act ; yet none of the railway ministers has thought it necessary to allocate railway budget funds to implement the Act .
According to the national commission for safai karamcharis , progress “ has not been altogether satisfactory ” and benefited only “ a handful of these workers and their dependents .
One of the reasons for unsatisfactory progress of the scheme appears to be inadequate attention paid to it by the state governments and concerned agencies . ”
State governments often deny the claim and cite lack of water supply as preventing the construction of flush latrines .
This despite the sum of Rs 4,640 lakh ( US $ 116 million ) allocated to the scheme under the government ’s eighth five - year plan .
Activists claim that the resources , including government funds , for construction and rehabilitation exist ; what is lacking is political will .
Members of the national commission for safai karamcharis consider it imperative that the commission be “ vested with similar powers and facilities as are available to the national commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes . ”
Currently , the commission has only advisory powers and it has no authority to summon or monitor cases .
The political class has failed to exert any will in acknowledging the gravity of the situation and its own duty to eradicate it .
Even the central government pleaded lack of resources in failing to implement the law effectively .
The judiciary , however , has taken exception to the fact that money was squandered , but yet at the ground level there are no results .

I ’m loving all the swirling rumors and speculations , the secret extraction and youtubing .
But now that the game is out I will come clean and reveal the inside story .
I will avoid spoilers as much as possible here ( though you should not read the lyrics if you really want to be surprised ) .
The game is called Portal and it is awesome .
The song is called “ Still Alive ” and it plays as part of the end credits when you finish the game .
This all came about when a couple of Valve folks came to one of my shows in Seattle long ago , and followed up with me afterwards asking if I ’d be interested in working with them in some capacity .
I ’ve long been a fan of Half - Life , so I said yes yes yes .
We got together to talk about a couple of ideas , and somehow we decided it would be a good idea for me to write a song in the voice of one of the characters in the game , something that would sort of tie up the story arc at the end .
The character is this hilarious passive aggressive personality , which is obviously a perfect subject for me .
I write about that sort of thing all the time .
I got an advance copy of the game when it was nearly finished , played through it , talked with the writers , and tried to get inside this character ’s head as best I could .
I bought my first ukulele specifically to record this song , it just seemed right for it .
( Or maybe I wrote the song that way so I could buy a ukulele , hard to say . )
I recorded a version with some scratch vocals and we sent it to the voice actress who did that character in the game , Ellen McLain .
We all went into the studio to record her vocals , then did all the fancy computer sound things they do to make her sound like a computer voice .
Ellen ’s a classically trained soprano , and a very talented voice actress – she has this character down perfectly , and she did a great job conveying emotion in a non-emotional way .
Between her and the very strong writing behind her character ’s dialog , it was hard for me to not end up looking good in all this .
Did I mention the game is awesome ?
To answer some of your questions :
I believe that Valve has some plans on making this track officially available through Steam and perhaps elsewhere , also maybe a version with me singing the song .
I do n’t know when that will happen , but sometime soon I ’m sure .
It ’s really their ball game at this point , because they did commission this song from me .
I ’m not going to interfere with whatever they want to do with it , so I wo n’t be posting it here .
Lyrics and chords are below ( hooray ! ) .
Someday I or Valve may also want to make the source tracks available , but that ’s further down the line .
I have no sheet music , because that is not how the J - Dog rolls .
I ’m very happy to have been a part of this – the team of people behind the game , and indeed everyone I ’ve met at Valve are all such talented and creative people , and it was a privilege to work with them .
Long ago there was a Playstation game called Skullmonkeys that had a great soundtrack and this awesome song about a secret bonus room ( both written by a guy named Terry Scott Taylor ) that just blew my mind .
I ’ve always loved the way that song broke the rules about what music in a game is supposed to do , so it was great to have the opportunity to do something fun and unusual like that .
Thanks for all your kind comments about it .
The cake is a lie !!!!!

This was a triumph
I ’m making a note here : huge success
It ’s hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead
But there ’s no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive
I ’m not even angry
I ’m being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart and killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we ’re out of beta , we ’re releasing on time
So I ’m glad I got burned , think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I ’d prefer to stay inside
Maybe you ’ll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke , ha ha , fat chance
Anyway this cake is great
It ’s so delicious and moist
Look at me still talking when there ’s science to do
When I look out there it makes me glad I ’m not you
I ’ve experiments to run , there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive
And believe me I am still alive
I ’m doing science and I ’m still alive
I feel fantastic and I ’m still alive
And while you ’re dying I ’ll be still alive
And when you ’re dead I will be still alive
Still alive

Catholic League president slams Huckabee for ' subliminal ' cross ad David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday December 18 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee 's new Christmas - themed campaign ad -- which may or may not feature a subliminal cross image -- has found an unlikely critic in Catholic League president Bill Donahue .
The opening seconds of Hucakabee 's Christmas spot features the candidate seated in front of a window pane which appears to form the shape of the Christian cross .
Speaking in the ad , the former Arkansas governor tells viewers that " sometimes it 's nice to pull aside " from politics and " remember that what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ and being with our family and our friends . "
Donahue , the president of the Catholic League and an ardent defender of Christmas in what he believes is a secular " war " against the holiday , told hosts of the Fox and Friends morning program that the ad had gone too far .
" The whole idea is to give the appearance of a cross , " he said , " and this is just injecting religion into politics even too far for guys like me .
"
Asked if the ad was " too much , " Donahue said it was .
" Because there 's a pattern here , " he added .
" Every other word out of [ Huckabee 's ] mouth is that ' I'm Christian . '
He 's calling into question Romney 's Mormonism ... let people talk about there faith , but do n't sell it on your sleeve . "
Added Donahue , " Yeah , I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion , but do n't become a salesman .
Do n't hawk it like that on the street . "
The Catholic League president suggested that Huckabee was relying on his faith too heavily as a campaign tactic .
" If it was just the Christmas ad , I would n't have one complaint about it , " he said .
" But when you juxtapose that with all these other kinds of things , there 's a subliminal message there , and it's all done intentionally ... what he 's trying to say to the evangelicals in Western Iowa is ' I 'm the real thing . ' "
" You know what ? " concluded Donahue .
" Sell yourself on your issues , not on what your religion is . "

What 's in furniture ?
It 's enough to make you sick .
1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Laura Ingram rarely buys anything new , but last spring the 58 - year - old Oakland landlord sprang for 16 feet of new oak bookcases to line the walls of her backyard studio - office .
" There was no problem in the showroom , when I was standing there with huge stacks of shelves , " she said .
" But when the shelves arrived , they provoked such a violent allergic reaction in me after delivery that the vendor had to come and get them the next day and put them on a loading dock for three weeks to off - gas . "
The bookcases came back , and Ingram paid a carpenter to install them and a helper to move 35 boxes of books .
Still , her chest would hurt , her lips would swell , she'd get confused and feel as if she had the flu .
So the furniture sat in her yard for three more months while she waited for the chemical odor to dissipate .
It did n't .
The vendor finally returned Ingram 's money and took the bookcases away .
" This was my attempt to spiff up my environment , " Ingram said .
" Now , I 'd be extremely wary and want every certificate in the world . "
The problem for Ingram and others who are growing increasingly sensitized to indoor air pollutants is that the certificate does n't exist , and the furniture industry resists the notion of labeling its wares .
Consumers can read a list of the ingredients in their cornflakes and a summary of what nutrients they contain , but good luck trying to find out what 's in the new set of bedroom furniture we spend eight hours with every night .
The store owner concluded that it was some chemical in the lacquer that made Ingram sick .
Lacquers can contain high levels of solvents that release volatile organic compounds , or VOCs , that the American Lung Association reports can irritate eyes , skin and lungs and cause headaches , nausea and even liver and kidney damage .
Kirk Saunders , a finish specialist at EcoHome Improvement , guesses it was formaldehyde off - gassing from pressed wood .
Emissions from urea formaldehyde - " which is really , really bad for you , and is so ubiquitous in an urban environment , " Saunders said - can cause cancer " and other adverse health effects , " according to the California Air Resources Board .
If it had been a couch Ingram had bought , potential irritants would have multiplied .
The upholstery might have been treated for stain and water resistance with a finish containing more formaldehyde and also perfluorooctanoic acid , considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to be a likely human carcinogen .
It might have been dyed with chemicals including benzidine , a carcinogen , and filled with polyurethane foam made before 2006 and containing flame - retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers , which are now banned in California for their potential health effects .
The EPA has a list of 188 air toxics ( referred to by some as HAPs , hazardous air pollutants ) , and has assessed and classified 32 of those .
Benzene , a carcinogen that can emit knock - out fumes , is a solvent that has been commonly used for making resins , paints and dyes .
Ethylene oxide , a probable carcinogen that can also cause brain and nerve malfunctions , has been used in polyurethane foam and adhesives .
Hydrazine , a chemical used in textile dyes , is a probable carcinogen with a range of adverse health effects , and vinyl chloride , used in the making of some furniture , is a carcinogen that can cause liver damage with chronic exposure .
Furniture , the EPA 's " Introduction to Indoor Air Quality " states , can release pollutants " more or less continuously , " producing immediate effects such as eye , nose and throat irritation , headaches and dizziness that can be most intense right after the furniture comes off the assembly line and then seem to dissipate .
But even for those without immediate violent reactions such as Ingram 's , there can be long - term effects , such as respiratory and heart ailments and cancer .
" I might feel nothing now , but I might be at risk later of respiratory issues , cancer and so on , " said Carl Smith , CEO of Greenguard , which tests emissions from new products seven days after unwrapping them .
" You do n't get cancer just from walking into the room . "
" Only a small number of the 80,000 chemicals registered with the EPA have been tested for harmful effects , " said Rowena Finegan , owner of San Francisco 's Eco-terric ( a green home furnishings store ) and a specialist in Bau- biologie , the study of the effects of the built environment on human health .
" I 'm sure we all suffer from stuffed noses and achiness that 's all due to chemicals . "
It is possible to find furniture that is chemical free and made of all - natural material ; Finegan has partnered with Cisco Brothers to create residential furniture that uses only sustainable wood frames , pure latex foam and pure wool batting .
Natural Sense makes foam from tree sap .
Columbia Forest Products has replaced formaldehyde in its pressed - wood products with soy - based and cost - competitive PureBond , which could revolutionize the ubiquitous plywood and particleboard ( see your kitchen cabinets for examples and a Federal Emergency Management Agency trailer for extremes ) and even MDF , or medium - density fiberboard , which appears in many expensive pieces of furniture as a veneer because it tends to be less flawed than natural wood .
" We 're doing low - VOC lacquer , a low - fume urea formaldehyde , we 've made great strides in reducing formaldehydes , VOCs , HAPs , " said Bill Perdue , the vice president of environmental affairs , health , safety and standards for the American Home Furnishings Alliance .
" I guess part of what 's happened is we have not told our story very well . "
The High Point , N.C. , trade group launched its Enhancing Furniture 's Environmental Culture program in 1999 , prompted partly by increasing regulation ( much of it in California , much of it global ) and also by growing public awareness of environmental issues .
Now it is partnering on a new launch , the Sustainable Furniture Council , which has set out to establish an " eco-label " for furniture .
" We 're in the process of developing a hangtag that customers can see , " Perdue said .
" It 's been to the detriment of our industry that we have n't gotten the word out . "
The Sustainable Furniture Council , more than 100 members strong after only one year , announced its standards for certification at the High Point Furniture Market this month .
Meanwhile , two respected third - party standards , that of Green Seal and Greenguard , have zeroed in on components ( with Green Seal testing paints , adhesives and other materials used in the making of furniture ) and on office / contract furniture ( Greenguard is testing and certifying a long list of brands of furniture for meeting standards of VOCs , formaldehyde and other indoor air emissions ) .
" The residential furniture industry has been slow thus far adopting standards for indoor air quality , " said Smith of Greenguard .
" It is something that is very problematic for them - not so much for the cost of testing , but for the need to make changes in their formulations . "
Smith said that there are two ways a furniture - maker can receive Greenguard certification for a product that has exposed particleboard : Switch from formaldehyde to another ( " slightly more expensive " ) binder , or seal the particleboard in laminate or some other coating .
So far , architects shooting for high ratings from LEED ( that 's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , a certification program run by the U.S. Green Building Council ) have driven the office / contract furniture manufacturers to make changes ; of course there are also standards for school furniture , because children are considered at risk .
" But in the home , " Smith said , " furniture is one of the three or four things we should be most concerned about , " along with carpets , adhesives and paints .
Formaldehyde emissions levels have dropped in recent years - though try telling that to someone doing a kitchen or installing 13 feet of shelves .
The California Air Resources Board has taken aim at urea formaldehyde and established regulations that by 2012 " will set a standard for the entire world , " Perdue said .
He and his group succeeded in removing from the regulations a requirement that manufacturers test and label their furniture before sending it to retailers , but there will be third - party certification by the board .
" Woods shipped through California will be clearly marked , and the box you buy at Ikea should be clearly labeled , and everybody throughout the process will be held responsible for it , " said Dimitri Stanich , spokesman for the board , which adopted the new regulations in April and , barring an industry challenge , will begin implementing them in tiers starting in 2009 .
" Once these regulations are implemented , they will be the most health - protective in the country . "
" Phase 2 , " Perdue said , " will set a standard for the entire world .
I would anticipate that to meet Phase 2 compliance levels , we 'll have to move away from urea formaldehyde altogether . "
As to other chemicals , Perdue said , " We think down the road there may be some type of certification for residential furniture . "
He 's joined the U.S. Green Building Council 's committee developing LEED certification for residential furniture .
But , beyond certification and a stamp of approval , where is the label that merely lists the components of a product and lets the consumer make an informed choice about what to inhale from the breakfast table besides the cornflakes ?
" We 're where food was 15 or 20 years ago - now there are labels , " said Victoria Schomar , principal of the Green Built Environments design firm , who gave a design seminar at the San Francisco Furniture Mart 's Live Green , Live Well show last month .
" We 're not there yet with furniture . "
" Most furniture companies probably do n't know what 's in their furniture , " said Saunders of EcoHome Improvement .
Indeed , one furniture manufacturer said that although he upholsters and finishes his chairs locally , frames come from overseas , so he knows only how they are supposed to have been made .
Keith Parker , owner of the small , family - owned company where Ingram bought her bookcases , said the ones Ingram chose came from a firm in Southern California that he assumed used a " standard lacquer " of primarily acetone , which has been exempted by the EPA .
Said Finegan , " Those businesses that are involved in the healthy furnishings industry know what they are selling and are proud to be leading a very worthwhile cause .
I would suggest that you advise your readers to ask searching questions when they are buying furniture , and if the person they are addressing has n't a clue what they are talking about , they should go elsewhere . "
Perdue in part agreed .
" Do n't take the furniture home and then complain , " he said .
" Go to Levitz and say , ' I want furniture that 's low - VOC , low - HAPs , without UF . '
They can't go into the buying situation and then say , ' Oh , this furniture makes me sick . '
The companies that are retailers , you 'll be able to ask them those questions pretty soon and get good answers . "
( A Levitz spokeswoman was in contact via e-mail for this story but did not answer questions about the contents of the store 's furniture . )
Furniture manufacturers thus far would like to leave it up to the consumer to press for answers ; one salesperson said , " They did n't used to tell us what was in it because they did n't want us to know . "
" Historically , there has not been the concern or awareness that it needed to be disclosed , " said Greenguard 's Smith .
" But there was also not the awareness that it could make you sick .
Increasingly , people are becoming aware of that .
I think that over time , formulations and components will have to be disclosed . "
In the meantime , Ingram had an empty wall in her studio and decided , she said , to buy " something used that the poison has already seeped out of . "
So off she went to the Berkeley Outlet and found five rustic , 7 - foot - tall pine bookcases salvaged from Fantasy Records .
One more thing we do n't know :
There is no timeline for exactly how long a new piece of furniture containing formaldehyde or other potentially harmful chemicals continues to emit gases after the obvious smell has dissipated .
But shelves that once held music on vinyl should be a safe bet .
House calls
Do n't bother calling the doctor to ask for a prescription for furniture to breathe by .
But here are a few resources to help you shop :

Australia ’s telecommunications minister has announced that the country will be requiring ISPs to provide filtering tools for blocking pornography and other “ inappropriate ” material .
According to the report , anyone that wants uncensored Internet will still be able to opt - out of the state censors , and the government will not do anything that affects download speeds .
While some will undoubtedly argue this is a huge infringement of free speech , there are a few important differences between Australia ’s proposed policy and those of other countries like China and Iran , who arbitrarily block web sites from being used ( for some examples of how other countries censor the Web , check out our round up of the year in censorship ) .
Although Australia ’s policy basically gives the government the ability to determine what appropriate is content and what is n’t , the “ opt - out ” option is an important distinction .
It ’s similar to public libraries in the US , where filters are often present but can be overridden at your request .
On the other hand , the government could track those “ opt out ” requests , which does create privacy issues .
That said , it is still a fairly significant move when a Western - style democracy imposes censorship on Web access .
It could provide impetus for government officials in other parts of the world to say “ well , if Australia ’s doing it … ” and usher in an era of government controlled Web access , which , is n’t in most people ’s best interest .
The important thing to track in Australia ’s case will be what ultimately constitutes “ inappropriate ” content .
If the country starts using filters to silence opposing views , then it is no better than China , but if it simply blocks out child pornography and articles on how to create bio-chemical weapons and the like ( and , still lets those that seek out that sort of content get it if they request it ) , then there is no great foul here .

Claim : Santa ’s ‘ Ho Ho Ho ’ has been changed to ‘ Ha Ha Ha ’ in Australia because women felt insulted by the original phrase .
Status : False .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , November 2007 ]
SYDNEY ( AFP ) – Santas in Australia ’s largest city have been told not to use Father Christmas ’s traditional “ ho ho ho ” greeting because it may be offensive to women , it was reported Thursday .
SYDNEY ( AFP ) – Santas in Australia ’s largest city have been told not to use Father Christmas ’s traditional “ ho ho ho ” greeting because it may be offensive to women , it was reported Thursday .
Sydney ’s Santa Clauses have instead been instructed to say “ ha ha ha ” instead , the Daily Telegraph reported .
One disgruntled Santa told the newspaper a recruitment firm warned him not to use “ ho ho ho ” because it could frighten children and was too close to “ ho ” , a US slang term for prostitute . ”
Origins :
In November 2007 a news story emerged out of Australia that left many with the impression that Santas in that country had been issued a prohibition against saying “ Ho ho ho ! ” because that catchphrase had been deemed demeaning to women .
Reportings in the U.S. focused on this being yet another instance of political correctness carried too far , yet a more careful reading of the news accounts coming out of Australia showed that Santas - in - training were being advised to alter their greeting for a quite different
reason .
While indeed thirty trainees at a Santa course held by a recruitment company had been urged to use “ Ha ha ha ! ” in place of the traditional festive greeting associated with Saint Nick in some cases , the reason for doing so had little to do with associations to an American slang term for prostitutes .
Instead , those taking the course were advised that sometimes small children could be inadvertently frightened by a booming “ Ho ho ho ! ” and so come away from the experience of getting to meet Santa more scared than delighted .
To keep that from happening , prospective Santas were advised by those running the training sessions to keep their voices down around nervous tots .
A Westaff , the training company that had proffered the advice to its trainees , issued the following statement regarding the hornet ’s nest of opinion it had stirred up :
Westaff Santa - Ho -Ho-Ho Statement and FAQ Santa Statement from the Company Westaff does not ‘ ha , ha , ha’ at Santas saying ‘ ho , ho , ho . ’
We take our responsibility to provide friendly , caring Santas to our clients seriously .
One of the main reasons Westaff Santas have been putting smiles on children ’s faces for more than 40 years is that each Santa is trained to be sensitive to a child ’s needs .
Training includes a discussion of how to help a child feel more comfortable when visiting Santa .
Among the advice we give our Santas to ease children ’s fears is to lower their tone of voice .
This advice is merely a guideline and each Santa is asked to assess children ’s reactions and act accordingly , including saying ‘ ho , ho , ho ’ .

Was that a factor in instructing Santas not to use “ ho , ho , ho ” ?
Westaff Santas were not instructed to eliminate “ ho , ho , ho ” from their greetings .
Westaff Santas were simply provided with ideas on how to be sensitive to children , especially those who may appear uncomfortable by Santa .
In December 2007 another news story emerging from Australia at first blush appeared to add credence to the “ Santas barred from saying ‘ Ho ho ho ! ' ” tale .
But once again , more careful reading of the news item showed that there was more to the matter than merely the sensationalistic headlines slapped onto the piece .
A 70 - year - old man named John Oakes , who worked as a Santa in an Australian department store , asserted he had been fired for saying “ Ho ho ho ! ” and singing Christmas songs to children .
His claim was disputed , however , by Westaff , who said Oakes had been dismissed because of his poor attitude toward the job and not for his ho ho ho-ing .
Santas in Australia continue to “ Ho ho ho , ” which works to undermine the claim that they ’re being fired for sticking to the traditional greeting .

New York police shoot down disturbed youth — thought hairbrush was a gun
By Bill Van Auken
15 November 2007
In the wake of another brutal police shooting of an unarmed individual , New York City officials and sections of the mass media have rushed to exonerate the cops involved and contain popular anger in one of the city ’s more impoverished neighborhoods .
The victim in the shooting incident Monday night was 18 - year - old Khiel Coppin , a Trinidadian immigrant with a history of mental problems .
His mother had called 911 seeking assistance after her son had become unruly inside her apartment .
Instead of help , however , she got a police firing squad that unleashed a hail of 20 bullets at Khiel within 14 minutes of arriving on the scene .
He was struck by 10 of the bullets , 2 of which ripped through his lung and intestines , killing him .
The police on the scene said that they believed the youth was armed , but what they said they thought was a gun turned out to be only a hairbrush .
Less than 24 hours after the killing , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly called a press conference at One Police Plaza to announce that the five police officers who opened fire appeared to have been acting “ within department guidelines , as officers fired at someone they reasonably believed to be about to use deadly force against them . ”
He claimed that a number of eyewitnesses had corroborated the cops ’ contention that the 18 - year - old had ignored their orders to halt and had lunged at them with a dark object .
Some police officials have suggested that the incident can be chalked up to “ suicide by cop , ” a rationalization of the killing that was echoed dutifully by an editorial in Rupert Murdoch ’s New York Post Wednesday .
Acknowledging that “ few situations are as potentially inflammatory as a police shooting of a young , unarmed civilian , ” the Post assures its readers that the incident “ sounds an awful lot like ‘ suicide by cop , ’ where the troubled victim deliberately provokes a confrontation that ends in police gunfire . ”
It concludes with a warning that “ there may yet be an attempt to exploit the tragedy . ”
In fact , the fatal shooting has already sparked anger in the streets of Bedford - Stuyvesant , where neighbors have held candlelight vigils and angry residents have marched on the 79th Precinct stationhouse .
Both Khiel ’s family and some who witnessed the killing have disputed the police version of events .
“ Sometimes things do n’t go the way we want them to , and sometimes we handle things wrong , ” said Reginald Owens , the boy ’s stepfather .
“ But the most important thing is that when you are trained , when you have the authority under you of the law to go out and execute the law , you should do that , but without killing somebody .
He did n’t have to be killed . ”
One neighbor dismissed the department ’s defense of the cops in an interview with NY1 news television .
“ They always think they have good reason , ” he said .
“ Then the mayor backs them up , the governor backs them up .
There is no good reason to open fire on a teenager the way they did . ”
In particular , the family objected to the NYPD ’s self - serving use of an audiotape of the 911 call made by Khiel ’s mother , Denise Owens , in which the youth could be heard in the background yelling , “ I ’ve got a gun . ”
In fact , in a second telephone conversation with 911 , Ms. Owens made it clear that he was not armed .
She also told a police captain in charge of the squad that showed up at her door the same thing .
Some eyewitnesses told the press that , while Khiel did not comply with police orders to halt and get down on the ground , when they told him to put up his hand , he did so and dropped the hairbrush .
It was after that , they said , that the cops opened fire .
They also said that one of the officers shouted out for the others to stop shooting .
Ms. Owens ’s call to the police came after she had called the psychiatric mobile crisis team at Interfaith Medical Center to seek help for her son , who was not taking prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-depressant drugs .
One of the hospital ’s psych teams came to the Brooklyn apartment , but the youth had gone out .
About a half hour after the team had left , Khiel returned and , desperate over his deteriorating mental state , his mother called 911 .
The killing in Bedford - Stuyvesant recalls earlier killings — like that of Sean Bell a year ago and that of Amadou Diallo in 1999 — in which New York police have rained bullets down upon unarmed men .
In the Diallo case , officers of the since - disbanded Street Crimes Unit claimed that they thought a wallet that the African immigrant was taking out to show his identification was a gun .
Nor is Khiel Coppin by any means the first emotionally disturbed person to be shot down by police rather than rendered needed medical assistance .
In 1999 , Gidone Busch , a 31 - year - old man with a long history of mental problems , was killed by cops in the orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park , prompting angry demonstrations .
The claim that the police in this case were operating within “ department guidelines ” may well prove legally defensible .
Both the NYPD and the Brooklyn District Attorney ’s Office are conducting investigations of the killing , but it is highly unlikely that any of the cops involved will be criminally prosecuted .
The real issue in this incident and the many others that have preceded it are the social and political imperatives that ultimately determine the methods of the NYPD , the largest police department in the United States .
The principal function of this force of 35,000 armed personnel is to police what is the starkest social divide in America , maintaining the status quo in a city in which the wealthiest 20 percent of the population boasts incomes that are 52 times those of New Yorkers in the bottom 20 percent .
It is a city that is home to the greatest concentration of multimillionaires and billionaires in the country , and in which a record 9,300 families sleep in the city ’s homeless shelters each night .
Under these conditions , the police carry out relentless enforcement against the poorest section of the population , while protecting the power and privileges of the wealthiest .
According to the NYPD ’s own figures , last year New York cops stopped and frisked more than half a million people — 90 percent of whom were not engaged in any unlawful activity at the time .
Some 86 percent of those stopped were either black or Hispanic .
Complaints of police brutality and abuse , meanwhile , have risen sharply in the past several years .
In the first 10 months of this year , they were up 18.4 percent over the same period of 2006 , reaching 21,341 separate complaints .
Of these , 6,390 were for excessive force , while 11,290 were over abuses of authority .
In the poorest neighborhoods of the city , the police force serves as a virtual occupying force , maintaining the status quo and inevitably arousing hostility .
Under these conditions , fear and brutality are inevitable byproducts .
The gunning down of an 18 - year - old with serious mental problems also underscores the acute crisis that exists in America relating to the treatment of the seriously mentally ill , in which particularly those without financial resources are relegated to the prisons and delivered into the hands of the police .
As part of the elaborate presentation that the police commissioner put on Tuesday to defend the actions of the officers involved in the shooting , several pieces of paper with notes jotted down by the murdered youth were presented to the media , apparently with the aim of showing that he was bent on taking his own life .
His mother told a reporter that in addition to enjoying basketball and music , Khiel also liked to draw and to write poems and short stories .
“ Those closest 2 death iz closer to happiness , ” one note read .
“ Truly that ’s why more bums smile than millionaires . ”
The Value of Privacy
Last week , revelation of yet another NSA surveillance effort against the American people has rekindled the privacy debate .
Those in favor of these programs have trotted out the same rhetorical question we hear every time privacy advocates oppose ID checks , video cameras , massive databases , data mining , and other wholesale surveillance measures : “ If you are n’t doing anything wrong , what do you have to hide ? ”
Some clever answers : “ If I ’m not doing anything wrong , then you have no cause to watch me . ”
“ Because the government gets to define what ’s wrong , and they keep changing the definition . ”
“ Because you might do something wrong with my information . ”
My problem with quips like these — as right as they are — is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong .
It ’s not .
Privacy is an inherent human right , and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect .
Two proverbs say it best : Quis custodiet custodes ipsos ?
( “ Who watches the watchers ? ” ) and “ Absolute power corrupts absolutely . ”
Cardinal Richelieu understood the value of surveillance when he famously said , “ If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man , I would find something in them to have him hanged . ”
Watch someone long enough , and you ’ll find something to arrest — or just blackmail — with .
Privacy is important because without it , surveillance information will be abused : to peep , to sell to marketers and to spy on political enemies — whoever they happen to be at the time .
Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power , even if we ’re doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance .
We do nothing wrong when we make love or go to the bathroom .
We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation .
We keep private journals , sing in the privacy of the shower , and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them .
Privacy is a basic human need .
A future in which privacy would face constant assault was so alien to the framers of the Constitution that it never occurred to them to call out privacy as an explicit right .
Privacy was inherent to the nobility of their being and their cause .
Of course being watched in your own home was unreasonable .
Watching at all was an act so unseemly as to be inconceivable among gentlemen in their day .
You watched convicted criminals , not free citizens .
You ruled your own home .
It ’s intrinsic to the concept of liberty .
For if we are observed in all matters , we are constantly under threat of correction , judgment , criticism , even plagiarism of our own uniqueness .
We become children , fettered under watchful eyes , constantly fearful that — either now or in the uncertain future — patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us , by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once - private and innocent acts .
We lose our individuality , because everything we do is observable and recordable .
How many of us have paused during conversation in the past four - and - a - half years , suddenly aware that we might be eavesdropped on ?
Probably it was a phone conversation , although maybe it was an e-mail or instant - message exchange or a conversation in a public place .
Maybe the topic was terrorism , or politics , or Islam .
We stop suddenly , momentarily afraid that our words might be taken out of context , then we laugh at our paranoia and go on .
But our demeanor has changed , and our words are subtly altered .
This is the loss of freedom we face when our privacy is taken from us .
This is life in former East Germany , or life in Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
And it ’s our future as we allow an ever - intrusive eye into our personal , private lives .
Too many wrongly characterize the debate as “ security versus privacy . ”
The real choice is liberty versus control .
Tyranny , whether it arises under threat of foreign physical attack or under constant domestic authoritative scrutiny , is still tyranny .
Liberty requires security without intrusion , security plus privacy .
Widespread police surveillance is the very definition of a police state .
And that ’s why we should champion privacy even when we have nothing to hide .

EDITED TO ADD ( 5/24 ) : Daniel Solove comments .

Deep in the woods near Brushy Creek stands an old beech tree , its smooth bark etched with dozens of carvings , including biblical references , a heart and a legless horse .
Bob Brewer was 10 when his great - uncle , W.D. “ Grandpa ” Ashcraft , pointed it out on a logging trip 57 years ago .
“ He said , ‘ Boy , you see that tree ?
That ’s a treasure tree , ’ ” Brewer recalled on a recent visit to the site .
“ ‘ You see that writing ?
If you can figure out what that is , you ’ll find some gold . ’ ”
The old man did n’t elaborate , but his words stuck with Brewer through childhood and two tours of duty in Vietnam as a Navy helicopter crewman .
So did memories of Grandpa ’s frequent , unexplained horseback rides into the nearby Ouachita Mountains .
In 1977 , after retiring from the Navy , Brewer returned to western Arkansas and took up an obsessive search -- for buried treasure , and for his family ’s links to a secretive , subversive Confederate group , the Knights of the Golden Circle , or KGC .
After many years of research , he is among those who believe that the group buried millions in ill - gotten gold across a dozen states , to finance a second Civil War that never came to be .
And he thinks Ashcraft and his son , Odis , had something to do with it .
“ I think Grandpa Ashcraft and Uncle Ode had a secret , ” Brewer says .
A similar theme will play out on the big screen Dec. 21 , when Nicolas Cage returns as code - breaking treasure hunter Ben Gates in “ National Treasure : Book of Secrets , ” a sequel to Disney ’s 2004 hit .
Brewer is a consultant on the film .
But although Cage ’s character searches for Confederate gold and his ancestral ties to the Lincoln assassination , Brewer ’s journey shows , once again , that real life can be stranger than fiction -- or at least as intriguing .
Steeped in the history of the South and the West , his quest is haunted by the legend of Jesse James and imbued with the mysterious stuff of Freemasonry , coded treasure maps and conspiracy theories dating to John Wilkes Booth .
Along the way , Brewer says , he has unearthed about $ 200,000 worth of gold and silver coins .
It ’s enough to support his modest lifestyle , and to thumb his nose at those who might think he ’s just another old coot with a metal detector .
“ It ’s my damn story , ” he says , “ and if they do n’t believe it I ’m not gonna worry about it , damn it .
Pardon my French . ”
Brewer ’s life is detailed in “ Shadow of the Sentinel : One Man ’s Quest to Find the Hidden Treasure of the Confederacy , ” a book he wrote with Warren Getler , a former Wall Street Journal reporter .
The authors say their 2003 book , reissued in paperback as “ Rebel Gold , ” sheds new light on the hidden history of the KGC , even as it lays out Brewer ’s efforts to trace his familial connections to the group and crack the code behind its legendary “ depositories . ”
Having found smaller coin caches , Brewer says he ’s now on to “ a big , big one ” in Oklahoma -- big enough to more than validate his 30 - year search .
“ It was supposed to have been $ 2 million when it was buried , ” he says .
“ We figure it ’s about 80 times that face value . ”
The hunt that brought Brewer to this point began in earnest after he retired from the Navy in 1977 and started spending time at a Hatfield coffee shop , where talk often turned to treasure - hunting .
Some spoke of “ Spanish treasure signs , ” similar to the markings his great - uncle had shown him .
Spaniard Hernando de Soto had explored the nearby mountains in 1541 and local legend held that he stashed gold there .
Over time , Brewer came to doubt the Spanish angle , but linked what his forebears had told him to what he was hearing in town .
He sketched the symbols others described , tracked them down when he could and plotted them on topographical maps .
During a stint as a state inspector of beekeepers , he explored remote areas of the forest and found more carvings on trees and rock faces .
Many were recurring symbols : snakes , turtles , crescent moons , crosses , numbers and letters with odd flourishes .
Brewer figured they were cryptic indicators of distance and direction , clues to buried riches .
By mapping them , Brewer surmised that they ran along lines that might extend for miles as part of a larger “ treasure grid . ”
Tracing the lines with a metal detector , he says , he learned to systematically find buried clues , one leading to the next , everything from gun barrels to farming implements to milk can lids .
If that sounds far - fetched , it did also to some of the 400 or so residents of Hatfield , including Brewer ’s wife , Linda .
“ A lot of her friends , and even my own family , were telling her , ‘ You better watch Bob because he ’s going off the deep end , ’ ” Brewer says .
“ She was beginning to believe it , too . ”
But Brewer persisted , and concluded that clues could be found not only in carvings on trees but also in the trees ’ shape .
Some appeared to have been contorted as saplings , or had oddly grafted limbs that caused them to grow into unusual shapes and directional pointers .
Following a line from one such “ hoot owl tree , ” Brewer says , he found the carved beech that Grandpa Ashcraft had shown him several decades earlier .
He studied its symbols , “ walked the lines ” radiating from them and found buried horseshoes and other clues that led to his first cache in 1991 -- a canning jar filled with gold and silver coins from the 1800s , their $ 400 face value a fraction of their actual worth .
Brewer says he was “ stunned ” by the find , in the forest about 10 miles from his home .
“ I was totally wiped out for a couple of days and could n’t sleep for a couple of nights , ” he says .
“ I thought I had it all figured out and I ’d be rich within a week .
I was a little wrong about that . ”
The Brewers made a video about the carved beech , dubbed the “ Bible Tree ” for etchings such as “ 1st Thess 3:2 , ” an apparent reference to First Thessalonians .
It was a hit at treasure - hunting shows , and Brewer soon was trading stories and information with others who shared his esoteric interest .
In 1993 , one of them showed Brewer a book about Jesse James , with passages about the Knights of the Golden Circle , buried Confederate treasure and cryptic symbols .
Founded in the 1850s by George Bickley , a former Virginian living in Cincinnati , the group was reputed to include prominent political figures and Confederate leaders , among them Gen. Albert Pike , a high - ranking member of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry .
One of the things that led Brewer to link his family to the KGC were “ Pike ” carvings he ’d seen on trees .
Another was Grandpa Ashcraft ’s mysterious , daylong rides into the woods .
Sometimes his great - uncle told him he ’d been hunting “ cows , ” says Brewer , who only much later learned it might have been short for “ cowan , ” a Masonic term of contempt for intruders .
Grandpa had shown him where one was buried amid the pines and hardwoods .
“ He said the man got in here , got to messing around and putting his nose where he should n’t have , and got himself killed , " he says .
Eventually , Brewer concluded that Grandpa and Uncle Ode were part of a generations - old network of “ sentinels ” who watched over caches of KGC money .
Much of it came from government - payroll holdups and train robberies , according to Brewer and others who say Jesse James was a leader and benefactor of the group .
Ceci Gillespie thinks some of the loot wound up on a chunk of property she and her sister own in Wapanucka , Okla . , about 100 miles southeast of Oklahoma City .
“ We ’ve had at least 10 people show up with the same idea , that Jesse James buried treasure there , ” Gillespie says , starting with an 87 - year - old man who greeted her with a “ treasure map and his ‘ list of reliable facts ’ ” some 20 years ago .
In the mid-1990s came Brewer , teamed with an Oklahoma schoolteacher who also had a Jesse James treasure map .
In the area , they found a jar of silver coins dated 1812 to 1880 , Brewer says , but their hunt was cut short when the sisters booted them from the property .
Brewer says the teacher doubled back without him and found another cache of gold coins .
The man might later have struck it even richer , according to a 1995 story in the Daily Oklahoman , which said he ’d “ unearthed a Wells Fargo safe full of gold coins ” at an undisclosed location .
If it was from her property , Gillespie says , she ’s never gotten any of it , though she is convinced that millions in gold are still stashed there .
Robert Smith , a University of Oklahoma law professor who has written at length about Jesse James and other American outlaws , dismisses stories of huge treasure troves .
“ I know very little about the Knights of the Golden Circle or whether such an organization even existed , ” he says .
“ But my own feeling is this stuff about buried gold , as far as Jesse James is concerned , is nonsense . ”
James M. McPherson , a Pulitzer Prize - winning Civil War historian and a professor emeritus at Princeton University , has his own doubts about the group ’s reach .
“ There certainly was an organization called the Knights of the Golden Circle , ” McPherson allows , noting the group sought to spread slavery by annexing territory in Mexico and the Caribbean in the years before the Civil War .
But once the war began , “ the story becomes pretty shadowy , ” he says .
“ My guess is that as the war went on , its reality kind of shaded over into myth , ” he says .
Brewer ’s co-author Getler , who met Brewer in 1998 and spent five years with him in the field and on a lengthy paper chase , counters that “ we dug a lot deeper ” into the group than anyone before .
“ The Knights of the Golden Circle were a much more powerful organization than history gives credit to , ” Getler says .
At the National Archives in Washington , he and Brewer scoured files and rare - book collections , finding the personal prayer book of KGC founder Bickley , who in 1863 was arrested as a spy but never charged , and died in 1867 .
Inside the book was a hand - written key to the group ’s code .
The pair interviewed descendants of members , searched the Library of Congress for relevant writings and pored over the archives of the Pinkerton detective agency , which had pursued James .
Their search of an online database yielded illuminating articles from newspapers , magazines and journals dating to the 1800s , and at Georgetown University Library they found works on Booth .
They concluded Booth was either a KGC member or was helped by the group while on the run after shooting President Lincoln at Ford ’s Theater on April 14 , 1865 .
“ No one can be sure , ” Getler says , “ but we are pretty confident that the KGC , the most powerful subversive group that ever existed in the United States , was very involved in the assassination of Lincoln . ”
He ’s also confident that Brewer is on to something very real .
“ This is not crop circles , ” he says .
Brewer ’s quest has taken him from Arkansas to Georgia to Arizona and back to Oklahoma , where he and two partners have zeroed in on a site more than 100 miles from the Gillespies ’ land .
Like other treasure hunters , they are cagey when discussing their work , loath to let slip too many details about exactly where and what they ’re doing .
They say the Oklahoma search got held up by summer rains and flooding , which produced four - foot - high grass .
It ’s crawling with snakes and too high to work in with metal detectors , they say , and hiring someone to mow it would draw too much attention .
Others might be watching and could beat them to the gold .
Brewer is willing to wait it out .
“ We know where it ’s at now , ” he says .
“ All we have to do is put our detectors over it and we ’ll find it . ”
In some areas , treasure hunting is banned by law or requires permission from private property owners , or state and federal agencies that oversee public lands .
At the Oklahoma site , Brewer and his partners have a contract with the owner .
“ We do n’t ever go anywhere without permission -- period , ” says John London , 63 , an Amarillo , Texas , electrician and satellite dish installer working with Brewer .
“ There are no ifs ands or buts about it , and if you do n’t get it , the ‘ butt ’ will be yours . ”
Along with metal detectors , global positioning devices and laptop computers with mapping software , London ’s treasure - hunting tools include dowsing wands and an “ information rod ” made from an old rabbit - ears TV antenna with a silver dollar riveted onto it .
He insists it works , but says he has n’t had to rely on it in Oklahoma .
“ This is pure KGC research that has brought this stuff up , ” he says .
Another partner , Jim Weaver , a 63 - year - old window and siding salesman from Hutchinson , Kan. , credits Brewer ’s “ unique ability ” to decipher symbols and find clues .
“ You can say it ’s a gift .
You can say it ’s genetic , ” Weaver says .
“ I do n’t know what it is , but Bob really has discovered something remarkable . ”
He says he ’s seen evidence “ beyond any possible shadow of a doubt ” in Oklahoma .
“ If we bring this thing to the conclusion we anticipate , ” he says , “ it will be mind - boggling . ”
If he does hit it big , Brewer says , it wo n’t change his life much .
He has all he needs : a good family , enough money to pay his bills , a nice house on a patch of land where he can step out his front door and shoot deer and wild turkey all day long .
Mostly , he just wants to finish his life ’s work .
“ Sometimes I wish I had never started it , ” he says .
“ But I was always good at puzzles and when I set my mind to doing something , I do it . ”

Recently a new video game came out called Portal .
You may have heard of it .
Many of the Something Awful Forum Goons not only heard about it , but actually played it .
The Goons , increasingly unable to handle the rigors of modern life and horrifyingly dependent on escapist fanfare , liked the game so much that they decided to apply its principles ( sometimes incorrectly ) to real life .
This is how they think with portals .
bitreaper proved his mettle by making this image , and through a complex series of events , start this theme .
Sure everything looks happy in this pipes !
pictures , but in an hour that slide will be coated with vomit .
Hello
Pity wants the good times to roll and not stop rolling .
Crun is nothing without his childlike naiveté .
bitreaper lives in an empty apartment bereft of furniture , decorations , and humanity .
LIKE many flights , the use of mobile phones on aircraft has been subject to unexpected delays .
But some passengers , at least , are now sending text messages and e-mails , and soon an Air France plane will go further .
Once it has reached its cruising altitude , its “ fasten seatbelt ” sign will be switched off — and so will a new “ no phones ” light alongside it .
Passengers will then be able to switch on their handsets and make and receive calls .
Airlines are unsure what passengers will make of this .
Surveys have found that many people are vehemently against the idea , but others say they would welcome the opportunity to text , access the internet or make calls .
So airlines plan to test the market before deciding how and when to allow phones to be used in the air .
This week JetBlue , a low - cost carrier based in New York , launched a free but limited Wi -Fi data service on one of its Airbus A320 aircraft , in partnership with Yahoo ! , an internet giant , and Research in Motion , the maker of the BlackBerry .
Passengers using Wi-Fi-enabled laptops can use Yahoo !'s mail and instant - messaging services ; those with Wi-Fi-capable BlackBerrys can get their e-mail .
( The system uses a national network of special ground stations to provide connectivity . )
There is no support for voice calls , following the Federal Communications Commission 's decision in March that the in - flight use of mobile phones would not be permitted .
But in other parts of the world , voice calling will be allowed .
Air France 's test will begin on an Airbus A318 in the next few weeks .
Rather than Wi -Fi , it relies on a tiny mobile - phone base - station installed on the plane .
At first it will allow only mobile - data access and text messaging , but after three months the voice service will be switched on , too .
“ We will give a questionnaire to every passenger to see what they think before we make a decision to equip more aircraft , ” says Marina Tymen of Air France .
“ If people say they want data but no calls , that will not be a problem . ”
Data could prove to be popular because it is less intrusive than voice calls .
Qantas , Australia 's flag carrier , has quietly been trying out a data - only service on one of its Boeing 767s .
Since it was installed in April , some 19,000 passengers have used mobile devices for texting and e-mails , says AeroMobile , the British firm that supplied the system .
More airlines will join in during 2008 .
AeroMobile is fitting out an Emirates aircraft for data and voice .
Ryanair 's aircraft are being kitted out by OnAir , a rival technology provider that supplied the Air France system and is backed by Airbus .
As Europe 's pushiest low - cost carrier , Ryanair thinks passengers on its short , busy flights will not mind texting and calls , because the money it raises will help keep fares low ( callers will be billed at international roaming rates , with airlines taking a cut ) .
It plans to equip all 150 of its aircraft .
Passengers will still have to keep their phones switched off during take - off and landing .
This is to reduce the risk of interference with aircraft instruments — though the main reason why the use of mobiles has hitherto been banned on aircraft is , in fact , to avoid disruption of networks on the ground as lots of handsets pass overhead at high speed .
New systems get around this problem by blocking out ground - based signals within the aircraft , so that phones connect to the on - board “ picocell ” instead .
This is then linked by satellite to ground - based networks .
Satellite links have the advantage that they will work even over oceans .
The equipment is also much lighter and cheaper than an elaborate earlier generation of satellite technology , which provided Wi -Fi access on some aircraft , but was never widely adopted .
Now that the technology works , it is up to passengers and airlines to decide the rules governing its use .
Will data prove most popular , with voice access limited to short - haul flights and brief periods at the start and end of long - haul flights ?
You make the call .
People had to decide whether to keep money , or give it away
A total of 203 people took part in an online task in which they could either keep or give away money .
Gene tests revealed those who had certain variants of a gene called AVPR1a were on average nearly 50 % more likely to give money away .
The study , by The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , appears online in the journal Genes , Brain and Behavior .
It is probably more important to be altruistic and co-operative than it was five million years ago
Dr George Fieldman
Buckinghamshire New University
Lead researcher Dr Ariel Knafo said : " The experiment provided the first evidence , to my knowledge , for a relationship between DNA variability and real human altruism . "
The gene AVPR1a plays a key role in allowing a hormone called arginine vasopressin to act on brain cells .
Vasopressin , in turn , has been implicated in social bonding .
The researchers found greater altruism in players in which a key section of the gene , called its promoter , was longer .
The promoter is the region that determines how active a gene is .
In this case a longer promoter makes the gene more active .
Long history
The researchers point out that a version of AVPR1a also exists in voles , where it also promotes social bonding .
This , they say , suggests that altruism has a long rooted genetic history .
Dr George Fieldman , a lecturer in psychology at Buckinghamshire New University , said carrying genes which promoted altruism and social bonding made evolutionary sense .
He said the success of altruism as a strategy was based on the idea that a good deed was likely to be reciprocated .
However , the odds of that happening among strangers were lower than among people who were known to each other .
Therefore , the impulse to bond socially , and make new friends , was important .
He said : " Because society is becoming increasingly complicated , it is probably more important to be altruistic and co-operative than it was in our ancestral history . "
Print this article Original blueprints for 200 mpg carburetor found in England Rather than a future technology , high mileage carburetors are inventions of the past , but unfortunately they did never make it to market .
I wonder why .
Now one of them may come back to haunt the oil interests - a bit late , but nevertheless .
An article published in Times Online on 19 April 2003 relates the story of how plans for the carburetor designed by Canadian inventor Charles Nelson Pogue in the 1930 were recently re-discovered by a Cornish mechanic in a secret compartment of a toolbox he had been given . . .
Source : Times Online
Date : Sat , 19 Apr 2003 Oil Industry Suppressed Plans for 200 - MPG Car
The original blueprints for a device that could have revolutionized the motor car have been discovered in the secret compartment of a tool box .
A carburetor that would allow a car to travel 200 miles on a gallon of fuel caused oil stocks to crash when it was announced by its Canadian inventor Charles Nelson Pogue in the 1930s .
But the carburetor was never produced and , mysteriously , Pogue went overnight from impoverished inventor to the manager of a successful factory making oil filters for the motor industry .
Ever since , suspicion has lingered that oil companies and car manufacturers colluded to bury Pogue ’s invention .
Now a retired Cornish mechanic has enlisted the help of the University of Plymouth to rebuild Pogue ’s revolutionary carburetor , known as the Winnipeg , from blueprints he found hidden beneath a sheet of plywood in the box .
The controversial plans once caused panic among oil companies and rocked the Toronto Stock Exchange when tests carried out on the carburetor in the 1930s proved that it worked .
Patrick Davies , 72 , from St Austell , had owned the tool box for 40 years but only recently decided to clean it out .
As well as drawings of the carburetor , the envelope contained two pages of plans , three test reports and six pages of notes written by Pogue .
They included a report of a test that Pogue had done on his lawnmower , which showed that he had managed to make the engine run for seven days on a quart ( just under a litre ) of petrol .
The documents also described how the machine worked by turning petrol into a vapour before it entered the cylinder chamber , reducing the amount of fuel needed for combustion .
Mr Davies has had the patent number on the plans authenticated , proving that they are genuine documents .
He said : “ I could n’t believe what I saw .
I used to be a motor mechanic and I knew this was something else altogether .
I was given the tool box by a friend after I helped to paint her house in 1964 .
Her husband had spent a lot of time in Canada . ”
The announcement of Pogue ’s invention caused enormous excitement in the American motor industry in 1933 , when he drove 200 miles on one gallon of fuel in a Ford V8 .
However , the Winnipeg was never manufactured commercially and after 1936 it disappeared altogether amid allegations of a political cover -up .
Dr Murray Bell , of the University of Plymouth ’s department of mechanical and marine engineering , said he would consider trying to build a model of the Pogue carburetor .
Engineers who have tried in the past to build a carburetor using Pogue ’s theories have found the results less than satisfactory .
Charles Friend , of Canada ’s National Research Council , told Marketplace , a consumer affairs programme : “ You can get fantastic mileage if you ’re prepared to de-rate the vehicle to a point where , for example , it might take you ten minutes to accelerate from 0 to 30 miles an hour . ”

This is a story by someone in the US who analyzed Pogue 's carburator and made plans for his own unit to vaporize gasoline in accordance with the principles described in Pogue 's patents .
An interesting discussion is also developing on that article .

The Bourke engine , first demonstrated by inventor Russell Bourke , in 1932 , but lost in the politics of wartime manufacturing , optimizes the 90 degree optimal torque angle for converting combustion to movement , improves fuel efficiency over the 4 - stroke engine by 300 % , while ( depending on design ) reducing wear , noise , vibration , as well as cutting noxious emissions to nearly zero because of its efficient use of the fuel .
Numerous contemporary replications have demonstrated its viability .
It is a technology long overdue .
Bourke may be to engines what Tesla is to radiant energy -- a scientist who did not realize the actuation of his revolutionary technology in his day , but whose technology may be the salvation of the 21st century energy needs .
Apparently , the Bourke design has shortcomings , which Melvin Vaux , who worked with Bourke , has addressed in a series of patents produced in the 1990s .
This approach to fuel economy may be more plausible than the vaporizer technologies , which create pockets of highly explosive fumes .
The Bourke engine can easily , and perhaps even optimally , run on hydrogen ( which can be produced from water ) , as well as Biodiesel or other less clean but renewable fuels such as methane from garbage .

Does anyone make a modern day version of the pogue carb ?
Hi Matt , thanks for comment / question .
As far as I know the pogue carb never did make it into production , at least not seriously , and there is no recent developments that I know of , which would allow us to get hold of one of these " off the shelf " .
Plenty of do - it - yourselfers but nothing official for now .
If any reader has better news , please inform us .
Kind regards
Josef
Yeah from the research that I have done on this carb it would have work great .
Note the would have , due to the additive in lead in gas there is no way this carb was ever going to make it .
Now that lead is no longer a additive there are about 10 other additives that prevent this carb from working correctly .
If you were to get ahold of some raw gasoline then you may be able to get it to work , other than that the pogue carb will not work .
So let 's publish ALL the prints so more people will have a chance to built it themselves instead of burying it again .
Will we ever learn that technology is a gift from God for EVERYONE'S benefit .
If you do n't want and / or have the ability to build it yourself , then have someone build it for you ( and pay them ) .
Are we ever going to grow up and get rid of the mentality of " I " have to build it so ultimately " I " can sell it to " everyone else " ?
( Just a thought )
Yes , I have made a vaporizer for gasoline and it gets around 70 mpg .
I have never seen the pogue carb blueprints but I know that it just vaporizes the gasoline
before it enters the intake .
This device is simple to build also .
does anyone have the blueprints to the pogue carb ?
Also it was stated above that the gasoline had to be leaded to work ...
That is not true .
This device was successfully used in WWII by the U.S. Army .
A study of the logistics in North Africa and how Rommell , s tank Core was defeated ( by running them out of fuel ) gives serious consideration to the " rumor " of this being the case .
The German high command were certain the Allies would not be able to win the campaign because they did not have the rescources in place for the massive fuel consumption necessary .
The fact that these carbs were used is substantiated by many WWII vets and eye witnesses and the publication technology was deemed a security threat at that time , if it was made public which it certainly would have been .
anyway
A search on the topic will bring up many credible and not so credible sources on the topic .
Is there proof of the 200mpg
carburetor ?
Are there really blueprints .
I have ddeveeloped a caarburetor burning the vapor of the liquid gas drive a v8 limo .
and get up to 65 miles per hour .
now to increeease the power and speed
My father invented a carburetor that came close to the pogue carb it was installed on thousands of cars it was called the vari-vent by astron energies corp .
He recieved death threats by oil companies in about 1975 and was bought out in 1978 .
I am trying to locate one of these if any one has any info please contact me
In the early 70s I had the plans to build one of these carburators , but misplaced them .
If I recall correctly , it was made using a Toyota heater core and the fuel lines were wrapped around the exhaust manifold to superheat and vaporize it before entering the carb .
The manual had the names of several people over the years who have invented these carbs , and were either bought out by the oil companies or disappeared .
Since the media is now interested in the extremely high cost of fuel , maybe we can get them onboard to do some " Investigative Reporting " if anyone knows people in the media .
Also , in the past there was a nationwide campaign to not buy fuel for one day .
Nice gesture , but not good enough .
How about starting the month of May 2004 , we spread the word not to buy fuel from EXXON , the next month CHEVRON , next TEXACO etc .
That ... will put a dent in the companies big time .
The power of the Internet can be used to spread the word .
Do what you can .
I witnessed a version of the pogue carb operate on a 73 Toyota SR5 .
The technician , Mikky , now deceased , disconnected the fuel pump and fed heated fumes from the gas tank to the intake of the carb .
It ran .
To produce power you need more heat .
Warning !
Backfiring is a big concern .
Email me if you want to make a documentary .
We 'll do it guerilla style like Michael Moore .
Fog out the faces to protect the guilty .
The oil companies do not take kindly to this subject .
I 'll show you how to do it but I 'm running the camera not turning the wrenches .
Explosafe , a product used in 70s NASCAR to prevent explosions , works .
Also , you have to flush your fuel system frequently because our fuel contains additives that leaves unwanted matter in your gas tank .
One more thing to keep your valves from burning , install a water injector system .
Use distilled water .
Remember gas fumes can kill .
You got to be careful .
The Toyota got 200 mpg BTW . :)
I should word this correctly .
The fumes are not heated .
The gasoline is .
I would be concerned about using the exhaust system for heating in that the temperature can get too high .
Heater core in the gas running at rad temp is far safer .
Tesla had a patent called " Coil for Electromagnet " which uses a principle that may apply to a heat engine .
Specifically if the input air for a Stirling is run through a coil so that the input air is preheated by exhaust air , this might provide higher torque .
The problem of overheating can then be addressed by providing only minute quantities of supermixed fuel vapor .
In other words , the overheating problem is a good development if the richness of the vapor is reduced .
This may be a method to give higher MPG operation of the engine .
Rather than looking at overheating as a problem to be dealt with by increased cooling intensity , deal with it as a problem to be dealt with by rarefying the input fuel mixture .
If the input fuel mixture is reduced so that the vapor has a lower ratio of gasoline molecules to air molecules , then the excess heating of the engine is less .
Yet the heating of the engine is required for maintaining combustion temp of the fuel / air mixture .
If this engine heat is maintained or increased by preheating of the input air , then the engine can have high heat / cool ratio thus maintaining high torque and high Power to weight ratio .
This problem of engine overheating is a key issue which can be used to increase fuel efficiency if it is handled properly .
The overexplosiveness situation can also be dealt with by making the fuel / air ratio dependent on the required torque .
If more torque is required , you increase the input air heating while using fuel - line self - vacuum / vapor production , decreasing the fuel / air ratio so that the less gasoline is required -- this makes for higher mpg while also keeping the uncontrolled explosion hazard under control .
Something along these lines has been tested but not sure if I am on the right track .
thank you for reading this .
Folks , you can obtain all of Pogues patents and blueprints at the US patent office www.uspto.gov.
You have to do a search by patent number only ( PN ) .
The patents are 1,938,497 : 1,997,497 : and 2,026,798 .
You can only get the images in tiff format .

There 's a lot more out there .
Please visit " IAeSR "
For starters , there is plenty of NEW various types of engines that exceed 100 miles per gallon , you just have to look for them .
Eventually they will come to market , possibly through popular mechanics ( like H&G 's vapor carb ) , but you will see them .
The fact others may be " scared " to produce their inventions in mass quantities because of Oil cartels or the Auto industry looking at them with a sour face .
This is only true if they do not get it to the public first , such as waiting until the very last minute before patenting and shoving it out on the shelf .
The best idea is mass advertising and the use of paid programming on National Television when the time is right .
With so much interest and public viewing it would be very hard to " scare " anyone without some sort of investigation .
There is also engines that do not require fuels .
Well lets just say , I heard of one that does not need any fuels or liquids of any form , it is called a GPG3 .
Gravity propulsion Generator that has UNLIMITED milage .
I also heard the inventor will have it on National Television as it makes its way across America Coast to Coast without stopping .
News has it that it will cost less than $ 10,000 for the engine once in production .
Now how is that for cutting down the use of Fuel ?
It is supposed to be out sometimes in 2005 .
Afterall , this is the future and we cannot expect to live like the 19th century forever . =)

There are hundreds of WW2 TANKS and TRUCKS dumped in the sea in the Philippines that RAN these devices .
Tanks trebled their range ( according to RETURNING tank drivers ) �on the same Fuel quantity - when running flat out - so yes this system worked and was used .

Do you have any idea where did they dump it , I am from the Philippines .
todays gas is a very watered down solution compared to that of 1935 therefore pogues carb worked exelently and had full power at top speed .
i have found that heating the fuel is the way to go .
getting it to its true vapor temp but not far enough to self ignition temp .
your best chance is to develop a system with auto controls and sensors to be as safe and efficient as possible .
i would love to see your plans for your 65/70 mpg systems .
hope this helps
Hello all .
Check out these sites for information on alternative fuels other than gasoline .
www.futurehorizons.net - click on alternative fuels , and they have directions on how to convert an internal combustion engine to run on hydrogen .
Also go to www.ebay.com and just type in hydrogen .
I have found a few programs on there with instructions on how to convert an internal combustion engine to run on hydrogen .
Beware some may be scams , I would email the seller first and ask questions , then you will have to make your own judgement if these are legitimate or not .
Not all these instructions are scams but some are .

The carb set up you guys are talking about , plans and working models have been sold for years out of texas .
To get more info check new or old popular science mags , the back page adds .
I have plans to a vapor carb purchased many years ago , it is a basic set up , fuel is feed in a large biggs $ stratton lawnmower carb , then channeled into a prefab metal box , thru tubes inside of box , exhaust is flowed over these tubes and back into main exhaust pipe , vapor produced is then place into carb .
it was claimed to give 65 mpg in a v - 8 cad , highway only as it must be turned when car is up to speed , a balancing act must then be performed , cutting off standard fuel flow while turning on vapor flow .
if this works at all , the next logical course is to add sensors , and computer control , flow controls to make this all automatic .
Vapor carbs might work but would need money a automotive engineer and someone with computer software skills .
the best type of engine to try this on is most likely one of the new acura motors some of the 4 cylinders , have varitable timming , and valves which is controled by computers , this would solve the torque problems with vapor carbs if the vapor carb could be tied in with the valve and timming with sensors and the right software and hardware it would give one of those acura rsx cars around 100 ?
mpg , with decent torque
Hey I have to design a car for a class that i am taking in high school and it has to meet certain standards .
I have been having some major trouble on the fuel consumption issue .
If anyone has a way that this could work or any data that could help me find out if this would work it would be greatly appreciated .
how about a bosch cis fuel injection system ?
if you put a vaporization system in the air box , fed by the fuel lines designed to go to the injectors , removing the injectors , and plugging the injector holes in the head .
all you would have to do is to make the air box air tight .
the plunger that is actuated by air suction would automaticly meter the gas coming from the lines .
the only problem is that the motor would no longer need that much fuel .
look at the diagrams of the bosch cis if you do n't know how one works .
man that could work if the amount of fuel being fed to the system could be reduced somehow .
hmm ..... how about a cut off switch inside of a small holding tank that feeds the " boiller " cut off the fuel pump intermittantly as the fuel in the holding tank gets to the needed level .
although that could prove hazardous if the engine was shut off then turned back on .
a spring loaded vent that only lets air / vapors to travel one way would have to be in place just after the air filter .
Dear friends , I regret that only today I have found this webpage .
This is all very good stuff here !
I myself am also researching Watercar systems and High Mileage carbs !
I am a member of several of the yahoo Groups on energy etc .
Unfortunately there are lots of discussions but few people are actually experimenting .
As for myself , I have not come up with a lot of impressive results .
My Hydrogen production has been way to little until now , but I now have the major parts required to make a Carl CELLA generator and will try this in coming months on m car .
Furthermore , I have tested a Gas Vapor System on my other car , using following principles :
1. Testengine : 1988 GM 2.8V6 TBI with 2 injectors
2. Vaporhookup : a T - connector hooked into the fuel line ( 13psi ) taps fuel to a Bosch Injector ( BI ) from a junkyard that delivers about 1 / 4 the amount of fuel the engine normally gets from the TBI .
The BI is wired directly to the ground on one side and the other wire is hooked to a pressure sensitive membrane switch ( PSMS ) , which reacts to pressures as low as 125 mm water column .
This PSMS was retrieved from an old washing machine and surely not the best choice .
I need to find a better more reliable switch .
When there is no or pressure is below 125 mm Water Column , the BI is activated and sprays fuel into a straith 8 mm OD copper tube of about 50 cm long .
This 8 mm OD tube is inserted as deep a possible into the Exhaust trough a drilled hole , as close as possible to the exhaust manifold .
This 8 mm OD tube again is inserted in a 12 mm OD 10 mm ID Stainless Steel Tube , whith the bottom end of it welded closed .
Using plumbing and gas parts and T- connectors the 2 tubes are sealed tight togehter on he top side .
The gas sprays into the 8 mm tube , drips down to the bottom while exposed to exhaust heat , vaporises , and the only way out is trough the space between the two pipes and in the 12 mm pipe upwards and out trough the T - connector .
From the T - connecor , a hose goes to a T - connector with the PSMS to control the BI and the other end goes to a LPG Pressure regulator from a Car LPG system .
From the LPG Regulator a hose runs to the TBI manifold , trough the PCV line .
A switch was installed to turn of the standard TBI feed from the ECM .
A switch was installed also to turn the BI on and off .
I started the engine in a normal way running it with the TBI and after about 10 minutes warming up , I tried the system .
That is , I switched the BI on and waited until the PSMS switched the BI of , meaning there was some pressure buildup in the hoses and tubes .
Then I switched the TBI off , but the engine died every time I switched off the standard TBI .
I tried until I observed a fuel leak at the PSMS .
Then I parked the car for several weeks , being to busy with other issues .
I then had to move the car , and simply started it , drove it in and out of the garage , the engine was ildeling high ( 1500 RPM ) as it was cold .
I started the car about 3 or 4 times and it ran for at least 15 minutes total but surely longer , before it died on me finally .
I could not get it started after that and I then checked the switches and wires , as I could not understand what was wrong , thinking that I had been operating the car with the standard TBI and nothing else .
I then noticed that in fact the TBI was switched of and also the Vapor system with the BI was also switched off , so I had been running the car from whatever fuel and vapor was still remaining in the tubes and lines from the vapor system .
I would say that this represents fuel and fuel vapors stored in a fuel line with a 10 mm ID and length of 120 cm and not under pressure at all .
This to me seems somewath promising , but I will have to get back to testing the system .
I just wanted to share my experience with you all , so we can concentrate our efforts .
In any case , the tube - inside - tube system is to my opinion a very effective , efficient and easy way to make the setup .
The advantage of straight tubes is easy construction and more over , easy maintenance , because if the additives clogg up the tubes , then a correctly sized wire brush of 8 and 10 mm will do the job easly and even on the field .
Do use Stainless steel tubes however , as the outher one is fully exposed to exhaust heat and oxidation .
Regards ,
Jake
i have blue prints of the 200 MPG carburetor , my uncle has had them for along time and just gave them to me .
not sure if any body is wanting them , i am not willing to just give them to any body , i want to keep this a secret as much as posible , my dad is working on makeing one .
Well all of this reading inspired me to talk a bit about my experiments with gas vapour .
I have done many tests on a rotary 1.1L NA engine from a Mazda Rx - 7 .
I chose this engine due to it 's design and combustion chamber characteristics .
A vapour mixture would give even a higher efficiency than one from a piston type engine .
Ok , now for the good part !
I first hooked up a coppper gas line wrapping around the exhaust before the gas went to the carburetor .
This proved to give me a 2 mpg increase , with very little power .
Having realized that the engine was getting so much vapor it was almost flooding , I spliced the heated gas line into the gas return .
I then used the vent line from the gas tank as an idle fuel source .
Whilst restricting the fuel going to the engine with the idle fuel mixture screw and opening up the vapors from the tank , I was able to totally close the idle mixture screw .
The engine would idle extremely smooth , and extremely low .
It would pull right along as low as 300 rpm .
I did n't worry about the gas getting too hot either --
With lean mixtures you get overheating , and with the hotter the gas , the leaner the mixture .
The setup was self - limiting .
The gas line wrapped around the exhaust was not covered , and when the engine rad fan came on fan would cool the gasoline .
I ran the car like this for a summer , with no problems .
I have also done tests with the rx -7 test vehicle with water vapour injection , hydrogen / oxygen injection from a hydrogen boost , steam injection , and a catalytic cracker .
I also have used a carburetor enhancer ( george wiseman ) and hooked up spark plug capacitors for longer sparks .
Hope this inspires some people , as other posts inspired me .
I 've heard all kinds of crap about 200 mpg carbs for years .
Let me try one more time .... a measure of gasoline , or any other hydrocarbon , contains only a certain amount of energy ( BTU 's ) so far you can't create energy out of nothing !
In other words , THERE NEVER WAS A 200MPG CARB !!!
Dear Gerry Flood ,
Your words are spoken like a true mechanical engineer .
Of courese , they are BS .
I have built and used a " cold vacuum " vapor system and the car averaged 32MPG when it normally got 16MPG .
How do you explain that ?
All vapor systems work , it 's only a matter of how much .
I 've been really looking into this for a while .
I 'm badly wanting to build a carburetor that can give at least 50 mpg on my GM 455 V - 8 engine for my 72 ' Cutlass .
If I could get that kind of mileage out of it , I 'd never have to buy a new car .
Ever .
And it 's a classic , so the value only goes up up up !
I 'm currently looking for plans for a carberator that I can put on a holly or eddlebrock air intake manifold .
I just do n't want 8 mpg .
With the size of this engine , I would have to buy premium unleaded , so I want my money to go further .
I can't find a SINGLE diagram anywhere .
Could someone post one here ?
dear Leu , i have in my possesstion a original copies blue print and notes for the 200 mpg carburetor i can send u copies if u want copies contate me at poisionhawk@yahoo.com
To Joe Salisbury .

My hat is off to a team from the University of California who in 1992 set an American record of 3313 mpg with a vehicle called Shamu .
If a designer could mix current auto design with Shamu and come up with 1500 mpg I think most of us would be happy with that !
The next challenge ?
Get 1500 mpg from vegetable oil !
Grow our own fuel and tell Corporate oil companys to rob someone else .
Joe I have searched google for the last hour looking for this car called the Shamu .
There is nothing about this car .
I emailed some people from the University of Cal .
No one knows anything about this car built in 1992 .
Were you just kidding around .
If there was a car that got 3315 mpg .
I can assure you there would be tons of info about this car on the net .
There is nothing .
Which tells me you must have been told a falsehood by someone .
Check out this Volkswagon car that gets 282 mpg .
There 's also pics of the car .
It looks like something from the Jetsons .
It uses a diesel engine .

how about running the gas through the transmission cooler on the rad and putting in a higher degree thermostat ? i think this would work very well in a fuel injection type setup as you also have the intake manifold heated by the engine coolant , but it is only heating the chamber not the fuel , just an idea ?
A comment received by e-mail on the subject of Pogue 's carburetor 6 March 2005 : ... the Pogue carburetor was definitely sold to the public .
People were starting to buy them at such a rate that it attracted the attention of the oil companies , who put tetraethyl lead in their gasoline almost immediately , which coated the inside of the carburetors , rendering their catalytic action useless , and the the oil companies capitalized on the confused Pogue , who built them but did n't really understand exactly how they really worked , while the oil companies understood perfectly , and began calling the Pogue carburetor a fraud , when in fact they had ruined his idea with their additives .
Pogue started getting a lot of carburetors back from unhappy customers , and went broke .
They 're still doing it today , which is why you can't buy gasoline that wo n't " varnish up " any catalytic device that uses any real degree of heat that would otherwise yield more serious fuel economy gains .
They 'll allow about 10 % , but anything more than that attracts their attention , and the greater the increase , the more attention they will give it .
I found an old newspaper with an article about a man who turned regular auto engines into hydrolic engine .
He lived in the LA area in the late 40s
The mystery was , he used some type of green fluid that had an extrordinary capacity to expand by the ratio of 50 to one from cool to hot .
Does anyone know about this man or his invention ?

Hello , this guy says the carburetor story is not true .
Can anyone who knows about cars respond to what he said .
http://www.mikebrownsolutions.com/fish3.htm
The following is a reprint of Chapter III from the Fish Carburetor Book by Michael H. Brown , pages 11 - 12 ( 1982 ) : III .
The 100 MPG Carburetor Myth
There have been numerous books and plans written purporting to " reveal the secrets " of the famous " 200 mpg carburetor , " a device supposedly built in 1935 by Charles Nelson Pogue of Winnipeg , Canada .
As of this writing Mr. Pogue is in a nursing home in Winnipeg , Canada .
Several of our customers have visited with him .
Each came away with a slightly different story .
Mr. Pogue actually did manufacture a carburetor he titled the " Winnipeg " in the late 1930s ; 317 all told .
One of our customers had one and claimed it delivered 35 mpg on a Ford Mustang with considerable loss of power ; however , he agreed to let us have it for testing and we are still waiting .
There are two problems with the " Pogue principle , " which is being touted in high mileage seminars and books all over the country .
The first is that the Pogue carburetor violates the first law of thermodynamics , a commonly accepted scientific postulate that has been with us since 1830 .
The law is written as follows : U = q + w
Or , in simple English , if you have chemical energy in a system ( U ) in its expenditure , it must equal q ( heat ) plus work ( w ) .
That is , if you have 100,000 BTUs in a gallon of fuel in which you then burn the end products in a system operating at 30 % efficiency you will have 30,000 BTUs of work and 70,000 BTUs of heat .
Anything you put inside the combustion chamber can do only one of two things during the ignition stroke .
Produce energy ( mechanical movement ) during the reaction .
Absorb energy ( leave out the exhaust as heat ) during the reaction .
There has been a lot written about the " unburned particulates " furnishing the extra fuel for the extra 50 mpg or so , but if you 'll check the Fish dynatune emissions levels you 'll see there are n't enough of them to get you another 300 yards down the road .
The second problem encountered with Pogue - type devices is that in some instances they actually predate the carburetor .
Let 's elaborate in both cases .
Back before the carburetor as we know it came into being in the 1890s there were several novel methods of getting fuel into the engine .
One method was using a kerosene - soaked rag to drip fuel into the engine .
Another method that became quite common was allowing air to pass over the surface of gasoline and then to be sucked into the engine .
Sometimes a valve called a " mixing valve " would be positioned between the fuel reservoir and the engine .
The valve would pop open when the downward motion of the piston created enough suction .
This method and variations of it have been touted all over the United States in " 100 MPG CARBURETOR " seminars sponsored by various individuals as being the " ultimate " in sophisticated fuel systems , usually with exhaust heat or radiator water added to " vaporize " the fuel much more effectively than a standard carburetor .
There are a number of things wrong with the concept of such a " 100 MPG " system .
The first is that the gasolines in use during the days of the mixing valve were far more volatile than the ones in use today .
Some of you may remember when you could stand ten feet away from an open pan of gasoline , light a match , and watch the gasoline immediately catch fire .
Gasolines were changed in the 1930s with the advent of the catalytic cracker now used in petroleum refining .
Carburetors like the Pogue , which depend on easily vaporized gasoline , simply will not work with today 's gasolines .
The second seminar - taught error is the method of using exhaust heat or radiator water to heat the fuel to the " vapor " point to extend the mileage .
Warming or preheating fuel does have some value , but it 's limited .
Consider using hot water from the radiator to vaporize the fuel first .
Today 's gasolines do not completely vaporize until they reach 450 º Fahrenheit heat , while the maximum temperature of the water in today 's pressure radiators reaches only 250 º Fahrenheit .
You just can't heat a substance to 450 º Fahrenheit using a 250 º Fahrenheit heat source .
At least , not on this planet .
Exhaust heat works a bit differently .
It is the function of an internal combustion engine to change chemical energy into heat , and then the heat into mechanical movement .
If the heat is not changed into mechanical movement it simply leaves as heat .
Any time you feel heat coming off an engine you are feeling wasted energy .
The exhaust ports of an engine that operated at 100 % efficiency would be ice - cold to the touch since ALL the heat would have been changed into mechanical movement .
Which means that the more efficient your engine is the less exhaust heat you 're going to have .
For example , if you have 600 º Fahrenheit exhaust heat produced by one gallon of gas over a 20 - mile trip and you use " exhaust heat " to " vaporize " the fuel and go 60 miles , what produces the 600 º Fahrenheit heat for the next 40 miles ?
If you answered " two more gallons of fuel , " go to the head of the class !
Seriously , there are ways to go several times the distance on a gallon of fuel ( none of them involving carburetors ) ; it 's just that the foregoing examples are n't two of them .
In short , Charles Nelson Pogue was a machinist with no formal training in thermodynamics and may have actually believed that what he was attempting would work .
All a carburetor can do is meter and atomize fuel in correct proportion to air .
Any further increases have to come from increasing the thermal efficiency of the engine itself ( such as raising compression ) or reducing rolling friction .
And this last is why a diesel locomotive with steel wheels will go ten times as far on a gallon of fuel as a diesel truck of the same weight with rubber tires .
For Pogueor any similar carburetor to go 100 mpg on a gallon of fuel on a vehicle normally going 20 mpg , the air / fuel ratio would have to be in the neighborhood of 75 to 1 or better .
Any second - year college chemistry student knows that .
Joe Salisbury actually was partially correct .
I just spoke to someone who 's building this solar car for Cal university .
He told me this .
He has n't heard about the Shamu car , but it 's possible that it existed .
He said the Cal Super Mileage Vehicle team built a car a couple years ago that
won the national competition with a mileage of 1068 mpg .
It 's important to recognize that their car does n't look anything like a real car ( it 's just a carbon fiber shell with tiny suspension and a small motor , though it can go 60 mph ) , and certainly does n't have any of the functionality .
It could go 1068 miles on one gallon of fuel though .
You guys need to go back to watching the sci - fi channel , enough bullshit in here to power a small town .
If someone 's here has actually done this , build a site , show the results and for gods sake stop bitching about it .
Acetone as a Fuel Additive
Acetone reduces the unburned portion of the fuel by aiding vaporization through eliminating surface tension , thus improving combustion efficiency .
Without acetone , the fuel has a higher surface tension , which increases temperature required to vaporize the fuel .
Without acetone , small droplets of fuel go unburned and pass through the engine and into the environment as pollution .
If you can give me an e-address I will send info on my work with gasified gasoline .
Everyone seems to be overlooking the fact that liquid particles are burning after the initial combustion .
All the air is burned up and leaves a small ammount of fuel unburned .
Pogue got 217 mpg .
I have documented proof .
i'v been tring to desine a 200 mpg carborator for a 2 - cycle but , i need some help .
so if anybody has some ideas , plaes let me know .
Pouge Reality .
Its time to face a little bit of reality here people .
Pouge did build a vapor carburetor and it did get about 75 MPG .
However , the engine it was attached to was not a V8 .
It was a small four cylinder engine having about the same cubic inch displacement as a Harley Davidson motorcycle .
That 's only 1200 cc 's guys !!
Getting 75 MPG from a 1200 cc engine is not that bid of a deal .
I agree that vapor carburetors should improve combustion efficiency resulting in improved MPG .
However , Pouge never got 200 MPG using his vapor carburetor on a V8 because he never installed the carburetor on any car with a V8 .
The best way to do an analyses on vapor carburetors is to CUT THE BULL SHIT AND GET DOWN TO THE FACTS !
I just found a book on THE SECRETS OF THE 200 MPG .
CARB .
it has about 10 different variations of the carb .
all the same principle , ill scan and post as soon as i can .
if anyones interested
if you need someone to scan them , I volunteer , I am more than interested ..
I am trying to find my uncle in florida right now who has my set of plans to the actual pogue carburator ... but would like to see as many variations as i could where I could show him .. but because he is one of the original old 1 % 's it 's not always easy to track him down ... might be weeks so I would for sure be interested !
Why cant the unburned fuel in the exaust be condensed ( cooled ) and put right back into the fuel tank .
therfore bettering the milage
A Honda Insight hybrid can get over 100 mpg during cross country highway driving .
( Follow the link to check out documented hybrid milage results )
This guy has ran his Honda Insight 37,283 miles on 402 gallons of gasoline which equals 92.8 miles per gallon .
This is for real , with no lost blueprints or the typical " I knew a guy who remembers knowing a guy who met a guy who read about a secret 100 mpg carborator . "
Hybrid vehicles are in their infancy but will soon be mainstream .
Many of the major manufacturers are rolling out new models from compacts and midsize to pickups and SUVs .
Our society has been spoiled by decades of cheap energy .
We have all been sleepwalking through our daily rountine and have become used to the availability of a never - ending supply of cheap gasoline .
Currently Americans burn 20 million barrels of oil a day .
Who gives a shit about fuel efficiency if gasoline is cheap .
Here in Houston , gas was 97 cents a gallon only three years ago .
Today a gallon costs 2.20 .
A near future where gasoline prices which could easily be in the 4 - 6 dollars a gallon range is very possible .
My neighbor mentioned that he filled the tank on his Surburban SUV and it cost him 90.00 .
He has to fill up once a week .
That adds up to 4680.00 a year for fuel .
Now think of the possibility of a per gallon price of 5.00 .
Now you are talking 225.00 for a full tank and 11,700.00 a year fuel costs !
How many SUVs would be parked because the average middle class family could not afford to drive it ?
Necessity creates opportunity .
Since America produces very little of its own energy and has to import from increasingly dangerous and unstable parts of the world , now more than ever , it makes sense to develop vehicle technology which decreases our reliance on imported energy .
http://www.greenhybrid.com/compare/mileage/car/54-little-red-beauty.html
It is relatively easy to get " raw " gas .
I am currently looking for a secondary gas tank to turn into a " filter " tank .
When I fill this tank up , the gasoline will go through a series of activated Chacoal filters before it drops into the primary tank .
The filters should filter out the additives and make even a regular carburetor more efficient .
But also adding ceramic heating elements to the bowl of a regular carburetor should increase the efficiency at least a little bit .
You can run a " condensetor " in your vehicle .
a hose from you PCV to the condensetor and then back to the intake should help .
The process is simple .
It is basicly a jar that catches the sludge that would normally build up in the engine and allow the unburned fuel to return to the manifold .
I attempted this with a home made condensator but I didnt have it quite air tight enough .
It did catch sludge though and allowed the unburned fuel to go back into the mainfold .
Hello ...
Charles is my grandfathers brother .
I 'd love to tell you I have the true story on the carb but even he does n't know the extent of what happened .
One day im going to try and make one for myself and see what I can do .
If someone out there knows soemthing more I 'd really liek to know .
Thanx .

I have a Astron Vari Vent Carb , with adapter plates for 2 or 4 barrel , gaskets , linkage , looks 100 % complete !
Looks in great shape as well !
I know nothing about it and I am also not interested in keeping it around !
Thanks
Hi , i read that all of you want to build a vaporise type carborator , but there is a propane carborator that will do the same thing , And it should work with vaporized gas .
they have them out on the market and already have them on some trucks .
I 'v also seen them work , and they work like a regular truck .
so i hope this will help .
if you want to run a engine off vapor , just take a 3/ 4 " id peice of clear hose , commonly found at home depot , get 2 or 3 hp briggs and stratton engine , clamp off the fuel line going to the carb , have a friend hold the hose over the mouth of the carb , and hold the other end just in the top of the gas tank and start the engine .
I did this with a coleman 1750 watt generator and when loaded it put out about 3 / 4 of it 's full load .
The longest I had it running like this was about a half hour .
I simply got bored and sick of listening to it and shut it off .
I have been playing around with heating the gasoline on my 1940 H - D and using small carburetors , so there will be a very high vacuum signal , and to a degree it does work some , but so far nothing to really get excited about .

To all those who are trying to improve your mileage , more power to you .
I am too !
If you find anything on the net you need to print it right away as I am finding that alot of stuff comes and goes .
Maybe the oil companies do not want us to know ??
To all of those who think the concept is pure snake oil , keep up the good work !
After all somebody has to keep wasting money at the pumps to keep the oil companies happy !
good luck to all !
I had made several different models , of carbs , but the last one which I thought would be it !
feeding vapors through the propane carb , would work great for 20 minutes !
then as I had the unvaporized fuel return , through the heat exchanger , only the light ends , vaporized , and the gas was converted into a varsol smelling liquid , and no longer ran the vehicle !
the vehicle would lean out , burn your eyes , " nox " and eventualy quit running , until the gas was replaced in the vaporizer , same thing all over again !
better luck to you guys !
I guess that I should of read more of the prior comments on here !
as I seen a coment about the pogue , carb , that is runing on text book , it says that the purpose of the carb , is to meter liquid fuel into the engine !
which is absolutly correct !
but now where it fails to say is , only the vapor burns !
and if anyone has seen the explanation , from charles pogue , as to why the fuel has to be vaporized , prior to entering the air stream into the intake !
there is not enough time for liquid fuel to be completely vaporized , when it gets to you cylinder !
in the snap of your finger , the liquid fuel left the nozzle , or venturi of your carb , and is on its way out the exhaust !
well if you have ever spit on a hot stove , you can see it sizzle for about 20 to 30 seconds , before its all gone !
so even though your engine run s with a vacum , to help boil the gas on the way through and vaporize some of it !
enough to run !
when all is said and done !
your engine canot take liquid , and completly convert it to vapors , in .02 of a second !
thats why the pogue carb vaporized the gas before it went to the intake system , well to the engineers who read it out of there text book !
well the book was writen by someone , and was that before or after the pogue carb !
it also says , in the ingeneering books that that a bumble bee , should not be able to fly , the body is to big , and the wings to small ! haha , well I 'm not realy trying to pick on engineers , as you can see I can't even spell it ! haha , I 'm just saying when ever you think you know it all , something happens and some old books have to be changed !
food for though !
if you think that vaporization of fuel , is not needed !
why does a cold engine need more fuel to run ?
because less vapors are emited from a cold engine with cold fuel , so in fact your engine does not realy require , more fuel to run when its cold !
it just needs the same amount of vapors , it always needs to run !
so a cold engine , with cold fuel , you have to increase the volume of liquid , to produce , the same amount of vapors !
oh by the way !!
I have had a 283 , in my 66 pickup get in the nabour hood of 60 mpg !
but I did not get it to run under all load conditions , and would not run cold !
and if you rushed it it would lean and backfire !
and why is the pickups , of this melinuim , not getting better gas milage , the the 1980 trucks with the old carbs !!
Just thought I 'd point out that the Pogue carb is a well known urban legend :
http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp
Thank you John
White , but I would like to also point out to you and others that Barbara Mikkelson of Snopes does not always get her facts straight .
She recently wrote an article about Codex Alimentarius , a situation I closely follow , which just took the government ( FDA ) misinformation and repeated it apparently without looking into the huge amounts of serious investigation and reporting that is available not only on my site , but all over the internet .
What a pity - can't even rely on Snopes to tell the truth !
If any of you want to see something quite amazing go to www.geet.com where you will see a new type of system that can run on ANY liquid .
I know because I was trained on the technology on the scooter that you see in the pics in July 2003 .
An article found on the Pure Energy Systems website , which reports on new energy developments .
This particular one is relevant to the Pogue Carb discussions , as it heats fuel to make it burn better .
Vaporate Aims to Maximize Bang for the Buck
A pinpoint technology eliminates a limitation of internal combustion engines with minimal intervention .
First product delivered Monday .
AUSTRALIA --
In today 's typical internal combustion engines , a fuel injector discharges droplets of gasoline into the air intake just before the combustion chamber .
The surrounding air helps vaporize the outer layers of these droplets , which decrease in size and weight ...
Does anyone know if there are any laws " preventing " us from putting these vaproization systems on our own vehicles here in the U.S.A .?
The Carburetor Reseach Center , that was in Florida , would not sell their canister kits to a few states , especially California .
Can i get the blue prints for such a device .
Thank you .
This is as good as it gets for free http://www.rexresearch.com/pogue/1pogue.htm#2026
The original blueprints for a device that could have revolutionised the motor car have been discovered in the secret compartment of a tool box .
A carburettor that would allow a car to travel 200 miles on a gallon of fuel caused oil stocks to crash when it was announced by its Canadian inventor Charles Nelson Pogue in the 1930s .
Here is a reference to SHAMU which Mr. Salisbury mentioned .
It gives very little information and states 1990 for the record ...

I ordered the pouge plans from a pop.sci . ad in the 70's .
I also mlost or misplaced them .
I never got very far with the experiment , procrastination mostly .
but I came to a conclusion that this was much different than changing liguid propane into a gas before combustion on propane orerated forklifts an such .
propane just does n't burn at the same temp .
hope this helps some one
Has anyone heard of the Hydro - Gen device from website savefuel .
ca
I talked to the father of the inventor and he sounds legit .
I am trying to post all the information I can get on super - efficient carburetors - and anything else that we can use to reduce our consumption
of oil - any information anyone here can provide on a super - efficient carburetor will be greatly appreciated and posted for everyone 's benefit .
We now have enough for a person to build any one of several carbs as well as a new source of fuel .

Very intersting run a mower on 75 % water and 25 % gas I am still confused as how this is possable unless when the water is in steam form and compressed hydrogen from the water is ignited .

Hello , I do n't understand the water my self , So me and my cusson are doing this project on a 5.5 hp pressure washer we have that the pump is cracked on it .
When we got the supplys for it cost use $ 94 @ ACE HARDWARE ( 8- 27-05 ) but you can cut the cost if you deside to use non Galvanized gas pipe ( what we should have done ) .
we are not using the 22 mm / 7/8 " Copper Oil Drain Plug Washers , we are going to have the pipe
Tees welded to insure a good seal .
We do n't trust the washer because if the washer do n't seal the gas fummes will mix with the exh and may cause for a big BOOM !
I will keep you all posted on how it goes .
Hello ,
Got it all together today 9-01 - 05 and it worked like a charm on gas vapor only .
I keep you all posted on how it does with the test of 75 % water and 25 % gas after this weekend .
Damien I have been thanking of try to test the joe cell myself .
I ran it today on 75 % water and 25 % gas and it runs great but it is a little harder to start but not bad .
But I still do n't understand what the water does .
I worked on a turbin for Ford Motor in the late 60 we obtained 60 mpg on kerosine and over 300 HP .
When sent to ford they wanted the converter changed and to max of 20 mpg we came up with 10 mpg ford bought it This motor went into their large diesel tracks I was just one person but if Omega Watches would release their engineering end you would be suprised .( Josh Omega was the engineer ) .
What about hydro cells that just run off of water .
Anyone ever look into the one mentioned earlier at http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/water.html
Very interesting and I am thinking of building it for my truck .
Any ideas or anyone willing to help
I am not for sure whats going on but i was able to get a 100 % vapor gas test done at WOT for 10 mins and it used 6 oz of fuel 6x6 = 36 oz in an hr and 128 oz ( gal ) \ 36 = 3 hrs and 56 min run time on 1 gal of gas .
When i tryed the water / fuel mix it run good for about 3 or 4 mins then start slowing downuntill it would die , so i tryed running it 1 \ 4 open throttle and it run longer but would still die so i went back to 100 % gas and i get the same thing runs 3 or 4 mins and dies , so i am thing i am losing pressure in my bubble tank that feeds the fuel ot may be it is getting to hot with no air moving around it .
so I am Back to the testing stang to find out what is wrong .
Vapor phase carburation systems using the present gasoline cracking system will not keep good mileage the longer they are ran .
The current price for gasoline could make it possible to replace gasoline with the pure white gasoline which is lantern fuel that is becoming competitive in price that has always been available .
The generators on the Coleman gas stoves and lanterns prove that a true vapor phase carburetion system is possible .
I 've built several of the systems and the main problem was contamination .
I 'd recommend connecting to Bruce McBurney 's site at : http://www.himacresearch.com/letters/open.html
I plan on building an entire three part engine with all of the new high tech capabilities that auto companies and oil companies dont want you to know exist .
the car i am currently trying to build the engine on will be much lighter than the 2700 lb cars that car companies are making now with only 18 mpg or so .
i project when all is said and done i will create a car that can get about 350 MPG imagine if you had an 10 gallon tank .
you would receive 3,500 Miles to an entire tank of gasoline ... how amazing would that be .
There has to be lots of unburned fuel coming out those exhaust ports or we still would n't be using catalytic converters now would we !!!
Wake the hell up you naysayers .....
HI to all !
As i read through the different experments ,
It made me aware , that there are many people out there looking for answers !
I started to play with all different type of vaporizing ideas in the mid seventies ; then in the early part of the eithies i got a book by allan walace , it had the pogue carb and many others !
I had made many different type of heat exchangers !
some with coolant and others with exhaust !
so ofcourse this new book was heaven to me !
as it renewed my hope in the gas milage part !
I made about fourteen completly different types of fuel systems !
and ofcourse with each time being more convinced that I had all the angles covered !
I have had enough succest to know that it has possibilities !
from the results I got !
I had in upwards of sixty miles to the gallon !
but the drawbacks were terible !
leaning during aceleration !
no cold start , and running !
in my last oneI was useing coolant to heat gasoline !
and the system ran through a propane Imco carburetor !
it ran like a charm !
with no problems through all rpm ranges !
then 15 minutes would go by !
and it started to run terible until it died !
Well I know why now !
but it took me awhile to figure it out !
as i was useing heat from the coolant !
and recirculating the fuel which was unvaporized back into container to be rerun through the heat exchanger agian and agian !
but what happened !!
was only the light ends of the fuel vapourized !
and the fuel was converted to a stale smelling varsol like fluid !
and would no longer emite enough vapours to run the engine !
but after that amount of time of 15 minutes or so that half pint of gas had not demenished enough for the float to let new gas in !
so then , the engined leaned and made a terible amount of nox ! 1 burnt your eyes and died !
Well I know its possible from all my experiences !
to make gains which would be very aceptable !
I know that there will never be another pougue carb that will work like his did !
bacause !
the gas is not now like it was then !
after his carb came out !!
gas got leaded !
to make sure the heat exchanger would not work for to long !
and now it has other crap in it to do the same !
if you doubt this to be true !!
try useing it in your colman cook stove and see how long it will last !!
as you are vaporizeing it there to a true vapour state !
and the crap in the gas that is intentialy put in there so it can't be cracked into a vapour state !
but that does n't mean that it can't be heated enough as to not make some good gains !!
I wish you all the best of luck !

I just stumbled across this site today and noticed a comment from Ron Rollins from 20 Feb 2004 stating that he is looking for an Astron Vari - Vent carburetor .
If he is still interested , I may be able to help him out .
Email me at bubbamike80@yahoo.com
Hello , this is for the guy that said he would scan the book THE SECRETS OF THE 200 MPG .
CARB .
if yoiu can and send it to me at Blind_hearse18@hotmail.com i would greatly appreciate it .
My friend and I are trying to build these carbs for our cars , my friend has a 77 ford Bronco and I have a 77 LTD , they both have 351s .
If anyone has anything that could help us , that would be great .
Hello to all you high gas milage seekers !
Well I have checked out a lot of forums , about high gas milage , I have to say that the response are getting preditable !
The people , who have never actualy build anything !
All seem to say from what they heard from a friend of a friend , or what they have read someplace !
That it can't be done !!
One of the forum , replies
from " cecile Adams " actualy said that the " carburetor "
Was absolete , like the buggy whip !
haha !
Well !
maybe so !
but the piston engine was the reason for the need of the carburetor !
so we are still in need of that !
so the piston engine must be the " buggy !
I would like to give you a bit of food for though !
before fuel injection ! in the popular science adition of april 1983 !
you would see on the cover of that magazine !
smokey yunick 's 150 hp two cylinder engine , useing heat exchanger 's first coolant to bring the intake air fuel temp to 220 degress , than exhaust to heat it up to 440 degress !
through a turbo , that smokey liked to call homogenizer !
the turbo was evaloped along with the intake with the exhaust going through the involope to heat the air\fuel mixture !
to 440 degress , smokey says that when the fuel went through that turbo , the fuel particals were very small like a smoke mist !
and able to vaporize more rapidly with the hot intake temperatures !
Well there 's more to this !
but its to much to put on here !
Ofcoure this was known thechnoligy then !
but by 1985 we know what was going to be the winning , savior as for moder technoligy !
the new adds read !!
no need to look for the supper carburetors !
fuel injection is here !
haha !
Now I 've been a mechanic for thirty years !
and Ive seen several different things !
As the diesel john deere engines for example are now at 10,000 psi of fuel delivery pressure on there tier two engines !
which turns fuel injected through it , into basicly smoke !
as the paitical are so fine !
now lets talk about the joke !
1 of me laughing about fuel injection , in your car !
did you know that your kitchen tap , in your house has more pressure , then the fuel injection in your car !
and the spray pattern of your advanced fuel system , is comparible to one of a windex spray bottle !
so now you know what your " buggy whip " was replaced with !
and just maybe !
you can see why the gas milage of a 1981 pickup chev , or ford five liter , with the automatic over drive , was as good if not better then one comparible one now !
useing that " buggy whip " carburetor !
haha !
and what about the performance machines on the race circuit ! , still a lot of carburation going on there !
more food for though the knowledge is there !
just needs to be found !
good luck claude !
just a little info !
If you go to google search ! and put ; SMOKEY YUNICK'S TWO CYLINDER ENGINE !
It will take you to more info on that one !
somthing else to think about !
if you invent somthing that is marginly better , or equivalent to fuel injection !
As fuel injection was over caburation !
: out of tune : you would be a genious !!
but if you are successfull ! in doubleing gas milage !!
you would be deemed a fraudulant idiot !
food for though !
haha !
claude !
Hello Everyone
I am working on my vaporizer fuel system that is presently being installed on a 4x4 GMC 1 ton crew cab truck with a 454cid engine .
Progress is going well so far and pictures of the system installed under the hood of the engine bay are uploaded to the group files at the alfvaporizer group link provided .

Check out Vapor Systems Technology 's website .
They have a CD with over 900 different fuel vaporizing systems , including Pogue's , Ogle's , Caggiano's , Smokey Yunick's ...
Ton's of systems , the CD's $ 24.95 .
I am trying to get intouch with KUSTOM KARBS Rockford , Il .
They make a VAPORKARB which is a device that mounts under the carburetor .
It consists of a turbulator , turbo vane & electro grid which is electronicaly activated to heat the gas .
As the gas air is pulled therw the device by the engines own vacuum it is vaporized by the heat & turbo action of the device .
If anyone knows how to get in touch with Kustom Karbs I would like to hear from you .
Thank You !
Hi Guys ,
I 've seen lots of good info here , and some great ideas as well .
Some of the greatest discoveries of past centuries have been completely accidental , or put together in someones backyard or garage , so keep it up , and never let negative comments or opinions keep you from trying new ideas .
At the very least , a high milage fuel system ( 100 m pg + ) would be awesome , and it would benifit millions of people , but since fossil fuels seem to be one of the greatest contributors to pollution problems , would n't even a high milage system still only be prolonging the inevitable ?
I fully understand that this type of system would greatly reduce pollutants , but with the number of vehicles on the highways projected to increase by 25 % over the next five years alone , the problem of automobile air pollution still remains .
I believe Hydrogen may well be our next " gasoline " , and a system that could separate water into it 's basic components ( Hydrogen and Oxygen ) , burn the Hydrogen , and release the Oxygen into the air , would not only be a clean source of fuel , but it would actually make a contribution to our atmosphere in the form of Oxygen .
There is also research being conducted with Gravity Wave Generators , other types of Gravity propulsion , and probably a few that none of us have heard about just yet .
Of course the Oil Industries and Automobile manufacturers will try and convince us that our present fuels are the best thing going , but is n't it time we all started thinking for ourselves and believing a little less of what we are being spoon fed day by day ?
Maybe it 's time we started thinking " outside the box " just a little more ?
HI to you all !
I read the last post , on hear !
I have to say that I agree !
but the government , has not figured a way to put a road tax , on water yet !
and sense the government have there hands in the pockets of the oil companies , you know which side , the government is on !
they say that the economy hindges , around oil and gas !
so how would , the water distrubitors , give kick backs to the government ?
and when it comes to morals , or the ecolagy ,
putting your faith in your government , is like letting the fox gaurd the chickens !!
as we would not ever be able , to get the government , to say hey !!
the oil industry , is bad for the inviroment !
and we must take steps , to stop them !!
and the growth , as you say is expected to rise 25 % in the motor vehicles , in just five years !
so if the EPA of the vihicles that are on the road , could be raised ,
from 21 mpg to 60 mpg !
then yes we would be buying some time !
and just one more thing !!
food for though !
the EPA for vehicles , in 1988 was 22MPG and as 2004 it has dropped to 21MPG !
do n't you think this reflects the interest of our government ! in the inviroment ??
claude
Just throwing this out there .
Has anyone ever though of using ultrasonics to atomize the fuel .
Like those ultrasonic fog makers you see in shopping malls .
Makes a very fine fog out of vapors .
Might eliminate some fuel / heat issues .
Food for thought .
Cheers ....... Steve
Damien , would it be possible to get more info from you on your system you spoke about making Hydrogen ?
Mostly anything you will share adding digital pics too .
I have been studying about many different vaporizers to gain needed info first but now find interest in what you are doing .
If you can / will share this type of information , please email to me .
Thank you .

Hello , I have built a pogue carb that worked temporarily , but due to the fact that gas at the pump today is made so it will not completely vaporize below 400 degrees the carb only worked for a short time .
This is the oil companies way of preventing any back yard mechanics from building a successful vapor carb using gasoline .
Some food for thought .... what if you used high pressure to spray gasoline into such a fine mist that it actualy vaporized ?
This could be done using the fuel pump off of a diesel .
This is over 2000 psi.
so only hard lines should be used .
Another idea I would like to put out there is this .... has anyone taken a close look at the propane fuel system ?
Have you noticed that the propane carb is just a vapor mixing device that would work with any type of vapor !
The available BTU 's in propane is far greater than the system uses !
What if you added an oven expansion chamber to a propane system ?
This would expand the propane vapor before it enters the carb .
This could expand the propane to over 200 times itself and miles per gallon would follow the same multiplication .
Years go by and many people have tried so hard and spent so much time and money trying to find a system that will work .... there are many different ways that will work and for all of you who have hope and an undying devotion to succeed do n't ever give up !
Jake
I want a better carb for my boat it is a 1978 ford 302 .
Can you re-do my carb or sell me one that will work ?
I was looking for kustom karbs and found your site .
Their address is 720 Jordan Place Rockford , IL 61108
Jake , would it be possible to get pics emailed to me of your pogue endeavor ?
I am very interested in what you have built .
My email address is a couple of posts back .
ken55ford2001@yahoo.com
Ken ,
I can send you pictures of the carb but it wo n't give you any idea of what is inside .
To look at it from the outside you only see the external steel that surrounds the inner workings .
If you have ever seen a picture of the pogue carb you will notice that it has a spray chamber that creates a very rich mixture of fuel by spraying it through nozzles .
I created a chamber just for this and used a holley 110 fuel injection pump to provide the pressure to the spray nozzles .
The idea is to make sure you create a mixture so rich that it wo n't burn .
Now I piped the super rich mixture out of the top of this container and routed it through an oven that basically consist of a bunch of passages inside a round tube .
The idea is to bring the rich mixture in contact with the heat in the oven as much as possible .
This will dry the liquid droplets of fuel thus turning them into vapor .
Now comes the hard part ........ now that you have a dry gas vapor how do you mix it with the incoming air and control it in a way that it is a calibrated mixture for the engine to use ?!
I suggest buying a propane carb and using it as a mixture device .
I fabricated a single butterfly carb that was less than impressive .
Some things to think about before you get motivated to build ..... How will you heat your oven ....
It needs to reach 400 + degrees to evaporate the ingredients in todays gasoline .
Vapor burns so cool that the exhaust temps drop to a level that I couldnt even get to 300 degrees without increasing the rpm's to 2000 .
Another thing to consider ...... a propane carb needs 1.75 psi operating pressure to work so you must find an air pump that you can use to pressurize your system with .
I am sure you are noticing that there are an amazing amount of very important details that are left out of the description of these devices when you read the patent .
I have been looking for a long time now for a heat source that would provide 400 degrees in an automobile ...... I have n't found an air pump that would work for the system either ....
I do n't think pictures would give you enough detail of how I built this carb but I would be happy to email you some drawings of the internal workings ?
Let me know if your interested .
I will always find hope where others only see failure : )
Jake
Hey Jake .
Thanks for the answer .
Yes , please email me what you have and maybe we can expand on them .
Ken
Hello Ken ,
Did you get the sketchs I sent you ?
Jake
Hey Jake .
Yes I got them .
Sorry to say I have been really busy .
Working 12 hour days no days off since I got them .
Then the holidays ...
Hopefully get right to this after the holidays .
I do continue to research all I can about the related items we are talking about .
I do have resources to do up a system , just gathering knowledge at this time .
I 'll get back to you later .
Thanks for the info and more insight .
Damien , probably what you heard about it carbide , not carline .
Here is a bit of information carbide any one of a group of compounds that contain carbon and one other element that is either a metal , boron , or silicon .
Generally , a carbide is prepared by heating a metal , metal oxide , or metal hydride with carbon or a carbon compound .
Calcium carbide , CaC 2 , can be made by heating calcium oxide and coke in an electric furnace ; it reacts with water to yield acetylene and is an important source of the gas .
Barium carbide reacts similarly .
Aluminum carbide reacts with water to yield methane .
Some carbides are unaffected by water , e.g. , chromium carbide and silicon carbide .
Silicon carbide , almost as hard as diamond , is used as an abrasive .
Tungsten carbide , also very hard , is used for cutting edges of machine tools .
Iron carbides are present in steel , cast iron , and some other iron alloys .
found on http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/c1/carbide.asp
I remember people talking about using this for lamps , but be warned - there is danger of explosions .
It does not seem to be an effective fuel , probably because it costs more than what we are using now .
Sepp
If you want the most power for the least amount of fuel , use a jet engine .
Thats why the airforce changed away from internal combustion engines !
I have thoroughly read this entire discussion .
There is a lot of good info here , mostly trial and error , but hey it works .
A couple of you guys mentioned hydrogen .
Here is a site that I found and I plan on reproducing this unit as it seems to come from a legit source .
Check out this site : http://members.fortunecity.com/freeenergy2000/hydroboost.htm
Also , personally I think some of you guys should do research on Lean burning engines .
They are mostly made of ceramic 's that can withstand very high temperatures that would normally melt a cast - iron motor .
Toyota has been experimenting with Lean burn ceramic Diesels for the european market , but odds are if it is developed , it wo n't be here in the states for another 15 - 20 years .
I personally built a Chevrolet 396 with ceramic coated pistons , intake and exhaust valves , and a coated cylinder head chamber for durability .
This is pretty strong stuff .
You can put a blowtorch right up to the pistons and keep it there for a couple of minutes and it wo n't do anything .
The Thermal Barrier works and might be something to explore in addition to vaporization .
My motor should be able to take some leaning in moderation , although gains in Gas mileage would only be moderate , not 100 mpg .
If I got 20 around town , I 'd be happy .
Just my two cents
- Cory
Enjoyed scrolling through and reading the various posts , but the naysayers are not far from us .
I also remember reading about Smokey Yunick 's homemade V - 2 engine in a VW Rabbit that was in the April 1983 Popular Science and how the doubters came and drove his vehicle and wondered why it would n't knock when trying to start out in 4th gear .
Turns out that when you fully vaporize your fuel , the knocking problems are basically nonexistent .
That was the result from a friend of mine in Utah who had taken off the RH exhaust manifold from the 350 V8 engine in his full - size 1974 Chev pickup and installed a homemade heat exchanger , that had 16 feet of black pipe inside , which vaporized the gasoline when the tubes were exposed to the hot exhaust gases .
He started his truck on the 4 barrel Quadrajet carburetor and when it warmed up he shut off the gas flow to the carb , let the float bowl run dry and then switched it over to the vapors from the heat exchanger , which were fed into a modified propane - mixing device on top of the carburetor .
I drove the truck one time and we were on the highway when he asked me if I wanted to try his vapor system .
I said " yes , " so he shut off the fuel to the carb , let it run dry and switched over th the vapors and the truck picked up some speed .
What was really interesting is that the acceleration was so much better than the regular carburetor .
It is n't like it had the power of a supercharged street rod , but it was definitely an improvement .
He claimed 30 MPG with it , and I have no reason to doubt him .
We still need to ask ourselves , like someone stated above - if our modern fuel systems are so wonderful , why do we still have to have EGR valves and catalytic converters ?
Some people have theorized that a piece of nickel and / or platinum attached in some way to the top of a piston and the cylinder head actually helps gasoling to burn better in the combustion chamber .
I do n't remember if anyone above talked about the Fish carburetor by Robert Fish ( he has four patents in the USPTO )
and how it improved mileage simply by providing more streams of gasoline , which would then vaporize better .
You can buy almost anything in this world for money - even good ideas and inventions .
Use hot air from the exsaust manifold to the intake manifold .
This has been a garded secret for a while as car manufacturers make us believe the opisit : Build shrouds around the exhaust manifolds .
Most engines already have a shroud on one side .
V - 8 engines must have two shrouds t : .? enough hot air .
Heated air works with fuel injectkn too .
If you have a thermostatically controlled , vacuum actuated flap ~ your air cleaner intake , remove the control valve and add the second ( from the shroud you built ) to the of the air cleaner intake .
You must let NO cold air enter the air cleaner
Yet you must allow plenty of air to the engine .
I have found that a lot a air cleaners do not have large enough intake tubes and constrict the amou - of air going into the engines to the point that they actually lose power .
You will find that replacing the flimsy aluminum tube that came with your car with flexpipe to be a good idea .
There are several different types of flexpipe , some for exhaust , some for protecting electrical cables .
If you try it you wont be disapointed and its more than safe for an engine .
Temperatures are down because of better vaporisations .
If you have the now how also lean the engine down as the engine will be a little richer due to more vapor .
All due credit to George Wiseman at Eagle reseach for this idea and also a local in my town did this as well with good results .
I am not technical but very interested in the subject .
I want to mention the use of kerosine or petroleum in an engine .
Is this possible ?
Kerosine may be less " polluted " than gasoline .
The behaviour of kerosine must be considered ; ignition temperature , engine pressure and so on .
Wesley Gary 's magnetic motor design found at www.fevj.org/FEV-magnet-motor-by-W-W-Gary.php - as well as several other sites - is as simple as putting 2 permanent magnets facing each other so that they attract then , put a small electromagnet between them , with 2 sets of contacts mounted so that as it approaches either magnet , its poles are reversed
and it is repulsed back toward the other with a lot of force !
It is a design simple enough for anyone to build with little expense !
hey jake
have you ever thought of using gas made from corn to run the pogue carb ?
i know that it is totally clean burning with no additives and it increased the gas mileage on my 93 suburban from 18 to 35 mpg .
it has 235,000 and runs better now than it ever did before .
i had the pogue plans but have since lost them .
i saw it on a 67 galaxy 500 back in 70 and it got the 200 mpg . ( could never find anyone to build it for me )
it just seems to me that if you could use the corn fuel it might get even better than 200 mpg .
in ww2 the japs used this fuel to fly their planes like we used the pogue to run our tanks in africa .
http://waterpoweredcar.com/1978camero.html
I think these are genuen watercar plans using a plasma spark simular to JLN labs .
This is a totaly different approch to what i have normally seen using electrolisers but worth reading and deciding for yourself .
Click on the plans and also have a good read of this entire website
I know for a fact that holley made a carburetor for a 82 dodge pickup with a slant 6 it got 27 mpg with all kinds of power .
This carb .
was not suppose to get out of the factory , Could not get a carb kit for it .
It was not listed in the holley book for a rebuild kit , the carb it self was not listed in the price list .
not bad for a full size truck .
installed KUSTOM KARB KIT ON 2001 S10.INCREASED MPG BY ONLY 1 MPG .
terry , question for you .
You say ,
I had the pogue plans but have since lost them .
I saw it on a 67 galaxy 500 back in 70 and it got the 200 mpg . ( could never find anyone to build it for me )
Did you actually drive the 67 Galaxy or know someone that drove this car that got 200 MPG .
Or the paper said it will get 200 MPG .
There is a big difference between actually seeing the car get 200 MPG and only reading that it will get 200 MPG .

These are small differences you can make to gaining small but simple increases to better MPG .
I have tried the first one with the oxygen sensor : see below Cover Oxygen Sensors with Aluminum Foil :
Wrap your oxygen sensors in the exhaust pipe with 7 to 10 layers of shiny foil .
Advantage :
The car computer system depends on the oxygen sensors to adjust the air - fuel mixture being fed to the engine .
The cooler the exhaust gases , more fuel gets sent to the engine .
The hotter the exhaust gases , less fuel will be sent to the engine .
Directions :
To seal maximum warmth inside the exhaust pipe , insulation in the form of Reynolds Aluminum Foil is employed to insulate the oxygen sensor .
Wrap five inches in front and five inches after the sensor to keep it much warmer .
We double a one - foot section of foil and wrap that around the pipe and around the sensor itself .
Do not remove the sensor .
Then we repeat the process four more times .
Finally we use .030 " copper or aluminum wire to wind around the aluminum foil to keep it from blowing away and be sealed against water .
The wire comes from any welding supply .
The goal is to fool the car 's computer into sensing too rich a mixture so it adjusts with a slightly leaner mixture and possibly a slight advance in timing .
The end result is smoother engine operation and better MPG .
This trick is especially important in severe winter climates .
I have tried this one and normal rules are if an oxygen sensor gets hotter it is lean and tells the computer to richen , but the oxygen sensor doesnt work unless temperatures are above 600deg in the exsaust which i found out on a site so the computer if it doesnt get a response from the oxygen sensor automaticly richens the mixture .
I found this hard to believe but have tried it and since the engine is 20 % quiter and alittle bit more efficent .
When you do this just think what you can do to the intake air sensor .
Me personally i would add hot air .
I cant do this one cause i made a manual control to trick the computer : see below
Use Warm Air Intake : Modify intake to draw warm air near radiator .
Advantage : Deliver warm and smooth air to the intake for best MPG .
Directions : Disconnect the cold air hose or housing from the fender well .
Remove filter .
Clean up the parts .
Bore about 10 1 - 3/4 inch holes into plastic housing ( if this applies ) to draw air from the engine compartment directly to the air filter .
Deburr the holes and clean the parts .
Plug up the cold air inlet leading to the air collector box .
Reinstall the air filter assembly .
This will improve the engine Thermal Efficiency and mileage .
I am to try this one next week .
Basicly i would just make a shroud to sux intake hot air from the radiater with out any extra cold air coming in .
George Wiseman from Eagle research has done simular to this but using heat off the exsaust manifold with good results .
When i try this next week or so ill post the results .
If you want to see water burn on fire check this site www.joecell.com.au/video.html ( sorry , link gone bad - Sepp ) and go to the bottom of the page and download Sols BNE download video .
You will need cable or broadband for a fast download which it will still take 10 mins to do .
Know this vid goes for 10 - 15 min but watch it all and wait till they show you how to light water on fire .
They will say they are using negativly charged water which is a alkuline water from an irionizer .
If you dont know what a irionizer is just email me and ill send some plans how to make one as on the net there expensive ( $ 1000 plus for something so simple ) and you can build one for under $ 50 if ya skilled
The alkuline water from an irionizer you can drink and is very pure and it burns if ya do the right experiment same as the vid .
I would recommend you to download this vid quick cause i recond it will disapere eventually and burn a copy and keep it if your a enthusius researcher

yes i saw and road in the car .
the guy had a device that showed the car got 200 mpg .
it had lots of power .
i road in it for about a half hour .
have you ever seen one ?
i am from melbourne australia .
& yrs . ago I rebuilt my 79 old wagon ( ford )
It ran on straight gas similar to camp stove gas .
But for the auto industry .
A 5 speed manual .
29.88 mpg on a trip & 24.5 around town .
If I had been given all the secrets I have been told close 33 mpg . on a trip .
This fuel was a 3rd of the price of petrol at the time .
The man that told me how to do this ( john bennett ) did the same car on petrol with only some of his tricks & achieved 39.88 mpg .
A friend of his that owned the car said it was an 3 speed auto .
We actually belive that wec ould achieve 55 mpg using all of johns tricks .
my personal car had 20 - 25 % better torque .
My old boss just passed away & he built a carby out of perspex 15 - 20 yrs ago & got 63 mpg out of a GM 6 cyl .
The only problem is that it would ice up .
Yes people the vapour system similar to pouges carby .
We 're building a 100 mpg Saturn
This and other vehicles are being modified and all details will be fully disclosed .
Also debunking and testing devices and products of all kinds .

Sorry folks , you 're all dreaming .
Everyone knows that for emissions purposes todays cars are tested for unburned hydrocarbons at the exhaust .
I 've had 18 mpg non catalytic engines showing less than 200 parts per million of hydrocarbons in the exhaust .
This means that more than 99.98 % of the fuel was being burned .
There 's nothing left to get extra energy from .
The fuel is a fine mist when entering the combustion chamber and when the pressure is increased 9 times on the compression stroke it ALL explodes .
Carnot 's theorem dictates the maximum possible thermal efficiency in any heat engine as being wholey dependent on the maximum temperature in the cycle .
You 'd need temperatures well over 10,000 F to get efficiencies that would get 200 mpg on a v - 8 .
The maximum temperature you can run any engine at is limited by metallurgy and lubrication .
Your pistons and valves would liquify instantly at 10,000 F , you 're oil would turn to carbon at 700 F .
This is why engines have thermostats at 180 F , to keep them from frying .
These phantom carburetors are all nonsense .
The honda insight which got 90 mpg did it with a tiny , low friction loss engine , outstanding aerodynamics , and by running at near full throttle and then coasting a while , all at 35 mph or so .
This type of driving maximizes fuel efficiency , as gas engines run their most efficient ( hp per unit of fuel consumed ) when running wide open ( highest safe combustion temperature , and lowest losses from engine vacuum pulling against the pistons during the intake stroke ) .
The car company that comes out with a 200 mpg conventionally sized car would make many many billions in its first year of production .
They havent done it because it's an impossible dream to do it with just a carburetor .
Sorry folks , but you 're all dreaming .
Ken Jones must be one of the Petroleum Company staff or sort of .
Do n't fool us with your words of " wishdom " .
I have seen a small drop amount of fuel ignited with tremendous heat and light generated .
Those people died after invented something which can threaten the benefit of petoleum company will die .
Are n't it that way ?
They will assainate who ever try to make fuel uprofitable .

Obviously you have learned what you know from a text book .
A text book tells you what you can and cant do .
Just like a water power car is imposible ay .
The people that have made such a unit never read any info from a text book .
They went and did it .
George Wiseman from Eagle Research built many fuel saving units and never was trained from a text book .
A text book is made from and designed to tell you what you need to know .
Vested intrest ( Oil companies ) spend lots on helping designs on what machanics need to know .
Thats why you see donations of equipement to collages so they got thier foot in the door .
They dont want the secrets to get out so they loose money .
If you believed everything that is written from a text book you deserve to be the normal idiot that will get now where in life .
Just like our doctors text books .
There are plenty of cures for cancer but our docters arnt trained for this cause our governments cant afford to cure everyone .
Its a fact .
Pull yta heads out of the sand and explore .
Sorry ... Ken Johns how much do you get paid to write that garbage you just wrote on behalf of what ever oil intrest .
the problem with a 200 mile per gallon carburator is that if you want to get a patent for it it is like a free energy device which falls under the dept .of defense so if you apply for a patent you cant do anything with it for ten years .
the govt .has all the info they need to produce these but they are so tied in with oil companies and big dollars that it will never happen .
they just dont care
Sorry guys , I 'm just a damned good mechanic / world class mad scientist tinkerer with a mechanical engineering / thermodynamics background , I 'm not an oil company assassin or spokesman .
Truths : yes , you can improve gas mileage by running as engine super lean ( up to the point where it starts misfiring ) , yes you can use exhaust heat to provide heat of vaporization for your fuel and improve your mileage slightly , yes you can fool with air fuel ratios and intake temperatures to the point where your engine runs weak and thus gain the benefit of running nearly wide open just to produce half the horsepower ( wide open throttle reduces losses due to engine vacuum pulling against the pistons on the intake stroke ) .
High temperature intakes also reduce the density of the incoming mixture and keep the engine from drawing in a large volume of air , killing your maximum horsepower .
It also immensely increases nitrous oxide emissions ( causes smog ) .
You can do much better by putting a 20 hp conventional engine in your car and running it wide open all the time .
You can run an engine with water injection in the intake , thus increasing the density and volume of the intake charge and get more available horsepower ( the same thing happens with good old fashioned nitrous oxide setups you see at the race track ) but you 'll also just be using MORE fuel boiling all this water and tossing the steam ( and the energy it took to boil it ) out the exhaust pipe .
The sad truth is that unless you want to run with no power or fry your engine in a few hundred miles , or unless you have huge money to build an engine that can withstand super high temperatures by using ceramics , titanium , and some nonexistant miracle oil that wo n't degrade at high temps then you cant beat a smaller harder working conventional fuel injected engine .
Believe what you want , believe in your conspiracy theories if it makes you happy , but the fuel injection computer knows far better than you guys how to get maximum efficiency without pollution .
Dream on guys .
Ken I take it you have played or experimented with EFI vehicals or know someone that has and failed .
I can explain this and its a simple modifacation to trick the computer .
If you add a fuel saver of some sort eg a vapor system , water injection or extra fuel system the computer reads it as extra vacume and adds fuel .
George Wiseman over come this problem with a simple mod to trick the computer and no engine parts got extra hot or melted .
I have also proved you can run a car on vapor ( experimeted with an MGB with SU carbs ) as well to cut down the fuel usage on the carb as not all fuel vaporises .
EFI is a different kettle of fish to play with when adding any vapor unit such as the HYCO or what ever .
Ken you being a scientist enthusist or hobbyist or what ever , would you agree with me that only vapor burns in a engine .
If only vapor burns in an engine we can lean the engine down and run it but the engine will get hot and start doing damage .
Car manufactures overcome this by richening the fuel system which is what we know to slow down the heat process .
Ok why cant we keep the engine lean and then use water injection or a vapor unit to cool the temps down .
Would you agree by only using vapor in a engine that it would run cooler .
Would you also agree that you would have more power as only vapor burns .
If we had a system with adding more vapor so we can cut back our exsisting fuel system would you agree that we can throw away the catalac converter .
Ken if your a smart man which no doubt you are what would happen id you decided to start using a pump to blow bubbles in your fuel tank .
We would creater more fumes or vapor is that correct .
Lets forget the danger of a backfire as this can be overcome with a backfire arrester or one way valve .
If we were to add this vapor to our exsisting fuel system wouldnt we lean of the carb .
Ok number one Temps wouldnt be as hot cause more vapor is burning than before .
You have the vapor burning from your normal carb with this extra vapor so we now have more vapor in our combustion chamber than before with more power and less polution is that correct .
We can govern how much vapor we want by how much air we blow through the tank .
Now im not considering that we could also use a water heater hose and heat up a return line if we had one to create extra vapor as well in the tank or using a heater water coil in the tank to get more vapor as well .
Ok we still need to run a carb or injecters to swirt some fuel as not all fuel can vaporise completely .
Also Ken what would happen if we started heating up our oil vapor from the breather on the cyclinder head or tappet cover that goes to the intake manifold .
If we wraped a copper coil around the exsust manifold and sent the oil vapors from the engine and heated them up arnt we breaking it down into a burnable state .
I have proved this on a desiel and now get an extra 28 % milage by something so simple and cheap .
People say what if you got a back fire well iv been driving the van like that for months and months and havnt encounted such thing .
So Ken what we have to ask is how much fuel in our fuel system acually burns as vapor to combust considering our catalact converter burns most of it cause we need an engine to be richened up so it dont melt .
Id say less than 40 % actually burns in the combustion chamber if that .
We all read from a text book what we can do or cant do .
But is our text book genuan .
Oil companies control car companies and also machanics are only taught how to fix something , not make it better .
Why arnt machanics taught this .
You cant tell me its a conspirisy theroy .
I am currently working on the Joe cell which is a water fuel cell .
Scientist say it takes to much power to create enough hydrogen to power a car .
Well the Joe cell uses water but you dont need lots of power to run it .
You and others say well keep dreaming your being conned .
Well at lest 6 people i know has a working unit and im going to see one in the next week or two and will take my cell with me so i can be shown the craft of it to get it running myself .
This unit can do well over 400 kms on a cup and a half of water .
No one can explain how and why it works .
No text book even mentions it and denys such thing is posible .
Explain that .
No comspirisy there , just a working unit that no scientist invented , a back yard guy with no scientific education invented it and many other backyard guys are getting thiers working .
Ken we have to ask our selves is the text book viable with what it says , is it genuan .
If you want to fly over and come with me to see this working unit you are very welcome .
Throw away that text book and start gain .
Damien , I truly wish you luck with your endeavors .
I do have a couple questions though .
My old carbureted 351 windsor ford van ( 18 mpg / pretty good for a clubwagon ) ) with no catalytic converter had less than 200 parts per million of hydrocarbons in the exhaust .
That 's less than two one hundredths of one percent of unburned fuel .
If the fuel were a hundred dollars , the unburned fuel in the exhaust would be two cents .
IT ALL BURNS !!!!!!

KIEV , Ukraine ( CNN ) --
Ukraine 's parliament elected pro-Western former premier Yulia Tymoshenko as its new prime minister on Tuesday , the Ukrinform national news agency reported .
Yulia Tymoshenko celebrates after becoming elected as the prime minister of the Ukraine .
Tymoshenko won the vote with the minimum number of 226 votes , Ukrinform said .
She had failed to win the election a week earlier after receiving only 225 votes , but the 450 - member parliament then decided to change the voting procedure by rejecting the electronic system in favor of a show of hands .
However , the close result leaves her opposition -- led by pro-Russia former prime minister Viktor Yanukovych -- in a strong position to fight initiatives by the reformist coalition .
With her trademark blond braid crowning her head , Tymoshenko has been a recognizable figure in Ukrainian politics .
She appeared alongside then - candidate Victor Yushchenko during Ukraine 's Orange Revolution in late 2004 , protesting rigged elections which were later overturned .
When Yushchenko then became president , Tymoshenko was his ally in parliament and served as prime minister until September 2005 , when Yushchenko fired her amid allegations of corruption .
The 47 - year - old Tymoshenko then started an eponymous bloc in the Verkhovna Rada , or Ukrainian parliament , and patched up her differences with Yushchenko earlier this year .
On a visit to Washington in February , Tymoshenko spoke to congressional leaders and Vice President Dick Cheney about Ukraine 's need for independence from Russia .
" It 's an ongoing fight for Ukraine 's strategic choice : either to become a European country on the path to democracy or to fall back into the post - Soviet sphere and step by step lose its political and energy independence , " Tymoshenko told CNN at the time .
She said Russia was putting pressure on Ukraine over energy supplies , including a complete shut - off of gas supplies to Ukraine which affected the rest of Europe .
She vowed not to let Russia treat Ukraine as its own territory , " like a little brother . "
" The revolution was just the beginning , " Tymoshenko told CNN .
" It 's still a fight and a very difficult job to give birth to real democracy in our country . "

London City Airport in London , England is pictured in this undated file photo .
Aircraft taking off from London City Airport have had their compasses affected by iron and steel buried below the runway , leading to significant navigation problems , a British air safety monitor said on Monday .
REUTERS / File
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Aircraft taking off from London City Airport have had their compasses affected by iron and steel buried below the runway , leading to significant navigation problems , a British air safety monitor said on Monday .
The main culprit is recycled oil pipelines used as steel casing on concrete piles that underpin the holding area where aircraft prepare for take - off , as well as buried railway lines and bollards , the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said .
The AAIB issued six safety recommendations , including that the steel casing be removed and pilots flying to / from London City Airport be routinely reminded in flight plans there is a magnetic anomaly which can affect their aircraft ’s instruments .
The moves follow an AAIB inquiry into an incident on October 31 , 2006 when a Raytheon Hawker 800XP experienced difficulties navigating after taking off from the airport and had to return .
The incident was one in a series of navigation problems dating from January 2000 for aircraft leaving London City Airport .
Some were attributed to pilot error at the time .
“ A walk around the Runway 28 holding area with a hand - held magnetic compass by an AAIB inspector showed that there were some large and strong magnetic anomalies that made the compass needle deviate by up to +/- 60 degrees , ” the AAIB said .
Scientists called in to the airport , which is on the site of old docks in east London , found major magnetic anomalies from the steel casing , and a lesser effect from old railway lines and cast iron bollards that were used to tie up ships .
These were covered over during construction of the airport .
London City Airport , which has one runway , was not immediately available for comment .

“ SCIENCE ” is a recently coined word .
When the Royal Society , the world 's oldest academy of the discipline , was founded in London in 1660 , the subject was referred to as natural philosophy .
In the 19th century , though , nature and philosophy went their separate ways as the natural philosophers grew in number , power and influence .
Nevertheless , the link between the fields lingers on in the name of one of the Royal Society 's journals , Philosophical Transactions .
And appropriately , the latest edition of that publication , which is devoted to the science of climate modelling , is in part a discussion of the understanding and misunderstanding of the ideas of one particular 18th - century English philosopher , Thomas Bayes .
Bayes was one of two main influences on the early development of probability theory and statistics .
The other was Blaise Pascal , a Frenchman .
But , whereas Pascal 's ideas are simple and widely understood , Bayes 's have always been harder to grasp .
Pascal 's way of looking at the world was that of the gambler : each throw of the dice is independent of the previous one .
Bayes 's allows for the accumulation of experience , and its incorporation into a statistical model in the form of prior assumptions that can vary with circumstances .
A good prior assumption about tomorrow's weather , for example , is that it will be similar to today's .
Assumptions about the weather the day after tomorrow , though , will be modified by what actually happens tomorrow .
Psychologically , people tend to be Bayesian — to the extent of often making false connections .
And that risk of false connection is why scientists like Pascal 's version of the world .
It appears to be objective .
But when models are built , it is almost impossible to avoid including Bayesian - style prior assumptions in them .
By failing to acknowledge that , model builders risk making serious mistakes .
Assume nothing
In one sense it is obvious that assumptions will affect outcomes — another reason Bayes is not properly acknowledged .
That obviousness , though , buries deeper subtleties .
In one of the papers in Philosophical Transactions David Stainforth of Oxford University points out a pertinent example .
Climate models have lots of parameters that are represented by numbers — for example , how quickly snow crystals fall from clouds , or for how long they reside within those clouds .
Actually , these are two different ways of measuring the same thing , so whether a model uses one or the other should make no difference to its predictions .
And , on a single run , it does not .
But models are not given single runs .
Since the future is uncertain , they are run thousands of times , with different values for the parameters , to produce a range of possible outcomes .
The outcomes are assumed to cluster around the most probable version of the future .
The particular range of values chosen for a parameter is an example of a Bayesian prior assumption , since it is derived from actual experience of how the climate behaves — and may thus be modified in the light of experience .
But the way you pick the individual values to plug into the model can cause trouble .
They might , for example , be assumed to be evenly spaced , say 1,2,3,4 .
But in the example of snow retention , evenly spacing both rate - of - fall and rate - of - residence - in - the - clouds values will give different distributions of result .
That is because the second parameter is actually the reciprocal of the first .
To make the two match , value for value , you would need , in the second case , to count 1 , ½ , ⅓ , ¼— which is not evenly spaced .
If you use evenly spaced values instead , the two models ' outcomes will cluster differently .
Climate models have hundreds of parameters that might somehow be related in this sort of way .
To be sure you are seeing valid results rather than artefacts of the models , you need to take account of all the ways that can happen .
That logistical nightmare is only now being addressed , and its practical consequences have yet to be worked out .
But because of their philosophical training in the rigours of Pascal 's method , the Bayesian bolt - on does not come easily to scientists .
As the old saw has it , garbage in , garbage out .
The difficulty comes when you do not know what garbage looks like .

I 'm currently playing Manhunt 2 on my my cracked psp , modded so I can see all the delicious torture sequences uncensored .
And though I 've been generally enthused about getting the chance to act out my innermost violent urges I 'm really more pleased to just be playing it before Sir Cucumber .
To be sure , the executions have gotten all the attention prior to Manhunt 2's release and I agree that they are chillingly violent , but on the psp and ps2 the graphics are so muddy and the characters so sparsely rendered ( seriously , you can count the polygons ) that you can barely make anything out .
What modding does do is remove the jarring , blinding , mind - searing colorform crapfest that flashes on the screen any time you kill someone .
You are already squinting at the psp , hunched close to make anything out even with the brightness cranked up , and then suddenly it feels like you 've been hit with a hot poker in the brain via entry through the left nostril .
I 'm of a mind that this is the ultimate victory for ESRB :
In order to satisfy their demands Rockstar did n't just obscure the death sequences but did so in a way that conditions you to NOT want to perform them .
Also , your avatar will occasionally vomit on his victim 's corpse afterward , as if to press the point further home .
Why do they always wear masks in Manhunt games ?
MANCHESTER , N.H.  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York rode a wave of female support to a surprise victory over Senator Barack Obama in the New Hampshire Democratic primary on Tuesday night .
In the Republican primary , Senator John McCain of Arizona revived his presidential bid with a Lazarus - like victory .
The success of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain followed their third - and fourth - place finishes in the Iowa caucuses last week .
Mrs. Clinton ’s victory came after her advisers had lowered expectations with talk of missteps in strategy and concern about Mr. Obama ’s momentum after his first - place finish in Iowa .
Her team is now planning to add advisers and undertake a huge fund - raising drive to prepare for a tough and expensive fight with Mr. Obama in the Democratic nominating contests over the next four weeks .
Mr. McCain had pursued a meticulous and dogged turnaround effort : his second bid for the White House was in tatters last summer because of weak fund - raising and a blurred political message , leading him to fire senior advisers and refocus his energy on New Hampshire .
Several New Hampshire women , some of them undecided until Tuesday , said that a galvanizing moment for them had been Mrs. Clinton ’s unusual display of emotion on Monday as she described the pressures of the race and her goals for the nation  a moment Mrs. Clinton herself acknowledged as a breakthrough .
In a new paper examining the Sony BMG rootkit fiasco , a pair of lawyers argue that the music company did n't just damage itself — it unwittingly struck a blow against DRM in general .
Deirdre Mulligan and Aaron Perzanowski are the authors of " The Magnificence of the Disaster , " which looks at the entire chronology of Sony BMG 's problems with CD copy protection technology in an attempt to understand just how the label could have made a blunder of this magnitude .
The paper , published in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal , argues that the rootkit was the result of more than " utter disregard , or even contempt , for user security and privacy . "
It was a product of market , technology , and legal factors that all encouraged Sony BMG to go forward with its ill - advised plan .
The music business continues to sink , and it 's understandable that labels like Sony BMG would grab at any available life raft .
Upset about P2P trading of its songs and swapping between friends , the company hoped to eliminate one of the main sources of pristine - quality digital rips : the unprotected CD .
But how could it have added the badly buggy software from both First4 Internet and SunnComm to millions of discs without doing any due diligence on the possible ramifications ?
The authors argue that simple negligence or lack of technical expertise is a hard explanation to believe , especially as Sony ( which owns a big chunk of the label ) has wide technical expertise in this matter that Sony BMG could easily have drawn on .
Security researchers , who identified the problem after the CDs were released , could also have done so ahead of time had they been consulted .
The most likely explanation for deploying the CD - based DRM was that " Sony BMG likely underestimated the public reaction to the security and privacy threats created by its DRM . "
In other words , the company took a calculated risk that consumers would n't care about these issues and found later that it guessed wrong .
Consumer backlash may have been particularly strong in this case because consumers already have an expectation of privacy and control when listening to CDs that they do n't necessarily have when using Internet - enabled software , for instance .
" Consumers consider the playing of the CD to be a private passive act and one carries no risk of attack from the outside world , " say the paper 's authors .
" One security and privacy threats intruded upon the snow and safety , consumers reacted with unexpectedly intense indignation . "
It also did n't help that buyers had paid the same amount as other CDs but received less functionality in return .
The DMCA may have also contributed to Sony BMG 's calculation to deploy the software .
Because the DMCA bars the circumvention of effective copy protection technologies in almost all cases , even security researchers worry about looking too deeply into how the technologies work .
This " chilling effect " may have led the music label to conclude that its system did not have to be extensively vetted before deployment , as it could always file DMCA lawsuits against those who researched the copy protection software .
To correct the problem , the paper argues that the DMCA needs reformation ; specifically , it needs a permanent statutory exemption " that enables researchers and lay users to proactively identify and remove dangerous protection measures from their systems . "
It also would n't hurt for the FTC to lay down " best practices " for software installation and removal .
Although things turned out badly for Sony BMG , anti-DRM advocates may be pleased at the fallout .
By raising the public profile of DRM and making users aware of its many downsides , the rootkit incident may have contributed to a broader move away from DRM among music labels .
The rootkit " undermined consumer acceptance of digital rights management technology , " according to the paper 's authors , and may have helped spur labels like EMI and Universal to experiment with opening up downloads , rather than trying to restrict CDs .
With non-lethal weapon manufacturers such as TASER International constantly finding new and insidious ways to incapacitate " non-compliant individuals , " it 's only natural that those folks who have frequent encounters with stun gun-toting authorities would want protection from their piercing , electrifying barbs .
Well a gentleman from Arizona named Gregory Russell Schultz apparently empathizes with this demographic , and has filed a patent for an " energy weapon protection device " -- essentially a jacket embedded with alternating layers of conductive and non-conductive panels that complete an electrical circuit and leave the wearer impervious to the shocks of what would likely be a very surprised officer of the law .
If they can retrofit our Members Only jacket in this manner , we 're sold .

IT WAS a sorry end .
Cut down in his prime , the cunning thief lay on the slab , his cold body offering pathologist Brett Gartrell no outward sign of how he had met his maker .
Once Gartrell had wielded his scalpel , however , the cause became clear : a belly stuffed with sticky brown gunk .
Diagnosis ?
Death by chocolate .
Divine – yes .
Delicious – absolutely .
But deadly ?
For some it certainly is .
The corpse on Gartrell ’s slab belonged not to a human but to a kea , an endangered New Zealand parrot .
Like many animals , keas are acutely sensitive to chemicals in chocolate that are harmless to humans in all but huge doses .
Scientists are now studying these chemicals , along with other substances in cocoa , hoping to exploit their toxic effects to control pests or microbes .
If you ’re reading this after scoffing your fifteenth chocolate Santa , do n’t panic : we humans have been safely enjoying the beans of the cacao plant , Theobroma cacao , for millennia .
Theobroma is Greek for “ food of the gods ” , reflecting the Mayan belief that cocoa had divine origins .
Every April , they sacrificed a dog with cacao - coloured markings in honour of Ek Chuah , the god of cacao .
Knife - wielding priests aside , chocolate is still bad news for many animals .
Cocoa beans are naturally rich in caffeine and its chemical relatives theobromine and theophylline , collectively called methylxanthines .
To humans these are little more than benign stimulants , but to a number of animals they are highly toxic .
Just 240 grams of unsweetened dark chocolate contains enough methylxanthines to kill a 40 - kilogram dog , about the size of a German shepherd .
It was methylxanthines that did for the kea …
MIAMI  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton won the Florida Democratic primary on Tuesday , a contest that generated extraordinary voter interest even though the result will have no practical impact because no delegates were at stake .
With 95 percent of the vote counted , Mrs. Clinton , of New York , was running ahead of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , 50 percent to 33 percent .
Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina was third , with 14 percent .
None of the Democratic candidates campaigned actively here , fulfilling a pledge to Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina , the four states that had permission to hold early primaries , in response to Florida Democrats jumping the line by scheduling their primary before Feb .
5 . But supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama worked hard to get their voters to the polls to make a symbolic show of strength .
Mrs. Clinton ’s victory was expected and may have largely reflected her prominence on the national political scene for almost two decades .
She did well among those who cast their votes early ; among late deciders , Mr. Obama matched her almost one for one , according to exit polls conducted by Edison / Mitofsky .
“ There is an effort to accelerate the bottom - up reconciliation , ” said one Defense Department official who declined to speak on the record .
“ The idea is to capitalize on the unexpected progress made at the provincial level through the Sunni awakening and efforts to work with former insurgents .
We are increasing Iraqi and American money being invested in the provinces . ”
The money would come , the official said , by spending State Department funds through provincial reconstruction teams , which are finally being deployed in significant numbers .
Some would come from American military commanders , who have emergency funds at their disposal , and some from a Department of Defense program to generate jobs by revitalizing state - owned industries — a reversal of the privatization effort begun by American forces four years ago .
The reduction in attacks on Americans in Anbar , according to current and recently departed officials , has fueled a new optimism in the White House that Republican defections from Mr. Bush ’s overall Iraq policy will be limited , and that Democrats will once again find themselves unable to assemble the votes to cut off financing or force an early withdrawal of troops .
But Mr. Bush ’s argument that Anbar is a locus of progress has drawn fire from Democrats and critics of his war strategy , who say that he is picking out a single tactical accomplishment and ignoring broader strategic failures that have been documented by the intelligence community , the Government Accountability Office and an independent commission examining the Iraqi military and police .
The president is expected to argue that what has happened in Anbar is beginning to be replicated in Diyala Province and other places , and that to pull back now — and fail to reward the Sunnis in Anbar — would halt the first significant gains that American forces had made against the insurgency in four years .
Officials were cautious about discussing Friday ’s Pentagon meeting .
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were said to have used it to hear a variety of viewpoints , officials said , including lengthy descriptions from the Joint Chiefs about how the increase in forces is unsustainable beyond spring without extending the tours of forces already in Iraq .
Several aides to Mr. Bush have said in recent weeks that such extensions are so politically unpalatable that they are not under consideration unless an emergency breaks out requiring the use of American forces elsewhere in the world .
But Mr. Bush , they said , is also unlikely to wait until April to begin the drawdown .
If he does so , he would have to pull troops out at the same pace at which he sent them this year , about a brigade a month , the officials said .
By beginning a drawdown slightly earlier , the officials say , Mr. Bush would both maximize his flexibility and avoid having to stick to a strict timeline for withdrawal , which the president has said in the past would signal to enemy forces exactly when and how quickly American forces would begin to leave .
George Bush was castigated by European diplomats and found himself isolated yesterday after a special conference on climate change ended without any progress .
European ministers , diplomats and officials attending the Washington conference were scathing , particularly in private , over Mr Bush 's failure once again to commit to binding action on climate change .
Although the US and Britain have been at odds over the environment since the early days of the Bush administration , the gap has never been as wide as yesterday .
Britain and almost all other European countries , including Germany and France , want mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse emissions .
Mr Bush , while talking yesterday about a " new approach " and " a historic undertaking " , remains totally opposed .
The conference , attended by more than 20 countries , including China , India , Britain , France and Germany , broke up with the US isolated , according to non-Americans attending .
One of those present said even China and India , two of the biggest polluters , accepted that the voluntary approach proposed by the US was untenable and favoured binding measures , even though they disagreed with the Europeans over how this would be achieved .
A senior European diplomat attending the conference , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the meeting confirmed European suspicions that it had been intended by Mr Bush as a spoiler for a major UN conference on climate change in Bali in December .
" It was a total charade and has been exposed as a charade , " the diplomat said .
" I have never heard a more humiliating speech by a major leader .
He [ Mr Bush ] was trying to present himself as a leader while showing no sign of leadership .
It was a total failure . "
John Ashton , Britain 's special envoy on climate change , who attended the conference , said : " It is striking here how isolated the US has become on this issue .
There is no support among the industrialised countries for the proposition that we should proceed on the basis of voluntary commitments .
" The most inspiring example of leadership this week was the speech on Monday at the UN by Arnold Schwarzenegger . "
The governor of California is already putting into action in the state policies to reduce carbon emissions .
Other European governments expressed similar sentiments .
Although many of those attending had predicted the conference would break up without significant agreement , there had been hopes that Mr Bush , in search of a legacy , might produce a surprise .
Instead , he stuck to his previous position , shunning mandatory caps in favour of clean coal , nuclear power and developing clean energy technology .
In contrast with the early years of his presidency when he expressed scepticism about climate change and whether humans were responsible , Mr Bush acknowledged yesterday " energy security and climate change are two of the great challenges of our time .
The United States takes these challenges seriously . "
He added : " Our guiding principle is clear : we must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions , and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity . "
Instead of mandatory caps , he emphasised a need to shift to clean coal , nuclear energy and new clean technology .
He also proposed a new international technology fund but did not say how much the US would put into it .
He reiterated a need for Americans to shift from oil to ethanol for their cars .
" We 're working to develop next - generation plug - in hybrids that will be able to travel nearly 40 miles without using a drop of gasoline .
And your automobile does n't have to look like a golf cart , " he said .
Elizabeth Bast , of Friends of the Earth , described the conference as a diversion .
" We have heard it before .
He put a huge emphasis on technology and does not speak to binding targets , and there is a great emphasis on coal and nuclear energy , " she said .
Backstory
Many US states have embarked on their own programmes , with California leading the way .
The governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has signed a law requiring a 25 % cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 , with penalties for industries that do not comply .
California 's three biggest utilities must produce at least 20 % of their electricity using renewable sources by 2010 .
The fundamental problem in all of this is that women and girls are dehumanized , opening the floodgates to every kind of mistreatment .
“ Once you dehumanize somebody , everything else is possible , ” said Taina Bien - Aimé , executive director of the women ’s advocacy group Equality Now .
A grotesque exercise in the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri ’s Ranch , a legal brothel about an hour ’s ride outside of Vegas .
There the women have to respond like Pavlov ’s dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night .
At the sound of the bell , the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up , virtually naked , and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by .
If you do n’t think this is an issue worthy of a presidential campaign , consider the scandalous way that women are treated in the military and the fact that the winner of this election will become the commander in chief .
The sexual mistreatment of women in the military is widespread .
The Defense Department financed a study in 2003 of female veterans seeking health assistance from the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Nearly a third of those surveyed said they had been the victim of a rape or attempted rape during their service .
The Associated Press reported in 2006 that more than 80 military recruiters had been disciplined over the course of a year because of sexual misconduct with young women and girls who had considered joining the military .
There continue to be widespread complaints from women about rape and other forms of sexual attacks in the military , and about a culture that tends to protect the attackers .

I love real - life stories of people who get rich slowly .
Paul Navone , a 78 - year - old resident of Millville , New Jersey , is one of those .
On December 21st , Navone donated $ 1 million to Cumberland County College .
He still has millions left .
How did he earn his money ?
The old - fashioned way : lots of hard work .
Navone never attended high school .
He began working in local glass factories at the age of 16 .
In 50 years , he never made more than $ 11 per hour , often putting in 60 hour weeks .
He never experienced a windfall ; instead , he practiced thrift , put some money in savings accounts and he invested in the stock market .
“ Paul never inherited money , ” his broker told The Press of Atlantic City .
“ Paul started from zero .
He just worked hard .
He stayed the course even through the bad markets .
Paul rarely ever took money out .
He was the perfect client . ”
The newspaper 's editors write :
Such a life seems almost impossible to live today , does n't it ?
Get rich merely by working hard and saving and investing ?
Then not spending any of that investment income ?
Simply accumulating wealth that way is impressive and praiseworthy .
But then to start giving it way — to give $ 1 million to a small community college ?
All because of hard work , thrift and a spirit of generosity ?
Paul Navone is one rare , rare individual — and a lesson for us all in this age of conspicuous consumption .
Navone shops at flea markets , drives an older SUV , and rarely buys anything at full price .
He does n't own a phone or a television .
Though he 's something of a recluse , he leads a happy life — one of his hobbies is announcing a BINGO game at the local McDonald 's every Wednesday morning .
His wealth came from frugal living , wise investing , and from owning several rental properties .
Navone 's story is a perfect example of the power of time .
If you 're patient , your money will grow , and wealth will come .
It 's fun to watch Navone 's story develop gradually in the pages of The Press of Atlantic City .

At least 46,600 children along the Gulf Coast are still struggling with mental health problems and other serious aftereffects of 2005 hurricanes , according to a new study by the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and the Children ’s Health Fund .
Many of these children are performing poorly in school and have limited access to medical care , according to the study , which combines government statistics with data collected by a group of researchers that has been closely following about 1,250 families displaced by the storm .
The children most at risk are those who have returned to their home states of Louisiana and Mississippi but lack stable living situations , the study says .
They are children like Nicole D. Riley ’s daughter Isis , who is about to turn 4 .
Her family left New Orleans the day before Hurricane Katrina and moved five times over a short period before ending up in the large government - operated trailer park in Baker , La .
All those moves “ really did n’t sit well with her , ” Ms. Riley said of her daughter .
“ When we got out here to the park , she was out of control , out of hand .
She was not like that before the storm . ”

Active chemical from peppers allows painkilling without affecting other sensations .
An anaesthetic method that kills pain without producing numbness or preventing movement has been developed .
Pain relief : good for moms - to - be Photodisc
Current local anaesthetics work by indiscriminately blocking all the channels in a nerve cell , so they can block movement and sensation as well as pain .
However , the new technique involves using a combination of two compounds to home in on pain - sensing nerves in a specific area , leaving other functions unaffected .
It could prove useful for situations where patients require anaesthetic , but also need to be able to move or control muscles , such as in childbirth and in some dental procedures .
Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School in Boston , Massachusetts , and his colleagues targeted the pain by taking advantage of an ion channel called TRPV1 , which is only present in pain - sensing nerve cells .
This channel opens when it senses capsaicin , the active ingredient in chilli peppers .
“ It ’s a match made in heaven ” Michael Caterina
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Working on cultures of neurons , the researchers used capsaicin to open the ion channel , allowing their painkiller of choice — a local anaesthetic called QX - 314 — to enter the cell .
QX - 314 is similar to the commonly - used local anaesthetic lidocaine , but , unlike lidocaine , it has no effect unless it is acting from within a cell .
The team found that capsaicin did indeed allow the anaesthetic to only enter pain - sensing neurons , where it could then dampen the action of these cells .
The combination of compounds also worked in live animals .
When the team injected rats with QX - 314 and capsaicin , the animals did n’t react to a normally - painful stimulus applied to their foot once the painkiller had taken effect .
But the rats could move around as normal .
The team ’s results are reported online in Nature1 .
Better together
Capsaicin is already in use as a painkiller for conditions where pain fibres are overactive , says Michael Caterina of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , Maryland , who also studies the TRPV1 channel .
Applying it overstimulates the nerve endings and de-sensitises them , persuading them to stop overreacting .
But , as its link to chilli peppers suggests , it produces an uncomfortable burning sensation and ca n’t be given in high doses .
Caterina say he thinks the new study is a neat trick , because it may be able to get around this problem .
As the capsaicin and anaesthetic are applied at the same time , the capsaicin grants the anaesthetic admission to the cell , where activity is dampened down so that pain ( including the burning sensation ) is relieved .
“ It ’s a match made in heaven , ” he says .
“ They ’ve taken a number of reagents in common use in pain , and put them together in a very creative way . ”
Better for baby
A number of clinical procedures could benefit from a local anaesthetic that does n’t paralyse or numb the patient .
The most obvious is childbirth , where retaining muscle control is important .
The commonly - used epidural , which involves injecting anaesthetic into the spine to block the nerves leading to the womb and lower parts of the body , also blocks all movement and feeling , making it harder for the mother - to - be to ‘ push ’ the baby out .
Another use could be in dentistry , where blocking some nerves can lead to unhelpful drooling .
The method could also be used to treat some chronic pain conditions , where constant pain is caused by abnormally active pain fibres .
Developing the technique for clinical use should n’t be too difficult because the two substances are already approved for clinical use .
“ Our prediction is that it should be as safe as lidocaine , ” says co-author Clifford Woolf , an anaesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
“ We think this could lead to a new therapeutic advance quite rapidly . ”
Bean believes that a few refinements could make the technique even more effective .
“ In these initial experiments we used off - the - shelf molecules that we knew about — there may be other agents that would give longer - lasting anaesthesia , ” he says .
SAN JOSE , Calif .  Nanosolar , a heavily financed Silicon Valley start - up whose backers include Google ’s co-founders , plans to announce Tuesday that it has begun selling its innovative solar panels , which are made using a technique that is being held out as the future of solar power manufacturing .
The company , which has raised $ 150 million and built a 200,000 - square - foot factory here , is developing a new manufacturing process that “ prints ” photovoltaic material on aluminum backing , a process the company says will reduce the manufacturing cost of the basic photovoltaic module by more than 80 percent .
Nanosolar , which recently hired a top manufacturing executive from I.B.M. , said that it had orders for its first 18 months of manufacturing capacity .
The photovoltaic panels will be made in Silicon Valley and in a second plant in Germany .
While many photovoltaic start - up companies are concentrating on increasing the efficiency with which their systems convert sunlight , Nanosolar has focused on lowering the manufacturing cost .
Its process is akin to a large printing press , rather than the usual semiconductor manufacturing techniques that deposit thin films on silicon wafers .
In November , CNN.com invited Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto to reflect on the tumultuous events following her return to Pakistan this fall .
In this commentary , the former prime minister reflected on a failed assassination attempt on her life at that time and vowed to keep pushing for the restoration of democracy .
President Pervez Musharraf ended a 42 - day state of emergency on December 15 .
He had condemned the attack against Bhutto .
CNN.com also invited Musharraf to submit a piece giving his perspective .
He has not yet responded .
KARACHI , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
I have long claimed that the rise of extremism and militancy in Pakistan could not happen without support from elements within the current administration .
My return to my country poses a threat to the forces of extremism that have thrived under a dictatorship .
They want to stop the restoration of democracy at any price .
They have exploited a poor , desperate , and powerless people and allowed extremists the right environment in which to flourish .
Benazir Bhutto speaks Saturday at a news conference after a state of emergency was declared in Pakistan .
The ruling party is an artificial , political party created in the headquarters of the Inter - Services Intelligence ( Pakistan 's equivalent of the CIA ) during the General Elections of 2002 .
Its core support comes from the political partners of the military dictator of the ' 80s , General Zia al - Haq , who empowered the most radical elements within the Afghan Mujahedeen who went on to morph into al - Qaeda , Taliban and the Pakistani militants of today .
This party has called for a banning of outdoor rallies , demonstrations and caravans .
They would thus suspend all activity that demonstrates to the people of Pakistan and to the people of the world which parties enjoy mass support amongst the people .
On my return to Pakistan last month , throngs of people turned out to welcome me back home .
The demand to ban grassroots political activity is a suspicious prelude to what could be an overt attempt to rig the upcoming elections .
All people who believe in the process of democracy should reject this attempt to undermine public participation in the campaign and set the table for what I believe would simply be a fraudulent election .
Watch as Bhutto expresses fears for the future of her country »
It has now been more than two weeks since the horrific assassination attempt against me and the police have still not filed my complaint .
They filed their own report without taking statements from eyewitnesses on the truck targeted for the terrorist attack which resulted in the death of more than 158 of my supporters and security guards .
Soon thereafter , I was asked by authorities not to travel in cars with tinted windows -- which protected me from identification by terrorists -- or travel with privately armed guards .
I began to feel the net was being tightened around me when police security outside my home in Karachi was reduced , even as I was told that other assassination plots were in the offing .

While the authorities speculated on whether a suicide bomber had been involved or two suicide bombers or perhaps a hand grenade or perhaps a car bomb , I reflected on my plight .
I decided not to be holed up in my home , a virtual prisoner .
I went to my ancestral village of Larkana to pray at my father 's grave .
Everywhere , the people rallied around me in a frenzy of joy .
I feel humbled by their love and trust .
Although it remains difficult to know for certain , I doubt that a suicide bomber was involved in the attack on me .
I suspect , after talking to some of the injured , that the terrorists used a small child as a ploy to get to me .
They were trying to hoist the child -- dressed in the colors of my party 's flag -- onto my truck .
Failing to do so , they dropped the child near my vehicle .
Some witnesses said the child had been rigged as a human bomb .
I can't be sure .
What followed was a massive explosion , killing scores immediately , tearing many bodies in half and sending blood , gore and flames up into the vehicle .
In less than a minute a second bomb -- reports later suggested a car bomb -- went off .
As I have reflected on the past two weeks , there are some things I wonder about :
• What was the car doing there ?
• Why had the street lights been turned off ?
• Was that intended to prevent my security from clearly seeing any approaching dangers ?
• Is there any truth to the report that a high government official ordered the lights turned off " to prevent her getting so much television coverage " ?
• Why would the leadership of the ruling party of Pakistan make a claim that my own party had committed the attack to gain sympathy ?
• Why would the investigation be initially given to a police officer who was present when my husband was nearly tortured to death in 1999 ?
And , then , there is to me the most worrying : the adamant rejection by Islamabad of any assistance from the state - of - the art forensic teams of the FBI and Scotland Yard .
There are precedents in Pakistan for such international assistance .
Such teams were called in to investigate the mysterious and sudden death of Army Chief General Asif Nawaz and the Egyptian Embassy bombing in the '90s .
I had called in international experts when my brother Murtaza was killed in what I believed was a conspiracy to destabilize my government in 1996 .
We can only wonder -- if there is nothing to hide -- why international investigators from the FBI and Scotland Yard are being prevented from assisting a Pakistan - led investigation ?
The sham investigation of the October 19 massacre and the attempt by the ruling party to politically capitalize on this catastrophe are discomforting , but do not suggest any direct involvement by General Pervez Musharraf .
Until recently , he had made both public and private commitments to confidence building gestures that would move Pakistan forward in the transition to democracy .
But at a time when he should be demonstrating to our country and the world his seriousness in allowing free , fair and transparent elections , he has declared martial law .
This can only be seen as a step to entrench his dictatorship .
We must have elections under an independent caretaker government , and neutral administrative officials who have the confidence of all major political parties in the country .
And these elections should be under the supervision of an autonomous and competent Election Commission .
It is time that Islamabad facilitates the operation of a rigorous election monitoring mechanism -- both domestic and international -- that can guarantee the sanctity of the ballot and allows election experts to conduct exit polls to insure that the counting reflects the voting .
It is time , in other words , for reconciliation to truly begin that will allow for the mobilization of the moderate majority of my nation and the marginalization of militants , fanatics and extremists .
But for that to happen , General Musharraf will need to revive the constitution by lifting martial law .

The breakthrough could mean smaller supercomputers
Scientists at IBM have completed work that may make it possible to do away with the copper wires used to couple processing cores to each other .
The connector created by the team uses light to pass data between the computational cores that is faster and uses less power than copper wires .
The device is smaller than previously demonstrated connectors promising to shrink future computational clusters .
The IBM development , reported in the journal Optics Express , could replace the copper wires that connect cores with a device that converts electrical signals to pulses of light .
The device , called a silicon Mach - Zehnder electro - optic modulator , is many times smaller than previously produced convertors .
" What we have done is a significant step toward building a vastly smaller and more power - efficient way to connect those cores , in a way nobody has done before , " said Dr Tze - chiang Chen , a spokesman for IBM 's science and technology research division .
It could also boost the power of coupled computational cores because by using light , the speed at which data travels between the cores would be accelerated .
With light the researchers , led by Dr Will Green , can cut the amount of power needed to move data between processors and slash the amount of heat a large computational cluster produces .
The technology , which can transfer data up to a distance of a few centimetres , is about 100 times faster than wires and consumes one - tenth as much power , said Dr Green .
The lower power requirement should reduce operational costs for supercomputers .
Doing away with some of the cooling systems for computational clusters could shrink the systems further .
So far the team has only demonstrated the technology in a lab and it could be years before it makes its way into commercial chips .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior congressional Democrat outlined a sweeping tax overhaul on Thursday that would repeal a tax that was meant for the rich but has ensnared many middle - class Americans .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Republicans blasted the proposal as a major tax hike .
The bill would raise taxes on some wealthy individuals to help offset the revenue lost from repealing the alternative minimum tax .
U.S. House of Representative Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel said his bill would provide more equity in the tax code and reduce the taxes paid by about 90 million middle - and low - income Americans .
“ Like the president , we all agree that taxpayers know what best to do with their money rather than government , ” said Rangel , a New York Democrat .
“ The differences we have with the president is that we do n’t believe that you have to be rich in order to know what to do with your money . ”
The alternative minimum tax was created in 1969 to ensure that the wealthiest Americans did not take so many tax breaks that they paid no federal income taxes .
But because of inflation , the tax has captured a growing number of middle - income taxpayers .
If Congress fails to act quickly on the AMT , as many as 25 million taxpayers could pay it when they file their 2007 tax returns next year .
Rangel said he did not expect a House vote on his measure before the end of this year .
But he said he would try to push through a temporary AMT fix to keep that from happening while lawmakers debate the broader tax reform measure .
Republicans were quick to pounce on Rangel ’s roughly $ 1 trillion proposal , calling it the “ mother of all tax hikes ” and saying it will hurt Democrats next year .
REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION
“ It ’s a great plan for us and its a bad plan for them , ” said Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri , the second ranking Republican in the House .
“ Thank God this plan is not going to happen . ”
Tax reform and growing pressures on the budget as the 80 million baby boomers prepare to retire are likely to be major issues in next year ’s presidential and congressional elections when Democrats hope to take over the White House and solidify their control of Congress .
Republicans say the AMT should be abolished without raising other taxes to offset the nearly $ 800 billion loss in federal revenues over 10 years .
Rangel ’s bill would lower the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 30.5 percent .
But it would close some loopholes and eliminate the “ last in , first out ” accounting method that allows companies to expense their most recent and most expensive inventories against their sales income .
The proposal would hit oil companies especially hard given the recent increase in crude prices .
The bill would also raise tax rates for private equity fund managers who currently pay a 15 percent capital gains rate on earnings from their business deals .
Their earnings would be treated as ordinary income , which has a tax rate as high as 35 percent .
The bill would replace the AMT with a surtax on income above $ 150,000 for individuals and $ 200,000 for couples .
Rangel said the effect of the tax would be minimal for those taxpayers making less than $ 400,000 .
The bill would raise the standard deduction for middle - and low - income taxpayers and expand the earned income tax credit for low - wage earners .
It would also increase the amount of the refundable child tax credit .

Is this toy some kind of centaur , or is that shield concealing an unnatural sexual act ?

This case is a classic that meets all the necessary conditions for a legitimate study of the UFO phenomenon Past News Releases RSS
The American public is not alone when it comes to sighting what the US Air Force has labeled Unidentified Flying Objects ( UFOs ) .
So too have former governors , high level military and government officials , highly trained airplane pilots and aviation experts .
The phenomenon is real .
It happens worldwide .
No one is sure about its nature .
Experts from seven countries will divulge what they have discovered about UFOs at a November 12 panel discussion moderated by former Arizona Governor Fife Symington ( R ) at the National Press Club ( http://www.freedomofinfo.org).
Just one year ago , pilots , mechanics and managers from United Airlines witnessed a metallic disc - shaped object hovering over the United Airlines Terminal at Chicago ’s O’Hare Airport .
The clearly observed object shot straight up leaving a hole through the clouds .
Despite the clear aviation safety issues involved , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) never investigated the incident and dismissed it as weather .
This head - in - the - clouds refusal to investigate stands in sharp contrast to efforts by governments of other countries to understand these incidents .
“ I believe that our government should take an active role in investigating this very real phenomenon , ” said Symington , who was a witness to the famed ‘ Phoenix Lights ” incident seen by hundreds in Arizona while he was governor .
“ This panel consists of some of the most qualified people in the world with direct experience in dealing with this issue , and they will bring incredible , irrefutable evidence , some never presented before , that we simply cannot dismiss or ignore , ” he said .
The group , using previously classified documents , will discuss many well - documented cases , including two investigated by the US government .
The first involves a Peruvian Air Force pilot who fired many rounds at a UFO which was not affected .
The second was an Iranian Air Force pilot ’s attempt to fire at a UFO , but whose control panel became inoperable .
“ This case is a classic that meets all the necessary conditions for a legitimate study of the UFO phenomenon , ” stated the US Defense Intelligence Agency document on the Tehran incident .
Both pilots will come forward to speak about these events publicly for the first time .

The black - focused school is a go .
After a heated but civil debate , Canada 's largest school board voted 11 - 9 last night to open an alternative Africentric school to help fight a 40 per cent dropout rate among Toronto 's black teens .
An elated parent , Donna Harrow , said she is thrilled the proposal she and fellow parent Angela Wilson had pushed for got through , despite fierce opposition and cries of segregation .
" I 'm ecstatic , but the struggle continues and we want this school to open in 2008 , not 2009 , " said Harrow .
Trustees voted on a sweeping package of programs to make schools more relevant to black students , including opening an Africentric school in September 2009 .
Trustee Josh Matlow , who opposed the pilot project school , warned that there is no guaranteed funding from Queen 's Park yet for even the estimated start - up costs of $ 350,000 .
The entire package of initiatives carries an estimated price tag of $ 820,000 .
In a passionate defence of the school , former chair Sheila Ward urged trustees to keep in mind " the power of symbolism " in endorsing it .
" I do n't know what it 's like to be a black parent , but I do know pain when I see it and recognize despair when I hear it , from the deepest part of the soul of those who believe time is running out , " said Ward .
Prior to the vote , fans and foes of black - focused schools made their case before a crowd of about 100 with all the passion and power that issues of race ignite .
To the mother of Jordan Manners , " this black school thing – no , it ai n't right . "
" Do n't propose it – Martin Luther King thought we could sit at the front of the bus together , " pleaded Loreen Small , whose son was shot dead last spring at his school in northwest Toronto .
" My son died at C.W. Jefferys in 2007 .
If we can all just come together and be as one , " said an emotional Small , who broke down in tears in the hall after her presentation .
" If black kids need to graduate , let 's get teachers in there and learn how to interact with black kids , " she said .
Yet human rights activist Vicky McPhee said an Africentric school " is a right , " and the only type of school to which she wants to send her 6 - year - old child .
She called for these schools in each of the city 's 22 wards .
Twelve of the 20 speakers urged the board to open an alternative Africentric school as a way to fight an estimated 40 per cent dropout rate among Toronto 's black students .
Longtime community leader Murphy Browne said she was alarmed at the high number of youth being " pushed out " of school by a European - centred system , who then get " caught up in the school - to - jail pipeline . "
" Many students say they would do better if they learned about their heritage , but who knows about Mathieu da Costa , ( a navigator of African descent ) who came to Canada in 1603 as a translator in Champlain 's expeditions . "
Others warned that an Africentric school would amount to a dangerous step back toward racial segregation .
In an impassioned bid to separate rumours from the real proposal , Donna Harrow reminded trustees that this proposed school would be open to all students .

Harrow said the debate has been made overly charged by those raising the ghost of the segregated South .
" This has turned into a fiasco – we did not propose a school for only blacks , we did not propose a school with all black teachers and all black curriculum .
" Let us stop it .
This is a school where all people could come and get support .
No one said little white children could not go there . "
Besides the Africentric school , the board passed , by wide margins , measures to :
Launch an action plan to help all black students do better .
Start three pilot programs in regular schools where subjects would be taught from an Africentric perspective .
Work with York University and community agencies to establish a centre of research on how to close the learning gap between black children and their peers of other backgrounds .
While many trustees support more inclusive courses , the stumbling block has long been creating a separate program or school with an Africentric focus with a largely black staff and student body .
It has been a lightning rod for racial debate in Toronto for more than a decade , since Ontario 's Royal Commission on Learning in 1995 suggested a black - focused school might help stem the higher dropout rate among black students , often blamed on a curriculum that overlooks their heritage and teachers who do n't reflect their diversity .
At the time of the Royal Commission , 40 per cent of black Grade 9 students in Toronto were dropping out , and their prospects have n't improved .
The Toronto District School Board says 40 per cent of Caribbean - born students drop out , and 32 per cent from east Africa .
Description :
On Monday , I wrote to the Republican National Committee and the Bush Cheney ' 04 campaign directing them to preserve the e-mails of White House officials . r
In those letters , I cited multiple examples of the use of political RNC e-mail accounts by White House officials conducting official government business .
[n one example I cited , an associate of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff was advised by a White House official not to send communications through the official White House e-mail system because " to put this stuff in writing in their email system ... might actually limit what they can do to help us . " '
The workers say they were assured that the children were orphans
Ahmat Mahamat Bachir told the BBC that a judge was expected to lay charges of child abduction against the workers .
Ten other people have been detained , including seven Spanish crew of the plane that was to be used by the charity , known as Zoe 's Ark .
The charity has denied it planned to sell the children for adoption .
It has said the 103 children are orphans from Sudan 's war - torn Darfur region .
France is a good mother , we will be with these French nationals to protect them as far as we can
Rama Yade , French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights
Children 's trauma Profile : Zoe's Ark
However staff from the UN children 's agency Unicef say many of the children , now being kept in an orphanage in Abeche , cry at night for their parents and say they are from villages in Chad .
Mr Bachir said the case would go before a judge on Monday .
" They made fake visas , which means they forged the documents .
For us , abduction is more than a crime .
They could be put in jail for several years .
" They committed the offence in Chad , so they would be imprisoned in Chad of course , it 's very probable , " he said .
The French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights , Rama Yade , said the planned operation by the charity was " irresponsible " but that France would offer its citizens " maximum consular assistance " .
The children are not being treated for any serious illnesses or injuries
" France is a good mother , we will be with these French nationals to protect them as far as we can , to guarantee their rights and we will never leave them , " she told Europe 1 radio .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said the charity workers ' actions were illegal and unacceptable .
Chad's President Idriss Deby has promised " severe punishment " for what he has described as a " kidnapping " or " child - trafficking " operation .
Denying it planned to sell the children for adoption , Zoe 's Ark says it was given statements from tribal leaders that all the children were Darfur orphans with no known relatives .
The charity insists it was trying in good faith to take endangered children abroad for medical treatment .
However , a BBC reporter says the children appear to be in good health .
On the runway
The BBC's Stephanie Hancock was among a group of reporters taken by Chadian authorities to the airport at Abeche , a town close to the Sudanese border , and shown the private charter plane still sitting on the runway where it was abandoned three days ago .
The reporters were later taken to the local police headquarters to see the 16 detained Westerners - six French charity - workers , three French journalists and a seven - strong Spanish crew .
They are not being held in prison cells but in a large room and are showing no signs of mistreatment , our correspondent says .
The seven Spaniards among the group are the plane 's two pilots and five air stewards .
Spanish media have reported they are employees of the Barcelona - based charter company , Girjet .
The company said it had provided transport for the charity but was not otherwise involved in the plan , reports said .
' Chadian children '
The reporters were also taken to the orphanage where the children are being cared for by aid workers and UN staff .
Aid workers confirmed they were not treating any of the children for any serious illnesses or injuries .
The vast majority of the children are believed to be between three and five years old , with the oldest about eight or nine , and several babies no more than one and a half , our correspondent says .
The president of the French national committee for Unicef said 48 of the children questioned so far appeared to be Chadian , not Sudanese .
" Our impression is that the majority are n't orphans , but at this stage it 's just an impression , " Jacques Hintzy told Radio Television Luxembourg .
A Paris court began investigating the charity last Tuesday after receiving a report about the unauthorised action .
Casey commented on my post about ALT .
Net and the Enterprise , and we have a good discussion going on there .
But something he said triggered so many red flags that I had to go breath into a paper bag for a few moments :
many ' enterprise ' teams have to take whatever body count they can get to satisfy the management .
And in that case you have to keep things really simple ( and by definition produce poor quality code ) .
He later went on to expand what he think is simple :
In case I expressed myself badly ... by simple in that context , I mean simple as in " mostly drag and drop " , no IoC , no inheritance , no composition , lots of " standard things " like EAAB , and most code in the aspx.cs files ... because that is as far as most developers understand code .
" simple code " in the context I suspect you mean it is probably as I would define it ... which is the hardest code in the world to write .
The simpler the code is , the harder it is to write .
High quality code is simple , elegant and to the point .
Keeping things simple means making it easy to go the right path .
Thinking that keeping things simple is by definition producing poor quality code is a mistake .
I am afraid that I can't really find any simplicity in " mostly drag & drop , most of the code in the aspx.cs " .
In fact , it is far more complex than the alternative , because you have to juggle so many balls at the same time .
Here is a piece of simple code :
[ Occurrences ( OccureEvery .
Day , At = EsitmatedRunTime .
MidMorning , RunAtHolidays = false ) ] public class SendSmsTwoDaysBeforeEventStart : ScheduledTask { public override void Execute ( ) { ICollection < Event > eventsInTwoDays = Repository < Event >.
FindAll ( Where .Event.ScheduledDate.Between(InTwoCalendarDays , InTwoDays ) && Where .
Event .
Participants .
With ( FetchMode.Join ) ) ; foreach ( Event e in eventsInTwoDays ) { SendNotificationSmsToAllParticipantsIn(e ) ; } } }
It is easy to write , easy to read , and it is stupid code .
You can write & test this in a short amount of time , and it lends itself greatly to a check list approach .
" Here are the batch processes we need to build right now , here is how you build a batch process , let me know if you have any issues and when you are done " .
Very simple code , quite elegant , if I say so myself , but nothing that you need to really think about when you build it .
Keeping things simple means higher code quality , period .
Making them complex any tiny bit over the necessary , and your code quality will plummet .
The Washington state legislature wants to know exactly what a 60 - day supply of medical marijuana is .
In 1998 , the state passed a law allowing people to possess a two - month medical pot supply .
But they left it up to individual counties to determine what that quantity means – and some counties , reports the Los Angeles Times , have said that a 60 - day supply is none at all .
( Maybe they really believed this commercial ? )
Washington 's the only state with such ambiguous medical marijuana laws .
Oregon , for example , lets people who 've been prescribed pot by a doctor to have 24 ounces on hand .
( My gut reaction , upon learning of this , was to make a snarky comment about electing Jarret and Gobi to the legislature – but some doctors say that treating ALS takes over two pounds of pot per month . )
California pegs it at a minimum of eight ounces , and cities and counties can up that
Washington will accept expert and public comments until the end of the year , and make their decision by next July .
My own opinion is that the law should be totally open - ended in regards to quantity .
Pot strains vary in potency and the nature of their effect .
Individual response varies , too : some people need more than others to feel its effects .
Some people smoke it , others eat it .
Not setting a maximum would take into account that variability , as well as the fact that federal hostility has made rigid medical pot research rare .
What do you think ?
Have you had any experience taking marijuana for medical reasons ?
How much did you need ?

Thirteen - year - old twins Lamb and Lynx Gaede have one album out , another on the way , a music video , and lots of fans .
They may remind you of another famous pair of singers , the Olsen Twins , and the girls say they like that .
But unlike the Olsens , who built a media empire on their fun-loving , squeaky - clean image , Lamb and Lynx are cultivating a much darker personna .
They are white nationalists and use their talents to preach a message of hate .
Known as " Prussian Blue " -- a nod to their German heritage and bright blue eyes -- the girls from Bakersfield , Calif. , have been performing songs about white nationalism before all - white crowds since they were nine .
" We 're proud of being white , we want to keep being white , " said Lynx .
" We want our people to stay white ... we do n't want to just be , you know , a big muddle .
We just want to preserve our race . "
Lynx and Lamb have been nurtured on racist beliefs since birth by their mother April .
" They need to have the background to understand why certain things are happening , " said April , a stay - at - home mom who no longer lives with the twins ' father .
" I 'm going to give them , give them my opinion just like any , any parent would . "
April home - schools the girls , teaching them her own unique perspective on everything from current to historical events .
In addition , April 's father surrounds the family with symbols of his beliefs -- specifically the Nazi swastika .
It appears on his belt buckle , on the side of his pick - up truck and he 's even registered it as his cattle brand with the Bureau of Livestock Identification .
" Because it 's provocative , " explains April of the cattle brand , " to him he thinks it 's important as a symbol of freedom of speech that he can use it as his cattle brand . "
Teaching Hate
Songs like " Sacrifice " -- a tribute to Nazi Rudolf Hess , Hitler 's deputy Fuhrer -- clearly show the effect of the girls ' upbringing .
The lyrics praise Hess as a " man of peace who would n't give up . "
" It really breaks my heart to see those two girls spewing out that kind of garbage , " said Ted Shaw , civil rights advocate and president of the NAACP 's Legal Defense Fund -- though Shaw points out that the girls are n't espousing their own opinions but ones they 're being taught .
On that point , April Gaede and Ted Shaw apparently agree .
" Well , all children pretty much espouse their parents ' attitudes , " she said .
" We 're white nationalists and of course that 's a part of our life and I 'm going to share that part of my life with my children . "
Since they began singing , the girls have become such a force in the white nationalist movement , that David Duke -- the former presidential candidate , one - time Ku-Klux - Klan grand wizard and outspoken white supremacist -- uses the twins to draw a crowd .
Prussian Blue supporter Erich Gliebe , operator of one of the nation 's most notorious hate music labels , Resistance Records , hopes younger performers like Lynx and Lamb will help expand the base of the White Nationalist cause .
" Eleven and 12 years old , " he said , " I think that 's the perfect age to start grooming kids and instill in them a strong racial identity . "
Gliebe , who targets young , mainstream white rockers at music festivals like this past summer 's " Ozzfest , " says he uses music to get his message out .
But with names like Blue - Eyed Devils and Angry Aryans , these tunes are far more extreme than the ones sung by Lamb and Lynx .
" We give them a CD , we give them something as simple as a stick , they can go to our Web site and see other music and download some of our music , " said Gliebe .
" To me , that 's the best propaganda tool for our youth . "
A Taste for Hate
Gliebe says he hopes that as younger racist listeners mature , so will their tastes for harder , angrier music like that of Shawn Sugg of Max Resist .
One of Sugg 's songs is a fantasy piece about a possible future racial war that goes : " Let the cities burn , let the streets run red , if you ai n't white you 'll be dead . "
" I 'd like to compare it to gangsta rap , " explained Sugg , " where they glorify , you know , shooting n****** and pimping whores . "
Sugg shrugs off criticism that music like his should not be handed out to schoolyard children , arguing that " it 's just music , it 's not like you 're handing out AK - 47s . "
Perhaps not , but Shaw says it 's the ideas in the music that are dangerous .
" When you talk about people being dead if they 're not white , " said Shaw , " I do n't think there is much question that that is hateful . "
A Place to Call Home
Despite the success of Prussian Blue and bands like Max Resist within the White Nationalism movement , most Americans do n't accept their racist message .
Like many children across the country , Lamb and Lynx decided to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina -- the white ones .
The girls ' donations were handed out by a White Nationalist organization who also left a pamphlet promoting their group and beliefs -- some of the intended recipients were more than a little displeased .
After a day of trying , the supplies ended up with few takers , dumped at a local shop that sells Confederate memorabilia .
Last month , the girls were scheduled to perform at the local county fair in their hometown .
But when some people in the community protested , Prussian Blue was removed from the line - up .
But even before that , April had decided that Bakersfield was not " white " enough , so she sold her home , and hopes that she and the girls can find an all - white community in the Pacific Northwest .

Caffeine is one of the most consumed substances of all times .
Through the years , people have consciously and unconsciously taken caffeine in the form of coffee , tea , softdrinks and other colas .
Caffeine intake has rapidly become popular that every now and then , critics and health experts have constantly warned about it .
A number of health professionals insist that the substance can do harm to the body .
The first blow to the intake of caffeine is the claims that it induces addiction .
Thus , many people seem to be pretty hooked up at drinking softdrinks and coffee .
Moreover , people should be aware about the benefits and detriments of taking caffeine .
Caffeine headaches
Caffeine has been found to cause headaches and the claims that the substances causes addiction is linked to this assertion .
The idea that what is called as ' weekend headaches ' are caused by caffeine is linked to the addiction allegation against the substance .
Experts believe that weekend headaches come as office buffs , who become used to consuming cups and glasses of coffee and sodas everyday in the morning and during breaks , suddenly stop taking caffeine during weekends .
Usually , workers sleep and take rest during weekends , so they are not drinking coffee or sodas to be awake .
The migraine triggered by such a cause can be alleviated by taking caffeine .
Quitters to caffeine intake also suffer headaches as a form of withdrawal symptom to the allegedly addictive caffeine .
Just like when smokers suddenly quit smoking , caffeine consumers also experience severe or even mild effects on health .
Moreover , too much intake of caffeine may also cause intense stress , especially when the person significantly lacks sleep and proper nutrition .
Such stress can lower the body 's resistance to the usual causes of migraines , making the person suffer occasional , and eventually , regular episodes of headaches .
Stimulant
You may probably heard from experts that caffeine is an effective stimulant , a group of substances that raise heart beats and makes people awake .
Stimulants help people combat sleepiness within a few hours after intake .
Thus , that explains why you feel very much awake and invigorated after drinking that cup of coffee in the morning .
Softdrinks also produce a different kick within you .
People then take caffeine whenever they need to stay awake during office hours or during over time sessions at work .
Caffeine should not be taken if you are about to sleep or if you have been encountering difficulties in inducing sleep .
You may notice that even the aroma of the coffee can almost invigorate you .
Caffeine as headache treatment
It can almost be confusing , but did you know that if caffeine can cause certain types of headaches , it can also help treat headaches ?
How dos it work ?
Migraines are caused by enlarging blood vessels that affect the nerves around them .
These nerves then trigger the sensory of the head , producing headaches .
Caffeine works by constricting the blood vessels , making those vessels return to normal and healthy sizes .
You may prove this when you encounter a minor headache .
Notice that at least about 30 minutes after you have taken coffee or colas during an episode of headache , you may feel relief .
In other cases , certain medications need the help of caffeine so those treatments can be utilized appropriately by the body .
There are various kinds of drugs that are manufactured with added caffeine for them to be effective .
Examples of such drugs are Tylenols , Florinol , Cafergot , Excedrin and Dristan .
Simple over the counter medicines also become more potent when taken with softdrinks or coffees .
Caffeine is indeed a wonderful substance .
They may be bad or good , depending on how your body utilizes them and how you take them .
Everything should be taken in moderation though .
Experts believe that about two to three cups of coffee can still be happy .
Anything more than that can lead to addiction and excessive caffeine intake .
Caffeine is certainly a good subject for discussion over a cup of coffee .
You may benefit or be harmed by it .
Just recognize the fact that as a stimulant , take it to invigorate your energy .
Never take it on empty stomach though .
That can be the reason why your grandma always has cookies when serving coffee or tea .
Much has been written about the dangers posed by click fraud on the Google advertising products , and how Google has taken steps to address the problem .
Click fraud , however , is only one of the ways for webmasters to defraud advertisers of money .
I will detail another way in this post .
The technique is already widely known among webmasters who use AdSense ( and , indeed , sometimes I wonder if Google does n’t encourage it ) .
If you ’re spending money on the Content Network , you also need to understand it so that you can cut your losses when appropriate .
A bit of back story : recently , I bumped by spending on the Content Network up by 30 % , to the “ several hundred dollars a month ” range .
As you might imagine , at 9 cents a click ( bingo cards are n’t the world ’s most competitive niche ) this means I was getting a virtual torrent of traffic .
During my daily check of the summary statistics ( a habit I suggest you get into after major changes to AdWords — in normal operation once a week is fine ) , I noticed that my click - through rate ( CTR ) on the content campaign had skyrocketed from 1 % to 15 % .
That could n’t possibly be natural .
Remember , an AdSense ad is , by definition , being shown to someone who is at least partially interested in something related to your product but has not expressed any interest in being sold to yet .
( Folks on Google frequently have expressed an interest with their search queries , such as buy bingo card creator , which is why CTRs are orders of magnitude higher there . )
As such , you should expect CTRs to be much lower than on AdWords ads — dropping from 8 - 10 % for a really good AdWords ad to about . 5 - 1 % or so for AdSense on most sites .
However , site design can have a major influence on how effective a site ’s ads are at getting clicked .
Google recognizes this and teaches some of the tricks to optimize the ads ( which , after all , makes them money ) : blend the ads into your site , place the ads where they are likely to be clicked , etc .
However , they have an anti-fraud policy for sites which toe the line , because using certain techniques to get the ads clicked on results in non-interested surfers clicking them , and that costs advertisers money and drives them away from the service .
Since web pages are made to be scanned , anything that causes your eyes to be drawn toward an ad but away from its content causes your click - through rate to soar .
One previously common tactic , which is now banned , was to line up images with the advertisements in order to suggest to visitors that the links provided explanations for the images .
This resulted in quadrupling CTRs for the ads .
Since the AdSense equation is
Revenue = ( traffic ) * ( # of ad units ) * ( CTR ) * ( cost per click ) * ( percentage Google gives you )
that quadrupled revenues for participating webmasters .
I ’m strongly tempted to say “ unscrupulous webmasters ” , because once the visitor realizes they ’ve been had they ’ll be on the back button without a second thought , costing the advertiser money without giving them any chance to pitch their products to an interested customer .
That is , of course , the entire point of the excercise .
So that is the old scam .
Here is the new hotness : using CSS and HTML , organize your website in the fairly typical sections - broken - by - heads style .
Then , optimize your CSS such that the section travels off the page , with the clipping at a common resolution ( 800×600 or 1024 ×768 ) happening in such a way as to cut off the legitimate content and thereby give your visitors the impression that the ad is the content promised in the section headings .
There are at least eight sites which are using this technique in the quite non-competitive bingo card niche .
I have taken a screenshot of one site which I thought was iconic .
( Editor ’s note : After first posting this , the author of that site got in touch with me and said the placement was accidental .
I have no particular reason to disbelieve him , as inspection of his other pages shows a variety of ad placements .
I ’m afraid that accident does n’t explain the other sites , though .
I am keeping the pictures up to demonstrate the general tactic , but have edited the remainder of this post to be less accusatory of his site in particular . )
You really have to see it in full - screen glory to appreciate the effect .
That screenshot is about 255 kb and shows the site in default IE7 , but if you wanted to be really devious you can use CSS hacks to make it work equally well in all browsers at once , using pixel perfect layouts and a bit of elbow grease .
I have obscured the “ branding ” of the site , and have obscured the ads of my competitors to avoid associating them with it .
( If you happen to be a competitor of mine , drop me an email and I will happily give you my list of sites which are using these strategies , or you can make your own as described below . )
Here is a close up on the main content area of the page .
Again , you really should look at in in context — the actual CONTENT here is invisible until you scroll .
Unsophisticated visitors miss the distinction between the blended links and the advertisements ( which happen to have quite similar titles ) and click on the ads instead of the file links .
Click to see the expanded version .
Remember , the site does not actually show that content in the middle unless you scroll down to see it — and even with the content there , it is easy for an unsophisticated Internet user to click on the ads thinking they are getting the promised downloads .
And click they do .
From my statistics , roughly 16 % of the visitors of that page clicked on my one , single advertisement .
Given there were five advertisements , a click in my niche costs about a dime , and Google splits somewhere in the general neighborhood of 50 - 50 with webmasters , we can guestimate their revenue per thousand visitors using the above formula :
Revenue = 1000 * 5 * .16 * .1 * .5 = $ 40 CPM .
( Edit :
The site owner suggests that he is earning $ 7.50 CPM for the site as a whole .
I do n’t have access to his console , but I think my estimate is closer than his for pages which employ this technique . )
Sorting the list of the hundreds of advertisers I am paying , and ignoring ones for whom small numbers distort results , it seems like a more typical CPM for an honest advertiser in my niche is about $ 2.50 .
So its fairly obvious why breaking the rules is so attractive — a single page with less than 1 k impressions a day could generate something like $ 12,000 a year .
And when I say generating , I mean “ taking it from the advertisers ” .
Most business owners understand the economics of advertising a product , but a brief review for the peanut gallery : I sell a $ 25 product , of which $ 24 is profit .
( It helps to be in software , the gross margins are quite healthy . )
The primary goal of having a user visit my page is to get them into the free trial of the software , which convinces about 2.5 % of them to convert ( i.e. buy ) , getting me my $ 24 .
Thus , it is rational for me to spend anything less than $ 24 * .025 = 60 cents ( at the margin ) to achieve one trial being downloaded .
I have reason to suspect , given a year of data , that the attractiveness of my website and sales proposition should convince about 22 % of interested visitors to take the trial for a spin .
Given that clicks in my niche cost about 9 to 11 cents each , this gives me an average cost of about 36 - 43 cents per trial download ( it bounces around on a daily basis ) .
As 43 is less than 60 , that means I am mildly profitable , with not too much room for error ( if my conversion rate decreases to 2 % and my cost per trial rises a few pennies I ’m not making money anymore ) .
Bamboozling visitors to click on my ads hurts me more than errors ever could .
When an unsophisticated Internet user clicks on the “ Create Bingo Cards ” link thinking “ This is step # 1 of the 3 step process this website is pitching to me ” , and then they are suddenly whisked to my very visually distinct site , they figure “ Uh oh , something went wrong ” .
And they immediately click the Back Button , to try to fix the mistake .
( Many of them probably click on a different ad instead , a mistake which is frustrating for them and great news for both the publisher and Google . )
As a result , it was n’t 22 % of folks coming in from these ads who actually completed a trial download , no , it was about 2 % .
Which means that I was paying approximately $ 50 to get a sale of a $ 25 product — I guess I can make the loss up on volume ?
Oh , but it gets worse : Google is very , very smart about where they show your ads .
This is why they have a Content Score for the search network which prioritizes high CTR ads over low CTR ads : this maximizes money .
Google ’s incentive is to maximize the number of clicks while minimizing the number of impressions , because if they capture 100 % of my budget then they want me out of the rotation ASAP so they can sell the inventory to another sucker advertiser .
This unholy , and I hope unintended , alliance of Google and the publishers using this trick sucked my budget dry within the first two hours of every day .
Google ’s automated algorithms helpfully suggested I increase my spending by a factor of ten to compensate , so that instead of spending $ 15 a day to make $ 7.50 I would be spending $ 150 a day to make $ 75 , for a monthly loss in the $ 2,000 range .
That Certainly Sucks .
What Can I Do About It ?
1 ) First , if you ’re not in the position to routinely monitor your AdWords performance , opt out of the content network and do n’t come back .
The scum sites are always one step ahead of Google , by definition , and if you ’re not one step ahead of them that $ 2,000 a month loss could be yours .
2 ) If you are in the position to routinely monitor your AdWords performance , use the Reporting feature in your AdWords console .
The report you want is Site Placement , for the previous 7 days .
Make sure you include the CTR and Cost Per Conversions columns .
Then , every day , grab your report in CSV format , and run a simple script on it to report all of the URLs where the CTR is higher than a threshold ( I use 4 % ) , the number of clicks is substantial ( otherwise you ’ll ban a lot of mom - and - pop sites for no good reason because 100 % of their 1 visitors this month clicked your ad ) , and your Cost Per Conversion is greater than your profit .
( Almost guaranteed if you set your threshold right , because the only way to beat that threshold is to be exploiting your visitors , and exploited folks do n’t make happy customers . )
Then , take any domain which appears on this screen , and add it to your banned list .
I am a Cygwin junkie so I do this with a gawk script every day , but if you are not a scripting wizard you can do it the longhand way , by increasing the number of rows in the visible report to 100 , sorting by descending CTR ( click it twice ) , and then visually identifying the rows that have significant number of clicks .
Then , take any domain which appears on this screen , and add it to your banned list .
3 ) If you are an engineer or product manager at Google , please , we could use some algorithmic help here .
I realize this suggestion is going to cost you money in the shortrun , but when advertisers lose money you will eventually lose money too , because they will stop advertising .
We give you all the information you need to calculate our maximum desirable cost per conversion ( I have my doubts that we are intelligent in doing this , because you can use that information to screw us over royally , but business is based on a foundation of trust and for the moment I ’m going to trust you ) .
You should provide a setting ( or make it default behavior ! ) that ads stop appearing on any site where they transparently wo n’t be profitable .
I would also suggest screening sustained abnormal CTRs automatically for fraud or Terms of Service violations .
4 ) If you find a website which is abusive in their ad placement , you can complain to Google .
Realistically , I think they value algorithmic solutions over manual ones so much that you have zero hope of being heard ( and they have to — they got to being a gazillion dollar company by NOT having to pay a human to deal with the little shrimp with the $ 15 a day advertising budget ) .
But if it makes you feel better , here is the link .

The technique , however , is being used by multiple sites and it strains credulity to think that eight people independently accidentally developed cross - browser compliant CSS and liquid layouts to achieve this effect . ]

JULY 2 -- Wrestler Chris Benoit was identified by Drug Enforcement Administration agents as an ' excessive purchaser of injectable steroids ' who , over the past year , was prescribed a 10 - month supply of anabolic steroids every three to four weeks by a Georgia doctor who was indicted today on federal charges .
Benoit , who last week murdered his wife and son before committing suicide , came to the attention of DEA agents probing RX Weight Loss , a Marietta company .
It was during that investigation , which is ' currently being prosecuted in the Northern District of Georgia , ' that narcotics agents discovered the World Wrestling Entertainment performer 's steroid purchases , according to a June 29 search warrant affidavit ( an excerpt of which you 'll find below ) .
The warrant was executed at the home of Phil Astin , Benoit 's doctor .
In the affidavit , DEA Agent Anissa Jones reports that pharmacy records show that , from May 2006 to May 2007 , Astin prescribed Benoit , on average , 'a 10 - month supply of anabolic steroids ... every three to four weeks . '
Astin , the affidavit notes , has been the ' subject of concern for excessive and / or suspicious prescribing activity ' by local police and pharmacies .
Astin , 52 , was named today in a seven - count indictment charging him with the illegal distribution of substances like Percocet and Xanax between April 2004 and September 2005 .
A preliminary DEA review of Astin 's prodigious prescription writing has revealed that he ' authorized approximately one million dosage units of various pharmaceutical controlled substances in the last two years . '
These scrips included ' significant quantities ' of an injectable anabolic steroid , reported Jones .

It ’s a great time to start a business David 120 comments Latest by CLARA

Fake has a peculiar list of reasons why starting a company today is a bad idea .
I say it 's never been a better time to start a business .
You know , the kind that develops a product or service and asks money for it .
Yes , it 's a bad time to start a company on VC diesel , using me - too technology , flaunting your non-existing goods , doing tagging because it 's cool , and spending all your time partying .
Guess what ?
That was never a good idea .
I know we 've been beating many of these drums to death , but here goes a recap of six reasons why you should start a business today :
You do n't need VC diesel to get your motor running .
Working nights or putting money aside to run full - time for three months is enough to get off the ground if you have a great idea and enough passion to make it matter .
You can actually charge money for valuable services .
People have never been more willing to part with their credit cards to pay for services that improve their business or their life .
You do n't need to spend aeons and cumbaja meetings pondering HOW TO MONITIZE ?!
when all you need is a service worth paying for .
You do n't need mainstream tech to make a dent .
No wonder you have a hard time finding people if you 're only looking at the mainstream tech circles .
You 're competing for talent with all the risk - averse insurance companies of the world .
We picked Ruby early and used Rails to get access to the cream of the crop .
People bustling with passion to develop using tools they love .
You do n't need to live in San Francisco to make it big .
Or rather , if you want to make it big , do n't live in San Francisco .
You 'll get sucked in to the myths ( you need VC ! ) and drowned by the parties .
Most of the worlds talent does not live in that tiny spot of land .
I developed the Basecamp , Backpack , Tada List , and Writeboard from Copenhagen , Denmark .
And we have one of the greatest developers I 've ever met in Provo , Utah .
While the rest of the company is in Chicago and New York .
The Rails core team includes people from Germany , Canada , Austria , and all over the US .
You do n't need a swarm of worker bees to take off .
Of course its hard to find 10 or 20 great people by tomorrow , but you do n't have to .
We 're entering a golden age of small teams capable of doing big things .
Just get a band of three together and you 're good to go for v1 .
Using modern tools and simply doing less software means that having more people is likely to slow you down rather than speed you up .
Thus , I believe it has never been easier to build a great business for the web , if your intentions are to simply be profitable and please a constituency of passionate users .
But yes , I agree with Fake that its getting harder to create a company with the intents to play the Web 2.0 Lottery .
There can only be so many winners and if you 're relying on Google or Yahoo to buy you out , you might want to pick a coupon for the powerball while you 're at it .
You 've read plenty of articles recently about visual invisibility but acoustic invisibility was considered beyond the reach of science .
Now Duke University engineers say a three - dimensional sound cloak is possible , at least in theory , by making sound waves travel distortion - free around an acousic veil the way microwaves do for a visual one .
" We 've devised a recipe for an acoustic material that would essentially open up a hole in space and make something inside that hole disappear from sound waves , " said Steven Cummer , Jeffrey N. Vinik Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke 's Pratt School of Engineering .
Such a cloak might hide submarines in the ocean from detection by sonar , he said , or improve the acoustics of a concert hall by effectively flattening a structural beam .
As in the case of the microwave cloak , the properties required for a sound cloak are not found among materials in nature and would require the development of artificial , composite metamaterials .
The engineering of acoustic metamaterials lags behind those that interact with electromagnetic waves ( i.e. microwaves or light ) , but " the same ideas should apply , " Cummer said .
The report by Cummer 's team is expected to appear in Physical Review Letters on Jan. 11 .
In 2006 , researchers at Duke and the Imperial College London used a new design theory to create a blueprint for an electromagnetic invisibility cloak .
Only a few months later , the team demonstrated the first such cloak , designed to operate at microwave frequencies .
Cummer and David Schurig , a former research associate at Duke who is now at North Carolina State University , later reported in The New Journal of Physics a theory showing that an acoustic cloak could be built .
But that theory relied on a " special equivalence " between electromagnetic and sound waves that is only true in two dimensions , Cummer said .
A report by another team had also suggested that a 3 - D acoustic cloak could n't exist .
It appeared they had reached a dead end .
Cummer was n't convinced .
" In my mind , waves are waves , " he said .
" It was hard for me to imagine that something you could do with electromagnetic waves would be completely undoable for sound waves . "
This time , he started instead from a shell like the microwave cloak his team had already devised and attempted to derive the mathematical specifications required to prevent such a shell from reflecting sound waves , a key characteristic for achieving invisibility .
On paper , at least , it worked .
" We ’ve now shown that both 2 - D and 3 - D acoustic cloaks theoretically do exist , " Cummer said .
Although the theory used to design such acoustic devices so far is n't as general as the one used to devise the microwave cloak , the finding nonetheless paves the way for other acoustic devices , for instance , those meant to bend or concentrate sound .
" It opens up the door to make the physical shape of an object different from its acoustic shape , " he said .
The existence of an acoustic cloaking solution also indicates that cloaks might possibly be built for other wave systems , Cummer said , including seismic waves that travel through the earth and the waves at the surface of the ocean .
Collaborators on the study included Bogdan - Ioan Popa , David R. Smith and Marco Rahm of Duke ; David Schurig of N.C. State University ; John Pendry of Imperial College London ; and Anthony Starr of SensorMetrix , Inc. in San Diego , Calif .

James is part of Intel 's Software Development Products team , and author of Intel Threading Building Blocks : Outfitting C++ for Multi-core Processor Parallelism .
He can be reached at [ email protected ]
Programming for multicore processors poses new challenges .
Here are eight rules for multicore programming to help you be successful :
Think parallel .
Approach all problems looking for the parallelism .
Understand where parallelism is , and organize your thinking to express it .
Decide on the best parallel approach before other design or implementation decisions .
Learn to " Think Parallel . "
Program using abstraction .
Focus on writing code to express parallelism , but avoid writing code to manage threads or processor cores .
Libraries , OpenMP , and Intel Threading Building Blocks are all examples of using abstractions .
Do not use raw native threads ( pthreads , Windows threads , Boost threads , and the like ) .
Threads and MPI are the assembly languages for parallelism .
They offer maximum flexibility , but require too much time to write , debug , and maintain .
Your programming should be at a high - enough level that your code is about your problem , not about thread or core management .
Program in tasks ( chores ) , not threads ( cores ) .
Leave the mapping of tasks to threads or processor cores as a distinctly separate operation in your program , preferably an abstraction you are using that handles thread / core management for you .
Create an abundance of tasks in your program , or a task that can be spread across processor cores automatically ( such as an OpenMP loop ) .
By creating tasks , you are free to create as many as you can without worrying about oversubscription .
Design with the option to turn concurrency off .
To make debugging simpler , create programs that can run without concurrency .
This way , when debugging , you can run programs first with then without concurrency , and see if both runs fail or not .
Debugging common issues is simpler when the program is not running concurrently because it is more familiar and better supported by today 's tools .
Knowing that something fails only when run concurrently hints at the type of bug you are tracking down .
If you ignore this rule and can't force your program to run in only one thread , you 'll spend too much time debugging .
Since you want to have the capability to run in a single thread specifically for debugging , it does n't need to be efficient .
You just need to avoid creating parallel programs that require concurrency to work correctly , such as many producer - consumer models .
MPI programs often violate this rule , which is part of the reason MPI programs can be problematic to implement and debug .
Avoid using locks .
Simply say " no " to locks .
Locks slow programs , reduce their scalability , and are the source of bugs in parallel programs .
Make implicit synchronization the solution for your program .
When you still need explicit synchronization , use atomic operations .
Use locks only as a last resort .
Work hard to design the need for locks completely out of your program .
Use tools and libraries designed to help with concurrency .
Do n't " tough it out " with old tools .
Be critical of tool support with regards to how it presents and interacts with parallelism .
Most tools are not yet ready for parallelism .
Look for threadsafe libraries ideally ones that are designed to utilize parallelism themselves .
Use scalable memory allocators .
Threaded programs need to use scalable memory allocators .
Period .
There are a number of solutions and I 'd guess that all of them are better than malloc ( ) .
Using scalable memory allocators speeds up applications by eliminating global bottlenecks , reusing memory within threads to better utilize caches , and partitioning properly to avoid cache line sharing .
Design to scale through increased workloads .
The amount of work your program needs to handle increases over time .
Plan for that .
Designed with scaling in mind , your program will handle more work as the number of processor cores increase .
Every year , we ask our computers to do more and more .
Your designs should favor using increases in parallelism to give you advantages in handling bigger workloads in the future .
I wrote these rules with explicit mention of threading everywhere .
Only rule # 7 is specifically related to threading .
Threading is not the only way to get value out of multicore .
Running multiple programs or multiple processes is often used , especially in server applications .
These rules will work well for you to get the most out of multicore .
Some will grow in importance over the next 10 years , as the number of processor cores rises and we see an increase in the diversity of the cores themselves .
The coming of heterogeneous processors and NUMA , for instance , makes rule # 3 more and more important .
You should understand all eight and take all eight to heart .
I look forward to any comments you may have about these rules or parallelism in general .
This article has been revised and re-written several times since its very first publication in 2007 , to keep the information current .
The most recent revision was done by Flip Stewart in January 2015 .
What are CSS Sprites ?
Spoiler alert : they are n’t fairies that write your stylesheets for you .
I wish .
In short : CSS Sprites are a means of combining multiple images into a single image file for use on a website , to help with performance .
Sprite may seem like a bit of a misnomer considering that you ’re creating a large image as opposed to working with many small ones , but the history of sprites , dating back to 1975 , should help clear things up .
To summarize : the term “ sprites ” comes from a technique in computer graphics , most often used in video games .
The idea was that the computer could fetch a graphic into memory , and then only display parts of that image at a time , which was faster than having to continually fetch new images .
The sprite was the big combined graphic .
CSS Sprites is pretty much the exact same theory : get the image once , and shift it around and only display parts of it .
This reduces the overhead of having to fetch multiple images .
Why use CSS Sprites ?
It may seem counterintuitive to cram smaller images into a larger image .
Would n’t larger images take longer to load ?
Let ’s look at some numbers on an actual example :
Image File Size Dimensions canada.png 1.95 KB 256 x 128 usa.png 3.74 KB 256 x 135 mexico.png 8.69 KB 256 x 147
That adds up to a total of 14.38 KB to load the three images .
Putting the three images into a single file weighs in at 16.1KB .
The sprite ends up being 1.72 KB larger than the three separate images .
This is n’t a big difference , but there needs to be a good reason to accept this larger file … and there is !
While the total image size ( sometimes ) goes up with sprites , several images are loaded with a single HTTP request .
Browsers limit the number of concurrent requests a site can make and HTTP requests require a bit of handshaking .
Thus , sprites are important for the same reasons that minifying and concatinating CSS and JavaScript are important .
How do you use CSS Sprites ?
Here ’s an example sprite , with three different countries flags combined into a single image :
You set the same background - image on several CSS classes and set the background position and dimensions of the individual classes to display a single portion of the sprite .
Here ’s some code that demonstrates the concept :
.flags-canada , .flags-mexico , .flags-usa { background - image : url ( '../images/flags.png ' ) ; background - repeat : no - repeat ; } . flags - canada { height : 128 px ; background - position : - 5 px - 5 px ; } . flags - usa { height : 135 px ; background - position : - 5 px - 143 px ; } . flags - mexico { height : 147 px ; background - position : - 5 px - 288 px ; }
If you ’re thinking that there has to be a way to automate this so that you are n’t manually creating these sprites and then adjusting your stylesheet to match , you ’re right , and you ’re in luck !
Generate Sprites with Grunt / Gulp / Node
If you ’re using Grunt , Gulp , or Node in general , css-sprite ( now called sprity ) is a wonderful node package that creates sprites from a glob of images .
Sprity has a lot of great features including formatting output as PNG , JPG ( or Data URIs of those ) , and stylesheet generation in CSS , LESS , Sass , and Stylus .
To compile sprites via command line , install css-sprite globally with :
$ npm install sprity -g
Then , to generate sprites and the corresponding stylesheet , run :
$ sprity ./output - directory / ./input-directory/*.png
For more information on using css-sprite with Grunt or Gulp ( or many other environments ) , head over to the project ’s repository on GitHub .
Generate Sprites with Compass
Generating sprites with Compass takes some additional setup and maintenance , but if you ’re already using Compass , it fits in well with your existing workflow .
Start by creating a directory within your `images` directory ( yes , it does need to be inside your `images` directory to work ) with a name that corresponds to the sprites you ’d like to create .
Ensure that the images you ’re converting to sprites are PNGs and place them in your new directory .
I ’m creating flag sprites , so I ’ve named my directory flags and placed three PNGs in the directory .
In a new SCSS file that I ’ve called `flags. scss` ( the name here is not important ) , the following three lines will , in order , import Compass ’ sprite making tools , glob import the PNGs to be converted to sprites ( notice that the path here does not include images / ) , and then generate the CSS for the sprites .
Be mindful that the @include statement ’s middle word needs to match the directory in the line before it .
@import " compass/utilities / sprites " ; @import " flags /*.png " ; @include all - flags - sprites ;
This is a fairly simple process for generating sprites , but it has a few drawbacks / oddities :
The generated CSS does not include widths or heights for the sprites .
There is no shared class between the sprites ; the background - image is applied to each class .
Generating Sprites with ImageMagick
ImageMagick can be used to create a spritesheet from the command line with the following commands :
convert *.png - append sprites.png # append vertically convert *.png + append sprites.png # append horizontally
This will take all the PNG files selected by the glob and concatenate them into a single file , but will not create the corresponding stylesheet .
If you use ImageMagick to create your sprites , you may want to read the section below on using Sprite Cow .
Using Sprite Cow with your Sprites
Sprite Cow is a hosted tool for generating a stylesheet corresponding to your sprites .
It does n’t make the sprite for you , it just helps you get numbers you need to use the sprite ( the width , height , and background - position of individual parts of the sprite ) .
It boasts 2 x image compatibility and a simple interface for quickly designating which areas of the sprite make up each image to create CSS for .
You just click the part you need and it gives you the CSS you need .
Generate Sprites with Spritepad
Spritepad is another hosted solution for creating sprites .
With Spritepad , you upload individual images , position them however you ’d like , and the CSS is updated in real time .
When you ’re done , download the image and copy the CSS over to your project .
Generate Sprites with SpriteMe
SpriteMe is a bookmarklet that generates a sprite based on what it finds on the current page .
So essentially you ’d develop without using sprites at all , then use this to sprite things together at the end .
Here ’s a workflow explaining how that would work .
Should my sprites be horizontal or vertical ?
One option is neither .
Compact them into a grid , making the smallest size , dimensionally that you can .
The dimensional size of an image plays a role in how much memory the image will take up when being used , so the less the better .
If you end up laying out your own sprite , Sprite Cow is a good tool to help with the CSS generation part .
If , for simplicity , you ’re going to pick one or the other , one way to do that is to look at the largest width and the largest height of your image files .
If the largest width is greater than the largest height , the sprite sheet should be arranged horizontally .
If the largest height is greater than the largest width , vertically .
If you ’re using a generation tool , they will generally make this choice for you .
In some situations , it may actually make sense to lay out a sprite diagonally .
This can make it possible to use a sprite in an area of unknown width and height , which is pretty cool .
Although another possible way to get around that is using a pseudo element .
Alternatives
There are a few alternatives to CSS sprites , but , as you might expect , they each have their own benefits and drawbacks .
Data URIs
Data URIs allow you to embed the image data directly into a stylesheet .
This avoids additional HTTP requests for images , making it essentially the same thing as a sprite , without the fancy positioning .
Icon Fonts
Icont fonts are similar to sprites in that the achieve the same thing : combining multiple images into a single request .
SVGs
SVG images can be combined into a sprite as well and used as an icon system .
It ’s a slightly different approach though , utilizing the syntax and strengths of SVG .
You may need to think about a fallback system though , as SVG does n’t have as deep of browser support as CSS background - image ( which essentially has no browser support issues at all ) .
Grunticon and Iconizr are possibilities for working with SVG sprites that help with the fallbacks .
Using < img > and object - position
Robin Rendle has a great post on this clever technique here .
Examples
Mozilla Developer
Network uses sprites to switch between different states when toggling their top level navigation .
Mailchimp uses sprites ( background - image SVG ) for their sidebar navigation in various states .
Mapbox uses an icon font for their smaller icons used throughout the site , but uses fairly high resolution sprites for social media and press logos

With several private companies launching businesses to provide customers with unprecedented access to their genomes ' secrets , legislation protecting people from genetic discrimination is more timely than ever .
But Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Oklahama ) is single - handedly stalling federal legislation to do just that .
The Senate passed earlier versions of the bill twice before , but they were blocked from coming up for House floor votes .
This year , the House passed it by a bipartisan landslide , but Coburn has held up the legislation in the Senate , saying it could place too much strain on businesses .
" We 're not really clear on what Coburn wants , because his excuses do n't make sense , " said the bill 's original sponsor , Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D - New York ) .
" But if this bill got to a floor vote in the Senate , I think it 'd pass almost unanimously . "
Coburn spokesman John Hart said his boss supports the intent of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act , known as GINA .
Coburn voted for a nearly identical bill in 2005 , but now says the bill 's language exposes employers to too much liability .
Supporters of the bill see Coburn 's new beef as another in a string of inconsequential objections to the legislation .
23andMe , Navigenics and Decode Genetics have recently launched programs to scan individual 's genomes and provide access to the information online .
Customers will have to spend a for 23andMe 's service .
In the absence of federal legislation , most states provide some degree of protection against discrimination .
Many have gone further , explicitly providing genetic - privacy protections .
Alaskan law ( .pdf ) , for example , says DNA samples are an individual 's private property .
Still , companies offering personal genome scans , as well as biotechs offering genetic diagnostic tests , worry that their businesses will not gain traction without a federal law .
Slaughter introduced GINA in the House 12 years ago , but Republican leadership repeatedly blocked a vote , even as it passed the Senate twice .
Under this year 's new Democratic majority , the House passed GINA , 420 - 3 ( H.R. 493 ) , and it appeared ready to sail through the Senate ( S. 358 ) .
But Coburn , exercising a prerogative available to all senators , placed it on hold , which requires a supermajority of 60 senators just to bring the bill up for a relatively rare floor debate .
An internal memo obtained Thursday from Coburn 's office said the senator 's make - or - break objection was the possibility that an employer who provides health insurance for its workers could be sued both as an insurer and as an employer .
That means employers could be hit for much higher damages than insurers .
Representative Slaughter said she 'd never heard that particular objection from any company in 12 years of campaigning on behalf of GINA .
" But it 's pretty creative , " she said .
Coburn is a physician .
He picked up the nickname " Dr. No " from pundit George Will , because of his frequent contrarian positions and use of the hold prerogative .
Coburn has consistently opposed bills that enable lawsuits against businesses and his fellow medical doctors .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and trade associations like the National Retail Federation are GINA 's main opponents , claiming it would spur frivolous lawsuits .
Michael Eastman , executive director of labor policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , applauded the Senator 's move to stop the bill .
" Coburn has been willing to put his name out there , " he said .

The Republican Florida State Representative says he ’s not a criminal , a racist , or was trolling for sex .
Embattled state Rep. Bob Allen , who has been vilified by computer bloggers and lampooned on late - night talk shows since his arrest on a charge of soliciting prostitution , is not a criminal or a racist and has no plans to resign , his attorney said Wednesday .
“ Based on the police officer ’s own report , this case should be dismissed , ” said attorney Greg Eisenmenger , adding that he would file a motion for dismissal .
“ The officer did all the soliciting . ”
… Allen , R - Merritt Island , told investigators he was just playing along when the undercover Titusville officer suggested oral sex and $ 20 because he was intimidated by the “ stocky black guy , ” according to the statement .
Allen , who is white , also said that there “ was nothing but other black guys around in the park ” and that he thought he was about to be robbed .
At the time , Allen was unaware the other men also were undercover officers .
The last time Columbus , Kentucky was a significant part of the national political dialog was more than 200 years ago , when Thomas Jefferson proposed moving the national capital here after Washington D.C. was razed .
Now the tiny rural burg of 229 residents is poised again for the historical spotlight , thanks to trendy social networking tools and experimental grassroots digital campaigning that ’s taken center stage in the 2008 election campaign .
This week , Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards will announce a stop here in early October , a result of placing his itinerary in the hands of voters through Eventful , a web–based event - planning site , a campaign spokeswoman said .
" I think such visits are important because they engage rural voters , " said Shawn Dixon , a 24 - year - old activist who helped orchestrate the trip , besting efforts from much larger destinations through clever digital lobbying .
" I think people write us off , but when 1,800 people from a region step up and say we want people to come to speak , that gives rural Americans a voice . "
Edwards ' journey to an obscure town in the Bluegrass state highlights the often - unpredictable ripple effects from unprecedented Web 2.0 - enabled community involvement in this campaign .
So far this year , the candidates and electorate have been subjected to a CNN / YouTube debate that was criticized for falling flat and not being community - oriented enough .
Earlier this month , they saw a half - hearted attempt by Yahoo to give voters a voice in interpreting candidates ' messages through a promotion of its presidential mash - up .
San Diego - based Eventful , founded in 2004 , is used by performers and businesses worldwide to interact with their audiences and customers .
Musicians and festival organizers use the tool to promote their events and determine venues .
More than 20,000 musicians , for example , have asked their fans to help select tour stops .
Since the application 's launch in 2006 , there have been five million " demands " in all for performers registered on the Eventful website , said company CEO Jordan Glazier .
With a mere three or four visits from presidential candidates so far this year , Kentucky ranks among the most neglected states on the national political stage .
Since its primary takes place on May 20 – well after the agenda - setting Iowa caucuses in January and the crush of Super Tuesday primaries in February , Kentucky is n't attracting much attention from the presidential candidates .
But in June , Edwards promised to speak in the city that piled up the most demands for him by July 18 , through Eventful .
Columbus , with a population of 229 , won the contest with 1,870 demands .
The town is located on a bend in the Mississippi river in Hickman County , which is home to just under 5,000 people , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Hickman County residents won over larger metropolitan areas such as Denver , Dallas , Los Angeles and San Francisco .
The city with the second - most demands for Edwards was Eureka , California , with a population of about 26,000 people .
Hickman 's victory was largely due to the efforts of Dixon , a politically passionate Columbus native who is now a first - year scholarship law student at the top-rated New York University School of Law .
The son of two factory workers , Hickman , 24 , is a Democratic activist , the first person in his family to go to college and an Edwards supporter .
( He 's also running an internet campaign to unseat Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican . )
Dixon began his campaign in May with an e-mail blast to his friends and acquaintances asking them to join Eventful to demand an Edwards visit to Columbus .
He followed up by posting the request on Facebook and MySpace .
On Eventful , Dixon described his hometown this way : " Columbus , Kentucky is a small town in Western Kentucky that boasts a population of 229 people and is about a 50 - minute drive from the closest McDonalds .
Like many rural communities across the south , job loss in the face of rising healthcare costs and education costs have crippled the economy . "
A visit from Edwards would provide a rare opportunity to highlight important issues facing rural America , he wrote .
" We want to see John Edwards come to real rural America and address the problems we face and hear his plan for revitalizing small American communities like ours ! " he wrote on this Eventful post .
Dixon says that Facebook was particularly useful in spreading the word because he had about 800 " friends " in that network whom he knew personally through high school , college and work .
He also wrote about his effort on the popular liberal blog , DailyKos .
Dixon also wants to use the visit to dispel the notion that all Southern states would automatically vote Republican .
Bush carried Hickman County with 60 percent of the votes in 2004 .
So far in this campaign however , state residents ' financial donations to the presidential candidates have flowed primarily into the coffers of the Democratic candidates , with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton in the lead , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
The event has also provided welcome publicity to Edwards , who is running on an anti-poverty platform and who trails both 2008 presidential campaign rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama according to several national polls .
Several local newspapers ran stories and editorials about the Eventful contest and about Dixon .
Wolf Blitzer 's " Situation Room " on CNN also spotlighted the contest several times over the summer .
And when Edwards visits Columbus in October , at least one national news show is expected to show up to cover the event .
Bruce Cunningham , a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service in Columbus , said he is looking forward to hearing Edwards speak about the Iraq war , education , affordable high - speed internet access and health care .
Columbus currently does n't have access to broadband .
Cunningham and his family have a dial - up connection .
" People ca n't afford ( broadband ) in this area , " he said .
" Most people in this area live pay check to pay check at $ 8 an hour – it's really hard for families . "
Stuttgart - based physicists observe the critical Casimir force and use it to cancel out an effect that brings nanomachines to a standstill .
When a machine jams , it ’s the fault of the engineer - or of physics .
The latter is true at least for the first simple nanomachines which are slowed down by the Casimir effect .
This force only works on the scale of a few millionths of a centimetre and makes tiny machine parts cling together .
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Metals Research and the University of Stuttgart have now observed a similar force in a mixture of two liquids .
They have also found a way to reverse the effect of the force so that blockages might be avoided in future nanomachines .
This will make it possible to miniaturise machines even further and produce nano - scale mechanical switches or sensors .
Nothing comes from nothing .
Only in physics is this not always true .
For example , two metal plates placed about half a micrometre apart in a vacuum and at a temperature of absolute zero exert a mysterious attraction on each other .
The force pushing the plates together comes from the quantum mechanical fluctuations of the vacuum - so from nothing .
This fluctuation represents variations in electromagnetic waves .
These need to have a node on the surfaces of the two electrically conductive plates , which considerably limits the number of waves permitted between the plates .
Outside of the plates they can spread without restriction .
This results in the attraction between the plates .
The physicist Hendrik Casimir predicted this effect in theory as early as 1948 ; today it is the reason why the components in nanomachines adhere to each other .
Clemens Bechinger , professor at the University of Stuttgart and a Max Planck Fellow since the beginning of the year , Christopher Hertlein and other staff members have now observed a very similar force in experiments with a mixture of water and the oily liquid lutidine : the critical Casimir force .
" This force is so weak that it is very difficult to detect , " says Clemens Bechinger .
The results nevertheless agree very well with the values that Siegfried Dietrich , director at the Max Planck Institute of Metal Research in Stuttgart and his team had predicted in theory .
The scientists have now published the results jointly .
The critical Casimir force gets its name from the fact that it occurs close to a critical point , such as that in a mixture of water and lutidine .
At low temperatures it forms a clear solution .
However , if the solution is heated to around 34 degrees Celsius , it becomes two separate mixtures ; physicists refer to these as two phases : one with a high water content and the other with a high lutidine content .
The temperature at which this happens is called the critical temperature .
The two phases do not come into being abruptly at this critical point , like water solidifying into ice .
It is more the case that below the critical temperature areas form in the mixture that contain more water or more lutidine .
The closer the temperature gets to the critical point , the larger these fluctuating areas grow and the longer they remain intact .
" The way the concentration of water and lutidine fluctuates in different parts of the mixture is similar to the quantum mechanical fluctuations in the vacuum , " says Siegfried Dietrich .
The fluctuations in concentration should create an attraction between surfaces in a similar way .
The researchers have now proven that this is exactly what they do .
" We observed a plastic sphere with a diameter of a micrometre floating in a glass with lutidine and water , " says Christopher Hertlein .
The temperature of the solution was initially much lower than the critical point .
The researchers then heated it up gradually .
When the temperature was only 0.2 degrees away from the critical point , the plastic sphere moved towards the glass surface .
The physicists used evanescent optical fields to determine the distance of the sphere to the glass surface by scattering them at the plastic sphere .
They shined light towards the glass at a sharp angle so that it was reflected almost completely .
Only a tiny part of the light leaked into the liquid .
How much reaches the plastic sphere and how much this part is scattered depends very much on the distance of the sphere to the glass surface .
The researchers succeeded in using the distance of the sphere to calculate the force working on it .
It was tricky : the tiny sphere moved very rapidly because it was constantly colliding with the heated molecules of the liquid .
The critical Casimir force therefore only manifests itself in the form of statistical blips towards the glass surface .
" We can only detect these statistical blips because our measuring method is several thousand times more sensitive than atomic force microscopy , " says Clemens Bechinger : " That means we can measure in the range of one femtonewton " .
Atomic force microscopy measures the attraction which a surface exerts on a fine measuring arm .
Using the optical measuring method , the physicists in Stuttgart have now established that the critical Casimir force only amounts to 600 femtonewtons , which is less than a millionth of the weight of a flea .
However , this force pushes the plastic sphere to the glass surface only when the glass and the sphere both prefer water or both prefer oil .
If the two surfaces are coated so that only one of the two surfaces favors oil , the critical Casimir force pushes the sphere away from the glass surface .
Then areas with a lot of water form on one surface and some with a lot of oil on the other .
Since it takes energy to make contact between the water and the oil phases , the sphere is repelled .
" This is the effect that our theoretical calculations led us to expect , " says Dietrich .
The researchers expect that this experimental proof may offer the possibility of stopping blockages in nanomachines .
These machines , on a scale of a few millionths of a centimetre , could one day be used as actuators in medicine , for example .
They could allow less invasive operations or medication to be transported directly to the focus of disease .
However , one of the reasons machines like this have failed up to now is partly due to the Casimir force of the quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuation , which brings them to a standstill .
" If these machines would work not in a vacuum , but in a liquid mixture close to the critical point , that could be changed , " says Siegfried Dietrich .
Then the machine parts could be coated so that the Casimir force has a repelling effect , meaning that the machine runs smoothly .
This is one of the objectives that Dietrich ’s theoretical group and Bechinger ’s experimental group will be pursuing in the future .

There were no climate change protesters waiting to jeer as the chief executives and other senior figures of one of the world 's biggest industries gathered on Wednesday .
Yet they represented a business that produces more than 5 % of mankind 's carbon dioxide emissions .
And they were in Brussels to discuss climate change .
The summit was not called by the aviation industry - that is comparatively clean in comparison .
Nor was it made up of car makers , oil companies , shipping firms or any other business that has traditionally drawn the fire of green campaigners .
These chief executives deal in a more down - to - earth commodity : cement .
It is the key ingredient in concrete , and one that is rapidly emerging as a major obstacle on the world 's path to a low - carbon economy .
No company will make carbon - neutral cement any time soon .
The manufacturing process depends on burning vast amounts of cheap coal to heat kilns to more than 1,500C .
It also relies on the decomposition of limestone , a chemical change which frees carbon dioxide as a byproduct .
So as demand for cement grows , for sewers , schools and hospitals as well as for luxury hotels and car parks , so will greenhouse gas emissions .
Cement plants and factories across the world are projected to churn out almost 5 bn tonnes of carbon dioxide annually by 2050 - 20 times as much as the government has pledged the entire UK will produce by that time .
Dimitri Papalexopoulos , managing director of Titan Cement , Athens , who attended the meeting , said : " No matter what you do , cement production will always release carbon dioxide .
You can't change the chemistry , so we can't achieve spectacular cuts in emissions .
" Cement is needed to satisfy basic human needs , and there is no obvious substitute , so there is a trade - off between development and sustainability . "
Concrete is the second most used product on the planet , after water , and almost half of it is produced in China .
The booming Chinese economy has created such a demand for building materials that cement production there last year released 540 m tonnes of carbon dioxide - just short of Britain 's total output from all sources .
Cement 's weight and low value mean it is almost always made close to where it is needed , and China 's demand helped it to overtake the US as the world 's leading polluter last year .
Like the aviation industry , the expected rapid growth in cement production is at severe odds with calls to cut carbon emissions to tackle global warming .
Cement plants in Europe already face pollution caps under the emissions trading scheme .
With no obvious way to significantly clean up their act , the companies are nervous about future regulation .
So they have taken the unusual collective step of drawing attention to their damaging impact .
Mr Papalexopoulos said : " Unlike the airlines , cement is not directly visible to the consumer , so cement companies do n't have the same profile .
I call it enlightened self - interest .
We know there is an issue .
If we draw attention to ourselves then we could attract criticism , but we could also have a voice in the regulatory solutions .
Otherwise we could have something thrust upon us . "
The Brussels meeting brought together the heads and senior staff of 18 companies which make more than 40 % of the world 's cement .
Howard Klee , who coordinates the initiative called the Cement Sustainability Initiative ( CSI ) , denies it is an industrial lobby group .
He said : " We have issues that affect our industry , and these companies are talking about what they might do to prepare for them .
" Most people are not even aware that making cement produces carbon dioxide .
It is an incredibly low - profile business and power companies , transportation and airlines get much more attention .
But if producing carbon dioxide starts to cost businesses money , it looks like it will have a huge impact on [ cement companies ' ] financial performance . "
Already , some cement companies have taken steps to reduce their environmental impact .
Some burn waste products alongside coal , while others have reworked their recipes and tried to make their plants more energy - efficient , with modest success .
The CSI companies are working to standardise such techniques and to issue guidelines on how they can be adopted by others , and plan to publish a progress report in February .
Like George Bush , the CSI prefers voluntary goals and reductions in the " energy intensity " of its products , rather than fixed emission targets .
The Japanese company Taiheiyo has pledged to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide it emits for each tonne of cement by 3 % by 2010 - a saving that will be swamped by the expected increase in production .
Michio Kimura , chairman of Taiheiyo , said : " Without a [ binding ] cap then emissions will go up .
But we must stop production to meet a cap and that is not good for business .
We focus on energy intensity , better performance for the industry and technology . "
In the long term , only carbon capture and storage could significantly reduce cement emissions , and the industry sponsors research into how this could be done .
Mr Kimura said companies in developing countries needed to develop cleaner technology so it could be used by cement manufacturers in China , none of which have accepted invitations to join the CSI .
But many of the newer cement plants in China are cleaner than more established facilities elsewhere , such as in the US - also not represented by the initiative .
Mr Papalexopoulos said : " Sustainability is always talked about from an ethical perspective , which is right , but we also need to look at sustainability based on a business rationale .
Regional caps such as the European scheme create an uneven playing field and have unintended consequences .
" Does it make sense from an environmental perspective to cap cement production in Europe , and for cement companies in Europe to shift production to North Africa , where there are less stringent controls ?
This a global problem , not a regional one .
Our industry is trying to develop a global sector approach , which we believe would be better . "
· This article was amended on Tuesday October 16 2007 .
We lost some decimal places when we said that cement production in China produced 540,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year .
The figure was 540 million tonnes .
This has been corrected .
· The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday October 29 2007 .
In this article about pollution and the cement industry we said that US cement plants are not represented by the Cement Sustainability Initiative ( CSI ) .
Ash Grove Cement based in Kansas has been a member of the CSI since 2006 .

Bloody Letters , Wal - Mart T - shirt
Warning : People triggered by stalking or cutting , this likely is n't for you .
I sent repeated drunken emails telling _____ _____
I was in my car , bleeding , both arms sliced wide fucking open with whatever I had handy -- knife , razor , multi- tool -- in the late spring / early summer of 2003 , after my suicide attempt .
The first month I even drove by her place a few times in traffic flow .
Yeah .
I warned you .
The stories I 've told you till now were the tame ones .
This is still pretty much in the tame category but we 're starting to get there as we build trust , you and I .
There 's harder to listen to come .
No one got hurt .
She calmed me down by email here and there , and an occasional phone call .
I stopped sending her drunken emails .
Stopped cutting myself when I got my ankle tattoo at another friend 's suggestion -- a tattoo would give me a permanent record , my friend said , thus no need to keep scaring myself to make sure I 'd never forget .
Worked .
Also , I was starting to gain some control back and cutting is all about having control .
My pain then was so enormous , both physically from my injuries but especially emotionally -- not just over the loss of my girlfriend , but from all in a moment discovering the total failure of my whole life , 31 years spent single - mindedly seducing women , how utterly evil I had become claiming to do good , how many lives I 'd ruined without thought .
And to live with that ?
Insanity and death , possibly both , were much more attractive .
That I was going to hurt was a given .
When , where and how I hurt -- that I kept scrabbling for control over .
Once I learned how to be in control of causing hurting myself , under the guidance of my therapist I sloooowly extended control to causing not hurting myself .
She and I met in person one last time a few months later , August 2002 , at a previously scheduled conference away from Puget Sound .
Spent hours talking with a mutual friend , a highly trained counselor who helped both of us sort out what we wanted from each other .
I wanted her back .
She wanted out out out , but was willing to talk to me occasionally if I 'd get we were over and let her off the hook .
I did .
( For certain who I was then was in enormous pain many ways and neither sane or even " me " , but that 's how it went . )
" Let her off the hook ? " I cringe just hearing the words now .
As if I had some right or she needed to ask my permission .
We emailed perhaps eight to ten times after that .
Talked only once .
And we were done .
( I 'd even burned her " special " photos . )
I healed .
Have absolutely no clue -- or interest -- in how the woman I 'd conned into talk of marriage is doing .
I hope well .
But not only is n't it my business , I no longer care .
That 's called a good result .
Does not always end that way .
Feministing Comments ( UCLAbodyimage )
David Buss , an evolutionary psychologist , recently published a book called " The Murderer Next Door " which talks about stalking .
Based on his study of 13,000 wife killings , he says :
Separation is also a powerful trigger for murder .
According to a study of homicides in Chicago , 50 percent of wife killings took place within the first two months of the separation , and an astonishing 85 percent of these women were killed within the first year .
In contrast , among the women who contemplated killing their mates , getting dumped accounted for only 13 percent .
Among women killed by a partner they have separated from , 88 PERCENT HAD BEEN STALKED PRIOR TO BEING KILLED ” Buss said .
“ Although most stalkers do not kill their victims , most mate - killing men do stalk their victims .
Stalking is one danger sign that women should not ignore .
“ Just when women feel as though they have successfully escaped a bad marriage is precisely the time when their lives are most in danger , ” he added .
“ It is likely that the key danger is not the length of time per se but , rather , when the man realizes she will never return to him . ”
Based on existing research , Buss concluded for the few mate killings that occur a year or more after estrangement , it seems the couple actually had sexual contact during the year even though the woman had moved out .
The hope that she might return , as indicated by sex , offers a protective buffer , lowering the odds the man will try to kill her .
But then when the sex stops , and he realizes she will never come back , the woman ’s life is in danger .
turns out

all my responsibility
Charlotte Observer
For the past two years , this woman has been stalked until she feels like a prisoner in her own life .
She has been spied upon , bullied and threatened with her life .
She has been in frequent communication with local authorities .
Yet , because North Carolina has one of the most vague stalking laws in the nation ( a bill is wending its way through the legislature to address that ) , her recourse has been limited .
So when she saw the T - shirts , clearly aimed for the teen - younger adult set , she did n't see the humor .
" It 's reprehensible , " said the woman , whose story is well documented but who asked not to be identified for fear that her stalker might retaliate .
" People do n't realize how serious stalking is , " she said .
" You constantly live in fear , look over your shoulder and suffer from psychological and physical symptoms due to the stress of the stalker . "
She wondered aloud :
What 's next ?
" Some say it 's rape , I call it hot sex " ?
Or : " Some call it domestic violence , I say I 'm just teaching her a lesson " ?
The question now is how the world 's largest retailer will respond .
Tara Stewart , a spokeswoman for the company , forwarded me information about Wal - Mart partnering with the attorney general 's office in South Carolina on a public education campaign to combat domestic violence .
" We work hard on this issue and do a great deal to bring awareness and help families in need , " she wrote in an e-mail message .
And the T - shirts fit into that public education campaign how ?
Repeated calls and e-mail messages elicited promises of answers -- but no answer .
No explanation .

One last point :
The Bush administration argues that it is not bound by FISA , amended or not .
This post is a test .
You see , I 've read Al Gore 's new book , .
And I want to see if any other readers of that book have heeded its lessons .
Otherwise , further discussion is pointless , democracy is doomed , and I might as well spend my remaining days " air conducting " Bruckner .
To be specific :
Let 's see if people are capable of reasoned debate on the new FISA amendment , more properly known as S1927 or the Protect America Act .
Reason , alas , seems a scarce commodity in these times of boiling blood .
Yesterday , Randi Rhodes had a caller who insisted that the passage of this act meant that Democrats should get rid of Harry Reid as Senate leader and replace him with Jim Webb .
This , despite the fact that Reid votedthe bill and Webb votedit !( I hate being in the same party with such dimwits .
That caller 's reaction was pure Daddyism : Webb looks and sounds more like a Daddy than Reid does . )
Now , I cite that example because it represents a widespread reaction .
Over at D.U. , MadFloridian has proven to be one of the few observers who :
He points the finger at the Blue Dogs .
Nearly everyone else screams for the blood of Nancy Pelosi , She voted against the bill .
She tried to have it rewritten .
She called it an assault on the Constitution .
And even though the bill is a stop - gap measure , designed to last a mere six months , she has asked John Conyers to fight to have it overturned or amendedmonth from now , as soon as Congress returns from recess .
What more could she do ?
Randi Rhodes suggested that the act could have been held up in the House Rules Committee .
But any such attempt would have been foolish and dangerous .
Even Russ Feingold admitted thatwas required -- on an emergency basis -- after a court had struck down the NSA 's ability to eavesdrop on foreign - to - foreign communications routed through U.S. telecommunications servers .
I agree with Feingold .
Look , thereterrorists in this world , and if Known Terrorist A in Dubai chats with Known Terrorist B in Indonesia , I do n't think the NSA should consider their communications inviolate simply because they decide to use AOL .
So something needed to be done .
Unfortunately , the amendment to FISA went too far .
Having said that , I must also note that many of the Act 's critics have pretended to an expertise they do not possess .
Let 's have a show of hands :
How many of you have actuallythe law ?
One of the most egregious rabble - rousers , I am sorry to say , was Larisa Alexandrovna .
It 's no secret that I think that she is just about the best journalist around right now .
( Every guy has a personal list of Women Worthy of a Crush ; I place Larisa somewhere between Anne Sophie - Mutter and Jennifer Connelly . )
But her piece " It 's official , we are police state " is inexcusable , and not just on grammatical grounds : Larisa , Larisa ...!
You speak as though this act is directed against all American dissenters .
The current measure is an amendment to the FISA act of 1978 .
Do you know what the " F " in FISA stands for ?
The answer is here Ah , I see that the Groucho - ized duck has descended from the ceiling .
" Da secret woid is .
" The act refers tosurveillance -- and like or not , the Attorney General has been the key figure in that act since 1978 .
The AG hasbeen the one deciding on cases of warrant - free eavesdropping .
( Do n't take my word for it .
Look it up : 50 U.S.C. sect ; 1802 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 50 U.S.C. sect ; 1802 ( a ) ( 3 ) . )
Despite the yelling and screaming you have heard , the current amendment does not greatly change the AG 's role .
Janet Reno had much the same power .
The only difference is that Reno was trustworthy and Gonzales is a snake .
If you want to read the actual statute , go here .
If you want to read the amendment -- the Protect America Thingie -- go here .
You have to read them together , for reasons that will soon become apparent .
Yeah , I know :
That 's a lot of homework .
But is n't it better to discuss an actual text , as opposed to dealing with a series of vague impressions gathered at third - hand from a gaggle of impassioned screamers ?
Like it or not , we 've known for a long time that the American intelligence community scoops up all sorts of foreign communications -- legally .
Hipper folks have known that our spies routinely trade information with British intelligence and other services in order to bypass FISA regulations .
The Brits are the ones spying on , and there aint ' nothin ' Congress can do about it .
Few people understand that , under the 1978 law , That part of the original FISA law was really directed at the intelligence services of foreign governments .
So what does the new amendment actually Let 's be candid .
My eyes lost focus trying to read that text , and so will yours .
Betcha dollars to donuts that the Congressfolk who passed the thing did n't read it very carefully .
If you read the 2007 Act without reference to the 1978 original , you will come away with the impression that nothing in it applies in any way to United States citizens .
I am sure that the Senators and House members who voted on the thing were rather surprised to hear from angry constituents who thought otherwise .
Many Democrats have been led to believe that the new law grants Gonzales the freedom to read every piece of email generated by the ACLU , the local PTA , and the Loyal Order of the Moose .
Legal experts disagree on the ramifications .
I 'm hardly an expert , just a citizen .
Here are the problems as one citizen sees them :
The target is no longer the KGB or the Chinese Public Security Bureau ; the target is nownon - U.S. person .
Here is where expert opinion seems to be divided .
Basically , Sec. 105B .
( a ) -- that 's the new bit -- allows the Director of National Intelligence and the AG to demand records from ISPs and other telecommunications providers , under certain circumstances .
The DNI is supposed to present evidence to the FISA court that the target really is foreign .
The scooping is supposed to be done according to " minimization procedures " under " section 101( h ) . "
What the hell doesmean ?
Ay , there 's the rub !
( When you check out the 1978 Act , you 'll find that these procedures are actually listed under 1801 ( h ) .
Many of the bill 's critics did n't bother to look this up . )
Minimization addresses an obvious problem :
What happens when a foreign national is in communication with a U.S. citizen ?
Take , for example , your phone sex sessions with that French lass you met online .
The new law allows the DNI to get all records of those steamy chats from the IRC server or cell phone provider .
Here is where the concept of minimization comes in .
The following is from the original law , the one we 've all lived with for the past 29 years .
Try to not let you eyes glaze over ; you should actuallythis :
And : The exception :
If the intercepted communication picks up discussion of a crime or planned crime , all bets are off .
Thus , if your phone sex session with that French lass segues into a discussion of the best way to kill her hated mother , the DNI can contact both the French cops and the American cops .
Needless to say , any US - foreign chat can lead to further eavesdropping on the US citizen --.
If no order appears , then all data involving the U.S. persondisappear within 72 hours .
That 's the law .
The problem here , as I see it , is that too much relies on one person 's judgment .
And we simply do not trust the judgment of this AG .
Frankly , we should not place this much trust inAG .
All of which leads us to problem numero three - o: In essence , they will be asked to give up records on foreigndomestic customers -- if those citizens have chatted with any foreigners lately .
Ever call customer assistance ?
You talked to a guy in India , did n't you ?
I do not believe that ISPs want to do this .
The Protect America
Act is not the Orwellian horror many have led you to believe .
But I still consider it bad law , and I have a few provisional ideas on how to fix it : Allowing the DNI and the AG to go afteroutside this country is insane .
Right now , the law says that the DNI may grab the data trail of anyone who may possess " foreign intelligence information . "
Hell , that phrase could apply to a guy running an ice cream parlor in Naples .
Since we now have the unhappy experience of living with an untrustworthy Attorney General -- and since at least half the country is bound to mistrustholding that position in future years -- we need to make sure than any data involving innocent U.S. citizens really is destroyed within three days , as the law requires .
Frankly , I do n't know how this can be accomplished .
1978 tech ai n't 2007 tech .
Nowadays , data has a habit of hanging around forever .
Every time the DNI and the AG interact in any way with the telecoms , they should provide a full record to a FISA court and the permanent Congressional intelligence committees .
Perhaps the public should be allowed to know what was done , in ageneral way .
The Protect America
Act does have oversight provisions , but they are , in my view , far too weak .
I 'm not sure how to address the legitimate complaints of the telecom providers .
Even so , if Pelosi , Conyers and Reid offer these fixes , then this is a law I could live with .
Alas , in such heated times , fixing the problem may not fix the problem .
Democrats will probably still scream for Pelosi 's head .
One can not argue with a mob .
And that is precisely the right word to describe the current anti-Democratic pseudo - progressives :
They are aHere 's my question to the " progressive " mobsters :
To what use did you people put Al Gore 's book ?
Did you tear out pages for butcher paper ?
If you step back from the legal minutia and take a more Olympian overview , you 'll see the Grand Joke underlying this whole discussion .
If American spooks want info on ( say ) an American anti-war group , they can always ask the Brits -- as they have done for 29 years .
And if I correctly understand what Russell Tice and others have said , the NSA 's current abilities go way , way beyond anything addressed by even the most current manifestation of the FISA Act .
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
Two reservoirs that supply drinking water to parts of the city have been shut down and will be drained after a rare sunlight and chlorine reaction tainted the water with a cancer - causing chemical , utility officials said Friday .
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power plans to drain 600 million gallons from the reservoirs , the Elysian and the Silver Lake , early next year , said a water department spokesman , Joseph Ramallo .
The reservoirs will be out of use for three to four months amid drought conditions .
High levels of the carcinogen bromate were found in early October by a commercial customer who ran a laboratory test , officials said .
The utility confirmed the finding , immediately removed the reservoirs from service and notified the Department of Public Health .
Officials emphasized that the chemical is dangerous only after long - term consumption .
The two reservoirs supply the water for about one - third of 1 percent of the city ’s annual consumption , or about the amount the entire city consumes in a day , Mr. Ramallo said .
SCHADENFREUDE ALERT …. The New York Times reports today that a group of conservative authors , including Swift Boat nutball Jerome Corsi , is suing right - wing darling Regnery Publishing .
The lead plaintiff is Richard Miniter , author of Shadow War : The Untold Story of How Bush Is Winning the War on Terror , who apparently got his hands on a royalty statement he was n’t supposed to see :
“ It suddenly occurred to us that Regnery is making collectively jillions of dollars off of us and paying us a pittance . ”
He added : “ Why is Regnery acting like a Marxist cartoon of a capitalist company ? ” …. The authors , who say in the lawsuit that [ Regnery ’s parent company ] has been “ unjustly enriched well in excess of one million dollars , ” are seeking unspecified damages .
But Mr. Miniter said , “ We ’re not looking for a payoff ; we ’re looking for justice . ”
Well , we ’re all looking for justice , are n’t we ?
But if a conservative is a liberal who ’s been mugged , what do you call a conservative who ’s come face to face with the naked face of vertically integrated capitalism ?
The chairs were installed in 2006 ( photo from MEN Syndication )
Three men , based in Bury , are being investigated for " involvement in the use of unauthorised rest facilities " .
It is claimed they broke regulations by using sleeping bags on the floor rather than the £ 400 chairs .
The chairs were installed as part of modernisation programme to replace all beds in the region 's 41 fire stations .
The Fire Brigades Union ( FBU ) said the men were all asleep as a team of inspectors from the fire service carried out a spot check early one morning .
Obviously what we are looking for is for common sense to prevail
Kevin Brown , FBU
" We have now christened them the furniture police , " said Manchester regional secretary Kevin Brown .
Mr Brown said the service launched an investigation into the incident and the men were due to appear before a level three disciplinary hearing on 14 June .
" A level three hearing leaves open the possibility for dismissal - this is how ludicrous this is , " said Mr Brown .
" Obviously what we are looking for is for common sense to prevail .
" These people work a 15 - hour night shift and they are entitled to take rest periods . "
Safety concerns
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said the inquiry concerned " involvement in the use of unauthorised rest facilities " .
" A full internal investigation into this matter is under way and no further comment can be made at this time , " a spokesman said .
The service bought more than 300 of the chairs last year after chiefs decided to remove beds from dormitories across the region .
But firefighters were not allowed to sit or lie on the devices before reading a four - page health and safety manual .
Two months after a recent college graduate incurred $ 53,000 in charges at a gentleman ’s club on Okaloosa Island , investigators are reviewing allegations of fraud and larceny .
Tommy Salter , 24 , of Warner Robbins , Ga. , was at Club 10 early Aug. 18 , celebrating his graduation from Georgia Tech , according to his father and an Okaloosa County Sheriff ’s report .
Salter told Club 10 employees he could only spend $ 600 , according the report .
But his dad , 52 - year - old Joe Salter of Mary Esther , was shocked by the $ 53,000 charge that ended up on a joint American Express credit card account he shares with his son .
“ Their employees totally took advantage of my son , ” Salter said Saturday .
“ It ’s totally ludicrous . ”
The club ’s co-owner called it “ a huge champagne night . ”
“ Oftentimes , men come in here and they spend a lot of money in an effort to show off in front of the entertainers , ” said Tim Beal .
“ And then they get buyer ’s remorse . ”
Club 10 employs women who also perform private dances , but Okaloosa County law prohibits full nudity .
Beal said Salter bought at least 19 bottles of champagne in a champagne room .
The bottles can range from $ 150 to $ 2,000 .
He also said Salter bought “ Club Cash , ” Monopoly - like money used to tip waitresses .
But Joe Salter said 24 of the 30 receipts he received from American Express were printed after 4 a.m. — when the club should have been asking patrons to leave .
He said his son was kept at Club 10 until 8 a.m. , when employees drove him home .
The last charge came at 7:54 a.m. , he said .
He said Tommy had been drinking heavily before arriving at Club 10 and could have been an easy target for manipulation .
Allegations on an Oct. 12 sheriff ‘s report include larceny over $ 20,000 and credit card fraud .
They represent charges that could be filed if the case is pursued in criminal court .
Otherwise , it may end up in civil court .
But Beal said he ’d already been in contact with American Express after Salter filed a chargeback with the company , seeking to have part of the charge withdrawn .
The company decided in Club 10 ’s favor .
“ We rarely ever lose chargeback attempts , ” Beal said .
Club 10 policy prohibits running tabs in the champagne room , Beal said .
Patrons must instead sign a receipt for each champagne purchase they make on credit .
Beal called it a “ straight sale ” policy .
He said the younger Salter signed each receipt , even scrawling his initials next to the itemized charges .
But Joe Salter says only the signature on the first receipt matches his son ’s signature ; the rest are signed with scribbles .
He also said Tommy came home with bruises on his neck .
He believes they came from club employees yanking him awake throughout the expensive morning .
In a letter to American Express , Beal wrote that Joseph Salter told him , “ This is not the first time my son has done something like this , ” and “ My son gets out of control when he drinks . ”
Salter called those statements false and said past credit card statements would prove that his son had never “ done something like this ” before .
When asked if a manager or any other employee considered refusing to keep accepting payments from Salter that night , Beal said Salter appeared to know what he was doing .
“ This fellow was lucid , ” Beal said .
“ He was actually dancing with the manager , Chris , right before he left .
“ He was in the best mood . ”
Beal said there are “ many occasions ” when employees would cut off customers from buying more alcohol , but this was n’t one of those cases .
It ’s unclear if security camera footage captured any or all of the transactions .
Still , Beal said he was willing to listen to the Salters ’ case in a private meeting .
He estimated he might reconsider about $ 15,000 of the total bill , although Salter said meetings scheduled with the club ’s owners had repeatedly been postponed or ultimately canceled .
The case is still under investigation as deputies await Tommy Salter ’s statement , Joe Salter said .

Is the Key to Democracy When senior Democrats , such as House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , explain why impeachment of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is off the table , they cite their fears of hostility from the American news media .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly On Amy Goodman ’s “ Democracy Now ” on Dec. 20 , Conyers said the U.S. news media has become such a problem that any Democratic attempt to hold the President and Vice President accountable might end up achieving the opposite result .
“ There is a very stark reality that with the corporatization of the media , we could end up with turning people , who should be documented in history as making many profound errors and violating the Constitution , from villains into victims , ” the Michigan Democrat said .
In Conyers ’s view , it ’s kind of Watergate in reverse .
Instead of the old Washington press corps holding President Richard Nixon ’s feet to the fire for his Watergate abuses , today ’s careerist news media would treat the idea of accountability for Bush and Cheney like some kooky conspiracy theory .
While one can dismiss Conyers ’s explanation as just another lame excuse from the timid Democratic leadership , there is an underlying reality here .
He ’s probably right that the Washington press corps would hoot any serious impeachment drive against Bush and Cheney off the political stage .
The current right - tilted asymmetry of the American news media has made it difficult if not impossible to achieve any sustained accountability for any of the Bush - Cheney offenses .
For instance , the Washington Post , which led the charge on Watergate , now leads the defense of Bush / Cheney for their role in exposing CIA officer Valerie Plame .
Getting Worse Another hard truth is that this U.S. media imbalance continues to worsen .
Day in / day out , year in / year out , the American Right pours billions and billions of dollars into its media apparatus , with Fox News starting a second network and Rupert Murdoch adding the Wall Street Journal to his empire , not to mention an endless array of well - financed outlets in radio , magazines , newspapers and the Internet .
Meanwhile , many American progressives and liberal foundations remain locked in a dogmatic resistance to investing seriously in media .
When I talk with wealthy progressives , they act as if building honest media is someone else ’s responsibility .
They tell me that they want to put their money into either direct - action projects ( like feeding the poor or buying up endangered wetlands ) or into supporting regulatory efforts ( like restricting money in politics or trying to reestablish government rules about media size and content ) .
While those endeavors might have some merit , the tragedy is that the progressives are passing up a great opportunity to use new openings created by the Internet to build powerful media institutions that can generate truthful information and establish some balance in the information reaching the public .
What We ’ve Done At Consortiumnews.com , we have been at this work for more than a dozen years .
But we have been perpetually hindered by the refusal of large donors to offer any consistent support .
That has undermined our ability to expand and to plan ahead .
We have relied on the generosity of our readers ( who have been great ) , but the sums we have raised simply have been insufficient .
That forced us to suspend regular publication in early 2000 , just as that pivotal election year was beginning .
Though we managed to keep Consortiumnews.com going on a part - time basis over the next four years , we did n’t have the impact that we should have as George W. Bush took power and veered the nation off in a very dangerous direction .
In 2004 , we resumed regular publication amid assurances from some well - to - do progressives that the need for strong media outlets was finally sinking in .
But again , the support was spotty at best – and now has dried up completely .
So , that has left us relying again on our readers to achieve a bare - bones goal of $ 50,000 by the end of the year .
More than halfway through December , we have raised $ 14,000 , with $ 36,000 to go .

There are fears the plan could lead to a brain drain from poorer nations
The plan would allow suitably qualified people and their families to live and work within the European Union .
The EU says it needs 20 m skilled workers over the next two decades , and is very short of expertise in engineering and computer technology .
The scheme , which is more restrictive than the US Green Card , would need the approval of all 27 EU member states .
Correspondents say another aim of the plan is to reverse a current trend under which skilled migrants , mostly from Asia and Africa , emigrate to the US to find work .
' Centralisation too far '
The BBC's Mark Mardell in Brussels says the proposal is controversial and some countries are sure to oppose it .
Critics also fear that Europe 's attempt to take the best and leave the rest will only encourage a brain - drain from poorer nations .
The UK , Ireland and Denmark could opt out , but the other EU members will have to take part .
UK ministers say they are studying it , but our correspondent says they are not keen on the card , preferring to develop an Australian - style points system .
Unveiled at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday afternoon , the Blue Card would enable holders and their families to live , work and travel within the EU .
To be eligible , new immigrants would need to show a recognised diploma and have at least three years professional experience .
They would also need the offer of a job , for a minimum one - year contract , which could not be filled by an EU citizen .
European Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said : " This is not an ' open doors ' policy . "
" If a given member - state needs engineers or doctors , it has to decide how many , and then I will provide a state with a common procedure , " he added .
But some politicians in the Netherlands and Germany are hostile and the Austrian government has condemned the plan as " a centralisation too far " .
Across Europe there is a real tension between politicians , who know voters are worried about immigration , and businesses demanding graduates from India and China , our correspondent says .
NOT surprisingly , Darfur has grabbed the world 's attention where Sudan is concerned .
The horrors of the past three years , with at least 200,000 Darfuris dead , are unspeakable .
But in the longer run another part of Africa 's largest country has suffered even more death and misery : Sudan 's southern region .
Unless strong diplomacy is fast brought to bear there , an even bloodier cycle of despair and destruction could start all over again — and make it much harder to make a lasting peace everywhere in the country , including in Darfur .
Mercifully , an edgy peace has prevailed in the south since 2005 , when a “ comprehensive peace agreement ” , known as the CPA , ended a war between Sudan 's Muslim and mainly Arab north and its black Christian and animist south that had stretched back , with the occasional truce , to independence from Britain half a century ago — at a cost of some 2 m lives .
But that agreement is now hanging by a thread .
A complete breakdown could make the debacle in Darfur , in Sudan 's west , look modest by comparison .
Saving the southern peace accord must be the priority , even while the UN and the African Union prepare for a Darfur peace conference in Libya this month .
A week ago the southern peace arrangement ceased to function when the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement ( SPLM ) , which led the southerners in their long war against the northern - dominated Sudanese army , walked out of Sudan 's government of national unity in Khartoum , the capital ( see article ) .
The peace agreement stipulates that the SPLM and the ruling Islamist National Congress Party , led by the country 's president , Omar al - Bashir , must implement the terms of the accord together .
It provides for the revenue from south Sudan 's abundant oil to be shared equally between north and south , and for a referendum to be held in 2011 whereby the south , if its people so wish , can secede and become a fully independent country .
Under the deal , the north promised to remove its troops from the south and to accept independent arbitration to mark the boundary between north and south .
Bashir unabashed
The southerners say , with justice , that Mr Bashir has been trying to wriggle out of the obligations laid down in the accord , just as he has spent years breaking promises to end the conflict in Darfur .
In particular , he has refused to abide by a “ final and binding ” ruling of an independent commission on a new boundary for Abyei state , which straddles the north - south division and holds a vast dollop of Sudan 's oil .
The only way to save the north - south agreement is to apply the same relentless pressure on the government in Khartoum that obliged it to sign the deal in the first place and which has now forced Mr Bashir to accept a UN force that is expected to arrive soon in Darfur .
The Americans have pushed hardest but , preoccupied by Darfur and crises farther afield , they have relaxed their guard in Sudan 's south .
They must urgently rally the many governments , Western and African , that have wet - nursed Sudan 's north - south agreement and persuade Mr Bashir to meet his obligations over the boundary and the troop withdrawals .
They should threaten to apply the same sanctions against Sudan over the south as over Darfur .
Nobody matters more than China .
The biggest consumer of Sudan 's oil has belatedly started to play its part over Darfur .
It is in China 's interest to have a stable Sudan .
In the short run , some in Beijing may gamble it would be best for their friend Mr Bashir to keep as much of Abyei and its oil as he can .
That would be a huge mistake : it would risk a return to a much bigger war than the one in Darfur — and would shut down much of Sudan 's oil production , not just in Abyei .
If China wants to guarantee its long - term investment , it needs to put pressure on Mr Bashir to do the right thing in all parts of his country .
There ’s a Mosque in the works for Harkness Road in Pelham and the neighborhood is n’t happy .
Personally , I feel very sad that the folks I live near are so narrow minded that they use the excuse of a narrow street as an attempt to prevent the Mosque from opening .
I think that if a good “ christian ” organization was proposing this same plan , the opposition would melt away .
I hope that that this opposition fails and that the Mosque opens and I ’m heartened that I ’m not alone ( and here ) in this opinion .

There are many ways you can reach the milestone of becoming a millionaire , and one of the simplest way is to start investing early .
Statistically , a 20 years old person could accumulate $ 1 million by the time they turn 65 simply by investing $ 100 a month .
If you do n’t have the money right now , here are some ideas to help you save $ 100 a month .
Now …let ’s get started … here is how you can become a millionaire .
“ It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results . ” — Warren Buffett
3 Steps to Investing $ 100 a Month
1. Find a Suitable Investment
First we have to look for an investment that can return about 10 % a year .
Our own analysis of the S&P 500 Index indicates that 9 % annualized return is reasonable , and probably leaning on the conservative side .
is reasonable , and probably leaning on the conservative side .
According to Investopedia , the average annual return for the S&P 500 since its inception in 1926 through 2018 is about 10 % .
. According to MoneyChimp.com , the average return for the past 30 years was about 11.66 % and for the past 45 years was about 11.62 % .
Based on these historical data , the 10 % annual return should be achievable over the course of 30 - 45 years .
To invest in the S&P 500 Index , you can invest in the Fidelity 500 Index Fund ( FXAIX ) which has a super cheap Expense Ratio of 0.015 % .
Lower investment expenses means that it is easier to achieve the full 10 % annual return target .
Also , you ’ll see why this fund is used as an example instead of an ETF or other S&P 500 Index Funds .
2. Automatic Investment
Secondly , we have to make sure that this can be done as cheaply as possible and we want to set it up once and forget about it — make your investment works on its own !
One way to do this is by utilizing Automatic Investment .
For example , Fidelity ’s Automatic Investments program will take money out of your bank on a regular basis ( e.g. , monthly , quarterly , etc. ) and purchase additional shares of mutual funds you already own .
In our example , you will set it up to invest in the FXAIX fund .
Alternatively , you can also use M1 Finance and set up an automatic investment in SPDR S&P 500 ( SPY ) which has an Expense Ratio of 0.09 % .
See how we use M1 Finance for our Dividend Income Investing here .
You will also direct the broker to reinvest any dividend payments back into the fund .
This way , you do n’t have money sitting around in the cash account doing nothing and let the power of compound interest do its thing .
3. Sit Back and Relax
The key to success for this strategy is :
Time in the Market – You ’re going to be investing consistently over the course of 46 years ( from 20 to 65 ) .
No Selling – You are not going to touch investment .
Come hell or high water , you are putting in $ 100 a month …every month !
That ’s it !
You ’re all done .
Now just sit back and watch your investment grow .
Yes , there might be some bad years but the key is to wait it out and keep investing .
Mathematically and statistically , you can achieve this .
Here ’s the calculation from Calculator.net .
Turbo Charge Your Investment
1. Tax Advantage
You can make this even sweeter by using a tax advantaged account instead of a regular account .
There are two options .
Traditional IRA –
You get tax deduction on the amount of money you put into the account , and you get taxed when you ’re ready to withdraw money from you account once you reach eligible age .
Roth IRA – You put in after - tax money , but your investment grow tax free — TAX - FREE MILLION !
2. Double Down
Invest $ 200 a month and become a millionaire by 58 and have $ 2 millions by 65 — SWEET !
What If You ’re Older ?
If you ’re older than 20 , do n’t sweat it .
You can also become a millionaire by the time you turn 65 … you just have to put in more money each month to catch up .
But I have to warn you that it is not easy to catch up , because when it comes to investing TIME IS MONEY has never been so true .
Here ’s the summary of how it plays out .
If you start at 25 , you ’ll need to invest about $ 160 a month .
This goes up to $ 260 a month for 30 years old , $ 425 for 35 years old , etc .
Basically , each decade you wait , you have to invest almost 3 times as much to catch up .
Bottom Line
If you start early enough , you can invest $ 100 a month and be on track to become a millionaire by the age of 65 simply by investing in an S&P 500 Index Fund .
It is vital to start as early as possible because time in the market makes a huge difference in how much your investment grows .
However , everyone can be a millionaire even if you start later — you just have to invest more to catch up .

The Taj Mahal is visited by millions of tourists every year
The ruling is aimed at safeguarding tourism revenues following the recent falls in the dollar .
Until now , foreign tourists to sites such at the Taj Mahal have had the option of paying in dollars or rupees .
The ruling will affect nearly 120 sites of interest run by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) .
Of these , at least 27 are World Heritage sites , including the Taj Mahal .
' International practices '
The ruling is due to be implemented next week .
Entrance fees to the sites in question will be either 250 rupees ( $ 6.35 ) or 100 rupees ( $ 2.54 ) .
" These rates have been fixed in line with international practices , and in order to take care of the fluctuation in the dollar rates , " a spokesman for the Ministry of Tourism told the BBC .
Officials say the ministry wanted to act fast so that the revenues are not hit .
Indians only pay 20 or 10 rupees to enter ASI sites , a difference often questioned by foreign tourists .
But officials say there is nothing wrong with this because most Indians earn far less than the foreign visitors .
" The uniform rate applied by most foreign countries are often too high for most Indians anyway , " the tourism ministry official told the BBC .
However , the Indian government has also decided that nationals from the regional South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation will not have to pay the higher rate .
Nor will people holding a government - issued People of Indian Origin ( PIO ) card .
India earned more than $ 6.5 bn in foreign exchange from more than four million foreign tourists to the country last year .
FARMINGTON , Mo. -
It ’s a hefty price for a pastry : A man accused of stealing a 52 - cent doughnut could face time in jail .
Authorities said Scott A. Masters , 41 , slipped the doughnut into his sweat shirt without paying , then pushed away a clerk who tried to stop him as he fled the store .
The push is being treated as minor assault , which transforms a misdemeanor shoplifting charge to a strong - armed robbery with a potential prison term of five to 15 years .
Because he has a criminal history , prosecutors say they could seek 30 years .
“ Strong - arm robbery ?
Over a doughnut ?
That ’s impossible , ” Masters told the St. Louis Post - Dispatch from jail .
He admitted that he took the pastry but denied touching the employee .
“ There ’s no way I would ’ve pushed a woman over a doughnut . ”
Farmington Police Chief Rick Baker said state law treats the shoplifting and assault as forcibly stealing property .
The amount of force and value of the property does n’t matter .
“ It ’s not the doughnut , ” Baker said .
“ It ’s the assault . ”
Masters said he did n’t even get to enjoy his ill - gotten gains :
He threw the doughnut away as he fled .

A Major Victory for Texas
I am pleased to report that last week we received notice that the Texas Department of Transportation will recommend the I - 69 Project be developed using existing highway facilities instead of the proposed massive new Trans Texas Corridor / NAFTA Superhighway .
According to the Texas Transportation Commissioner , consideration is no longer being given to new corridors and other proposals for a new highway footprint for this project .
A major looming threat to property rights and national sovereignty is removed with this encouraging announcement .
Public outcry was cited as the main reason for this decision .
I was very impressed to learn that the TxDOT received nearly 28,000 public comments on this matter , and that some 12,000 Texans attended the 47 public hearings held earlier this year .
They could not ignore this tsunami of strong public opinion against the proposed plans .
I was especially proud of how informed my constituents became on the subject , and how eloquently and respectfully they spoke and conducted themselves , considering how upsetting the plans were for our communities in Texas .
This is a major victory for the people of Texas , and a reminder of what we can accomplish with civic involvement .
The informed and active citizen truly is a force to be reckoned with , as we have seen with the defeat of this proposal .
We must keep fighting the good fight , and remain ever diligent against the encroachments of big government .
We must do this if we wish to maintain our traditional standard of living in this country .
As tempting as it may be to simply live our lives with no regard to government , apathy will inevitably be punished by ever more government intrusion .
That is what this fight was all about .
We can win if we stick together .
However , now is not the time to rest on our laurels .
The bittersweet aspect of this victory is that we had to fight at all .
We took time away from family and friends , doing other things , to attend these meetings , inform others , write letters , post signs and submit our complaints , and we should not have had to .
Government should let us be , if we are peaceful citizens , harming no one .
In a perfect world , government could be trusted to act in the best interests of the people without overwhelming pressure of this kind .
This is not a perfect world .
Constant pressure is needed to keep government in check , and we succeeded this time .
But this will not be the last time citizen efforts and involvement will be required .
We still face many unreasonable encroachments of big government today , from confiscatory , economy - strangling taxation to creeping disregard of the right of habeas corpus and other Constitutional rights , to thousands of nuisance bureaucratic regulations interfering with our every day lives .
We have drifted far from what the founding fathers envisioned for this nation .
Last week was just one victory towards getting back on the right path .
We must continue to hold politicians ' feet to the Constitutional fire .
If I had to guess , they will probably try to implement the NAFTA Superhighway again sometime in the future .

Apart from the obvious 32 - 64 bit distinction between 386 and AMD64 there are two other interesting comparisons ; parameter passing conventions and position independent code conventions .
Parameter Passing : on x86 parameters are passed via the stack .
On AMD64 the first six " integer " arguments ( anything that fits in a 64 bit register , basically ) are passed via registers , similarly some floats can be passed via SSE registers .
Only after this is data passed on the stack .
On IA64 , the first 8 arguments are passed in registers , whilst the rest are put on the stack .
On both AMD64 and IA64 , there is a extra 16 byte " scratch area " ( IA64 ) / 128 byte " red zone " ( AMD64 ) that is below at the bottom of current stack frame .
I would suggest that the smaller IA64 scratch area size is because of register windowing , which AMD64 does not support .
On both architectures this is reserved and not modified by signal or interrupt handlers .
" Leaf functions " ( functions that do not call other functions ) can use this area as their entire stack frame ; saving some considerable overhead .
For varargs functions causes some confusion for AMD64 / IA64 , since arguments might be floats or might be integers , meaning they should be passed in either general or float / SSE registers respectively .
On AMD64 , functions known to be varargs functions should have a prologue that saves all arguments to a " register save area " that has a known layout ( you pass the maximum number of possible floating point args as well to avoid saving unnecessary registers ) .
Then , as you use the va_arg macro to go through the arguments you grab them from the register save area .
On IA64 , you assume that the first 8 arguments are passed in via the stack , and save these registers to your scratch area ( 2 registers ) and 48 bytes of your stack ( remaining 6 registers ) .
This means all your arguments are stacked together ( the incoming parameter list sits up against the scratch area ) and va_arg can simply " walk " upwards .
Undefined functions are a bit more tricky ; IA64 suggests that if a float is passed into a function with an undefined parameter , it should be copied to both the first general purpose register and the first floating point register , just to be safe .
AMD64 does n't seem to make such assumptions for you , for example , on IA64
ianw@lime :/ tmp$ cat function .c void function ( float f ) { printf ( " %f
" , f ) ; } ianw@lime : / tmp$ cat test.c extern function ( ) ; int main ( void ) { float f = 10000.01 ; function ( f ) ; } ianw@lime : / tmp$ gcc -o test test .c function .c ianw@lime :/tmp$ ./test 10000.009766
That same code on AMD64 returns 0 .
IP relative addressing : Position Independent Code ( PIC ) is code that can be loaded anywhere into memory and work .
This is important because shared libraries may not always be at the same address , since other shared libraries might be loaded before or after them , etc .
To maintain position independence , you can't rely on the base address of any code ( because it might change ) so you add a layer of indirection between your calls .
In Linux / ELF land this is done with a Global Offset Table ( GOT ) .
You can think of the GOT as a big list two columned list that has a symbol and it's " real address " .
Thus , instead of loading the symbol directly , you load the value from the GOT , and then load that value to find the real thing .
Note , you always know the relative address of the GOT , because although the base address might change , the difference between your code and where the GOT is will not .
This means that if you need to load an address from the GOT , the easiest way is to load via an offset from the current instruction from the GOT entry .
The compiler knows the current instruction offset ( note it can't know the current instruction address , because the binary might be anywhere in memory ) , so it wants to say load the address at ( CURRENT_INSTRUCTION - OFFSET_TO_GOT_ENTRY ) .
386 just can't do this -- there is no way to load an offset from the current instruction pointer .
The only way you can do it is to keep a pointer to the GOT in a register ( %ebp ) , and then offset from that .
This wastes a whole register , and when you only have a few like the 386 this is a big killer .
AMD64 fixes this and allows you to offset from the current instruction pointer .
This frees up a register , and changes the ABI by removing the distinction between the Absolute PLT and PIC PLT .
The PLT is a further enhancement that facilitates lazy binding .
The PLT is " stubs " that point to a fix up function in the dynamic loader .
At first , the GOT entries for functions point to the PLT entry for that function .
When you call the function , you do n't go directly to it , you load it 's value via the GOT and then jump to that value .
As mentioned , at first this points to the PLT stub .
This calls the lookup function in the dynamic loader which goes off and finds the real function ( this might actually be in another shared library that needs to be loaded , for example ) .
As arguments to this lookup function you pass the function name you 're looking for ( obviously ) and the GOT entry of the original call .
The dynamic loader finds the function , but then additionally fixes up the GOT entry to no longer point to the PLT stub , but to point directly to the required function .
This means the next time you load from the GOT , you get the direct address of the function without the overhead of the PLT stub again .
IA64 , allowing IP relative addressing , similarly does n't have a distinction between absolute and PIC PLT's .

The official messaging from the White House has been clear .
The president ’s statements have been anything but .
KHARTOUM , Sudan ( CNN ) --
Hundreds of angry protesters , some waving ceremonial swords from trucks equipped with loud speakers , gathered Friday outside the presidential palace to denounce a teacher whose class named a teddy bear " Mohammed " -- some calling for her execution .
An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons , who has been found guilty of insulting religion .
The protesters , which witnesses said numbered close to 1,000 , swore to fight in the name of their prophet .
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , was given 15 days in jail late Thursday after she was convicted of insulting religion .
She was cleared of charges of inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs , her lawyer , Ali Ajeb , said .
Ajeb said they planned to appeal the sentence , which begins from the date she was detained , Nov. 25 .
Including Friday , she has 10 more days in jail .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was " extremely disappointed " that the charges were not dismissed .
Meanwhile senior British lawmakers were en route to Khartoum to try to secure Gibbons ' early release .
The two members of the House of Lords were set to arrive in Khartoum about 5 a.m. Saturday ( 9 p.m. Friday ET ) , Time magazine reporter Sam Dealey told CNN , citing British and Sudanese sources .
They will meet with government ministers and Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir , he said .
Sources close to the British government and the Republican Palace in Sudan say it is expected that a deal will be reached , and Gibbons will be released , Dealey said .
Visas for the two , he said , were granted " in record time ... by Sudanese standards . "
Friday 's demonstrations began as worshippers spilled out of mosques in the capital after Friday prayers .
They marched to the palace , which is on the same street as Unity High School , where Gibbons taught grade school students .
Those who named the bear were 7 years old .
A heavy police presence was maintained outside the school , but no demonstrators were there .
Watch men brandish knives , shout »
Armed with swords and sticks , the protesters shouted : " By soul , by blood , I will fight for the Prophet Mohammad . "
Western journalists who attempted to talk to the protesters were ushered away by men in plain clothes .
Gibbons is being held in a women 's prison in the Omdurman district of Khartoum , and she will be deported at the end of her prison term , British consular officials told CNN .
British Embassy staff said they were giving the teacher -- from the northern British city of Liverpool -- full consular assistance .
In leaflets distributed earlier this week by Muslim groups , the protesters promised a " popular release of anger " at Friday 's protests .
The leaflets condemned Gibbons as an " infidel " and accused her of " the pollution of children 's mentality " by her actions .
Omer Mohammed Ahmed Siddig , the Sudanese ambassador to Britain , was summoned for a second time to meet with the British foreign secretary late Thursday after the court 's ruling .
Miliband also spoke to the Sudanese acting foreign minister for 15 minutes on the telephone during the meeting , the British Foreign Office said .
" Our priority now is to ensure Ms. Gibbons ' welfare and we will continue to provide consular assistance to her , " Miliband said in a statement .
The Foreign Office said there would be further talks with the Sudanese government Friday .
Gibbons was arrested Sunday after she asked her class to name the stuffed animal as part of a school project , the Foreign Office said .
She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudan 's constitution , the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred .
She could have received a sentence of 40 lashes , a fine or jail term of up to a year , according to the Foreign Office .
British newspapers condemned Gibbons ' conviction , with the Daily Telegraph calling for the recall of the British ambassador from Khartoum and sanctions against the heads of the Sudanese government .
Watch a report on reactions to the verdict »
In an editorial , the tabloid newspaper , The Sun , said Gibbons ' jailing was a " grotesque insult to Islam " and called Gibbons " an innocent abroad . "

Four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse at Thursday 's hearing , but there were no disturbances .
Staff from Gibbons ' school , including director Robert Boulos , were present .
Defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint against Gibbons came from Sarah Khawad , a secretary at the school .
Gibbons has been working at the school , popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates , since August , after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool this summer , Boulos said .
He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot , which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats .

All About Sudan
At least two church members say they think that Mrs. Hawke - Petit endorsed an anti-death - penalty document known as a Declaration of Life .
The declaration states a person ’s opposition to capital punishment and asks that prosecutors , in the event of the person ’s own death in a capital crime , do not seek the death penalty .
The documents have been signed by thousands of people , including Mario M. Cuomo , the former governor of New York , and Martin Sheen , the actor .
“ She was a nurse and she would not cause harm to anyone , ” said Lucy Earley , a congregant who notarized at least a dozen declarations during an appeal at the church and said she thought Mrs. Hawke - Petit ’s was among them .
Declarations of Life are often kept with a person ’s will or other important papers ; sometimes they are filed with registries .
But it could not be independently determined whether Mrs. Hawke - Petit had signed one .
Although the family ’s home was heavily damaged in the fire and no independent copies have surfaced , death penalty opponents both inside and outside the church have kept trying to find one .
A clear indication that Mrs. Hawke - Petit rejected capital punishment could help them mobilize , they say , not only in the Cheshire case but also on behalf of the nine people on Connecticut ’s death row in Somers .
The opponents also say that a signed declaration by Mrs. Hawke - Petit opposing capital punishment could help counter the public outrage to the killings  outrage that has pressured state officials to suspend parole for violent criminals .
Still , if proof of Mrs. Hawke - Petit ’s sentiments did surface , it would have little standing in court , lawyers and prosecutors say .
“ Our job is to enforce the law no matter who the victim is or what the victim ’s religious beliefs are , ” said John A. Connelly , a veteran prosecutor in Waterbury who is not involved in the Cheshire case .
“ If you started imposing the death penalty based on what the victim ’s family felt , it would truly become arbitrary and capricious . ”
Michael Dearington , the state ’s attorney who is prosecuting the suspects in the Petit killings , said he did not know whether Mrs. Hawke - Petit had signed a Declaration of Life .
Asked if he knew Dr. Petit ’s views on the death penalty , he replied , “ I have a no comment on that . ”
A simple herb used in traditional Chinese medicine may be able to help crackheads kick their habits .
Tetrahydropalmatine , a chemical from the plant , blocks the euphoria that would be caused by a dose of cocaine .
Knowing that even the best blow would be wasted on them , addicts may find it easier to quit .
Researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Maryland trained rats to enjoy the effects of cocaine .
When the rodents were given the ability to get themselves high by pressing a lever , low doses of the herbal chemical made them use even more of the illicit drug .
However , high doses of the drug made them give up their hedonistic ways .
The results made perfect sense : Small amounts of the herbal medicine would not completely take the fun out of using the drug , but it would make it harder to get high .
Thus , the rats would need to indulge in larger amounts of coke to feel any satisfaction .
A full dose of the plant - derived compound must have completely prevented any pleasure – sapping the animals of their motivation to get high .
The herb , Stephanie , is not without drawbacks .
It made the rats lazy .
This is no big surprise because the active chemical is a sedative that has been used for decades to treat insomnia and chronic pain .
Zheng - Xiong Xi , along with collaborators at the Beijing Institute of
Basic Medical Sciences and University of Wisconsin , reported their findings in the November issue of Neuropharmacology .
They acknowledged that the soporific side - effects raise an important question :
Does the herbal molecule work by making cocaine unenjoyable or by making the rats too sedentary to get high ?
Since medium doses of tetrahydropalmatine actually increased the drug - seeking activity of their fuzzy friends , Xi was able to reason that sluggishness was not what kept the animals from pressing the lever that dispensed the drug .
Furthermore , researchers are quite convinced that the natural buzzkill blocks at least two types of dopamine receptors , proteins in the brain that are responsible for receiving pleasure signals .
Scientists do not know exactly how the chemical works , or why it acts as a sedative , but it is safe to say that feeling drowsy is a small price to pay in order to beat a serious addiction .
The Canadian Recording Industry Association this week quietly filed documents in the Federal Court of Appeal that will likely shock many in the industry .
CRIA , which spent more than 15 years lobbying for the creation of the private copying levy , is now fighting to eliminate the application of the levy on the Apple iPod since it believes that the Copyright Board of Canada 's recent decision to allow a proposed tariff on iPods to proceed " broadens the scope of the private copying exception to avoid making illegal file sharers liable for infringement . "
Given that CRIA 's members collect millions from the private copying levy , the decision to oppose its expansion may come as a surprise .
Yet the move reflects a reality that CRIA has previously been loath to acknowledge – the Copyright Board has developed jurisprudence that provides a strong argument that downloading music on peer - to - peer networks is lawful in Canada .
Indeed , CRIA President Graham Henderson provides a roadmap for the argument in his affidavit :
" First , the Board has stated , in obiter dicta , on several occasions that the Private Copying regime legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy , regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not .
Therefore , according to the Board , downloading an infringing track from the Internet is not infringing , as long as the downloaded copy is made onto an ' audio recording medium ' …
Second , also in obiter dicta , the Board stated that the private copying exception in Section 80 is not conditioned on the existence of a tariff to collect royalties covering the medium onto which copies are made .
Third , in combination with the aforementioned obiter dicta in the Board 's other decisions , the Decision [ the iPod decision ] could potentially be interpreted to allow the copying of music files from any source – whether legitimate or illegitimate – onto any type of device ordinarily used by individuals to copy music , such as personal computers … "
While Henderson and CRIA make it clear that they disagree with this interpretation , they are obviously sufficiently concerned that it reflects Canadian law that they have burned their remaining bridges with Canadian music in order to try to persuade the Federal Court of Appeal to allow them to intervene in iPod hearings .
In fact , with the Canadian labels having left the organization , CRIA has now :
irrevocably split with the Canadian Private Copying Collective ( on which CRIA General Counsel Richard Pfohl serves as a member of the board of directors ) , telling the court that " CRIA Members do not control the CPCC with respect to decisions to file particular tariffs .
And in the case at hand , CRIA did not have the authority or means to prevent the CPCC from filing the [ iPod levy tariff ] . "
openly acknowledged that its concerns rest with foreign artists , as it complains about the preferential treatment for Canadian artists under the private copying system and argues that " this has meant that under the Private Copying regime , CRIA Members receive compensation for only a small fraction of their recordings that are copied . "
CRIA 's attempt to intervene is somewhat odd , not only because it represents a public acknowledgement of the argument for legalized P2P in Canada , but also because CRIA 's intended arguments if granted leave to intervene are easily rebutted .
The Henderson affidavit outlines the organization 's seven arguments :
the Decision failed to consider the fundamental importance of exclusive rights in Canadian copyright law [ not true – CRIA itself sought the creation of the levy to grant consumers a license to make personal copies ] .
the Board failed to consider the implications of the combination of the Decision with statements in its prior decisions to the effect that the Private Copying regime legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy , regardless of whether the source is a non-infringing copy or subject to a levy .
[ in other words , the Board 's decision makes it clear that P2P downloading is legal ] by broadening the scope of the exception to devices never intended by Parliament to be covered , the Board has potentially and inappropriately transformed the ' private copying ' exception into a public license [ yet in 1996 CRIA told a House of Commons committee that " the proposed private copying regimes should not create yet another exemption , but should be structured as a statutory license . " ] the Decision failed to adequately consider and apply policy principles related to copyright .
Any decision or combination of decisions that exempts unauthorized P2P downloading from infringement would be contrary to the public interest because it serves as a disincentive to investment in the production of music and the dissemination of legitimate copies of music [ not true – a compensation system for P2P is arguably in the public interest as it ensures that artists get paid , a position supported by Canadian musicians ] .
the Decision failed to adequately consider and apply the specific policy principles behind the private copying exception [ not true – the Decision is nothing but the application of the policy principle that the levy is technology neutral ] .
the Board was wrong to broaden the scope of the private copying exception to avoid making illegal file sharers liable for infringement [ the clearest statement from CRIA that private copying as construed by the Copyright Board legalizes P2P ] .
the Decision failed to consider Canada 's international and bilateral treaty obligations related to copyright and related rights [ an issue for Parliament , not the Copyright Board or the Federal Court ] .
Hearings in the iPod case are not likely to occur until 2008 , yet these filings from CRIA will reverberate long after that hearing concludes .
It is not every day that the recording industry acknowledges an argument widely known within legal circles – downloading music in Canada for personal purposes is arguably legal as it is compensated activity covered by the private copying levy .

Unbelievable .
Korean
War veteran Nyles Reed , 75 , opened an envelope last week to learn a Purple Heart had been approved for injuries he sustained as a Marine on June 22 , 1952 .
But there was no medal .
Just a certificate and a form stating that the medal was " out of stock . "
" I can imagine , of course , with what 's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan , there 's a big shortage , " Reed said .
" At least , I would imagine so . "
The form letter from the Navy Personnel Command told Reed he could wait 90 days and resubmit an application , or buy his own medal .
After waiting 55 years , however , Reed decided to pay $ 42 for his own Purple Heart and accompanying ribbon — plus state sales taxes — at a military surplus store .
For a talk I was meant to give , I updated my graphs of Saudi oil production , which I had n't done in a few months .
What I found was pretty interesting , and I 'm starting to draw stronger conclusions .
Last time I looked at this , I made an earlier version of this graph :
At that time , while the conjunction of declining production and rising rig counts was striking , I was n't ready to draw firm conclusions on the data through August - October ( depending on agency ) .
Recently , Jim Hamilton raised the same questions :
The first possibility is that the Saudis could still pump 10 mbd or more today if they wanted to , but they are cutting back production and exploring like mad because they put an extremely high value on having 2 - 3 mbd of excess capacity .
If so , the recent price behavior suggests that the reason they would seek such capacity is not because they want to stabilize the price , but because it puts them in an incredibly powerful negotiating position .
For example , the ability at any time to flood the market could be used at an opportune moment to undercut expensive alternatives such as oil sands that require an oil price over $ 50 .
The second and more natural interpretation is even more disturbing : the mighty Ghawar oil field is already in decline , and the Saudis do n't want anyone to know .
What I did in this post was to look in more detail at what happened from the beginning of 2006 on , which is when the apparent decline begins .
I added data from a fourth source ( the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Review ) , and for each of the four sources of data , I fit a linear trend :
The resulting graph is extremely striking , I think .
The four different sources all estimate Saudi production slightly differently - they fluctuate in different ways month to month , and disagree over the absolute level ( that last may be differences in exactly what is defined as oil ) .
However , the regressions make clear that all four sources are in strong agreement about the nature of the decline .
The slopes of the lines are very similar .
The implied decline rate through the year is 8 % ± 0.1 % .
( Note that the year on year decline from 2005 to 2006 will only be about half that , as the decline only began at the beginning of 2006 ) .
As far as I know , there are no known accidents or problems that would explain any restrictions on oil supply , and the Saudis themselves have maintained publicly that their production is unproblematic and they intend to increase it .
It 's interesting to note the pattern in the underlying data where declines start , are interrupted in the middle of the year , and then resume .
I take this to be due to the coming onstream of the 300kbpd of liquids from the Haradh III megaproject :
HARADH , February 08 , 2006 --
In a record 21 months from approval of funding , oil started flowing through the new Haradh gas - oil separation plant ( GOSP ) from several of 32 new wells that will feed the facility .
...
Full production will be attained by the new plant within the second quarter of 2006 .
It seems this did not do more than briefly interrupt the declines .
We can get a clearer picture as follows .
What I did was average the EIA , IEA , and JODI series for 2005 and 2006 into a single estimate .
Onto that , I 've hand drawn a couple of guidelines that are 300 kbpd apart vertically :
Saudi Arabian oil production , Jan 2005 - Jan 2007 , from EIA , IEA , and JODI averaged together .
Black lines are handplaced guidelines that are 300 kbpd apart ( the advertised capacity of Haradh III ) .
Graph is not zero - scaled to better show changes .

Source : US EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1 , IEA Oil Market Report Table 3 , and Joint Oil Data Initiative .
My intepretation is that the bump in the middle of the year that separates the two lines is due to the impact of Haradh III coming on stream .
So that tells us that , given some extra production capacity , Saudi Aramco immediately threw it into the production mix .
And the effect of that ?
It lifted the plummeting production curve up by 300 kbpd , but did nothing to change the gradient of the plummet .
That suggests that the Saudis had nothing else to throw at the problem .
It also suggests that last year 's underlying Type II decline rate , before megaprojects like Haradh III , was 14 % .
Overall , I feel this data is clear enough that I 'm willing to go out on a limb and conclude the following :
Saudi Arabian oil production is now in decline .
The decline rate during the first year is very high ( 8 % ) , akin to decline rates in other places developed with modern horizontal drilling techniques such as the North Sea .
Declines are rather unlikely to be arrested , and may well accelerate .
Matt Simmons appears to be right in Twilight in the Desert , but the warning did not come until after declines had actually begun .
Steve Andrews of ASPO - USA correctly points out to me in email that Matt Simmons began warnings about Saudi Arabia as early as December 2003 , significantly before the publication of the hardback version of the book in mid 2005 .
I relied on an over - hasty check of Amazon which has the paperback publication date - mea culpa . ]
I suggest that this is likely to place severe political strains on Saudi Arabia within a year or two at most .
I also looked at the question of whether there is any evidence for the idea claimed by OPEC that the Saudi 's deliberately cut production starting in November .
Specifically , I constructed a series that represents the average decrease , month - over - month , in the four series .
That data looks like this ( the blue box is one sample deviation up or down from the mean - the heavy black line ) .
As you can see , November and December are statistically indistinguishable from the collection of other months .
There is no statistically significant evidence for the idea of any cut in those months other than whatever ongoing process controls the production declines .
The most notable feature of the graph , the large jag downwards in the middle of the year , again appears to be due to the impact of 300 kbpd of new production from Haradh III .
The production data simply do n't support the narrative that the Saudis were going along producing fine and then deliberately cut production in November to help support prices .
This raises the question of whether OPEC , taken as a whole , deliberately cut production in November / December .

There is some evidence of a very slight acceleration in November of a process of declining production that was ongoing throughout the second half of 2006 ( and in to January of this year ) .
This excess decline does not exceed 200 thousand barrels per day .
On the whole , media coverage of OPEC production cuts appears to be almost completely unmoored from the data the agencies are reporting .
The entire " production cut " may be a public relations exercise to disguise other processes .
Finally , it 's interesting to note this Saudi Aramco press release celebrating their achievements in 2006 :
2006 was a year of outstanding accomplishment .
That was the message coming from the Feb. 21 meeting of the Executive Committee ( Excom ) of the Board of Directors in Dhahran .
“ The company reacted rapidly to changes in global crude oil supply and demand during the year , ” said president and CEO Abdallah S. Jum‘ah , relaying the results of that meeting in a teleconference Feb. 25 .
“ Ambitious programs were proposed to expand future crude oil production and gas processing capabilities , and for increasing refining capacity both in the Kingdom and overseas . ”
Among 2006 accomplishments were the optimization of upstream operations , and development and depletion strategies to meet crude demand and increase maximum sustained capacity to 10.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) .
andI 'll bet $ 1000 with the first person who cares to take me up on it that the international oil agencies will never report sustained Saudi production of crude + condensate of 10.7 million barrels or more .
I wish people would stop breaking into tears when they talk to me these days .
I am traveling across the country at the moment -- Colorado to California -- speaking to groups of Americans from all walks of life about the assault on liberty and the 10 steps now underway in America to a violently closed society .
The good news is that Americans are already awake : I thought there would be resistance to or disbelief at this message of gathering darkness -- but I am finding crowds of people who do n't need me to tell them to worry ; they are already scared , already alert to the danger and entirely prepared to hear what the big picture might look like .
To my great relief , Americans are smart and brave and they are unflinching in their readiness to hear the worst and take action .
And they love their country .
But I can't stand the stories I am hearing .
I can't stand to open my email these days .
And wherever I go , it seems , at least once a day , someone very strong starts to cry while they are speaking .
In Boulder , two days ago , a rosy - cheeked thirtysomething mother of two small children , in soft yoga velours , started to tear up when she said to me : " I want to take action but I am so scared .
I look at my kids and I am scared .
How do you deal with fear ?
Is it safer for them if I act or stay quiet ?
I do n't want to get on a list . "
In D.C. , before that , a beefy , handsome civil servant , a government department head -- probably a Republican -- confides in a lowered voice that he is scared to sign the new ID requirement for all government employees , that exposes all his most personal information to the State -- but he is scared not to sign it : " If I do n't , I lose my job , my house .
It 's like the German National ID card , " he said quietly .
This morning in Denver I talked for almost an hour to a brave , much - decorated high - level military man who is not only on the watch list for his criticism of the administration -- his family is now on the list .
His elderly mother is on the list .
His teenage son is on the list .
He has flown many dangerous combat missions over the course of his military career , but his voice cracks when he talks about the possibility that he is exposing his children to harassment .
Jim Spencer , a former columnist for the Denver Post who has been critical of the Bush administration , told me today that I could use his name : he is on the watch list .
An attorney contacts me to say that she told her colleagues at the Justice Department not to torture a detainee ; she says she then faced a criminal investigation , a professional referral , saw her emails deleted -- and now she is on the watch list .
I was told last night that a leader of Code Pink , the anti-war women 's action group , was refused entry to Canada .
I hear from a tech guy who works for the airlines -- again , probably a Republican -- that once you are on the list you never get off .
Someone else says that his friend opened his luggage to find a letter from the TSA saying that they did not appreciate his reading material .
Before I go into the security lines , I find myself editing my possessions .
In New York 's LaGuardia , I reluctantly foudd myself putting a hardcover copy of Tara McKelvey 's excellent Monstering , an expose of CIA interrogation practices , in a garbage can before I get in the security line ; it is based on classified information .
This morning at my hotel , before going to the sirport , I threw away a very nice black T - shirt that said " We Will Not be Silenced " -- with an Arabic translation -- that someone had given me , along with a copy of poems written by detainees at Guantanamo .
In my America we are not scared to get in line at the airport .
In my America , we will not be silenced .
More times than I can count , courageous and confident men who are telling me about speaking up , but who are risking what they see as the possible loss of job , home or the ability to pay for grown kids ' schooling , start to choke up .
Yesterday a woman in one gathering started to cry simply while talking about the degradation of her beloved country .
And always the questions : what do we do ?
It is clear from this inundation of personal stories of abuse and retribution against ordinary Americans that a network of criminal behavior and intention is catching up more and more mainstream citizens in its grasp .
It is clear that this is not democracy as usual -- or even the corruption of democracy as usual .
It is clear that we will need more drastic action than emails to Congress .
The people I am hearing from are conservatives and independents as well as progressives .
The cardinal rule of a closing or closed society is that your alignment with the regime offers no protection ; in a true police state no one is safe .

I read the news in a state of something like walking shock : seven soldiers wrote op - eds critical of the war -- in The New York Times ; three are dead , one shot in the head .
A female soldier who was about to become a whistleblower , possibly about abuses involving taxpayers ' money : shot in the head .
Pat Tillman , who was contemplating coming forward in a critique of the war : shot in the head .
Donald Vance , a contractor himself , who blew the whistle on irregularities involving arms sales in Iraq -- taken hostage FROM the U.S. Embassy BY U.S. soldiers and kept without recourse to a lawyer in a U.S. held - prison , abused and terrified for weeks -- and scared to talk once he got home .
Another whistleblower in Iraq , as reported in Vanity Fair : held in a trailer all night by armed contractors before being ejected from the country .
Last week contractors , immune from the rule of law , butchered 17 Iraqi civilians in cold blood .
Congress mildly objected -- and contractors today butcher two more innocent civilian Iraqi ladies -- in cold blood .
It is clear yet that violent retribution , torture or maybe worse , seems to go right up this chain of command ?
Is it clear yet that these people are capable of anything ?
Is it obvious yet that criminals are at the helm of the nation and need to be not only ousted but held accountable for their crimes ?
Is it treason yet ?
This is an open invitation to honorable patriots on the Right and in the center to join this movement to restore the rule of law and confront this horror : this is not conservatism , it is a series of crimes against the nation and against the very essence of America .
Join us , we need you .
This movement must transcend partisan lines .
The power of individual conscience is profound when people start to wake up .
Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey said No : he told colleague that they would be ashamed when the world learned about the Administration 's warrantless wiretapping .
Comey said No : history will look at this torture and disgrace the torturers .
A judge today ruled that the U.S. can't just ship prisoners out of Guantanamo to be tortured at will -- she said No .
The Center for Constitutional Rights is about to file a civil lawsuit -- against Blackwater : they are saying No .
In Germany , according to historian Richard Evans , in 1931 - 1932 , if enough Germans of conscience had begun to say No -- history would have had an entirely diferent outcome .
If we go any further down this road the tears will be those of conservatives as well as progressives .
They will be American tears .
The time for weeping has to stop ; the time for confronting must begin .
Concurrency is always a source of problems in complex systems and one of the coolest patterns I 've seen for simplifying it is Futures .
I thought I 'd explore the idea today and hack up a quick and simple implementation of a dynamic Future proxy .
The basic idea is to take a block of code , schedule it on another thread and return a dynamic proxy that if accessed , blocks until the value returns .
This lets useful work continue on the main thread until you access the value .
A nice way to break up a big task concurrently might be to #collect : all the futures for a bunch of work processes you have , say fetching rates for a bunch of hotels that require calls to outside systems that may or may not return quickly , and then aggregate the results at the end .
Here 's the complete implementation , it 's quite simple but seems to work pretty well while playing around in a workspace and makes concurrency seem less of a beast .
First the class , a subclass of ProtoObject since we 're building a proxy ...
ProtoObject subclass : # SFuture instanceVariableNames : ' futureValue error lock ' classVariableNames : '' poolDictionaries : '' category : ' OnSmalltalk '
Then a #value : write accessor which eagerly kicks off the process , sets up , and clears the lock after fetching the future value .
value : aBlock lock := Semaphore new . [ [ futureValue := aBlock value ] on : Error do : [ : err | error := err ] ensure : [ lock signal ] ] forkBackground
Now a #value read accessor that blocks if the lock still exists , re-throws any error that may have happened on the worker thread in the context of the main thread , and finally returns the future value .
value lock isSignaled if False : [ lock wait ]. error ifNotNil : [ error privHandlerContext : thisContext ; signal ] . ^ futureValue
A quick testing method for checking if the future has finished executing ( useful for doing what work you can with the results that have returned ) .
hasValue ^ lock isSignaled
And the all important # doesNotUnderstand : override that intercepts any message sent to the proxy and sends it to the future value , causing the thread to block until the result is finished computing .
doesNotUnderstand : aMessage ^ self value perform : aMessage selector withArguments : aMessage arguments
Finally , a single extension method to BlockContext to make using the future more natural and ensuring to call fixTemps so I can collect future values in a loop with the assumption that the block will act like a proper closure .
For Squeak ( older ones without the new compiler ) ...
BlockContext >> future ^ SFuture new value : self fixTemps
And for Pharo ...
BlockClosure >> future ^ SFuture new value : self fixTemps
Now we can ask any block for its future value and just pretend we have it .
Executing some test code in a workspace ...
value1 := [ 200 timesRepeat : [ Transcript show : '.' ].
6 ] future .
value2 := [ 200 timesRepeat : [ Transcript show : '+ ' ].
6 ] future .
Transcript show : ' other work ' .
Transcript show : ( value1 + value2 ) .
Reveals the string ' other work ' , a long string of interspersed periods and pluses , and finally 12 , the result of adding the value returned by each future .
In all , a pretty nice way to handle concurrency , I 'll have to see where I can simplify some code with the use of Futures , I can already think of a few .
BAGHDAD , Sept. 1 — Newly released statistics for Iraqi civilian deaths in August reflect the strikingly mixed security picture that has emerged from a gradual six - month increase in American troop strength here : the number of deaths across the country rose by about 20 percent since July , but in the capital itself , the number dropped sharply .
The figures , provided by Iraqi Interior Ministry officials on Saturday , mirrored the geographic pattern of the troop increase , which is focused on Baghdad .
The national rise in mortality is partly a result of the enormous death toll , more than 500 , in a truck bomb attack that struck a Yazidi community in August north of the capital , outside the areas directly affected by the additional troops .
As Ryan C. Crocker , the American ambassador to Iraq , and Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top commander of military forces here , prepare to brief Congress on the progress of the troop increase , Iraqi politicians , clearly recognizing what is at stake , view the new figures through the lens of how their parties hope that Congress will assess the situation in Iraq .
“ We were hoping the figures would go down , but what happened was expected , ” said Haidar al - Ebadi , who sits in Parliament as a senior member of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki ’s Dawa Party .
The troop increase made it harder for insurgent groups to operate in Baghdad , he said , so they pushed outward to easier targets .
John McCain has just $ 1.67 million in primary money on hand and is carrying $ 1.73 million in reported debt .
Such a grim reality means that he is effectively left with two options -- take public matching funds or get out of the race .
While McCain aides sought to downplay his fiscal straits at the end of last month , the report filed last night paints an ugly picture .
He did n't raise $ 6 million for the quarter , as his staff claimed .
He actually brought in $ 5.73 million overall -- and of that only $ 4,977,000 was in primary dollars , per the Post By contrast , Ron Paul raised $ 5.2 for the primary in the third quarter .
And , speaking of ugly numbers , Mike Huckabee 's paltry $ 1 million raised for the quarter looks worse in light of his cash on hand -- just $ 651,000 .
But Huck 's money in the bank looks downright Clinton - esque compared to his rival Sam Brownback .
The Kansas senator raised $ 804 K in the quarter and , after blowing a lot of cash for a third - place finish at Ames , is less than $ 95 grand in the bank .
UPDATE : A McCain aide points out that Romney 's camp put out $ 10 million as what they expected to raise this quarter , but that the former governor wound up raising $ 9.8 million .

Now that ’s what I ’m talking about !
If I ’m gonna spend ten hours with my arms outstretched clawing at two horribly painful controllers until I have to guzzle rapid - release Tylenol and lay flat on my back , it might as well be for a title that actually takes advantage of this revolutionary new motion - sensitive gaming technology , instead of cheaply re-purposed multi-platform crap .
Except for the three - dimensional bone rotation .
I do n’t do well with the three - dimensional bone rotation .
In eighth grade I had to put a bunch of pegs in holes for some lady with a stopwatch to get a psychological exemption from wood shop before Mr. Cirillo flunked me for repeatedly failing to make a box .
So I do appreciate continuously variable difficulty levels and have no qualms about using it .

Spatial retardation and an instinctual avoidance of excruciating pain are why I played the first Trauma Center on my DS , and as enjoyable as I find this game I would n’t be suffering through it if it had n’t been Doomeru ’s holiday gift to me .
I got him one of these , but do n’t tell him because I did n’t order it until realizing he ’d bought me something so it has n’t arrived yet .
Anyway , what I love about this game , besides the impossibly inane plot and dialogue , is that it ’s really fucking hard .
I ’m no Dr. House , nor even Dr. Turk , but I imagine the satisfaction - not to mention complete and total exhaustion - I feel after finally finishing a level ( on the ninth attempt ) is about a fraction of what an ER surgeon must feel from finishing a day without killing anyone or getting sued .
Minus the shitty hours and constant risk of infection , of course .
But getting back to the inane plot and dialogue - why is it that every single person who comes into contact with these magical doctors inevitably gets sick and has to be operated on ?
What are n’t they telling us about this “ healing touch ? ”
And , you crazy fucking japs , its one thing for a lonely misunderstood Solid Snake to be constantly jabbering at anyone foolish enough to give him their radio frequency and something else entirely for doctors to stop and deliver long - winded soliloquies about their drive to save lives while their patients are cut open and bleeding to death on the table .
Now watch my Trauma Center Montage !
Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee talks to GQ about a number of things in this recent interview , and says he does n’t want gays to have marriage or civil unions .
GQ : Is the strategy shifting because social conservatives are losing on those core issues ?
Ten years ago , it would have been unimaginable to have gay marriage even in liberal Massachusetts .
Now it ’s there .
HUCKABEE : I do n’t think the issue ’s about being against gay marriage .
It ’s about being for traditional marriage and articulating the reason that ’s important .
You have to have a basic family structure .
There ’s never been a civilization that has rewritten what marriage and family means and survived .
So there is a sense in which , you know , it ’s one thing to say if people want to live a different way , that ’s their business .
But when you want to redefine what family means or what marriage means , then that ’s an issue that should require some serious and significant debate in the public square .
And if you look at states that have had it on the ballot — I know in our state it was a 70 - percent - against issue .
Most states are similar to that .
GQ : But if the younger generation keeps going the way it ’s going , it could be 50 percent in ten years .
HUCKABEE : It could .
GQ : I just wonder what you ’d say to the gay couple who says , “ Well , we want to live this way , and my partner ca n’t come visit me in a nursing home . ”
HUCKABEE : He can with a power of attorney .
That ’s the fallacy , that this requires some new definition of marriage .
It ’s simply not the case .
GQ : So why ca n’t you call it a civil union ?
HUCKABEE : Because it really is a precursor toward marriage .
Once the government says this relationship is in essence similar to or equal to a marriage — we ’re not going to call it that , but that ’s what it is — and you grant it the same basic rights as marriage , then you ’ve effectively done it .
He will , however , gladly take the support of gays if they ’d like to give it to him .
Is This Guy for Real [ gq ]
I had dinner the other night with a fine reporter and writer who works in another city where I was once a consultant .
She loves what she does , and is good at it ; she covers community news and sports .
She has done this all her life , and still enjoys it .
But she is now 48 years old and is a little concerned about security .
That 's because she makes ... $ 28,000 a year .
That 's enough to make me pray daily that all the executives of every large newspaper company , but especially Gannett , get some terrible skin infection that is n't covered by health insurance .
What makes me maddest is not that they are n't paying this poor woman even half of what she is worth .
What makes me truly angry is that they are sabotaging our freedom by failing to decently pay people whose jobs it is to be the watchdogs of democracy , and thus usually driving them out of the business .
Reporters tell us about what is happening in our communities and cities .
They watch for and expose abuses and direct our attention to things we should know about .

Reporters have never been paid enough money , but now things are getting worse .
The Detroit Media Partnership , which publishes The Detroit News and Free Press , is in fact entirely controlled by Gannett .
Two weeks ago , the partnership announced that it wanted to eliminate 110 jobs .
That 's 5 percent of the total .
Why ?
Hard times for Gannett , comrades .
The monster corporation 's profits for the July 1 - Sept. 30 period were only $ 234 million !
Never mind that Ford Motor Co. executives would kill small puppies for a quarter like that these days .
No , what matters is that a year ago , Gannett profits for those three months were $ 261.4 million .
Cancel the Porsche detailing service , Thurston .
No wonder Gannett thinks it 's clearly time to do the prudent thing and get rid of some of those highly overpaid $ 28,000 - a- year workers .
Now in Detroit the average reporter , etc. , makes nearly twice that .
But soon some will be making zero .
Gannett 's buyout offer is pretty cheesy as these things go , by the way .
Workers get two weeks pay for every year worked ... up to one year of pay .
What if they do n't take it ?
Well , then , our Media Partnership strongly hinted , they 'll start laying the buggers off .
True , the cuts are mostly to come from the business side of operations .
But the papers still intend to eliminate 16 newsroom positions at the Free Press and another six at The Detroit News .
( They have been , however , looking to hire photographers to take video of things like traffic accidents and put it on their Web sites .
They think that is the wave of the future . )
For years , the Detroit Media Partnership has had a pretty lame PR woman named Susie Ellwood .
When asked about these layoffs affecting the quality of the journalism , here 's what our Susie said : Losing these people wo n't matter one bit !
" Something we 're not going to change is our commitment to providing the right amount of news coverage , " she bragged .
That was so monumentally stupid it got a lot of attention on Romenesko , the nation 's best media - industry blog .
Here 's why chipper little Susie 's words were so brainless :
If the cuts really do n't affect news coverage , these people now being laid off were n't needed .
They must have been doing nothing worthwhile at all .
So if what she says were true , it also means the idiots running the papers are incompetent .
Think about it ; if you have n't already gotten rid of people who are n't needed in these tough times , what kind of manager are you ?
In fact , everyone knows Ellwood 's statement was a not - very - good - lie .
Had Susie been a little slicker , she would have said something like , " in spite of economic setbacks , we 're going to make every effort to bring readers what they need to know . "
That 's the kind of meaningless blather we expect .
Everyone knows that after this latest round of cuts there will be less news and more errors .
The papers are already vastly diminished from what they were .
The worst , no doubt , is yet to come .
Earlier this year , I talked with Phil Power , who founded and built up the Observer & Eccentric chain and other similar small suburban newspaper groups elsewhere in Michigan , Ohio and Kentucky .
I was his editorial vice - president for the last year and a half before he sold his company to Gannett .
Since he did that , Gannett has shrunk the payroll of those newspapers -- though not as much as the other out - of - town suburban publisher in this market , the Pennsylvania - based Journal - Register Co. , which has turned the Oakland Press into a largely contemptible rag with screaming headlines about nothing .
Power is alarmed by what 's happening to journalism .
" Newspapers were the economic engine that allowed the employment of reporters .
And for a century and a half , their work collectively invigorated the civic life of the republic . "
If newspapers do n't do it , " what society needs to ask is , ' Who is going to hire and sustain these people now , these journalists who provide us with the essential information a free society needs ? ' "
That 's a darned good question , and you may be tempted to say , " What the hell right does he have to ask it ?
He sold his papers to the greedheads , did n't he ? "
Point taken .
But you can't fault Power too much for selling his newspapers ; his sons had no interest in eventually running them .
Nor did he take his millions and sit on a yacht ; he has founded the Center for Michigan , a " think and do " tank dedicated to getting this state a future .
Mainly , he is trying to get people energized and engaged .
The goal is to move our mostly appalling politicians -- and the rest of us -- toward policies for our state that are based on political and economic common sense .
Yet common sense begins at home too .
People do have to look after themselves and their best interests .
So what could I tell my friend , who went to Indiana University -- a very good school -- and has since devoted her life to a profession that pays her less than this society would a bartender ?
I told her that , realistically , it was time to change careers , especially if she planned to keep living in Michigan .
Something like public relations for a college or a university , or for a sports team , if she could find one of those jobs .
And she could always write freelance on the side , I noted .
Yes , she agreed , but it would n't be the same .
No , that 's right , it wo n't be the same .
But journalism is n't the same either .

OP ED
President Bush is off on an eight - day whirlwind tour of the Middle East .
He starts in Israel with the hope of solving a thorny problem of a peaceful settlement of Palestinian and Israeli differences .
Woefully neglected by Condoleezza Rice , his present secretary of state , this remains a puzzle whose solution has stymied every American president since Harry Truman .
Our President carries with him to the region several fallacies that have been embraced or promoted by him .
Unfortunately , he is fond of ignoring the reality that his misbegotten preemptive war against Iraq may have destroyed the delicate balance of the Middle East forever .
Fallacy No. 1 . If a Palestinian state were created , many of the world ’s problems would suddenly disappear .
Speaking realistically and at the risk of seeming callous to the loss of human life , deaths as a result of fighting between Jews and Palestinians since 1921 total less than 100,000 , or about as many as are killed in a season of slaughter in Darfur .
Moreover , while it would be nice if the Israelis and the Palestinians could settle their differences , it will do little or nothing to resolve the other continuing conflicts in the Middle East , South Asia or Indonesia .
For example :
It will not stop Muslim - Russian violence in Chechnya .
It will not stop Muslim - Igbo ( Christian ) violence in Nigeria .
It will not stop Muslim - animist violence in Sudan ,
It will not stop Muslim - Hindu violence in Kashmir .
It will not stop Muslim - Buddhist violence in Thailand .
It will not stop Muslim - Christian violence in Indonesia and the Philippines .
It will not stop inter-Muslim violence between traditionalists and Islamists .
It will not stop violence and between Sunnis and Shia ,
It will not stop violence by radical Islamists against the West for past or present , real or imagined transgressions .
Fallacy No. 2 . We must attack Iran to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on an atomic bomb .
It is understandable for Americans to worry about an Iranian bomb , but no more so than a North Korean bomb .
In either case , if what we fear is the use of nuclear weapons by either state , there is absolutely no reason to think our strategy of conventional nuclear deterrence , employed successfully for more than forty years during the Cold War , would be less effective today than it was in the past .
Indeed , deterrence would be more effective against such weaker nuclear adversaries than against a stronger one like the Soviet Union .
Destruction in such cases would no longer be mutual ; for either nuclear weaker nation , Iran or South Korea , it would still be very much assured destruction .
Why the Bush administration does n’t perceive this is beyond comprehension .
Perhaps they have begun to believe their own trumped - up fear mongering .
There is another and more real aspect to our worries about terrorists getting their hands on fissionable materials .
If we are concerned about nuclear bomb materials falling into the hands of terrorists -- and we should be -- the Middle East should not be the main focus of our attention .
Why would potential perpetrators of a nuclear attack waste time waiting for the development of an Iranian nuclear bomb when the materials and technology needed to develop a nuclear weapon are already in circulation on the world ’s nuclear black market ?
The threat is real — petroleum money can indeed subsidize dangerous actions against the United States and its interests — but the Middle East is not even close to being the source of that threat .
Several regions should demand our attention in order to confront the threat of nuclear terrorism .
These are less likely to be in the Middle East and more probably will be in Russia or the states of the former Soviet Union .
More than six years after 9/11 , the U.S. commitment to the security of nuclear material in the former Soviet Union is still insufficient and being ignored .
Condoleezza Rice , the Secretary of State , supposedly an expert on the Soviet Union , apparently is unaware of the threat posed by such poorly guarded nuclear materials .
This is not surprising .
By her own admission she could never imagine that planes could be used to bring down buildings in suicide attacks .
The misguided emphasis on threats posed by Middle Eastern countries and groups like al - Qaida and Hizbollah continues to cause our inaction elsewhere .
For example , the growing instability of Pakistan , a nation with anywhere from 30 to 80 nuclear bombs , should cause concern over the possibility that these weapons could fall into the hands of disgruntled , Taliban - friendly Islamists .
Yet Pakistan is not on Mr. Bush ’s itinerary .
Fallacy No. 3 . We have not paid enough attention to the Middle East .
The truth is we are much too engrossed in the affairs of the Middle East , yet it is a region about which we are still abysmally ignorant .
Nevertheless , it could immeasurably profit from our benign neglect ,
The peoples of the countries of the Middle East constitute less than five per cent of the world 's population , and are remarkably unproductive .
In fact , a high proportion of the population of the backward countries of the Middle East is not in the labor force at all .
Consider Abu Dhabi , a city and an emirate overflowing with oil money and very few citizens .
The majority of its population is made up of expatriates from other countries that do the actual work .
Similarly , Saudi Arabia 's 27.5 million inhabitants also live off the oil revenues and do very little work , leaving that to the 5.5 million foreign technicians and laborers .
Even with astronomically high oil prices , Saudi Arabia 's annual per capita income ( $ 13,800 ) is only about half that of the $ 25,800 per capita income of Israel , which has no oil .
The Middle East ( excluding Israel ) is an economic and technological backwater .
A region that for centuries was the world leader in science and mathematics is now the global laggard in these subjects .
In this largely stagnant area almost nothing is created in the sciences or the arts .
If we take patents as an example and again exclude Israel , the per capita creation of patents in countries of the Middle East is one - fifth that of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa , itself a region not given to abundant inventiveness .
Centuries ago the Middle East was a seat of learning and the known world ’s most advanced region .
Today , its principal industries are ( 1 ) extravagant consumption by the moneyed classes , ( 2 ) wasting time sitting around in coffee houses , and ( 3 ) voicing bitter resentment against the West .
If the Middle East as a region is seen today as threatening , it is not because its countries are unusually powerful or menacing , but because most of its undereducated , unemployed and illiterate young people have too much time on their hands and are engaged in a virtually hopeless battle against political repression at home and economic irrelevance abroad .
The intelligent , disaffected middle - class male youths who join Islamic fundamentalist movements and who became the perpetrators of the 9/11 disasters recognize that the status quo in the Middle East does not serve a majority of its inhabitants well — but they nevertheless blame the West for this .
The stagnation of the resource - rich countries in the Middle East should come as no surprise .
Experts have long noted that countries rich in natural resources are frequently poor in everything else .
According to the UN's 2004 Arab human development report , at only 63 per cent , the Middle East boasts the second lowest adult literacy rate in the world ( after sub- Saharan Africa ) .
Its dependence on oil means that manufactured goods account for just 17 per cent of exports , compared to a global average of 78 per cent .
Moreover , despite its oil wealth , the entire Middle East generated less than 4 per cent of global GDP in 2006 .
Anyone who says we are dependent on the Middle East because of its rich supplies of oil simply is n’t familiar with current statistics .
Today the region produces lass than 30 percent of the world ’s oil .
Only about 17 percent of American oil imports comes from the Persian Gulf .
In fact , most statements about U.S. dependence on the Middle East for our oil conveniently fail to note that Canada is currently our number - one supplier of petroleum , with Mexico second .
Until oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938 , it was a land of Bedouin shepherds and oasis date farmers who may perhaps be forgiven for failing to catch up with the outside world by continuing their backward ways .
Saudi oil export revenues today account for 90 – 95 percent of the Kingdom ’s export earnings , 70 – 80 percent of its state revenues and roughly 40 percent of the country ’s GDP .
As a result , oil producers have at least as much reason to be concerned about sustained high oil prices as do oil consumers .
Once an advanced economy , Iran is an even better example of the negative effect of an abundance of petroleum .
Although it exports only 2.8 million barrels of oil daily , as compared with Saudi Arabia 's more than 10 million , oil still accounts for 80 percent of Iran ’s exports because its industry and agriculture are now so unproductive .
Vice President Dick Cheney is forever bleating about the strategic importance of the Middle East to justify our occupation of Iraq .
But despite its vast petroleum resources , this undeveloped region is less relevant than ever .
It would be far better for the United States if we stopped meddling in the Middle East and turned our attention to working with the vibrant and creative nations of Europe and Asia — places where hard - working populations are toiling and looking toward the future , not sitting around puffing on hubbly - bubbly pipes and dreaming of long - gone glories of the past .
A genuinely serious effort to make the United States less dependent on petroleum for our energy needs should also be a top priority .

The Consumerist 's Meghann Marco sez , " Reader Sam ordered a hard drive from Best Buy .
What he got was a box of bathroom tiles . "
Best Buy wo n't give him a refund , saying that he needs to take it up with the manufacturer .
I got into my car , raced back to Best Buy and voiced my complaint .
The employee and assistant manager were more than willing to help , saying that it happens .
So they set up the return and I repurchased the drive and while I was checking the contents to ensure it was a hard drive this time , the store manager came up , took the box from me and said to take it up with the manufacturer .

Embedding Complex Numbers as Types
> data Zero
> data S a = S a
> type Two = S One
> type Three = S Two
Either
( , )
Either One Three
( Two , Two )
> data Zero
> data Unit = Unit
> type S a = Either Unit a
> type One = S Zero
> type Two = S One
> type Three = S Two
Either and ( , ) as addition and multiplication .
But if you 're content to live with isomorphism then maybe we could embed other types .
Consider the type
> data Tree = Leaf | Trunk Tree | Fork Tree Tree
It 's easy to write an isomorphism Tree -> Either One ( Either Tree ( Tree , Tree ) ) .
In other words , up to isomorphism we have Tree=1 + Tree + Tree2 .
If you remember my earlier post it should be clear that legal sequences of moves in TNP give rise to isomorphisms of types constructed from Tree .
In other words , theorems about TNP apply to Tree .
Therefore given two polynomials , p 1 and p 2 , p 1 ( Tree ) =p 2 ( Tree ) if and only if p 1 ( i ) =p 2 ( i ) , as long as the p i contain non-constant terms .
Looked at another way , given any Gaussian integer , a +bi , we can embed this as a type in such a way that the embedding respects Either and ( , ) .
In fact the type
a Tree +b Tree 2+c Tree 3+d Tree 4
embeds ( d - b ) + ( a - c ) i .
For example , abusing Haskell notation ,
> type Zero = Tree + Tree 3
really does act like zero in that ( Zero , p( Tree ) ) has an isomorphism with Zero for any non-constant polynomial p .
As far as I can see , this fact is completely and utterly useless ...
NB
When I say isomorphism above I mean " particularly nice isomorphism " , which in this case means an isomorphism that takes time O ( 1 ) .
Otherwise all countable tree structures would trivially be isomorphic .
Forget about types for now .
The game of Thermonuclear Pennies is a lot like the game of Nuclear Pennies .
It 's played on a semi- infinite strip of cells , extending to infinity on the right , with a bunch of pennies in each cell ( and a finite number in total ) .
Instead of a single penny fissioning into two pennies , it now splits into three adjacent pennies .
And conversely , three neighbouring pennies may be fused into one .
Here are examples of legal moves : andAgain the puzzles consist of trying to get from a start position to a target position .
Here 's a nice example : Just as with Nuclear Pennies we can assign numerical values to positions in this game in such as way that if there is a legal sequence of moves from A to B then the value of A equals the value of B .
In this case we assign the values very slightly differently .
Each cell is assigned a value as follows :
Where i is the usual square root of - 1 .
The value of a position is simply the sum of the values of the pennies where each penny takes on the value of the cell it sits in .
So As before , we say that moving from A to B is paralegal if A and B have the same value .
Because i satisfies i=1+i+iit should be clear that legal implies paralegal again .
But here 's a surprising fact : if both A and B have pennies not on the leftmost cell , then a move from A to B is legal if it is paralegal .
In other words , we can tell if a sequence of moves is possible just by looking at the numerical value of the start and end points .
What 's more , the corresponding result also holds for Nuclear Pennies and a wide variety of related games besides .
Before proving that I want to talk about the algebraic structure of these types of games .
( And I just figured out how to procedurally generate diagrams with Omnigraffle using Applescript so it 's an excuse to draw lots of diagrams . ) ( BTW
If we 're allowed to have a negative number of pennies in a cell then you can simply treat a position in these games as polynomials with integer coefficients .
You can then use standard theorems about polynomials to prove the result in a straightforward way .
But those theorems rely on subtraction , and without negative numbers those methods fail . )
Firstly , we can add positions in Thermonuclear pennies ( which I 'll now call TNP ) .
Simply add the numbers of pennies in each cell :
We can also multiply positions .
We do this by making a ' multiplication table ' from the original positions and then summing along the lower - left to upper - right diagonals .
I hope this example makes it unambiguous : Exercises .
Convince yourself that A+B=B+A , A *( B+C ) = A * B+ A*C , ( A+ B ) * C = A * C+ B*C , A * ( B* C ) = ( A * B ) * C.
If you did the exercises , you 've now shown that TNP positions form a commutative semiring , or rig , with the empty board serving as 0 .
Now we 're ready to use a proof from Objects of Categories as Complex Numbers by Fiore and Leinster .
If we definethen every position is a polynomial , with non-negative integer coefficients , in x .
We can also interpret the equation x=1+x + xas saying that fission and fusion are legal moves .
More generally , we consider two positions equivalent if there is a sequence of legal moves going from one to the other where each move maps f( x ) + x to f( x ) + 1 + xor the converse .
If we define p( x ) =x and p( x ) =1+ xthen equation ( 3 ) in that paper defines exactly what we mean by a sequence of legal moves .
( BTW
For those wondering about the order in which I wrote this , I read that definition after inventing the game :-)
So now we can apply Theorem 5.1 to findLet q( x ) and q(x ) represent TNP positions with at least one penny somewhere other than the far left , then if x ^2+1=0 ⇒q ( x ) =q ( x ) ring - theoretically , then there is a legal sequence of moves from q( x ) to q( x ) . " x ^ 2+1=0⇒q ( x ) =q ( x ) " is just another way of saying q ( i ) =q ( i ) .
So we have a simple way to tell whether there is a legal way of getting from one position to another .
The puzzle example I gave above is soluble because i=i.
Actually , the corollary is n't too hard to prove without the theorem .
Here 's a hint for how to do it .
If we allow negative numbers of pennies the puzzle is fairly easy to solve .
But we do n't need negative pennies because if there is at least one penny , we can saturate as many positions as we like with as many pennies as we like simply by madly fissioning pennies all over the place in a big chain reaction .
So we start by doing the chain reaction to borrow lots of pennies , then carrying out the solution using negative numbers ( which wo n't actually ever go negative if our chain reaction was big enough ) and then reversing the chain reaction to pay back what we borrowed .
( It 's a bit like real life .
In a financial market without negative numbers there are many transactions that can't be performed .
But as soon as we allow borrowing we open up many more possibilities .
)
So back to types .
People have frequently found the need to embed the natural numbers as types .
A popular scheme is something ( in Haskell ) likeand so on .
Then we can go on to define addition and multiplication .
But types already have a natural addition and multiplication : the type constructorsand .
The problem is that , for example , is n't the same type as .
We could relax things a bit and allow isomorphism instead of equality .
But even then , these types are n't isomorphic .
Instead we could define : Now we can use
Chocolate , the popular product manufactured by roasting , fermenting , and processing the beans of a cacao tree in combination with sugar ( and milk in some cases ) , is a pretty amazing food .
Chocolate ( when used in the singular form typically refers to the basic ingredient , while the pluralis often used to refer to candies made with chocolate as a primary ingredient ) has a complex flavor that can change and develop as it melts .
Since its melting point is just below human body temperature , this means that while eating chocolate , both the texture ( as it changes from solid to creamy liquid ) and its flavor gradually changes in the mouth .
This low melting point does makes it very easy to melt .
Unfortunately , chocolate can burn if heated over 200 °F ( 95 °C ) which is very likely when heated directly over an open flame .
This need not be a concern if the proper precautions are taken .
There are several easy ways to melt chocolate .
I 'll discuss two of the most useful ones .is the easiest but works best when using a small amount of chocolate ( less than 1 pound ) .
The chocolate should be in relatively small pieces ( chocolate chips also work well ) , so if you 're using chocolate bars or blocks , you 'll want to cut the chocolate into smaller pieces first .
Microwave in short bursts , about 30 seconds at a time , and stir between each microwave session to provide even heating .
At some point , the chocolate will be warm and the pieces will hold their shape as you pull it out of the microwave oven , but they will be slightly shiny and mush as you stir it .
Keep stirring and allow the residual heat to melt the rest of the chocolate .
If done properly and gently enough on high quality tempered chocolate , this method can result in melted chocolate that is still tempered .
Heat it too much and you 'll lose the temper , so it 's important to stop as soon as the chocolate is about to melt.uses a little more equipment , but gives you the most control while melting chocolate .
You can melt larger quantities of chocolate with this method and use larger pieces ( up to 2 ounce blocks ) .
Select a heat proof bowl to place your chocolate in .
Put about 1/2 - in. water into a pot and place the bowl on top of the pot .
Make sure the bottom of the bowl does n't touch the water .
Now you have a double boiler .
Put the bowl aside and bring the water to a boil .
If you 're melting a small amount of chocolate , you can simply take the pot of water off the heat .
If melting a larger quantity of chocolate , keep the pot on the heat and turn it down to a bare simmer .
Place the bowl of chocolate on top of the pot of hot water and stir the chocolate using a silicone spatula until it has melted .
Be careful not to allow any steam or condensation to enter the melting chocolate or it can seize .
This is usually not a problem if you are watchful and have a lip on the bowl .
You can remove the bowl from the pan whenever you need to slow down the heating process and place it back on to introduce more heat .
This will prove vital while tempering .
When melted chocolate returns to solid form the cocoa butter in the chocolate forms a crystal structure .
The strange ( or cool depending on who you 're talking to ) thing about cocoa butter is that the crystal structure they take on depends on the temperature at which they are formed .
If the chocolate is allowed to cool on its own , the crystals of fat will be loose , resulting in a chocolate that is dull in appearance , soft & malleable , and greasy to the touch .
This loose crystalline structure has a slightly lower melting point than tempered chocolate crystals .
If , instead , while cooling , the chocolate is kept at 88 °F ( 31 °C ) , the loose crystal structure will not form ( 88 °F is above the formation point of the loose crystals ) .
At this temperature the cocoa butter actually forms a dense crystalline structure .
Holding the chocolate at this temperature and stirring will allow a whole bunch of these stable crystal structures to form providing a lot of seed crystals to form in the chocolate .
When the chocolate is finally allowed to fully cool , if there are enough stable seed crystals , then the chocolate will harden into a very stable hard chocolate with a slight sheen , snap when broken , and will keep for months at cool room temperature .
Tempered chocolate provides enough stability to be worked into a variety of shapes - sheets , painted onto leaves and peeled off , flowers , cups , and molds .
It also helps prevent the cocoa butter from rising to the surface of the chocolate and blooming into unsightly light brown markings or coatings .
To temper , most chocolate books will tell you to fully melt the chocolate and then to pour 3/ 4 of the chocolate onto a marble slab and repeatedly fold the chocolate onto itself and smear it across the marble until the chocolate is a uniform 82 °F ( 28 °C ) .
The chocolate is then returned to the remaining hot chocolate and stirred in .
The final mixture is either reheated or the residual heat is enough to bring the temperature back up to 88 - 90 °F ( 31 - 32 °C ) .
This technique is can be a bit tricky and requires a marble slab ( or other large , flat , cool surface like a sheet of aluminum or upside down sheet pan ) , a plastic scraper for smearing the chocolate ( a spatula will also work ) , and a chocolate thermometer ( an instant read that can measure accurately to the degree like the Thermapen will also work fine ) .
The chocolate needs to be worked sufficiently on the marble slab for enough seed crystals to form , so you have to work relatively quickly as the chocolate cools .
A good way to tell when you 've reached the right temperature and stage is to pay attention to the viscosity of the chocolate .
When the chocolate begins to thicken a little , you 've reached the point where seed crystals are forming and you should be able to reincorporate it into the rest of the chocolate .
The tempered chocolate must then be kept at tempering temperature , 88 - 90 °F ( 31 - 32 °C ) until used .
I find that the ( as described in The Professional Chef ) is a little easier .
Since almost all the chocolate that is sold is already tempered , we can use a piece of this already tempered chocolate as a plentiful source of seed crystals .
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler while stirring to ensure unform temperature .}? >
I ’m learning that portrait photography can be tough in more than one way thanks to my participation in the December Challenge .
I ’m already getting bored with taking the standard cookie - cutter portrait , so I started digging around Flickr for some inspiration .
Here ’s what I turned up :
[ tweetmeme ]
And yes , I realize that the accompanying text is much shorter than I would usually supply , but the idea of this post is n’t to teach these techniques — it ’s to introduce you to them and hopefully give you some inspiration with your own photography .
I feel that these photos are strong enough to stand on their own without lengthy descriptions .

1. PHOTOSHOP
If you ’re good with post - processing and manipulations , use it to your advantage .
Get crazy with the adjustments , try some new Photoshop techniques , and maybe even a composite image .
2. TEXTURE
If texture is a big part of your subject , make it stand out and make it obvious .
Match up the textures between your subject and your background .
You might even try texturizing the entire photo for additional impact .
3. OVEREXPOSE
Blowing out the highlights or making a high - key image makes a nice soft portrait with kind of a light airy feeling .
Another advantage of high - key photos is that the smaller details and defects are blown away , making the image look much smoother .
4. UNDEREXPOSE
A dominantly dark or low - key image will naturally draw your eyes to the lighter parts .
These tend to have a grittier and harder look to them than the high - key images .
5. BACK - LIGHT
Hair lights up like crazy when it ’s back - lit , so if hair is a big part of your subject make it stand out by placing your subject between you and a light source .
You could also take this a little further and push the image to a silhouette .
6. POSING
Get crazy with the pose and positioning — extra points if it looks uncomfortable .
Not only with the poses , but also with your own positioning — shoot from different angles to achieve different impacts .
7. CULTURE
Capture the local culture — what ’s mundane to you is exotic to us .
Culture is everywhere , even in your own town .
Just image you ’re visiting from a different country — what things would then seem more interesting to you ?
8. REFLECTIONS
Make use of different surfaces to add that extra dimension — windows , mirrors , and water are all very good reflective surfaces that give a different result and texture .
9. SHADOWS
Make the shadow an important part of the image .
Sometimes the shadow can even be more prominent than the actual subject casting the shadow .
10 . GET CLOSE
There ’s no rule against cropping out most of the subject ’s face .
This draws more attention to the parts that are left in the frame .
11 . ( UN ) FOCUS
Out - of - focus subjects can be more interesting than the in - focus subjects .
It kind of adds some mystery to the image because you ca n’t quite make out who that person is .
12 . MOVEMENT
Use movement to show action , even if it blurs out the subject entirely .
In cases like this , think of the person as a means of creating the subject rather than being the actual subject .
13 . CAPTURE THE MOMENT
Catch somebody doing something they love , even if it ’s not staged .
Street photography is one of my favorite genres because it captures life as it happens — unstaged and unposed .
14 . COLORS
Use vibrant and contrasting colors to draw attention to parts of your subject .
This could be makeup , clothing , accessories , or whatever else you can get your hands on .
15 . GET SERIOUS
Not all portraits need to have a smile , capture the serious emotions too .
Some of my favorite portraits have no hint of a smile in them , and they ’re highly emotional .
16 . PROPS
Use the props and tools around you to make the setting more interesting .
Find things to place your subject in , on , under , around , etc .

Shock Absorber sports bras are a great innovation for the ladies and maybe even some guys with man breasts , especially for marathon runners and intense exercisers , who cite examples of conventional bras actually cutting into them .
Those brassieres have been around for a while , though , but the real eye - opener is the way the company demonstrates the characteristics of its products with its Bounce - O - Meter , a Flash app on its website .
It lets you input a bra and cup size and then simulates what happens to those magnificent mamms under various exercise conditions , starting with naked breasts ( NSFW ) , then a normal bra , and ultimately the Shock Absorber sports bra .
Take the jump for the Bounce - O - Meter :
Besides appealing to the prurient interest , it 's an exceptionally well - done animation , demonstrating a real problem solved by a product that looks like it can get the job done .
Even the A cups do a whole lot of bouncing around , graphically vouching for the gal who invented the brassiere almost a century ago , and the Shock Absorber creators who dramatically improved that invention .
Yes , they certainly had better reasons than we do for studying breasts so carefully .

Ballot Changes Cited in Vote 's Discrepancy With Polls Clinton 's favorable placement on ballots may account for part of poll mistakes .
Jan. 9 , 2008  --
Without a doubt , a big source of the discrepancy between the pre-election surveys and the election outcome in New Hampshire is the order of candidates ' names on the ballot and in the surveys .
Our analysis of all recent primaries in New Hampshire showed that there was always a big primacy effect — big -name , big - vote - getting candidates got 3 percent or more votes more when listed first on the ballot than when listed last .
Until this year , New Hampshire rotated candidate name order from precinct to precinct , which allowed us to do that analysis .
This year , the secretary of state changed the procedure so the names were alphabetical starting with a randomly selected letter , in all precincts .
The randomly selected letter this year was Z .
As a result , Joe Biden was first on every ballot , Hillary Clinton was near the top of the list ( and the first serious contender listed ) and Barack Obama was close to last of the 21 candidates listed .
Thus , I 'll bet that Clinton got at least 3 percent more votes than Obama simply because she was listed close to the top .
Most , if not all , of the pre-election telephone polls rotated name order from respondent to respondent , which meant name order did not distort their overall results .
Failing to incorporate the name order effect that probably happened in the voting booth is therefore probably partly responsible for the polls ' inaccuracy .
More importantly , if New Hampshire had rotated name order in the voting booth as it has always done in the past , the race would probably have been too close to call without a recount and might even have been an Obama victory .
