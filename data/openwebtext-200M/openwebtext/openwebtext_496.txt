Forget 9-volts , AAs , AAAs or D batteries :
The energy for tomorrow 's miniature electronic devices could come from tiny microbatteries about half the size of a human cell and built with viruses .
MIT engineers have developed a way to at once create and install such microbatteries -- which could one day power a range of miniature devices , Â from labs - on - a- chip to implantable medical sensors -- by stamping them onto a variety of surfaces .
In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) the week of Aug. 18 , the team describes assembling and successfully testing two of the three key components of a battery .
A complete battery is on its way .
" To our knowledge , this is the first instance in which microcontact printing has been used to fabricate and position microbattery electrodes and the first use of virus - based assembly in such a process , " wrote MIT professors Paula T. Hammond , Angela M. Belcher , Yet - Ming Chiang and colleagues .
Further , the technique itself " does not involve any expensive equipment , and is done at room temperature , " said Belcher , the Germeshausen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering .
Hammond is the Bayer Professor of Chemical Engineering and associate head of the Department of Chemical Engineering .
Chiang is a professor of ceramics in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering .
Belcher , Chiang and Hammond are also affiliated with the MIT Energy Initiative , which aims to help transform the global energy system to meet the needs of the future .
Belcher and Hammond are also faculty members in the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT .
Batteries consist of two opposite electrodes -- an anode and cathode -- separated by an electrolyte .
In the current work , the MIT team created both the anode and the electrolyte .
First , on a clear , rubbery material the team used a common technique called soft lithography to create a pattern of tiny posts either four or eight millionths of a meter in diameter .
On top of these posts , they then deposited several layers of two polymers that together act as the solid electrolyte and battery separator .
Next came viruses that preferentially self - assemble atop the polymer layers on the posts , ultimately forming the anode .
In 2006 , Hammond , Belcher , Chiang and colleagues reported in Science how to do this .
Specifically , they altered the virus 's genes so it makes protein coats that collect molecules of cobalt oxide to form ultrathin wires -- together , the anode .
The final result : a stamp of tiny posts , each covered with layers of electrolyte and the cobalt oxide anode .
" Then we turn the stamp over and transfer the electrolyte and anode to a platinum structure " that , together with lithium foil , is used for testing , Hammond said .
The team concludes in their PNAS paper : " the resulting electrode arrays exhibit full electrochemical functionality . "
What 's next ?
In addition to developing the third part of a full battery -- the cathode -- Â via the viral assembly technique , the team is also exploring a stamp for use on curved surfaces , Belcher said .
" We 're also interested in integrating [ the batteries ] with biological organisms . "

US : Veteran turned away from military hospital commits suicide
By Naomi Spencer
28 July 2008
On July 7 , a Navy veteran suffering from psychological problems hanged himself after being turned away from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Spokane , Washington .
A July 20 report by the Spokesman - Review notes that the death of Lucas Senescall was the sixth suicide this year of veterans under care of the Spokane Veterans Administration ( VA ) .
In spite of lawsuits , legislation and countless pledges from officials for improved care , thousands of US veterans who return from occupied Iraq and Afghanistan bearing profound mental trauma continue to be denied adequate treatment .
According to data from the advocacy group Veterans for Common Sense , the VA is currently treating 325,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans , including nearly 134,000 for mental health problems .
One in four veterans wait for over a month to see a VA doctor , and the average waiting period for disability payments is six months , VA and Veterans Benefits Administration data suggest .
Senescall had served on the USS Kitty Hawk and had been honorably discharged .
Following his military tour , he had completed a community college program in prosthetics , but struggled with bouts of depression and mental illness .
His obituary read , “ Luke had many beautiful attributes .
His larger than life personality will leave a lasting mark on everyone he touched , but life was a struggle for him . ”
According to the Spokesman - Review , Senescall first visited the Spokane VA hospital in 2002 ; at that time he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder , which was compounded by drinking .
VA records noted that the veteran had “ a long history of childhood attention deficit disorder and depression ” along with severe depression when he was not on medication .
On the day of his death , Senescall called his father to drive him to the VA medical center for mental health care .
The Spokesman - Review explained that he was “ despondent over a recent breakup with his girlfriend and domestic violence and malicious mischief charges stemming from an incident in which he removed an air conditioner from the apartment he once shared with her ... ”
Senescall ’s father told the paper that he had also been having stress about his slipping grades .
When the two arrived at the VA center at 1 p.m. , his father said Senescall was sobbing , “ holding his hands on his mouth just to keep from screaming . ”
He told his father , “ My heart is just wanting to leave my body . ”
The Spokesman - Review quoted Senescall ’s mental health risk assessment completed by a VA social worker after an hour and a half of Senescall ’s arrival : “ Veteran is tearful , angry and expresses hopelessness .
He is frustrated with his care at the VA and feels like he is always accused of seeking medication ...
Veteran denies suicide plan but states , ‘ I do n’t want to exist . ’”
The social worker also noted that at times Senescall became so distraught that his father had to speak for him .
In spite of expressing suicidal thoughts , the screener concluded , “ Risk low .
Patient commits to safety plan . ”
Senescall then met for 15 minutes with the VA psychiatrist , Dr. William Brown , whose diagnosis concurred with the social worker ’s assessment .
Brown commented in his notes , “ It ’s hard to know what is going on with Luc [ sic ] due to his poor follow - through ...
I point out to him and his dad that his last presentation to me in 2005 was almost identical .
But he has had 2 NO SHOWS with me since then ...
If there was a quick solution to this problem , we would have given it to him by now .
He is going to need to work at his recovery and show some motivation for this prior to being prescribed medications . ”
Less than two hours after leaving the VA , Senescall hung himself in his garage with an extension cord .
“ He was begging for help , and they kicked him to the curb , ” his father told the Spokesman - Review .
The paper reported that the same psychiatrist had been in consultation with another veteran who had committed suicide after being released from the Spokane VA .
The veteran , Timothy Juneman , was a National Guardsman who had been diagnosed with Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) .
Significantly , despite these diagnoses , the Spokesman - Review noted , “ The week before he died , Juneman received final notification that the National Guard had rescinded a promise not to send him back to Iraq for two years . ”
And although the soldier had been on a suicide watch under VA care and had missed numerous scheduled appointments with the hospital , three weeks passed after he had hanged himself in his home before his body was found .
From such details emerges a picture of indifference within the military and political establishment toward wounded soldiers .
Funding for medical care of veterans is grossly inadequate .
At the Spokane VA , for example , a staff of only 52 behavioral health workers is responsible for some 4,500 patients .
More fundamentally , the fates of service members such as Lucas Senescall and Timothy Juneman underscore the exploitative character of the imperialist military and the war .
In many cases during deployment , veterans are wounded physically , as well as witness to — or party to — horrific acts of brutality .
Upon returning home , they enter an overburdened medical system in which their conditions are often denied , stigmatized , and untreated .
In a recent study by the Rand Corporation , 20 percent of military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan reported suffering symptoms of PTSD or major depression .
With PTSD and TBI , the afflicted can suffer intense feelings of isolation , depression , detachment , as well as severe headaches , memory loss and confusion .
Without adequate treatment , many veterans fall into alcoholism and other drug addictions as a means of dulling traumas .
This can only compound difficulties relating to family and friends and holding down a job , which in turn exacerbates the alienation and stress .
It is under these circumstances that thousands of veterans have committed suicide or acts of violence over the past several years .
An analysis of state - level death statistics commissioned by CBS News last year revealed that in 2005 , over 6,250 US veterans committed suicide .
The rate at which veterans took their own lives was double that of the non-veteran population , with the youngest veterans returning from occupied Iraq and Afghanistan the most likely to kill themselves .
In the course of a lawsuit brought against the VA by Veterans for Common Sense , a number of internal VA documents emerged that indicate the department was well aware of this growing social crisis .
The suit was dismissed last month in US District Court in San Francisco on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to order organizational changes to improve the government department ’s medical care .
Nevertheless , evidence introduced in the case established that the VA was aware of at least 1,000 suicide attempts every month , and a rate of four - five suicides every day , among veterans receiving care in VA facilities .
These staggering figures — 12,000 attempted suicides and at least 1,400 completed suicides per year — do not even include the thousands of veterans who have slipped through the bureaucratic cracks .
Emails turned over to the court made it clear that top VA officials took pains to cover up this epidemic .
( See “ Emails suggest Veterans Administration cover - up of suicide rate ” )
One email obtained by the court also suggested that VA counselors , in an effort to reduce caseloads and cut costs , may have been pressured to diagnose fewer cases of PTSD .
Norma Perez , coordinator for the VA PTSD department in Temple , Texas , wrote in an email to VA staff : “ Given that we are having more and more compensation - seeking veterans , I ’d like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out ...
We really do n’t or have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine PTSD . ”

The little - person James Bond movie , For Y'ur Height Only , has plenty of flaws — actually , the movie is pretty much 90 minutes of non -stop flaw — but it does have this awesome jetpack scene .
Weng , otherwise known as Agent 00 , uses the jetpack to zoom over to the hidden island of Mr. Giant , which involves climbing a very small hill .
It 's a good thing the actual James Bond jetpack moment , in Thunderball , lowered the bar to the point where this looks pretty good by comparison .
In addition to fantastic dialog ( Weng : " Shall we get it on ? " Irma : " Yes , my darling , bare your bod ! " ) the movie features some truly epic character acting , as you 'll see from our second clip , of a conversation between the evil Mr. Giant and his captured scientist , Dr. Von Koehler , who refuses to hand over the N - bomb .
There are some rules that go along with driving in Mexico :
1 . Do not ever drive at night .
2 . Do not ever drive without a map .
3 . Make sure your car has robust tires .
I realized on the way to LAX that I 'd already broken the second rule , having left my road map to the Yucatan Peninsula sitting on the kitchen table .
My uncle broke the third rule at Dollar Rent - a - Car when he signed off on a four - door toaster oven of a Hyundai Atos ( with engineering by Dodge ) .
Pulling out of the lot , we christened it Manuel .
Manuel had a manual transmission , manual windows , no power steering , no radio , no interior light , one side mirror , zero floor mats and — the worst part — tires so small they would be the spare on other , safer cars .
In the interest of spreading the blame around , we broke the first rule together .
A day earlier , I got off the plane at Cancun .
You also can't drive the streets of Cancun at night , not because of the danger , but because there are too many touristas .
The aim of the trip , however , was not to run into civilization , but to run away from it — to crash through the backcountry in a red Jeep , rooting out the forgotten villages and photographing the locals .
Instead of that , we were dragging Manuel down a two - lane highway … at night .
It seemed as if the rest of the country knew about the first rule — our only highway companions were huge 18 - wheelers and potholes .
We were pointed towards Palenque , the hidden jewel of the Mayan civilization , unearthed only a hundred years ago from the surrounding jungle .
In retrospect , it 's more likely that the roads into Palenque were empty because the locals were as bored with the ruins as New Yorkers are with the Statue of Liberty or Empire State Building .
We were n’t alone for long , though .
As we crossed the border into Chiapas , we ran straight into a military checkpoint .
Orange flares brought traffic to a halt .
Teenagers with Uzis stood around in camouflage , looking bored .
Their twentysomething captain headed straight for us , all business .
This was the other reason you never drive at night in Mexico .
As the captain approached our car , he pulled a black device , no bigger than a flashlight from his belt .
By then , one of the other soldiers started talking to us , asking the obvious questions :
Where were we going , what we were going to do when we got there , etc. etc .
But we were too fascinated to answer convincingly ; the captain pulled a lever on his flashlight and out came a silver antenna , like a single rabbit ear on an old television set .
The captain pointed the antenna straight ahead and paced steadily beside our car , step after slow step .
The silver antenna moved , to our abject horror , slowly to the left , pointing toward our backseat .
I tried to catch my uncle 's eye with a confused look , but he turned away , watching as the captain reset himself and walked again , slow and straight , past our car .
Once more , the antenna turned and pointed us out , American criminals in a foreign land .
A commotion blew through the roadblock .
The young guards woke up .
The old guards ushered Manuel towards a thatched hut with their submachine guns .
With no hesitation , our bags were unloaded on a long table underneath a lone light bulb , one bag after another in a long line of expensive travel accessories .
My uncle told me to keep an eye our belongings as the captain came back with his dammed flashlight .
Again , the captain walked his slow walk , but this time the antenna was more precise , picking my uncle 's black camera bag from the line - up .
By this time , my curiosity was overwhelming , so I turned to one of the young men standing at idle and asked him just what was happening .
Roughly , he explained to me that the black device was a molecular smell detector .
In 200 yards , it could pick out the smell of one molecule of marijuana , cocaine or heroin .
The captain finally spoke , asking my uncle if he had any drugs .
No .
They started pulling apart the bag and the captain asked again if we had even a small amount ?
No .
Nikon lenses started coming out of the bag , their caps removed and glass elements examined , the collection of my uncle 's entire professional career smudged and twisted and turned before him .
The captain spoke again , saying that the detector never made any mistakes :
If it pointed to us , we had to be carrying drugs .
So , he asked , where were they ?
My uncle looked at me finally .
I could see in his face that he expected The Choice next : between a police bribe that neither of us wanted to pay or detour to a Mexican jail that we might not come out of .
This , really , was why you never ever drive at night in Mexico .
We prepared ourselves to pay for our mistake .
Just then , a swarm of bugs came out of the night .
Big bugs , small bugs — every bug in the lowlands flew towards the sole source of light in the darkness , the bare light bulb hanging above our bags .
Within a few seconds , it was hard to breathe .
In a few more , it was hard to see .
And it was n't just the two Americans who were uncomfortable ; the guards started putting down my uncle 's camera equipment to better swat at the bugs .
The air underneath the hut became unbearable .
A few of the guards started to leave .
Then more .
Soon , we were standing alone with the captain , who was so disgusted he told us to leave .
And as quickly as the danger had risen , it dissipated again .
We packed our bags back into Manuel and drove off into the night , lucky and foolish enough to drive on for a few hours more .
So the AP has been threatening bloggers who quote their stories :
Last week ,
The A.P. took an unusually strict position against quotation of its work , sending a letter to the Drudge Retort asking it to remove seven items that contained quotations from A.P. articles ranging from 39 to 79 words .
Even after an AP spokesman acknowledged that the organization ’s tactics were “ heavy - handed , ” they still did n’t really back off :
Still , Mr. Kennedy said that the organization has not withdrawn its request that Drudge Retort remove the seven items .
And he said that he still believes that it is more appropriate for blogs to use short summaries of A.P. articles rather than direct quotations , even short ones .
“ Cutting and pasting a lot of content into a blog is not what we want to see , ” he said .
“ It is more consistent with the spirit of the Internet to link to content so people can read the whole thing in context . ”
Now , in a slightly ironic twist , the AP is taking content from a blog site .
Namely , mine .
In a news item about the e-mail from Judge Kozinski ’s wife that I posted on this site , an AP article lifted numerous passages .
I counted 154 words quoted from my post .
That ’s almost twice the number of words contained in the most extensive quotation in the Drudge Retort .
So am I going to be an ass and threaten to charge them , or sue them , or demand that they remove the quotes ?
Of course not .
They benefited from my content and I benefited from their link .
Just like when the Drudge Retort quoted them .
And I ’m going to go on quoting AP stories , within fair use guidelines .
And if they start threatening me , I ’ll have to remind them that they did the same to me .
UPDATE : Maybe I should reconsider .
Michelle Malkin says the AP owes me $ 188,750 .
( OK , so Marcy Tiffany actually wrote all the words that were quoted , so maybe they owe her .
But she was my exclusive source !!)
And Glenn Reynolds says : “ Yes , but they ’re news professionals , so they should n’t have to pay for content .
That ’s for everybody else .
. . . ”
UPDATE x2 : Orin Kerr notes that I do n’t own the copyright in Marcy Tiffany ’s e-mail , which is such a great point that I already made it — in the UPDATE above .
But that does n’t change the irony here .
I seriously doubt that the AP paid Ms. Tiffany , or asked her explicit permission to quote from her e-mail — because they knew they did n’t have to .
Their story was a classic example of fair use .
So , if for some bizarre reason she had denied the AP permission to quote her e-mail — which had already been published on my site , and related to a matter of intense public interest — it would n’t have mattered .
They still could have written the same story .
But the AP wants to deny that same fair use right to bloggers .
It ’s not just the AP that gets to take advantage of the concept of fair use .
Bloggers can too .
But the AP is trying to frighten us out of exercising our rights .
We should n’t let it happen .
UPDATE x3 : If bloggers really want to punish the AP , the solution is here .
Spammers have graduated to a new level of evil - tricking eager webmasters into thinking that their hard work has finally paid off .
This excited me at first ( even though I do n't want to sell AiROW ) .
But then I noticed that the e-mail looks very unprofessional .
A quick Google search shows that it is indeed a new scam .
Other people are getting identical e-mails .
Oh well .
My minimum would have been something like $ 10 K anyway , since AiROW is my personal place to play around with web programming .
I want to reply just to see what the scam is .
Why seek phone numbers ?

Journalist Ron Suskind ’s revelation that Saddam Hussein ’s intelligence chief was a prewar intelligence source reporting to the British that Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) adds yet another dimension to the systematic effort by then Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) Director George Tenet to quash any evidence  no matter how credible  that conflicted with the George W. Bush administration ’s propaganda line that Saddam was actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
According to Suskind ’s new book , The Way of the World , Iraqi Director of Intelligence Tahir Jalil Habbush al - Tikriti had been passing on sensitive intelligence to the UK ’s MI6 intelligence service for more than a year before the U.S invasion .
In early 2003 , Suskind writes , Habbush told MI6 official Michael Shipster in Jordan that Saddam had ended his nuclear program in 1991 and his biological weapons program in 1996 .
Habbush explained to the British official that Saddam tried to maintain the impression that he did have such weapons in order to impress Iran .
Suskind writes that the head of MI6 , Richard Dearlove , flew to Washington to present details of the Habbush report to Tenet , who then briefed National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice .
Soon after that , the CIA informed the British that the Bush administration was not interested in keeping the Habbush channel open , according to Suskind ’s account .
Tenet has called the story of the Habbush prewar intelligence a " complete fabrication , " claiming Habbush had " failed to persuade " the British that he had " anything new to offer by way of intelligence . "
His statement actually reinforces Suskind ’s account , however , by indicating that he had simply chosen not to believe Habbush .
" There were many Iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that Iraq had no WMD , " said the statement , " but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the Ba’ath Party line and trying to delay any coalition attack . "
Contradicting Tenet ’s claim that the British did not take the Habbush report seriously , MI6 director Dearlove told Suskind he had asked Prime Minister Tony Blair why he had not acted on the intelligence from Habbush .
Another high - level U.S. source in the last months of the Saddam regime was Saddam ’s foreign minister Naji Sabri .
Tyler Drumheller , the CIA ’s chief of clandestine operations for Europe from 2001 until 2005 , recounts in his book
On the Brink that Sadri was passing on information to an official of a European government in early autumn 2002 indicating that hints of a WMD program were essentially a " Potemkin village " used to impress foreign enemies .
Sidney Blumenthal wrote in September 2007 that two former CIA officers who had worked on the Sabri case identified the foreign intermediary as being France and said he had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the CIA and French intelligence to provide documents on Saddam ’s WMDs .
Drumheller told 60 Minutes that Sabri " told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program . "
On Sept. 17 , 2002 , the CIA officer who had debriefed Sabri in New York , briefed CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin , according to Blumenthal ’s account .
McLaughlin responded that Sabri ’s information was at odds with " our best source . "
That was a reference to " Curveball , " the Iraqi who claimed knowledge of an Iraqi mobile bio-weapons lab program but was later found to be a professional liar .
The next day , Tenet briefed Bush on Sabri ’s intelligence , but Bush rejected it out of hand as " what Saddam wanted him to think . "
French intelligence agents later tapped Sabri ’s telephone conversations and determined that he was telling the truth .
But it was too late .
One of Tenet ’s deputies told the CIA officers , " This is n’t about intelligence .
It ’s about regime change . "
Yet another highly credible U.S. source on the WMD issue in Sept. 2002 was Saad Tawfik , an electrical engineer who had been identified by the CIA as a " key figure in Saddam Hussein ’s clandestine nuclear weapons program . "
The story of the CIA ’s handling of his testimony is told in James Risen ’s State of War .
In early September 2002 , Tawfik ’s sister , who lived in Cleveland , flew to Baghdad with a mission from the CIA to obtain details about Saddam ’s nuclear weapons from her brother .
But when she returned in mid-September , the CIA did n’t like the report from her conversations with the source .
Tawfik told his sister that Saddam ’s nuclear program had been abandoned in 1991 .
When she told him the CIA wanted her to ask such questions as " how advanced is the centrifuge " and " where are the weapons factories , " Tawfik was incredulous that the CIA did n’t understand that there was no such program .
Tawfik ’s was only one of 30 cases of former Iraqi WMD experts who reported through relatives that Saddam had long since abandoned his dreams of WMDs , according to Risen .
Both the Sabri evidence and the evidence from Tawfik and other former Iraqi experts was available to the CIA during the work on the Oct. 2002 National Intelligence Estimates ( NIE ) .
But the CIA ’s Directorate of Intelligence kept all of that evidence out of the NIE process .
No report based on any of that evidence was ever circulated to State , Defense , or the White House , according to Risen and Blumenthal .
The disappearance of all that credible evidence reflected a deliberate decision by Tenet .
The White House Iraq Group had just rolled out its new campaign to create a political climate supporting war in early September , and Tenet knew what was expected of him .
As an analyst who worked on the NIE told Bob Drogin of the Los Angeles Times , " The going - in assumption was that we were going to war , so this NIE was to be written with that in mind . "
That means Tenet ’s account of the CIA ’s role in the WMD issue in his 2007 memoirs completely ignored the credible evidence from Habbush , Sabri , and the former Iraqi specialists that there was no active program , as well as his own role in suppressing it .
Tenet even brazenly claimed that a " very sensitive , highly placed source in Iraq " about whom " little has been publicly said " had " reported that production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place . "
The reporting from the source , continuing through the NIE and beyond , " gave those of us at the most senior level further confidence that our information about Saddam ’s WMD programs was correct . "
Tenet was clearly referring to the reporting coming from the Sabri debriefings , but his description of them was a prevarication .
As Blumenthal reported , they had written a report on Sabri ’s intelligence spelling out his view that there was no active WMD program , but they later discovered that it had been rewritten and given an entirely new preamble asserting that Saddam already possessed chemical and biological weapons and was " aggressively and covertly developing " nuclear weapons .
Tenet  who was a political operator rather than an intelligence professional  had betrayed the CIA ’s mission of providing objective analysis , instead choosing to serve the interests of the Bush administration in preparing the way for war .
It is not difficult to imagine how he would have meekly carried out whatever was asked of him by the White House  even forging a document and leaking it to the media , to buttress the administration ’s case for war .

American big SUVs seem to be of no use in Russia , tractors – those are really a decision for those who want to move themselves across .

Dr Rowan Williams said he wanted to accommodate traditionalists
The Church of England 's vote for women bishops will be an " obstacle " to reconciliation between Anglicans and Catholics , the Vatican has said .
The Church of England 's General Synod voted in favour of consecrating women and against safeguards demanded by traditionalists opposed to the move .
A Church group will now draw up a code of practice to try to reassure critics .
But Roman Catholic leaders believe this goes against the will of Christ , who chose only men as his apostles .
Apostolic tradition
In a statement , Cardinal Walter Kasper , head of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity , said : " For the future , this decision will have consequences for dialogue , which until now had borne much fruit .
" Such a decision is a break with apostolic tradition maintained in all of the Churches in the first millennium , and is therefore a further obstacle for reconciliation between the Catholic Church and the Church of England . "
We can force people out of the Church of England but I think the experience in America says you can't force people out of the Anglican Communion
Gerry O'Brien
Synod member
Analysis : ' Debate rumbles on ' Q&A : Vote over women bishops Guide to Church of England factions
Send us your comments A draft of the code will be put before the General Synod in February .
It may not go far enough to satisfy some 1,300 clergy who had threatened to leave the Church if certain concessions , including allowing male " super - bishops " to cater for those opposing the change , were not met .
A final vote on the issue of women bishops is still several years away .
Further revisions to the Church 's code of practice could happen in 2010 and later a majority of dioceses in England would have to agree to having women as bishops .
That would lead to a further vote by the General Synod in 2011 or 2012 .
' Humiliating women '
Following six hours of debate on Monday , which saw one bishop in tears , the Synod rejected both the super - bishops proposal and the traditionalists ' preferred option of new dioceses for objectors .
During the debate at the University of York , the pressure group Women and the Church said any such compromises would create second - class clergy and institutionalise division .
The Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , said he was deeply opposed to any system which would end up " structurally humiliating women who might be nominated to the episcopate " .
Synod member and traditionalist Gerry O'Brien was hissed during the debate as he alluded to the American and Canadian Churches , from whom traditionalists have split in protest at the ordination of an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
Mr O'Brien said : " We can force people out of the Church of England but I think the experience in America says you can't force people out of the Anglican Communion , because there are a lot of archbishops elsewhere in the world who will be more than ready to provide the support . "
The first women priests in the Church of England were ordained in 1994 .
The Scottish Episcopal Church has already cleared the way for ordaining women bishops , as have churches in the US , Canada , New Zealand and Australia .
But in May , the Vatican issued a decree which vowed to punish attempts in the Roman Catholic church to ordain women priests with automatic excommunication .

What are these ?
( CNN ) -- Pirates took four European tourists hostage after their yacht ran out of fuel off the coast of northern Somalia in the Red Sea 's Gulf of Aden , according to a Somaliland official .
The French Navy has been patrolling the waters off Somalia 's coastline in recent months .
The pirates then took their hostages -- a man , woman , their child and their yacht 's pilot -- into hills around the fishing town of Las Qoray , said Ahmed Yusuf Yasin , vice president of the self - declared Republic of Somaliland .
Somaliland soldiers and local residents were searching for the pirates in an effort to free the hostages , Yasin said .
Las Qoray is in a territory claimed by both Puntland , a self - declared autonomous state , and Somalia .
The two sides clashed over the disputed land earlier this year .
Yasin said he believed the hostages were either French or German .
Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council gave nations new powers to pursue pirates into the waters off Somalia in an effort to combat a new spate of hijackings off the Horn of Africa .
The Gulf of Aden in particular has become a treacherous stretch for shipping in recent months , with more than two dozen pirate attacks reported since the beginning of 2008 , according to the International Maritime Bureau .
Nine of those have been successful hijackings , the bureau said .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German politicians called for tougher privacy laws on Tuesday after officials revealed personal and financial information on millions of Germans was readily available for cash on the Internet .
The scandal over the illegal trading of bank account and phone data came just months after snooping cases at some major German corporations raised alarms .
“ The data scandals unfortunately highlight how urgent this issue is , ” said parliamentarian Sebastian Edathy from the Social Democrats ( SPD ) , who share power with Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) .
“ Parliament must ... find a quick response to these blatant cases of abuse , ” Edathy , who chairs parliament ’s internal affairs committee , told Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung .
He said he would call a meeting of lawmakers and experts to assess tougher data protection laws after the summer break .
Data protection and privacy protection are sensitive issues in a country haunted by domestic spying by the Nazi Gestapo and communist East Germany ’s Stasi secret police .
The new debate was triggered by reports that a call centre employee alerted authorities to a problem with his company ’s data collection practices by handing over data on some 17,000 addresses and bank account details to a privacy protection office in the northern state of Schleswig - Holstein .
Prosecutors have launched an investigation .
On Monday , privacy officials also said they were able to buy 6 million pieces of personal data , including bank and phone details , undercover on the Internet for 850 euros ( $ 1,248 ) .

@Klebert L. Hall : Irrelevant .
I do n't really care about the politics of whether they made the right decisions or not .
( Besides I was n't making digs at US or Soviet policy one way or another . )
My point is modern battlefield commanders are getting less and less time to evaluate more and more data .
They to learn a lot of rules of thum , gain experience and coping skills to filter out the irrelevant data from the crucial data .
As modern military systems become more rapidly evolving and tightly integrated , the commanders are becoming the weak link .
Sure the decision is ultimately binary or over a limited set of options but they are getting less and less time to make them while their high tech tools throw more and more data at them .
Which little piece of data is crucial , which piece of data is actually knowledge , not just information ?
Years ago the science program , Nova , reported on this problem .
They cited rather embarrassing stories about military pilots shutting off most of their avionics and sensing gear just before dog fights because most of it was distracting — even it if could be potentially life threatening .
They 'd just go into combat shooting down things and evading missiles the old fashioned way , by eyeballing it .
DARPA has spent billions for many decades on just this problem .
So far with limited success .
It 's really a problem in intelligence amplification .
For example , suppose a battlefield commander could control a complex military system , like an army or a flight of planes in the same way , martial artists control their own bodies during a fight ?
Almost subconsciously , definitely intuitively and extremely flexible and reactive .
The battlefield commander is the brain that has n't be adequately hooked up to the body yet .
See what I 'm getting at ?
Roboticizing the military is only going to make this problem worse until we figure out how to hook the brain up to the body .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. officials say Israel carried out a large military exercise this month that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities , The New York Times reported on Friday .
Citing unidentified American officials , the newspaper said more than 100 Israeli F - 16 and F - 15 fighters took part in the maneuvers over the eastern Mediterranean and Greece in the first week of June .
It said the exercise appeared to be an effort to focus on long - range strikes and illustrates the seriousness with which Israel views Iran ’s nuclear program .
The newspaper said Israeli officials would not discuss the exercise .
A spokesman for the Israeli military would say only that the country ’s air force “ regularly trains for various missions in order to confront and meet the challenges posed by the threats facing Israel , ” according to the Times .
A Pentagon official who the Times said was briefed on the exercise , said one goal was to practice flight tactics , aerial refueling and other details of a possible strike against Iran ’s nuclear installations and long - range conventional missiles .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said a second goal was to send a clear message that Israel was prepared to act militarily if other efforts to stop Iran from producing bomb - grade uranium fail .
“ They wanted us to know , they wanted the Europeans to know , and they wanted the Iranians to know , ” the Pentagon official said , according to the Times .
“ There ’s a lot of signaling going on at different levels . ”
Several U.S. officials told the newspaper they did not believe Israel had decided to attack Iran or think such a strike was imminent .

The U.N. Security Council has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Iran for defying council demands that it suspend its uranium enrichment program , which could be used to make fuel for power plants or atomic weapons .
Iran has refused to buckle to the sanctions and has spurned previous offers of economic benefits to suspend its uranium enrichment , which it says is to produce fuel for electrical power plants rather than for nuclear weapons .
Iran said Thursday it was ready to negotiate over a new package of economic incentives put forward by major powers seeking to persuade Tehran to curb its nuclear work .
Collision between rocket stages doomed Falcon 1
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : August 6 , 2008
SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket was brought down Saturday night when the vehicle 's first stage collided with the second stage due to residual thrust from the upgraded Merlin engine , the company 's founder said Wednesday .
The Falcon 1 rocket launches on its third flight .

The new Merlin 1C engine was expected to shut down one - and - a - half seconds before the rocket 's two stages separated a little more than two - and - a - half minutes after liftoff .
" There was still some thrust left over after one - and - a - half seconds , and that thrust caused the first stage to be propelled back towards the second stage after stage separation , " said Elon Musk , founder , CEO and chief technical officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp .
" Neither stage exploded , " Musk said .
" They just got a little bit cooked . "
The rocket soared to an altitude of nearly 135 miles before plummeting into the Pacific Ocean east of the launch site on Omelek Island at Kwajalein Atoll .
The company has not recovered any debris .
" It 's really just very sad that we had this small design - related issue , " Musk said .
" If there had been one extra second , this would n't have happened . "
The problem is relatively minor , and a fix will be ready in time for another Falcon 1 launch attempt as early as September .
Parts for the next launch will be transported from the company 's Hawthorne , Calif. , headquarters to Kwajalein within two or three weeks , according to Musk .
But that launch will not carry a Malaysian satellite as planned .
" We always committed to them that we would demonstrate getting to orbit before we flew their vehicle , so we 're sticking to that commitment , " Musk said .
Malaysia 's RazakSat spacecraft will now launch on the Falcon 1's fifth flight , scheduled for late this year or in early 2009 .
Even though SpaceX rockets have failed to reach orbit three times , Musk said the company 's customers are still supportive .
SpaceX continues to receive encouragement from NASA , the Department of Defense and the Operationally Responsive Space program , which owned the primary payload lost Saturday night .
SpaceX also expects to sign contracts for more launches in the next few months , according to Musk .
The company 's backlog now stands at 12 launches , including the upcoming demonstration mission .
Engineers believe there is a straightforward solution to Saturday night 's problem .
Musk said the team will simply add a few seconds of time between the end of the Merlin 's burn and stage separation .
" It 's just changing one timing setting and you 're done , " Musk said .
" If we a rocket on the launch pad tomorrow , we could make this timing change , launch and be OK , at least as far as this issue is concerned . "
The Merlin 1C engine , which includes a new regenerative cooling system , takes longer to shut down than designers expected , Musk said .
The time between Merlin engine cutoff and stage separation was fine for older models of the engine , which included insulating material on the nozzle that burned away in flight .
" The Re - gen engine has a much longer thrust transient than the ablatively - cooled engine , " Musk said .
In the Merlin 1 C 's cooling system , kerosene fuel first flows through cooling channels lining the engine 's chamber and nozzle .
The fuel helps cool the scorching temperatures inside the engine , according to SpaceX .
Pyrotechnic bolts sever the physical connections between the stages and pneumatic pushers are designed to spring the stages apart .
Those components all worked fine during Saturday night 's launch , Musk said .
" It was a very small amount of ( residual ) thrust , but it was just enough to overcome the force of the stage separation pushers , " Musk said .
The pressure inside the engine chamber was only about 10 pounds per square inch , or about one percent of the Merlin 's total thrust .
Musk said such low chamber pressures are difficult to detect on the ground because the ambient atmospheric pressure is nearly 15 psi .
" The thrust that 's seen at sea level is much less than the thrust that 's seen at vacuum .
So it was essentially masked when the tests were done on our test pad at ground level , " Musk said .
Engineers are also examining telemetry data to determine if there were any " near - misses " during the flight , but no such problems have been found yet , according to Musk .
The data indicates the second stage Kestrel engine ignited correctly and the payload fairing jettisoned on time , officials said .
" There are several data points showing a proper start - up before the plasma blow - back destroyed the base of the second stage , " Musk said .
The Merlin 1 C 's performance was better than expected , which is a good sign for the Falcon 9 rocket , according to SpaceX officials .
The Falcon 9 , a much larger vehicle built to compete with Atlas and Delta rockets in the U.S. fleet , will use nine Merlin 1C engines on the first stage and a single Merlin 1C on the second stage .
Musk wants a Falcon 1 to succeed in reaching orbit at least once before SpaceX tries launching a Falcon 9 .
" Better to have learned this lesson now than to learn it at ten times greater scale , " Musk said .
Officials recently completed back - to - back nine - engine test firings of the Falcon 9's first stage , a critical milestone in the vehicle 's development .
The Falcon 9 will be used to launch the Dragon capsule , a craft built by SpaceX to carry crew and cargo to and from the international space station after the space shuttle retires in 2010 .
The Dragon is part of NASA 's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program to procure a new option for cargo transport to the station .
Musk vowed to continue his effort to reduce the cost of access to space .
Despite the company 's " bad luck , " the career entrepreneur said he still believes low - cost space transport can be reliable .
Earlier this week , SpaceX announced a $ 20 million investment from the Founder 's Fund , a technology venture capital firm based in San Francisco .
" That $ 20 million was just to essentially prop up the war chest and ensure that we always have cash on hand for at least three more flights , " Musk said .
" I suspect we 'll actually not even use the $ 20 million investment , but it 's certainly there in a worst - case scenario . "
Musk was careful to describe Saturday night 's problem as a " design error " and not an issue with production or quality assurance .
" We first have to eliminate design issues , " Musk said .
" Only then should the reliability of the vehicle be assessed . "
Linux Foundation 's Jim Zemlin
Source : Linux Foundation
Standing at the headwaters of the ecosystem that is Linux is the Linux Foundation and its executive director Jim Zemlin .
The Linux Foundation was forged out of the merger of the Open Source Development Labs ( OSDL ) and the Free Standards Group in 2007 as a new group with a new mandate for Linux .
Now some 20 months after the Linux Foundation was created , Zemlin is claiming the group is succeeding and argues that it will remain relevant for the next 50 years .
The Linux Foundation 's goal is to promote and develop the Linux platform as it ramps up against Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , Unix and embedded OS vendors .
" Things have gone better than I would have expected , " Zemlin told InternetNews.com .
" We 're in the business of growing the Linux platform and making sure the development process of Linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe . "
The Linux Foundation also has the task of making sure that key developers of Linux such as Linus Torvalds have a neutral place to work .
Torvalds is employed by the Linux Foundation .
" One of the things that make Linux work as a development project is the fact that Linus [ Torvalds ] , who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel , works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project , " Zemlin commented .
Collaboration is one of the key things that the Linux Foundation aims to provide .
In the Linux and open source communities , many projects can be developed successfully without the need for an overarching organizational body .
Then there are projects that actually need the organization that the Linux Foundation can provide .
" The Foundation is a perfect place for people to come together on projects that are difficult , long , require coordination and are n't necessarily strategic from a competitive point of view so vendors want to share the cost , " Zemlin explained .
One such effort that has been spearheaded by the Linux Foundation is the Linuxprinting .org initiative .
Getting printer drivers on Linux has historically been challenging for end users .
Linuxprinting.org is a plug - and - play framework for Linux such that when a user plugs in a printer it will be identified and the latest distribution independent driver can be pulled from the Web site .
The Linux Foundation is also the leader of the Linux Standards Base ( LSB ) , which is a carry - over effort from Zemlin 's FSG .
The LSB aims to provide baseline standards for Linux to make it easier for developers to write applications for multiple Linux distributions .
LSB 4.0 is due out later this year .
At the FSG , Zemlin also was trying to come up with a unified Linux - packaging solution , it 's an initiative the does n't seem to have much momentum at the Linux Foundation .
Today mechanisms and formats for Linux packaging abound and can be a potential barrier for software developers .
According to Zemlin , the issue has little to do with technology .
" Packaging is not a technical issue to solve , " Zemlin argued .
" Everyone just has a different approach , and they can't agree on just one .
It 's really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community , " he said .
" I 'm not the cop here on this stuff , and I would rather see community members coming to a rough consensus rather than us saying what to do . "
Consensus building is something that the Linux Foundation is trying hard to achieve by way of a more open approach to membership and participation than the predecessor organization OSDL had .
" We 've expanded the board to be more participatory and opened up seats for community members , " Zemlin said .
" We have more board - level representation from smaller organizations , and the ability to be on our board is much more affordable than it was under the OSDL . "
Zemlin added that the Foundation has stratified its pricing such that small companies can become members .
Corporate memberships start at $ 5,000 , which is a far cry from the $ 1 million it cost to become a member of the OSDL .
" My goal in the organization is to diversify our revenues so we have a broad base of representation , " Zemlin said .
" So no single entity dominates the organization and I think we 've achieved that . "
Linux Foundation member Novell ( NASDAQ : NOVL ) is pleased with the way things are going as well and in the leadership that Zemlin provides .
" We 're very satisfied with the Linux Foundation , " Justin Steinman , director of product marketing for Novell 's open - platform group , told InternetNews.com .
" They serve a great purpose in bringing together the community , commercial Linux companies and end users , and they represent the interests of each group very well .
We have a very close relationship with Jim , and we 're very pleased with the direction he 's taken the Linux Foundation . "
Oracle , which was not a member of the OSDL , but is a founding member of the Linux Foundation is also pleased with the direction that Zemlin is providing .
In an 2006 interview with InternetNews.com , Wim Coekaerts , vice president of Linux engineering at Oracle , was critical of the OSDL .
" They [ the Linux Foundation ] try to stay neutral and not assume they are the ones owning development , " an Oracle spokesperson told InternetNews.com .
" In general , they have done a good job at trying to get companies to provide specifications and legal assistance to developers .
In general , from what we can see , the development community is neutral to positive about the Linux Foundation . "
Though things are going well so far , Zemlin is n't content to rest on his laurels .
His long - term goal for the Linux Foundation is truly long - term .
" I want to be a thousand percent confident that this organization will be around for the next 30 to 50 years because Linux is n't going away , " Zemlin said .
" It 's everywhere , and there is no doubt that Linux will be an important platform in the future and we 're only at the beginning on the embedded and mobile side .
It will be my screwup if we do n't have an organization that can help coordinate and grow the development of the Linux platform . "
Fines for most red light camera tickets in the city of Los Angeles more than doubled to nearly $ 400 under a newly ordered change , The Times has learned .
The change , which takes effect immediately , will affect thousands of motorists each year who make rolling right turns against red lights -- dubbed “ California stops ” by police -- at 32 camera - equipped intersections .
About eight in 10 camera tickets in the city are for those violations , officials have said .
For years , Los Angeles was the only city in the county that cited rolling right turns under a state Vehicle Code section that carried a $ 159 penalty .
Other agencies put those violations in the same category as running straight through a red light and wrote tickets with a state - established $ 381 fine .
Part of the Los Angeles Police Department ’s rationale for writing the less costly tickets was that slower , rolling right turns were not as dangerous , a department official told The Times earlier this year .
Advertisement
But after a lengthy legal review , officials concluded that the practice used by other cities was correct and that Los Angeles should do the same .
Lt. John Romero , a police spokesman , said late Friday that the new procedure affects officers issuing tickets as well as red light cameras and that it was needed to make enforcement consistent .
Raising money for the cash - strapped city was not part of the motivation , he said .
“ This was a recommendation a year ago , before we were in this fiscal crisis , ” he said .
“ It just takes a long time to get that city attorney opinion .
It ’s the correct section to cite . ”
Advertisement
“ We do not calculate revenue , ” he said .
“ This is a traffic safety program . ”
Official estimates were not immediately available , but it appears the change could generate as much as an additional $ 2 million a year , based on past ticket patterns .
The city issued about 30,000 camera tickets last year .
Though such areas as Culver City have reaped sizable profits from photo enforcement , Los Angeles ’ program has struggled to break even .
It appeared the city might never recover some $ 2 million in construction costs and past deficits , city analysts recently told The Times .
That could change .
Advertisement
The city ’s share of revenue from most of its camera tickets will now jump from about $ 58 to roughly $ 150 .
The rest goes to state and county agencies .
Using cameras to catch rolling right turns has been a point of contention , even among some traffic engineers and law enforcement officers .
A primary selling point of red light cameras has been reducing potentially deadly broadside collisions .
Some cities with red light cameras opt not to focus on right turns , saying they tend to cause fewer and less serious accidents .
However , a Times review earlier this year found that in Los Angeles and at least a half dozen other cities in the county , right turn violations were driving the majority of photo tickets and revenue .
Advertisement
The addition of right turn enforcement by the city ’s red light cameras two years ago was what led to officials noticing the discrepancy between officer - issued tickets and camera - issued tickets .
The city did not cite right turns with a previous camera system , Romero said .
But with a new vendor , Nestor Traffic Systems , and upgraded technology , tickets were added for right turns , he said .
Officials noticed some LAPD officers writing up similar right turn violations under different state code sections , which carried different fines .
Initially , Romero said , the city attorney ’s office said using the section with the lower fine appeared to be permissible .
But a recent , more detailed formal opinion concluded that the section on basic red light running , which carries the $ 381 fine , should be cited .

Those tickets have already begun to be issued and should start arriving in the mail any day , he said .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Merrill Lynch booked its fourth - straight quarterly loss Thursday , this time losing nearly $ 5 billion , as the nation 's largest brokerage was forced to once again take massive writedowns .
Merrill said it lost $ 4.9 billion overall .
On a continuing operations basis , it lost $ 4.6 billion , or $ 4.95 a share , down from a profit of $ 2.01 billion , or $ 2.24 a share a year ago .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting the company to report a loss of just over $ 1.8 billion , or $ 1.91 a share on this basis .
The company has now lost more than $ 19.2 billion in the past twelve months , making it one of the hardest hit companies during the credit crisis roiling the nation 's big financial services firms .
Merrill ( MER , Fortune 500 ) shares plunged about 6 % after hours , nearly wiping out the stock 's 10 % gain in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday .
Driving the loss was yet another round of writedowns .
Merrill took a $ 4.8 billion mark on its mortgage - related portfolio , a $ 2.9 billion writedown due to its exposure to the recently downgraded bond insurers Ambac ( ABK ) and MBIA ( MBI ) , $ 1.7 billion in its investment portfolio of U.S. banks and $ 348 million related to leveraged loans .
That surpassed the nearly $ 6 billion total that some analysts were anticipating heading into this week 's results .
" Is the company a good franchise ?
It 's a very good franchise , " said Brad Hintz , senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co .
" The problem you have is it will be a long time until that balance sheet is clean . "
Those marks hit Merrill 's global markets and investment banking divisions particularly hard , as it suffered a pre-tax loss of $ 8.56 billion in the quarter from continuing operations .
Merrill 's global wealth management business remained profitable , but its earnings fell 16 % from a year ago .
" Our core franchise continues to perform well despite the extremely challenging market environment , " said John Thain , Merrill 's chairman and chief executive officer in a written statement .
Merrill also took a pre-tax charge of $ 445 million due to staffing cuts .
During the quarter , the company said it trimmed its ranks by 3,100 , slightly more than it anticipated when it first announced the planned cuts in April .
At the end of the quarter , Merrill 's total employee count stood at 60,000 .
The New York City - based firm also revealed that it would sell its 20 % stake in the media outlet Bloomberg LP for $ 4.43 billion to Bloomberg Inc. , confirming long - running speculation that it would sell assets in order to raise capital .
Merrill added it reached a tentative agreement over the sale of a controlling interest in the financial services administrator Financial Data Services for more than $ 3.5 billion .
Ongoing deterioration in the housing market , mounting troubles in the economy and pressure from regulators has prompted brokerages , Wall Street firms and banks of all sizes to raise additional capital .
But Merrill said it is holding onto its 49 % stake in asset manager BlackRock ( BLK , Fortune 500 ) .
Larry Fink , BlackRock 's CEO , revealed earlier Thursday during his company 's quarterly earnings release that the two firms would stay together .
BlackRock reported a 23 % increase in its earnings , beating expectations .
Thain , just 8 months into his tenure as CEO , told analysts during a conference call Thursday evening that the company was in a " comfortable spot " in terms of capital , following the two sales .
But Merrill 's latest loss raised a red flag for one rating agency .
Moody 's downgraded Merrill 's senior long - term debt rating Thursday evening following Merrill 's report .
" Management 's options to sell assets or raise more common equity to offset unexpected losses are now reduced given the difficult industry and capital markets environment , " wrote Peter Nerby , a senior vice president at Moody 's in a note .
Thain , the former NYSE Euronext CEO and Goldman Sachs alum , did not rule out the sale of its stake in BlackRock in the future should the company need to raise additional capital .
But he suggested , however , that the company would probably consider alternatives before making such a move .
" There are , in fact , other options on our balance sheet , " said Thain .
Merrill is the latest financial firm to deliver second - quarter results this week .
Both JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , which reported earlier Thursday , and regional bank Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , saw their profits plunge during the quarter , but still managed to stay ahead of Wall Street 's expectations .
That news helped drive their shares , as well as the rest of the battered financial sector , higher the past two days .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) is expected to follow Merrill with its own ugly performance on Friday .
Analysts expect the nation 's largest bank by assets to lose more than $ 2.8 billion , or 61 cents per share .

Researchers at the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center and the VCU Institute of Molecular Medicine have published findings that implicate a new chemoprevention gene therapy ( CGT ) for preventing and treating pancreatic cancer , one of the most lethal and treatment - resistant forms of cancer .
In the July issue of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics , the researchers showed that combining a dietary agent with a gene - delivered cytokine effectively eliminates human pancreatic cancer cells in mice displaying sensitivity to these highly aggressive and lethal cancer cells .
Cytokines are a category of proteins that are secreted into the circulation and can affect cancer cells at distant sites in the body , including metatases .
The cytokine used in this study was melanoma differentiation associated gene - 7 / interleukin - 24 , known as mda-7/ IL - 24 .
The dietary agent , perillyl alcohol ( POH ) , was combined with mda-7 / IL - 24 , which is already used in other cancer treatments .
POH is found in a variety of plants , including citrus plants , and has been well - tolerated by patients who have received it in clinical studies .
The results indicated that the CGT approach not only prevented pancreatic cancer growth and progression , but it also effectively killed established tumors , thereby displaying profound chemopreventive and therapeutic activity .
Paul B. Fisher , Ph.D. , was principal investigator of the study , which was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Samuel Waxman Cancer Foundation .
Fisher , who recently joined VCU from Columbia University , is professor and interim chair of VCU 's department of human and molecular genetics ; holds the Thelma Newmeyer Corman chair in cancer research at Massey ; and is director of the VCU Institute of Molecular Medicine .
" Our hypothesis was that certain non -toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda -7 / IL - 24 and be safe for human use , " said Fisher .
" We are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer , and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials . "
Pancreatic cancer has a five - year survival rate of less than 5 percent , and currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy for it .
About 37,000 new cases are diagnosed in the United States each year .

But Mr. Davies presses his grown - up themes with a whisper and a laugh , not a shout .
No one actually has sex on screen in “ Doctor Who . ”
And when Captain Jack makes an appearance ( only rarely , since he now has his own show ) , his sexuality is an issue only in that his constant , equal - opportunity flirting tends to annoy his colleagues , busy as they are fighting intergalactic evil .
“ He takes ‘ Doctor Who ’ and pushes the envelope the whole time , not in terms of taste and decency but in terms of ideas and emotional intelligence , the size of feeling and epic stroke of narrative breadth , ” said Jane Tranter , the BBC ’s head of fiction .
She said that no one at the BBC had ever had a problem with Captain Jack or with any of Mr. Davies ’s plotlines .
“ How ridiculous would it be that you would travel through time and space and only ever find heterosexual men ? ” Ms. Tranter said .
Hiring Mr. Davies to remake the beloved but , finally , creaky old series was a daring , even counterintuitive move by the BBC .
First there was the worry that “ Doctor Who ” had already had its day , that it belonged to another era altogether .
But more than that , Mr. Davies was a risk taker with no obvious science - fiction credentials other than a fanatical lifelong devotion to “ Doctor Who ” and a headful of ideas about where to take it next .
At the time , in 2003 , he was best known for “ Queer as Folk , ” a 1999 series that chronicled the lives of a group of hedonistic gay men in Manchester with a frankness never shown before on mainstream television .
( It was later remade in the United States . )
“ Queer as Folk ” was revolutionary not only because of its racy subject matter but also because of the matter - of - fact way it presented its characters : ordinary people , if unusually attractive and sexually frisky , who happened to be gay .
Criticism of its content tended to be overshadowed by admiration for its wit and verve and for the mature fun of its story lines .
Mr. Davies used the same philosophy when Captain Jack came on the scene in “ Doctor Who ”  make it entertaining , not didactic .
“ I thought , ‘ It ’s time you introduce bisexuals properly into mainstream television , ’ ” he said , laughing .

Enlarge Barry Gossage / NBAE / Getty Images Shaquille O'Neal is the most successful draft pick of the lottery era .
so why did the Magic let him walk ?
Ever wonder who 's the best player ever selected fifth overall in the NBA draft ?
Or at No. 13 ?
Look no further .
Below is a comprehensive statistical look at the best selections at each spot since the dawn of the lottery in 1985 ( individual stats depict year player was drafted and career average ) :
No. 1 overall picks
In the lottery era , two players picked have separated themselves from the pack : Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan .
It should be noted that neither turned around his franchise without some luck .
O'Neal was the first of two consecutive No. 1 picks for Orlando in 1992 and ' 93 ( the Magic took Chris Webber in ' 93 before swapping him for Penny Hardaway ) ; the Spurs were only in the lottery in 1997 because of an injury to franchise center ( and 1987 No. 1 pick ) David Robinson .
Although O'Neal led Orlando to the 1995 NBA Finals , he was outplayed by Hakeem Olajuwon ( the last No. 1 pick of the pre-lottery era ) .
Most of Shaq 's success came in Los Angeles , where he starred on underachieving teams until the arrival of coach Phil Jackson .
Best pick : Shaquille O'Neal , Orlando , 1992
Top career assists Name Yr. APG LeBron James '03 6.6 Allen Iverson ' 96 6.3 Chris Webber ' 93 4.2 Brad Daugherty ' 86 3.7 Larry Johnson '91 3.3
Top career rebounders Name Yr. RPG Dwight Howard ' 04 12.2 Tim Duncan ' 97 11.8 Shaquille O'Neal ' 92 11.5 David Robinson ' 87 10.6 Elton Brand ' 99 10.2
Top career scorers Name Yr. PPG Allen Iverson ' 96 27.7 LeBron James '03 27.3 Shaquille O'Neal ' 92 25.2 Tim Duncan ' 97 21.6 David Robinson ' 87 21.1
No. 2 overall picks
The second selection has been fertile ground for point guards .
The two best No. 2 picks since 1985 are a pair of points who grew up playing on the same playgrounds in Oakland , Calif . -- Gary Payton and Jason Kidd .
Best pick : Gary Payton , Seattle , 1990
Top career assists Name Yr. APG Jason Kidd ' 94 9.3 Gary Payton ' 90 6.7 Mike Bibby ' 98 6.2 Kenny Anderson '91 6.1 Steve Francis ' 99 6.0
Top career rebounders Name Yr. RPG Emeka Okafor ' 04 10.8 Marcus Camby ' 96 9.7 Tyson Chandler '01 9.0 Alonzo Mourning ' 92 8.5 Antonio McDyess '95 7.7
Top career scorers Name Yr. PPG Kevin Durant '07 20.3 Steve Francis ' 99 18.1 Alonzo Mourning ' 92 17.1 Mike Bibby '98 16.6 Gary Payton ' 90 16.3
No. 3 overall picks
The best No. 3 picks have had their careers derailed .
In 1993 and ' 94 , Penny Hardaway and Grant Hill had size , athleticism , vision and scoring instincts .
Hardaway was first team All - NBA by his second season , when the Orlando Magic reached the NBA Finals .
Hill made first team All - NBA in his third season .
But injuries derailed both players .
Still , no other No. 3 pick has approached the peaks of Hardaway and Hill .
We 'll give Hardaway a very slight edge based on his twice being named first - team All - NBA .
Best pick : Penny Hardaway , Golden State , 1993 ( traded to Orlando )
Top career assists Name Yr. APG Deron Williams '05 8.1 Baron Davis ' 99 7.2 Chauncey Billups ' 97 5.5 Grant Hill ' 94 5.0 Penny Hardaway '93 5.0

No. 4 overall picks
Chris Paul has played only three NBA seasons , but he has already staked a solid claim to being the best No. 4 pick in the lottery era .
CP3 was runner - up to Kobe Bryant in a 2008 MVP race that many believed he should have won .
Stephon Marbury , however , has averaged 19.7 points and 7.8 assists in 823 career games .
Only four NBA players have averaged at least 19 points and seven assists during the course of their careers -- Oscar Robertson , Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas are the others .
Best pick : Chris Paul , New Orleans , 2005

No. 5 overall picks
With all of the talented players selected at this spot over the years , it 's difficult to choose the best .
We 're going with Dwyane Wade ( '03 ) , based on his performance as MVP of the 2006 Finals .
He beats out Scottie Pippen ( ' 87 ) , a six - time NBA champion and the best wing defender of his generation .
Kevin Garnett ( ' 95 ) has won an MVP award and a title , and he's one of three players in NBA history with career averages of 20 points , 11 rebounds and four assists per game , joining Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor .
Best pick : Dwyane Wade , Miami , 2003
Top career assists Name Yr. APG Raymond Felton '05 6.6 Dwyane Wade '03 6.5 Scottie Pippen ' 87 5.2 Kevin Garnett ' 95 4.4 Vince Carter 9.8 4.2
Top career rebounders Name Yr. RPG Kevin Garnett ' 95 11.2 Juwan Howard ' 94 6.8 LaPhonso Ellis ' 92 6.5 Scottie Pippen ' 87 6.4 Tony Battie ' 97 5.6
Top career scorers Name Yr. PPG Dwyane Wade '03 23.9 Vince Carter ' 98 23.8 Ray Allen ' 96 21.1 Mitch Richmond ' 88 21.0 Kevin Garnett '95 20.4
No. 6 overall picks
Brandon
Roy might well be on his way to becoming the top No. 6 pick in the lottery era .
To this point , though , Antoine Walker has clearly been the best .
Best pick : Antoine Walker , Boston , 1996
Top career assists Name Yr. APG Kenny Smith ' 87 5.5 Brandon Roy '06 5.0 Antoine Walker ' 96 3.5 Hersey Hawkins ' 87 2.9 Tom Gugliotta ' 92 2.8

No. 7 overall picks
Chris Mullin had the sweetest lefty stroke our eyes have seen , but Kevin Johnson , who fittingly wore jersey No. 7 , was as lethal as any point guard before injuries derailed his career .
Among players selected at No. 7 , only KJ , Chris Paul , Isiah Thomas , Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson have career averages of 17 points and nine assists per game .
Top pick : Kevin Johnson , Cleveland , 1987

No. 8 overall picks
Rudy Gay has a chance to distinguish himself at the No. 8 spot if he can continue to develop .
However , for now , we give the nod to Ron Harper ( ' 86 ) over Detlef Schrempf ( ' 85 ) , Vin Baker ( ' 93 ) and Andre Miller ( ' 99 ) .

Tracy McGrady , Dirk Nowitzki , Amare Stoudemire and Shawn Marion were each drafted in this slot .

No. 12 overall picks
Mookie Blaylock , a six - time All - Defense selection , is clearly the cream of the crop at the No. 12 spot .
A special mention goes to Muggsy Bogues , who 's the shortest player in NBA history , at 5 - foot - 3 , but ranks 16th in career assists .
Best pick : Mookie Blaylock , New Jersey , 1989
Top career assists Name Yr. APG Muggsy Bogues ' 87 7.6 Mookie Blaylock ' 89 6.7 Greg Anthony ' 91 4.0 Khalid Reeves ' 94 3.2 John Williams ' 86 2.9

Perhaps some are satisfied the FBI has proved beyond a “ reasonable doubt ” that Ivins and no one else was responsible for the post 9/11 Anthrax attacks on Democrats and “ liberal ” media , and that he killed himself to avoid prosecution .
However , Ivins is n’t being autopsied , and the FBI was not ready to present evidence to a grand jury ; they claim they were going to sit down with him and his attorney and present it to them !
As soon as Ivins was dead , a campaign was begun of anonymous leaks to corporate news media , who regurgitated them without questions .
This has manufactured an appearance of involvement by Ivins , just as it did with the FBI ’s leaks regarding Steven Hatfill and ABC ’s reporting on “ bentonite ” and the false Iraq connection .
So far , the FBI has ignored the many questions being raised in other media reports , but it looks they will have to deal with a Congressional investigation .
Many of Ivins colleagues and other experts believe Ivins could n’t have created the Anthrax used in the attacks , and some of them believe the FBI ’s harassment drove him to kill himself .
For a review of problems with the FBI ’s case against Ivins , see here :

And , of course , there are the really obvious questions the FBI is avoiding , such as why were White House staff put on Cipro on 9/11 , who told journalist Richard Cohen to start taking it , and who tried to frame Ayaad Assaad for the Anthrax attacks , before the outbreak even occurred ?
Brixton , one of the UK ’s biggest developers , said almost 20 per cent of its £ 2.2 billion property portfolio was vacant , while Segro , its rival , is to reveal next week that the tax has cost the company about £ 2 million to date , following Brixon ’s admission of a £ 1.5 million deficit .

Wednesday , August 20 , 2008 MOSCOW — Russian security officials threatened retaliation against Israel for its weapons exports to Georgia including eight different aerial drones .
Russian Deputy Chief of Staff Col. Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn said Israel supplied at least eight different models of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) to Georgia .
Nogovitsyn said Israel has also sold a range of weapons and sought to export main battle tanks to Georgia .
" We asked Israel not to sell offensive weapons to a hostile neighboring state , but they said they 're a sovereign state , " a diplomatic source said .
" Well , Israel should n't be surprised if we sell offensive weapons to Israel 's neighbors . "
Already , Russia , in wake of its military victory over Georgia , has scheduled a summit with Syria to discuss offensive weapons sales , the sources said .
Syrian President Bashar Assad was scheduled to meet Putin in Moscow on Aug. 20 .
Also In This Edition Amazon.com Widgets Tbilisi has asserted that Israel continued to ship weapons and platforms to Georgia throughout the Russian war .
But Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili reported delays in the supply of Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles to his country .
Tbilisi has asserted that Israel continued to ship weapons and platforms to Georgia throughout the Russian war .
But Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili reported delays in the supply of Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles to his country .
" The Israeli weapons have proved very effective , " Saakashvili told a news conference on Aug. 13 .
So far , the diplomatic sources said , Putin has been careful to limit Russian military sales to Iran and Syria to defensive systems .
In 2007 , they said , Putin , who remains in charge of defense export policy , vetoed efforts by the Defense Ministry and the state - owned arms agency Rosoboronexport to sell the Iskander - E long - range rocket to Syria .
" Putin will now offer Iskander to Syria , " another Russian source said .
" Whether this will be a serious offer or something just to scare the Israelis we 'll know in another few months . "
In December 2007 , Israel agreed not to sign new contracts for offensive weapons to Georgia .
But the Israeli Defense Ministry , supported by the United States , maintained it would honor existing arms deals with Tbilisi .
" We told the Israelis that this was a very unwise move and that Russians were being killed because of Georgia 's policy , " the Russian source said .
" They did n't take us seriously , probably because they were encouraged by the United States . "
" In 2007 , Israeli experts trained Georgian commandos in Georgia , and there were plans to supply heavy weaponry , electronic weapons , tanks and other arms at a later date , " Nogovitsyn told a news conference on Aug. 19 .
" But the deal did n't work out . "
Officials said Moscow 's assertion was based on a review of weapons and military installations captured in Russia 's invasion of Georgia .
They said Israel also trained Georgia 's military , particularly its special forces .
At the news conference , Nogovitsyn did not identify the Israeli UAVs .
Israel has acknowledged the sale of UAVs to Tbilisi .
The Russian deputy chief said Israel also exported bombs , mines and mine - clearing systems to Georgia .
He said the systems were comprised of munitions that could explode landmines .
In late 2007 , Israel agreed to end the sale of offensive military systems to Georgia .
The decision by the Israeli Defense Ministry did not affect weapons already ordered by Tbilisi .
On Aug. 20 , Russia and Syria were scheduled to begin a two - day summit meant to focus on defense and military cooperation .
Syrian President Bashar Assad was scheduled to meet Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in what officials said could result in arms sales to Damascus .
" The significant military aid provided by Israel to Georgia in its war against Russia will affect in the future — probably in the near future — relations between Russia and Israel , as well as Russia 's attitude toward Arab states , " an unidentified Russian analyst said in an interview to Syrian state television on the eve of Assad 's visit .
" Russia will reassess its relations with Israel , and it is likely that Moscow will decide to increase its military aid to Arab countries in conflict with Israel , including Syria . "

Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania 3915 Union Deposit Road # 223
Harrisburg , PA 17109
www.lppa.org
For Immediate Release : July 21 , 2008
Contact : Doug Leard ( Media Relations ) or
Michael Robertson ( Chair ) at 1-800-R-RIGHTS / chair@lppa.org
Harrisburg , PA - Pennsylvania gun owners breathed a sigh of relief at the Heller vs. DC Supreme Court ruling , but the Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania ( LPPa ) warns that major threats to gun rights still exist .
One such threat is REAL ID , the federal mandate turning driver 's licenses into national ID cards .
The long - term plan for REAL ID is to force its biometric ID functions on federal , state , local and private entities for all transactions .
Thus , ID confirmation by a distant bureaucracy becomes permission for essential daily activities including banking , doctor visits , transit , school attendance and purchases -- including guns .
Do you want to risk your gun rights on the appointment of someone opposed to our second amendment rights as Secretary of Homeland Security ?
" The very thought that the sale of firearms and ammunition could be stopped based on some political agenda in Washington is frightening , " remarked LP Activist Mark Crowley .
" We saw the disastrous consequences of such an agenda in New Orleans during Katrina when some police abandoned their posts leaving citizens defenseless and criminals armed .
We must never put Pennsylvanians into a position where they can only hope that distant Washington bureaucrats will do the right thing . "
“ The implementation of REAL ID presents a significant threat to gun ownership in the United States of America . " added Michael Robertson , LPPa Chair .
By participating in REAL ID , Pennsylvanians will be subjected to scrutiny by a host of federal agencies with every swipe of a REAL ID card .
This is de facto gun registration , only worse .
Once a gun buyer is identified , other information such as military service , purchases , rentals , travel , and medical history will be easily cross-referenced and subjected to interpretation .
It 's inevitable that politicized standards will emerge that can be used to deny Pennsylvanians the right to keep and bear arms -- everyone except violent criminals and politicians ' bodyguards .
LPPa Media Relations Chair , Doug Leard , added , “ A few years ago when the NICS [ National InstaCheck System ] computer system crashed , no one could be validated for a gun purchase .
A political agenda is one thing and bureaucratic incompetence is another .
When a state submits to REAL ID , it submits its citizens to the possibility of being denied not just gun purchases , but ATM cash , credit card purchases and even a critical prescription pickup .
Pennsylvania must emphatically reject REAL ID . "
The LPPa urges Pennsylvanians to contact their state legislators and instruct them to support state House Bill 1351 and state Senate Bill 1220 .
Be wary of other recently introduced legislation such as H.B. 2537 that claims to oppose REAL ID , but ignores the central issue of biometric data collection of Pennsylvanians .
Despite the Heller case , the anti-gun movement will continue to seek alternatives to eliminate our gun rights .
REAL ID provides them an unguarded backdoor .
Let 's nail it shut in Pennsylvania .
The Libertarian Party is the third largest political party in Pennsylvania and the United States .
More than 200,000 people across the country are registered Libertarians , and Libertarians serve in hundreds of elected offices .

McCain's Supreme Court position , in pop-ups
Joe Biden 's ability to out straight talk the faux - maverick is definitely an asset for him .
He sees what 's important right now and is n't afraid to put it plainly .
Biden said U.S. President George W. Bush ’s two conservative appointees — Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito — have pushed the nation ’s highest court far to the right .
This , Biden charged , has threatened civil liberties and set back efforts to desegregate schools and obtain equal pay for women .
“ Other than ending the war in Iraq , the single most significant thing that Barack Obama can do — and I hope I ’ll be able to he help him — will be to determine who the next members of the Supreme Court are going to be . ”
... During the next four years , Biden said , citing life expectancy estimates , there may be as many as three vacancies on the nine - member court .
“ It ’s not merely the woman ’s right to choose ( to have an abortion ) which is at stake , ” Biden told a mostly female crowd of several hundred people .
“ It ’s whether or not you are going to be able to have a fair shot at a fair wage , ” Biden said .
“ It ’s whether or not you are going to able to demand that you are treated equally in every aspect of your life . ”

A widget is anything that can be embedded within a page of HTML , i.e. a web page .
A widget adds some content to that page that is not static .
Generally widgets are third party originated , though they can be home made .
Widgets are also known as modules , snippets , and plug-ins .
I have a widget that I have been using recently on the top of Comics Legends and Lore , just under my header .
It is provided by a unique startup company , Entrecard .
The idea is that you create a “ business card ” for your blog which you use to advertise on other blogs .
It ’s free and uses Entrecard credits as a currency , which you earn through a variety of activities .
Each day you will see the business card of a blog that I have chosen to advertise on Comics Legends and Lore .
Click the card and you will be redirected to that blog .
I try to choose quality blogs , ones that I have visited and enjoyed .
Some may have themes and views similar to my own , some may be radical or extreme .
Consider the link one teabag of a Celestial Seasonings sample pack .
You may or may not like it , but it 's only one !
However , as there is often a delay of several days from approval to posting , I have no idea what may have been posted on the site for that day .
It 's a bit like mushrooms , you think they may be safe , but you could be turned into a frog !
As a young company Entrecard is experiencing some growing pains .
Recently some Entrecard bloggers have been crying " foul " in the name of censorship .
They even claim that their actions ( bashing the founders of Entrecard ) are being done to protect all bloggers from the clutches of the censors .
I always distrust anyone who claims they are acting in my behalf , especially if I have not been consulted .
Entrecard members are a loose social network of bloggers .
Some post personal diaries , some post child rearing tips , others rant against government , while others claim they can make you rich , or direct you to those hard to find " Internet coupons " .
The one common link is that they are trying to improve their blogs , generate traffic to their sites and maybe discover some interesting sites for their own enjoyment .
The group bashing the site reminds me of children or young adults acting out to gain attention .
Behavior that may be tolerated in a college bar would not be tolerated in a family restaurant or a high ticket club .
I may think that my 20 second belch , the result of many long nights of practice , has the same performance rights as the held note of an opera Diva or long cord of a jazz musician .
The verbal belching and farting of these would be blogging martyrs is simply boorish behavior .
I may admire the reporter willing to sit in jail rather than betray his or her sources .
However I reserve the right to abhor their actions if they are protecting a child molester .
For me , symbolism takes second place to the social good .
The thing for any future Entrecard member to realize is that freedom of expression exists .
The individual blogs are not banned .
You can enroll your site dedicated to bathroom humor as easily as your neighbor can enroll their site dedicated to long , tall , fishing tales .
However , crude behavior in the forums is a no - no . "
So I practice my belching in the privacy of my own home , or at the backyard barbeque with appreciative friends ( whose wives have left to admire the gardens ) .
I behave myself in restaurants , because I value my right to eat the owner 's great food more than my freedom to sing my song .
If you are a blogger check out Entrecard .
Click my widget and sign up .
Just be forewarned .
You will be expected to behave like a reasonably responsible adult !

Must be the buzz : Koala dozes off ... up an electricity pylon
There 's your natural habitat and there 's making do - as this koala has .
Normally these cuddly mammals are happiest munching on a eucalypt leaf or two in - between naps in the tree canopy but with no gum trees 20 km in one direction and 6 km in another , this little fella was happy to get his head down up an electricity pylon .
Scroll down for more
Time out : A male koala grabs a nap in - between marking out his territory for females .
With no gum tree in sight he clambers up an electricity pylon and gets his head down before , bottom , waking from his slumber
And sleep is something koalas just love to do , often notching up between 16 and 18 hours a day as they have a very low metabolic rate .
This male koala is believed to have been out in the open close to Gunnedah , New South Wales , Australia , marking his territory while on the lookout for girlfriends .
The males head out on regular trips to mark out circles and claim the female koalas inside .
' If you think it is out in the middle of nowhere , he knows where he is going .
But they do mark their territory looking for females , ' said wildlife expert Nancy Small .
' He is setting his groundwork up for breeding , there will be a lot of koalas travelling around here and they travel in circles and each circle takes in so many females . '
' I think you will find this koala will be fine , I have only heard of one being electrocuted and he was in a big power plant .
' They do travel , they travel from area to area , they can travel quite far and they go up into any tree or anything that 's high and have a rest . '
But as these pictures show , this sleepy chap had just about had his fill of sleep and even managed to pose for the camera - albeit with eyes shut .

We just wrapped up 8 days in Vermont : a week in Brattleboro plus a crazy day shuttling between Montpelier and Burlington .
Vermont absolutely stole our hearts .
Here ’s how Vermont compares to other places we ’ve lived and traveled :
In Virginia , the signboards in front of the churches say : “ God Bless Our Troops . ”
In Vermont , the church signs say : “ Peace on Earth . ”
In Vancouver , there ’s a Starbucks coffee shop on every corner .
In Vermont , there ’s at least one bookstore on every block .
In Texas , people tended to be extremely large , or emaciated and ( in the case of women ) surgically “ enhanced . ”
( Dallas leads the country for plastic surgery and breast implants after Los Angeles . )
In Vermont , people were n’t huge , and they were n’t scrawny .
They looked like normal , healthy , active people .
The 2004 Howard Dean presidential campaign makes more sense after being in Vermont .
People seemed aware and involved .
Every community we spent any time in has a food co-op .
It is illegal to idle your car because of the environmental damage .
The bumper stickers made me smile instead of frown .
There seems to be huge community support for local Vermont food producers .
It is incredibly easy to find healthy food and vegetarian meals .
Billboards are outlawed .
Vermont has a kind of Gortex / tie-dyed / locavore / mountain - climbing / veg-positive / tread - lightly - on - the - earth feeling that reminded us of Vancouver in a very , very good way .
Vermont is the first place we ’ve visited on the trip that felt like home .
It is the first place I could imagine living .
It is definitely the first place where I feel like , if we stayed , we might “ fit in . ”
At dinner on Thursday night , I was chatting with our server , who turned out to be a transplant to Vermont from Massachusetts , about the secret of Vermont : Vermonters eat like kings .
The quality of life is spectacular .
The state is beautiful .
How do they keep everyone else out ?
“ The winters , ” he replied .
And laughed .
He continued that the cost of living is high but wages are generally low .
The people are wonderful partly because it is a hard place to live : the people who stay are really committed to being there .
( Any Vermonters reading this is welcome to weigh in and let us know how accurate you find his assessment to be ! )
We are n’t ready to stop traveling yet .
We ’ve had our fill of high living costs .
And , I ’ve fulfilled more than my lifetime quota of harsh winters .
But we still fell in love with Vermont : the wonderful people we met , the food , the culture , the attitudes .
We wo n’t be making a permanent move to Vermont soon , but I really hope we can spend more time there in the future .
Rock Port , Mo. , has an unusual crop : wind turbines .
The four turbines that supply electricity to the small town of 1,300 residents make it the first community in the United States to operate solely on wind power .
" That 's something to be very proud of , especially in a rural area like this — that we 're doing our part for the environment , " said Jim Crawford , a natural resource engineer at the University of Missouri Extension in Columbia .
A map published by the U.S. Department of Energy indicates that northwest Missouri has the state 's highest concentrations of wind resources and contains a number of locations that are potentially suitable for utility - scale wind development .
The four turbines that power Rock Port are part of a larger set of 75 turbines across three counties that are used to harvest the power of wind .
" We 're farming the wind , which is something that we have up here , " Crawford said .
" The payback on a per- acre basis is generally quite good when compared to a lot of other crops , and it's as simple as getting a cup of coffee and watching the blades spin . "
And the turbines have another benefit besides produces clean energy : MU Extension specialists said that the Missouri wind farms will bring in more than $ 1.1 million annually in county real estate taxes , to be paid by Wind Capital Group , a wind energy developer based in St. Louis .
" This is a unique situation because in rural areas it is quite uncommon to have this increase in taxation revenues , " said Jerry Baker , and MU Extension community development specialist .
Landowners can also benefit by leasing part of their property for wind turbines .
The turbines will also provide savings to rural electric companies and will provide electric service for at least 20 years , the anticipated lifetime of the turbines .
" Anybody who is currently using Rock Port utilities can expect no increase in rates for the next 15 to 20 years , " Crawford said .
Baker added that the turbines could also attract tourists to the area .

101 Amazing Earth Facts
Top 10 Emerging Environmental Technologies
To celebrate Father ’s Day , we ’ve compiled a list of TV ’s best and worst dads .
While these dads are completely fictitious , these men have had a heavy influence on the way Americans approach fatherhood .
We ’ve got representatives from the “ aw shucks ” 1950s dad to the bumbling idiot dad of the 21st Century .
Did we miss a dad you think should have been on the list ?
Got a beef with the ones that made the list ?
Make yourself heard in the comments .
TV’s Best Dads
Andy Taylor - The Andy Griffith Show
As a single dad , Sheriff Taylor did a fantastic job raising his son Opie .
In every episode , Sheriff Andy taught his son and the rest of America one important lesson - do the right thing .
Not only did Andy teach little Opie important life lessons , he also made sure to spend plenty of time with him on fishin ’ trips .
Homer Simpson - The Simpsons
I originally put Homer on the worst TV dad list because he ’s a perfect example of television ’s now ubiquitous portrayal of the bumbling idiot dad .
But I had a change of heart .
Sure , he is a poor example of physical health .
Sure , he constantly abuses Bart through strangulation .
But at the end of the day , the man would do anything for his kids .
One of my favorite examples of this was when Homer , unbeknownst to Bart , acted like a robot so Bart could win the Robot war competition .
In the process , Homer got bludgeoned and poked with sharp metal objects .
Ah , the abiding and hilarious love of a father .
Hank Hill - King of the Hill
Hank
Hill may just sell propane and propane accessories , but he ’s the best damn propane seller in Heimlich County .
Hank does a fantastic job of teaching his son Bobby the meaning of hard work , dedication , loyalty to friends and family , the importance of Dallas Cowboys football and Texas pride , and of course , the stupidity of political correctness .
Yeah , Bobby is awkward , and sometimes Hank is overly concerned about Bobby being a sissy , but he ’s always there when Bobby needs him .
Steve Douglas - My Three Sons
My Three Sons was one of many dad sitcoms from the 1950s and 60s based around a widowed father raising their kids .
Steve Douglas was an aeronautical engineer trying to raise three sons first in the Midwest and then in Los Angeles , California .
The show ran for 12 years and during that time , America saw Steve ’s three sons move out , go to college , and get married .
Raising well adjusted and successful family men definitely makes you a great dad .
Ward Cleaver - Leave It To Beaver
Ward Cleaver embodies the stereotypical 1950s dad .
Ward might have been idealized , but that does n’t mean men should n’t be inspired to be the kind of father he was .
Ward Clever was a businessman that took his job as seriously as his family .
Even when frustrated , the man hardly raised his voice .
He read Mark Twain to his sons .
When he did give bad advice , ( like telling the Beaver to get in a fight with a girl )
Ward would admit his mistake and teach his sons a lesson in the process .
Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable - The Cosby Show
Cliff Huxtable was able to manage raising five kids while being a successful doctor .
On top of that , he amassed the most awesome sweater collection in the history of TV fatherdom .
Dr. Huxtable ’s advice to his children was always based on common sense mixed with a wisecrack .
Dr. Huxtable taught his children that personal responsibility is the key to success in life .
For example , even though his son , Theo , had dyslexia , Dr. Huxtable still expected him to excel in life and not use his learning disorder as an excuse .
If only more dads were like Dr. Huxtable .
Jim Anderson - Father Knows Best
Jim Anderson , the patriarch of this almost perfect 1950s family , was a successful insurance agent at work and a fantastic dad at home .
Jim always ended each episode by teaching his children some important moral lesson .
The show is a bit campy and is n’t a reflection of what real family life is like , but Jim Anderson is definitely a refreshing portrayal of an American dad when all you see these days are a bunch of dopey fathers on TV .
Mike Brady - The Brady Bunch
Mike Brady , a widower ( another widower ! ) , was faced with the challenge of integrating his three sons with another woman ’s brood of three girls .
He handled the situation by being both a strict disciplinarian and an empathetic guy .
He had a home office / studio in his house so he could work part of the time at home , and even when he went to his real office , he came home around the time the kids returned from school .
He won “ Father of the Year ” on the show after Marcia submitted an essay in his praise to a newspaper .
While clearly a stellar dad , Mike gets docked for abandoning his man haircut for a curly perm , and pulling a no - show for Greg ’s high school graduation
Eric Camden - 7th Heaven
Of all the best TV dads on this list , Eric Camden is the only one who was introduced in the last ten years .
Eric was a father to seven children and a minister at a local church where he spent time helping churchgoers and troubled teens .
Each episode took on some moral lesson that Eric ’s family had to deal with directly or indirectly .
Issues like alcoholism , pre-marital sex , and self injury were dealt with on a regular basis .
Eric was a good example of a father trying to keep his kids on the right path in a world that ’s constantly telling them to go down the wrong one .
Howard Cunningham - Happy Days
Mr. Cunningham ( or “ Mr. C. ” as the Fonz lovingly called him ) was not only the dad to Richie and Joanie Cunningham , but he also acted as a father figure for the Fonz ( who Mr. C let move into the family garage ) , Ralph Malph , and Potsie .
He always laid down the law in his house .
He was never his kids ’ friend , but was always their loving authority figure .
Although he loses points for not losing any sleep when his son Chuck disappeared in the second season , in general , Mr. C was a great dad .
TV’s Worst Dads
Tony Soprano - The Sopranos
Sure ,
Tony was able to provide for his family as a “ garbage man , ” but other than that , the guy was a lousy father .
It ’s tough to be raised by a professional criminal who knocks off people , including your boyfriend , with little remorse .
Tony cheated on his wife and had a strained relationship with his children .
As a result , his kids suffered from some serious emotional issues .
Al Bundy - Married With Children
Al Bundy had no redeeming qualities .
He was loser who wished he could go back to his high school days when he was a football star .
Sitting on the couch with his hand in his pants , he doled out criticism to his family with apathetic aplomb .
He was stuck in a dead end job as a shoe salesman , and could n’t even excel in that capacity .
He was up to his ears in debt .
His relationship with his kids was poor and his attitude toward women , including his wife , was deplorable .
If you want a lesson on how not to be a man , watch Married with Children .
Archie Bunker - All in the Family
All in the Family was a critically acclaimed show that broke boundaries in regards to race , religion , and gender all thanks to Archie Bunker , the most bigoted old man in television history .
Archie pretty much spent his entire time sitting in his living room chair spouting off racial epithets and calling his son - in - law “ Meathead . ”
While Archie started to soften up as the series progressed , he was still pretty much a racist jackass .
Frank Costanza - Seinfeld
There ’s a reason why George Costanza was a paranoid shell of a man- his father , Frank Costanza .
Frank Costanza was a loud , neurotic , and abrasive man .
Frank always found some way to make George ’s life more difficult .
In the episode where George Steinbrenner , George ’s boss and the owner of the Yankees , comes to tell George ’s parents about George ’s apparent death , Frank Costanza screams at Steinbrenner for trading Jay Buhner .
Thanks dad .
Frank Costanza does get points for inventing Festivus , but those points are canceled out by his creation of “ the bro . ”
Peter Griffin- Family Guy
Peter Griffin is a lousy father .
He makes fun of Chris , pays no attention to Stewie , and treats Meg like crap .
His selling of Meg to pay off a debt at the local drug store is a perfect example of his failure as a dad .
A father that sells his daughter into slavery deserves to be hit across the face with the baseball bat .
Of course , if that happened to Peter , it would be hilarious .
And probably involve some kind of wacky TV sitcom flashback .
John Locke ’s Dad- Lost
Before the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 , John Locke had some serious father issues .
First , his dad abandoned him as a child .
As an adult , he finally reunites with him , but instead of hugs and tears of joy , John ’s dad cons John out of a kidney and then abandons his son once more .
Later on , John Locke and his dad cross paths again and Locke is this time greeted with a shove out the window of an eight story building .
Consequently , Locke becomes paralyzed .
But hey !
There ’s nothing like being stuck on some mysterious island to work through all these daddy issues !
Arthur Spooner - King of Queens
Jerry Stiller makes another appearance on this list as an annoying dad .
On King of Queens he plays a dad quite like his character on Seinfeld , albeit with somewhat less yelling .
He still loses his temper though and makes life difficult for his daughter Carrie .
He lives for free with Carrie and her husband Doug , but never seems grateful for this privilege .
Doug and Carrie can seldom get alone time , and when they try to , Arthur makes them feel guilty for it .
Gob Bluth - Arrested Development
Gob ( pronounced like the Biblical character Job ) works as a part - time magician and beauty contest judge .
He was formally a male stripper , working as one of the “ Hot Cops . ”
During one of Gob ’s many one night stands during high school , he unknowingly fathered Steve Holt .
Gob does n’t find out that he ’s Steve ’s dad until Steve is a senior in high school .
Gob does n’t know how to deal with this new found responsibility and Steve is surely disappointed that his long lost dad scoots about town on a Segway .
Jack Bauer–24
Sure , having a terrorist fighting bad ass for a father would be really cool in many ways .
But his passion for his job has enormously detrimental effects on his family .
Bauer ’s job is to save American lives , but this puts the lives of his family at risk .
His own life is always in danger , he ’s never at home , his wife Teri is killed , his daughter Kim is kidnapped several times , and her relationship with her dad is understandably strained .
Ray Barone - Everybody Loves Raymond
Ray is a good natured and funny guy , but definitely falls into the “ incompetent man-child ” stereotype currently dominating the airwaves .
He ’s not good at communicating , and cracks a joke instead of dealing with things seriously .
He ’s still tied to his mom ’s apron strings and ca n’t confront her .
While he works from home , he does n’t spend much time with his kids and wife , preferring to watch TV .
When he does spend time with his kids , he prefers his twin sons over his daughter .
He ’s not sure how to relate to her since she ’s a girl and so buys her gifts to solve her problems or makes his wife deal with it .
I am sitting through Day 3 keynotes and now it's the Research and Development keynote session with Justin Rattner .
Lots of pictures to load later , but I wanted to post this one because I think it 's the big thing out here : wireless power transmission .
Unlike those " wireless power " gimmicks shown at CES , which require special connectors and devices actually touch the power source , this one transmits power over the air - we are talking about 60 watts power over two feet , at 75 % power efficiency .
Based on principles proposed by MIT physicists , Intel researchers have been working on a Wireless Resonant Energy Link ( WREL ) .
WREL promises to deliver wireless power safely and efficiently .
The technology relies on strongly coupled resonators .
Intel says that with this technology enabled in a laptop , for example , batteries could be recharged when the laptop gets within several feet of the transmit resonator .
Many engineering challenges remain , but the company 's researchers hope to find a way to cut the last cord in mobile devices and someday enable wireless power in Intel - based platforms .

Like a gold coin on a dunghill , the truth about the EU
Peter Lilley 's message is clear - 80 per cent of Britain 's laws are now made in Brussels and Parliament has no power to reject or amend them
Amid the silly soap opera that now passes for British politics , in which we are supposed to care more about hairstyles and mannerisms than about the country , there was one moment last week when a decent man said something important .
The brief flash of truth shone out like a gold coin on a dunghill .
The man was Peter Lilley , older and wiser than when he used to sing daft songs to Tory conferences .
Mr Lilley looks to me as if , like several others , he is trapped in the Unconservative Party and would blossom like an irrigated desert if only he could escape from it .
Because what he said was important , there have been far too few reports of it .
Hansard for Tuesday , June 3 , at 3.35 pm , will give you the details , if you want them .
But his clear , hard message was that 80 per cent of our laws are now made in Brussels , and Parliament has no power to reject or amend them .
If you wonder why our Post Offices are all closing , it ’s thanks to an EU directive .
So is the increasingly hated Data Protection Act .
So are Home Improvement Packs and fortnightly bin collections .
In 15 years ’ time our Parliament will have only two functions left – to raise taxes and declare war – admittedly things that our current politicians are rather keen on .
Mr Lilley ’s mischievous suggestion is that MPs ’ pay should be cut each time they hand over authority to others .
Incredibly , many MPs do n’t know what is going on .
If they ended up on the wages paid to district councillors – which is all they really are now – they might care more .
His own stark words cannot be improved upon : ‘ Few voters , or even members of this house , fully realise how many powers have been , or are about to be , transferred elsewhere .
There are three reasons for this .
The first is that governments of all persuasions deny that any significant powers are being transferred .
The second is that , once powers have been transferred , Ministers engage in a charade of pretence that they still retain those powers .
Even when introducing measures that they are obliged to bring in as a result of an EU directive they behave as though the initiative were their own .
‘ Indeed , Ministers often end up nobly accepting responsibility for laws that they actually opposed when they were being negotiated in Brussels . ’
So now you know .
Not since Dunkirk , 68 years ago , has our national independence been so imperilled .
But back then , we could see the danger .
Now most of us pretend it is n’t there .
Why must we pay for £ 18 m
Ross to insult our values ?
Jonathan Ross talks on TV in an arrogant sort of loudspeak
Defiantly refusing to get the point , the BBC continues to claim that it is right to pay £ 18 million to the superslob Jonathan Ross .
There ’s more to this than just bad taste .
It is a cultural cringe , the worship of loutism and a deliberate grinding of the faces of the morally and culturally conservative people of this country .
This force is so strong that David Cameron ( as is now largely forgotten ) submitted without protest while Ross subjected him to lewd questioning , asking him if
he had masturbated over pictures of Margaret Thatcher .
Ross talks on TV in an arrogant sort of loutspeak .
I wonder if he talks like that when he ’s dealing with his lawyers and his accountants .
His every attitude and gesture implies contempt for what he no doubt regards as ‘ stuffy ’ and ‘ conventional ’ attitudes – that is to say the invisible web of moral goodness that used to keep us safe , but which very rich people ( like him ) do n’t need because they can shield themselves from real life .
Who decides that such a person should be given a major slot on primetime TV ?
What can those of us who dislike it do ?
Nothing .
Your money – extracted from you under threat of imprisonment – will be handed to Mr Ross whatever you think .
I am the last conservative I know who supports the BBC licence fee , but – following this Marie Antoinette piece of arrogance in which we are told we must pay to be insulted – the Corporation has probably ensured that its days are numbered .
If it thinks Mr Ross is so marvellous , why not hold a flag day for him and see how much of the £ 18 million it manages to raise ?
Good enough for you , but not for Benn
The great infuriating unpunished scandal of socialist school hypocrisy never ceases .
They take for themselves what they deny to others , just like the old
Kremlin Politburo .
And they have no shame about it .
The late Caroline Benn , wife of Tony , was the most fervent campaigner for comprehensive schools in Britain .
Mr Benn – consistent with his principles – withdrew his two sons from their private school to send them to a comprehensive .
One of those sons , Stephen , then tried to become a Labour councillor and worked for the fanatically egalitarian Inner London Education Authority .
He married Nita Clarke , another career Leftist ( one - time Press officer for Glenys Kinnock , later a Blair adviser at Downing Street ) .
Now we find that their 18 - year - old daughter , Emily , has been attending ... selective grammar schools .
These are the schools her family opposed for decades .
Labour still hates them so much that its last Education Act ( backed by the Useless Tories ) banned the creation of any more .
Apparently unbothered by this ridiculous contrast between her private advantage and her public views , Emily Benn is now trying to become a Labour MP .
‘ I care more about the people that are n’t in grammar schools , ’ she trills .
I bet she does .
Reality that 's beyond belief
Some time ago I tried to write a satire , imagining what Britain would be like after ten years of New Labour rule .
My imagination was n’t up to it .
I predicted cannabis on open sale , and licensed shops for stolen goods , which has more or less come true .
But I would never have dared suggest that parking wardens would be paid more than front - line soldiers , or that thousands of prisoners would turn down early release because it was too nice inside .
Is the problem that we are now so outrageously misruled that we are unable to believe it , and so ca n’t bring ourselves to do anything ?
• Once upon a time Government Ministers would never dream of commenting on criminal proceedings .
But on the BBC ’s Question Time on Thursday night the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , referred to live cases during a lame attempt to justify the Government ’s despicable plan to introduce 42 - day detention without charge .
He said , before an audience of millions : ‘ Three cases have gone not for 14 days , but for 27 or 28 days , and those three cases are now being pursued through the courts for the most serious terrorist offences . ’
The word ‘ alleged ’ is missing .
Can this be right ?

The FBI cannot match Ivins and the handwriting in the anthrax letters .
As summarized by World Net Daily :
" Casting further doubt on the FBI 's anthrax case , accused government scientist Bruce Ivins passed two polygraph tests and a handwriting analysis comparing samples of his handwriting to writing contained in the anthrax letters , U.S. officials familiar with the investigation say .
***
Officials confirm that FBI handwriting analysts were unable to conclusively match samples of Ivins ' handwriting with the writing on the anthrax envelopes and letters " .
The WND article points out other problems with the FBI 's case :
Investigators also failed to uncover other critical evidence linking Ivins directly to the letters .
For instance : * No textile fibers were found in his office , residence or vehicles matching fibers found on the scotch tape used to seal the envelopes ; * No pens were found matching the ink used to address the envelopes ; * Samples of his hair failed to match hair follicles found inside the Princeton , N.J. , mailbox used to mail the letters .
Also , no souvenirs of the crime , such as newspaper clippings , were found in his possession as commonly seen in serial murder cases .
What 's more , the FBI could not place Ivins at the crime scene with evidence , such as gas station or other receipts , at the time the letters were mailed in September and October 2001 .
*** lab records reviewed by WND show the number of late nights
Ivins put in at the lab first spiked in August 2001 , weeks before the 9/11 attacks . "
So much for an air - tight case .

The armed wing of Hamas has admitted that a massive explosion in the Gaza Strip on Thursday was caused by militants preparing an armed operation .
Seven people , including a four - month - old baby were killed in the blast , in Beit Lahiya , in the north of the strip .
Hamas had initially blamed the explosion on an Israeli air strike and responded with rocket fire , but Israel denied any involvement .
Egypt is currently trying to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas .
Israel said on Wednesday that it would support Egypt 's efforts but instructed the army to prepare for possible military action in Gaza if they failed .
' Preparing operation '
" Members of the Ezzedine al - Qassam Brigades were trying to prepare for a Jihad operation , " the Hamas movement 's armed wing said in a statement .
The statement said six members of the brigades were killed in the blast , as well as the four - month - old baby of one of the militants .
About 50 people were wounded , among them 15 children , Palestinian medics say .
The blast destroyed a house and damaged about 10 neighbouring homes .
On Thursday , Hamas militants fired dozens of rockets into Israel .
A 59 - year - old woman was seriously wounded in the barrage .
In other violence on Thursday , an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in Gaza killed three Hamas militants and four other militants were killed in various clashes .

Rarely Seen , Elaborate Art from Tzarist & Soviet Russia
Never mind the quality of goods themselves , or that you could not find them in stores anyway - some advertising posters from Tzarist and Soviet Russia featured outstanding graphic design , quite prized by collectors today .
Here is a collection of unique and rarely - seen posters , serving as a commentary on troubled era and a deeply surreal consumer culture in pre-revolutionary and communist Russia .
Posters before the Revolution -
Full of " Art Nouveau " design elements , often a visual treat in itself , these sophisticated posters advertised no less sophisticated products , some of a very fine quality .
The select few who could afford to buy , could truly engage in a world - class Victorian luxury .
Once communists came to power , the designs ( and products themselves ) became increasingly atrocious and pretty tasteless .
But for the brief period in the 1900s , Russian consumer culture approached the sophistication and creativity of that in Europe .
Check out John Grieves from Berdyansk , with his agricultural equipment company :
( playing on the famous brand of John Deere , no doubt )
Russian traditional folk art is amply reflected in commercial posters :
( including some influences from Bilibin 's illustrative style )
This mighty warrior is looking for beer ( source of his strength ? ) -
The smiling lady is holding beer :
But this distinguished - looking gentleman is holding not beer , but " kvas " ( bread drink , a fermented mildly alcoholic beverage made from black or rye bread ) -
It helps when there is a huge variety of product to advertise : check out the extensive choice in beers from pre-Revolution Russian breweries : German , Bohemian , English Porter .
It seems that pre-revolutionary Russian beer industry was well on its way to become the " New Bavaria " , as the poster above proudly proclaims .
I think they should revive this beer bottle - style , it 's very distinctive :
An artsy ad for the Russian Tea :
Continuing to sweets and chocolate ...
" Just try to take the chocolate away from me , I 'll show you ! " :
Crawfish !
Well , actually crawfish - looking candy :
Other wonderful posters : for automobile show , and gun powder -
Not commercial , really elaborate poster celebrating 300 anniversary of Romanov 's Tzar dynasty :
Very strange combination :
And a greatly atmospheric setting for bars of soap :
Even Communists Need to Advertise Sometimes ...
... by normal ( printed paper ) means , that is , not by insidious propaganda .
Of course , they 'd rather use Orwellian brainwashing , but such technology could not be obtained at the time .
So they had to resort to the normal " capitalist marketing " ways of pushing their miserable ( or almost unobtainable ) products to consumers .
Funny thing , though - most posters advertise a generic product , such as " The Chocolate " , " The Ice cream " , " The Cigarettes " - supposedly convincing the masses to try them more often .
There were no trademarks , no variety of flavors to choose from ( or a very basic choice ) - so the only thing you see on the poster is the huge lettering " Eat more ...
Drink ... Smoke ! "
This one just says " Smoke Cigarettes ! " ( does not matter , which kind ) -
These are admonishments to cook hot dogs .
Yes .
Eat more hot dogs , wherever possible .
Some generic ice cream :
....OK , I 'll have more ice cream , no problem , comrades .
The other funny part of Soviet poster design was an invitation to " DEMAND this product in stores " - as though the store clerks were hiding the items under the counter and would procure them only by special order .
Ironically , this was often the case - the shortage of products and inefficient distribution saw to that .
The poor consumers had to not only " demand " , but also give bribes , grease certain hands with money to get the desired product .
Among the weirdest posters printed at this time ( in the 1920s ) : " These pacifiers are second to none , I 'd suck on them until I die " -
- or check that child 's face on this generic juice advertisement , pretty creepy :
These faces / creatures are not much better ( ad for cosmetic powder ) -
Happiness , derived from the new pair of rubber boots :
Interesting advertisement for a circus stunt :
Typical Stalin - era sex appeal : girl pilot with a tube of toothpaste -
And a country guy riding a cigarette - apparently ignorant of the " government 's health warning " :

Bush quietly seeks to make war powers permanent , by declaring indefinite state of war John Byrne
Published : Saturday August 30 , 2008
Print This Email This
As the nation focuses on Sen. John McCain 's choice of running mate , President Bush has quietly moved to expand the reach of presidential power by ensuring that America remains in a state of permanent war .
Buried in a recent proposal by the Administration is a sentence that has received scant attention -- and was buried itself in the very newspaper that exposed it Saturday .
It is an affirmation that the United States remains at war with al Qaeda , the Taliban and " associated organizations . "
Part of a proposal for Guantanamo Bay legal detainees , the provision before Congress seeks to acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with Al Qaeda , the Taliban , and associated organizations , who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of Americans . 
The New York Times ' page 8 placement of the article in its Saturday edition seems to downplay its importance .
Such a re-affirmation of war carries broad legal implications that could imperil Americans ' civil liberties and the rights of foreign nationals for decades to come .
It was under the guise of war that President Bush claimed a legal mandate for his warrantless wiretapping program , giving the National Security Agency power to intercept calls Americans made abroad .
More of this program has emerged in recent years , and it includes the surveillance of Americans ' information and exchanges online .
" War powers " have also given President Bush cover to hold Americans without habeas corpus -- detainment without explanation or charge .
Jose Padilla , a Chicago resident arrested in 2002 , was held without trial for five years before being convicted of conspiring to kill individuals abroad and provide support for terrorism .
But his arrest was made with proclamations that Padilla had plans to build a " dirty bomb . "
He was never convicted of this charge .
Padilla 's legal team also claimed that during his time in military custody -- the four years he was held without charge -- he was tortured with sensory deprivation , sleep deprivation , forced stress positions and injected with drugs .
Times reporter Eric Lichtblau notes that the measure is the latest step that the Administration has taken to " make permanent " key aspects of its " long war " against terrorism .
Congress recently passed a much - maligned bill giving telecommunications companies retroactive immunity for their participation in what constitutional experts see as an illegal or borderline - illegal surveillance program , and is considering efforts to give the FBI more power in their investigative techniques .
" It is uncertain whether Congress will take the administration up on its request , " Lichtblau writes .
" Some Republicans have already embraced the idea , with Representative Lamar Smith of Texas , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal .
' Since 9/11 , ' Mr. Smith said , 'we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent Americans . ' "
If enough Republicans come aboard , Democrats may struggle to defeat the provision .
Despite holding majorities in the House and Senate , they have failed to beat back some of President Bush 's purported " security " measures , such as the telecom immunity bill .
Bush 's open - ended permanent war language worries his critics .
They say it could provide indefinite , if hazy , legal justification for any number of activities -- including detention of terrorists suspects at bases like Guantanamo Bay ( where for years the Administration would not even release the names of those being held ) , and the NSA 's warantless wiretapping program .
Lichtblau co-wrote the Times article revealing the Administration 's eavesdropping program along with fellow reporter James Risen .
He notes that Bush 's language " recalls a resolution , known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress on Sept. 14 , 2001 ... [ which ] authorized the president to 'use all necessary and appropriate force ' against those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks to prevent future strikes .
That authorization , still in effect , was initially viewed by many members of Congress who voted for it as the go - ahead for the administration to invade Afghanistan and overthrow the Taliban , which had given sanctuary to Mr. bin Laden . "
" But the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administrations most controversial legal tactics , including the wiretapping program , and that still gnaws at some members of Congress , " he adds .

After each set of pictures were presented , another prerecorded sound file of the question ‘ How anxious do you feel ? ’ was played and the subjects rated their subjective anxiety on a Likert - style scale ( 0 = no anxiety to 8 = extreme anxiety ) .

The brain regions associated with compulsive hoarding in this study are anatomically very close to those associated with hoarding behaviors ... in human lesion studies .
Although it is plausible that hoarding behaviors caused by brain lesions may be phenomenologically and etiologically distinct from obsessive - compulsive hoarding , our results seem to suggest that they share similar neural substrates .

The previous two posts described the emergence of compulsive collecting behavior ( of Toy Bullets and Televisions ) following damage to the orbitofrontal cortex .
Although these unusual case reports do appear in the neurological literature , compulsive hoarding or collecting is much more common in psychiatric settings , as a disorder that may occur as a symptom of OCD ( or as a separate diagnosis ) .
In fact , in their new paper , Pertusa and colleagues ( 2008 ) ask the question , Compulsive Hoarding : OCD Symptom , Distinct Clinical Syndrome , or Both ? [ Both ] .
Earlier studies have come to similar conclusions ( e.g. , Grisham et al. , 2005 ) .
A recent neuroimaging study ( An et al. , 2008 ) used a symptom provocation procedure to examine the neural correlates of hoarding .
The research participants were restricted to individuals with obsessive - compulsive disorder ; those hoarders without an OCD diagnosis were excluded .
Thus , two groups of OCD patients ( those with and without hoarding symptoms ) were compared to demographically matched controls while viewing three types of pictures - 150 color pictures rated as low in disgust and anxiety .
Examples included furniture , nature scenes , urban landscapes , household items , pets , families .
The pictures were obtained from the International Affective Picture System - 50 color pictures of scenes rated as highly disgusting and anxiety - provoking by healthy subjects were also obtained from the IAPS .
These included scenes of mutilated bodies / wounds , small animals ( snakes , spiders , cockroaches and rats ) and body products .- 50 color pictures that included items such as old magazines / newspapers , empty food containers , clothes and toys .
These pictures were rated by several patients ( not in the fMRI study ) to ensure that they would be anxiety - provoking .
The pictures were presented in alternating blocks of neutral and emotional .
Participants were instructed toNot surprisingly , the OCD - hoarders rated thepictures as more anxiety - provoking than did the other two groups .
However , thepictures were rated as equivalently yucky by all three groups .
What did the fMRI results show ?
From the previous neurological case studies , one would expect differences in the orbitofrontal cortex of the OCD - hoarding group , relative to the non-hoarding and control participants .
And indeed , when viewing the provocative stacks of magazines and empty food containers ,
In contrast , when comparing the disgustingpictures topictures , the activated regions in the hoarding OCD patients were more similar to those that were seen in the non-hoarding OCD patients and the healthy control participants .
However , the hoarders did showactivation in the cerebellum and visual areas than the controls ( and the non-hoarders showed ) .
The authors suggest that [

Overall , the phenomenology of hoarding behavior was similar in the two hoarding groups [ OCD with Hoarding , Hoarding only ] .
The majority of participants in both groups reported hoarding common items as a result of their emotional and / or intrinsic value .
However , approximately one - fourth of participants in the compulsive hoarding with OCD group showed a different psychopathological profile , which was characterized by the hoarding of bizarre items and the presence of other obsessions and compulsions related to their hoarding , such as fear of catastrophic consequences , the need to perform checking rituals , and the need to perform mental compulsions before discarding any item .
...
In most individuals , compulsive hoarding appears to be a syndrome separate from OCD , which is associated with substantial levels of disability and social isolation .
However , in other individuals , compulsive hoarding may be considered a symptom of OCD and has unique clinical features .

Preliminary neuroimaging studies suggest that patients with the ' compulsive hoarding syndrome ' may be a neurobiologically distinct variant of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) but further research is needed .
A total of 29 OCD patients ( 13 with and 16 without prominent hoarding symptoms ) and 21 healthy controls of both sexes participated in two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments consisting of the provocation of hoarding - related and symptom - unrelated ( aversive control ) anxiety .
In response to the hoarding - related ( but not symptom - unrelated ) anxiety provocation , OCD patients with prominent hoarding symptoms showed greater activation in bilateral anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) than patients without hoarding symptoms and healthy controls .
In the entire patient group ( n=29 ) , provoked anxiety was positively correlated with activation in a frontolimbic network that included the anterior VMPFC , medial temporal structures , thalamus and sensorimotor cortex .
Negative correlations were observed in the left dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus , bilateral temporal cortex , bilateral dorsolateral / medial prefrontal regions , basal ganglia and parieto - occipital regions .
These results were independent from the effects of age , sex , level of education , state anxiety , depression , comorbidity and use of medication .
The findings are consistent with the animal and lesion literature and several landmark clinical features of compulsive hoarding , particularly decision - making difficulties .
Whether the results are generalizable to hoarders who do not meet criteria for OCD remains to be investigated .

A seven - alarm fire rampaged through part of Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield Saturday afternoon , destroying 80 unoccupied homes and threatening 300 more buildings before fire crews managed to stop the flames ' advance , officials said .
It was the biggest fire in the 66 - year history of Travis , base commander Mark Dillon said .
The blaze , which began around 3:15 p.m. as a small grass fire , quickly spread throughout the northwest region of the base , near the main gate .
About five hours later , firefighters said the blaze was about 80 percent contained , after having burned about 750 acres .
No one was injured , Fairfield Fire Department spokeswoman Morgan
Yahnke said .
The destroyed homes are part of a subdivision of enlisted personnel housing that was scheduled for demolition .
" Wow , you could see this huge , billowing column of black smoke over the city , " said Amanda Sparks of Vacaville , who saw it as she drove to work Saturday evening .
" It was very worrisome , because there 's a lot of industrial buildings right near the fire , and if it got out of control , it could get bad very fast . "
As night fell , however , it became clear that the danger would be confined .
" The fire has entirely been limited to these unoccupied homes , " Yahnke said .
" There have been no evacuations . "
About 160 firefighters from throughout Solano County fought the fire , aided by additional crews from Napa County and from Cal Fire .
" It 's been very hot , and the winds continue to be a challenge , " Yahnke said in the afternoon as crews attacked the blaze .
Occupants of about 125 other buildings on the base were advised to remain indoors until the fire is out .
Colonel Dillion , the base commander , said he " could n't be happier with the support we 've received from the surrounding community - it 's helped to bring the fire under control . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A Bush administration plan to define several widely used contraception methods as abortion is a “ gratuitous , unnecessary insult ” to women and faces tough opposition , Sen. Hillary Clinton said on Friday .

The former Democratic presidential candidate joined family planning groups to condemn the proposal that defines abortion to include contraception such as birth control pills and intrauterine devices .
It would cut off federal funds to hospitals and states where medical providers are obligated to offer legal abortion and contraception to women .
“ We will not put up with this radical , ideological agenda to turn the clock back on women ’s rights , ” the New York senator told a joint news conference with New York Rep. Nita Lowey , also a Democrat , at Bellevue Hospital .
“ Women would watch their contraceptive coverage disappear overnight , ” said Clinton .
The planned rule is aimed at countering recent state laws enacted to ensure that women can get contraception when they want or need it .
It also would help protect the rights of medical providers to refuse to offer contraception .
Clinton said she has written a letter with Patty Murray , a Democrat senator from Washington , to Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt asking him to reconsider and reject the release of the proposed rules .
She also urged people to sign a petition on her website , www.hillpac.com, against the proposed changes .
“ Our first effort is to get the Bush administration to rescind the regulation , not issue in its current form , ” Clinton said .
“ If that does n’t succeed , we ’re going to be looking for legislative steps that we can take to prevent this regulation from ever going into effect . ”
A copy of a memo that appears to be an Department of Health and Human Services draft provided to Reuters this week carries a broad definition of abortion as any procedures , including prescription drugs , “ that result in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth , whether before or after implantation . ”
Conception occurs when egg and sperm unite in the Fallopian tubes .
It takes three to four days before the fertilized egg implants in the uterus .
Several birth control methods interfere with this , including the birth control pill and IUDs .
“ If enacted , these rules will make birth control out of reach for some women .
That ’s a sure way to guarantee more unintended pregnancies and more abortions , ” said Anne Davis of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae , in another sign the nation 's housing problems are persisting , reported a much larger - than - expected loss in the second quarter and slashed its dividend on Friday .
The company signaled that its loss rate on its business will double in the second half of the year , and that it will see huge losses through next year because of the continued decline in home prices and rising mortgage foreclosures and delinquencies .
Its executives said the firm will pull back from some segments of the mortgage market and limit its overall growth .
Such moves might help Fannie stem its losses but could make it more difficult and expensive for some home buyers to get financing - and that in turn would likely add to the downward pressure on home prices .
Overall , the firm issued a gloomier outlook for the housing market .
It said prices are only two - thirds of the way through their eventual full decline .
Prices have declined 13 % through the end of June from their peak in 2006 , and will fall close to 19 % before they reach bottom .
" The housing market has returned to earth fast and hard , " CEO Daniel Mudd said in a conference call .
Uncertainty about the market made it impossible to say " what inning we 're in " or when prices would reach bottom , ' he said .
" There is progress but we have a long way to go , " Mudd added .
Large losses , and more ahead
Fannie reported a net loss of $ 2.3 billion , or $ 2.54 a share .
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters forecast a loss of 68 cents a share , compared to earnings of $ 1.86 a share a year earlier .
Shares of Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) were down 9 % on Friday .
The much bigger - than - expected loss stemmed from the company 's forecast for bigger future losses , which caused it to set aside an additional $ 3.7 billion and write down the value of its securities .
The company said that the rate of credit market losses for the second half of the year is likely to be more than twice the rate of losses in the first six months .
And it sees significant losses on loans continuing into 2009 .
Fannie has suffered significant losses from bad loans this year .
Its credit losses soared to $ 1.3 billion in the second quarter , up more than 400 % from year - ago levels and up 42 % compared to the first quarter .
Much of Fannie 's large losses before this quarter came from writedowns in the value of its portfolio of mortgage - backed securities it owns .
But clearly the climbing losses on the loans themselves will become an increasing problem in the periods ahead .
Fannie on Friday also slashed its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share , down 86 % from its previous level , as the company tries to maintain its capital reserves .
The lower dividend could save it $ 1.2 billion over a year 's time .
Still , even with the reduced dividend and $ 7.2 billion in additional capital it raised during the second quarter , the company said it is no longer certain that it will have enough capital to carry it through the losses it sees into 2009 .
Pulling back from some loans
The company also announced it would pull out of the so - called Alt - A loan business by the end of the year .
Those loans , made to borrowers who do not provide full or any verification of their income , have been responsible for most of the company 's losses , even though they are a small percentage of their overall business .
" There is something here for every single constituency to dislike , " Mudd said , referring to the company 's dividend cut , increase in fees and overall financial results .
And Fannie signaled that it may limit its growth of even some of the safer prime loans it purchases as it tries to limit losses going forward .
" We probably wo n't play as vibrant as role as in years past , " said Peter Niculescu , executive vice president of the mortgage portfolio business for Fannie .
Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and sibling company Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) are shareholder - owned companies set up by the government to provide funding to banks and other lenders making home loans .
They buy loans , attach a guarantee , then sell securities backed by the loans ' income stream .
They have been badly hurt in the last year by the sharp decline in home prices and the rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures .
Between them they back or own more than $ 5 trillion in single family home loans , or roughly half the outstanding U.S. mortgages .
The troubles in the housing and credit markets led to shares of both firms plunging in the last two months .
That , in turn , prompted Congress to authorize a rescue plan that would have the Treasury Department loan the firms unlimited amount of money or buy their equity if necessary .
On Wednesday , Freddie reported a much larger - than - expected loss due to the bad loans and slashed its dividend at least 80 % in an effort to retain capital it needs to operate .
Shares of both companies tumbled further on that report in Wednesday trading and again Thursday , leaving Fannie shares off 61 % between June 16 and Thursday 's close .
Freddie shares are off 75 % in the same period .

Effective web design does n’t have to be pretty and colorful — it has to be clear and intuitive ; in fact , we have analyzed the principles of effective design in our previous posts .

Well , there are a number of options — for instance , you can use grids , you can prefer the simplest solutions or you can focus on usability .
However , in each of these cases you need to make sure your visitors have some natural sense of order , harmony , balance and comfort .
And this is exactly where the so - called Divine proportion becomes important .
This article explains what is the Divine proportion and what is the Rule of Thirds and describes how you can apply both of them effectively to your designs .
Of course , there are many possibilities .
Hopefully , this post will help you to find your way to more effective and beautiful web designs or at least provide some good starting points you can build upon or develop further .
You may want to take a look at the following related post :
Divine Proportion
Since the Renaissance , many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio — especially in the form of the golden rectangle , in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio .
The rationale behind it is the belief that this proportion is organic , universal , harmonic and aesthetically pleasing .
Indeed , being evident everywhere in the universe ( in fact , many things around us can be expressed in this ratio ) , divine proportion ( which is also called Golden ratio , divine section , golden cut and mean of Phidias ) is probably the most known law of proportion which can dramatically improve the communication of your design .
As Mark Boulton states in his article Design and the Divine Proportion , “ one of the key components in the vehicle of communication is composition , and in design schooling it is something that is taught as something you should feel rather than create logically . ”
Hence , to comfort your visitors with a pleasing and intuitive composition it is often worth considering the Golden ratio .
So what exactly is Golden ratio ?
Basically , it is a proportion 1.618033988749895 ≈ 1.618 which holds between objects placed within some context .
Consider the example above .
You would like to create a fixed width layout .
The width of your layout is 960 px .
You would to have a large block for your content ( # content ) and a smaller block for your sidebar ( # sidebar ) .
How would you calculate the widths of your columns ?
First , calculate the width of your #content - block .
You need to make sure that the ratio between this block and the overall layout width is 1.62 .
Hence you divide 960 px by 1.62 which results in approximately 593 px .
Subtract 593 px from the overall layout width ( which is 960 px ) and get 960 px - 593 px = 367 px .
Now if you calculate the ratio between the #content - block and the #sidebar - block ( 593 px : 367 px ≈ 1.615 ) and the ratio between the container - width and the width of the content - block ( 960 px : 593 px ≈ 1.618 ) you have achieved almost the same ratio .
This is the whole idea behind the “ Golden ” proportion .
The same holds for fluid and elastic layouts , too .
Of course , a web design does n’t need to be organized according to the Divine proportion .
However , in some cases it can improve not only the communication of your design , but also improve further details of your layouts .
As an example consider The 404 Blog .
The design itself is visually appealing , provides calm and supporting color scheme and has a nice composition .
However , the design does not correspond to the Divine proportion as you can see from the image below .
Actually , users do n’t necessarily feel it , because they intuitively split the layout in two separate blocks of the width 583 px ( 630 px - 31 px - 31 px ) and 299px ( 330 px - 31 px ) .
The reason behind it is that white space of the main area is passive ( three columns , each 31 px wide ) , it clearly supports the content next to it rather than being the content itself .
The ratio between the layout blocks is 630 : 330 px ≈ 1.91 ≠ 1.62 , and the ratio between the content blocks is 583 : 299px ≈ 1.92 ≠ 1.62 .
The reason why the layout looks almost perfect although it does n’t stick to the Divine proportion is the simple fact that it is balanced — both the layout blocks and the content blocks have the same proportion .
Hence the design provides some sense of closure and structural harmony .
The interesting thing is , however , that due to a suboptimal layout length visitors are offered a suboptimal text length of over 90 symbols per line .
However , an optimal number for comfortable reading lies between 60 and 80 symbols per line .
The improvement of the layout would therefore lead to the improved readability of the content , too .
That ’s a useful side - effect of getting things done according to the laws of nature .
For some quick ’n ’ dirty drafts you may use the ratio 5 : 3 which is not exactly the Divine proportion , but can turn out to be a useful rule of thumb in case you do n’t have a calculator near you .
Divine proportion usually provides bulletproof values one can perfectly incorporate in almost every design .
When working on your next project you may want to consider using the following tools to calculate the widths “ on the fly ” :
Phiculator Phiculator is a simple tool which , given any number , will calculate the corresponding number according to the golden ratio .
The free tool is available for both Win and Mac .
Golden Section Ratio Design Tool Atrise Golden Section is a program , which allows avoiding the routine operations , calculator compilations , planning of grouping and forms .
You can see and change the harmonious forms and sizes , while being directly in the process of working on your project .
The Rule of Thirds
Basically , the Rule of Thirds is a simplified version of the Golden ratio and as such poses a compositional rule of thumb .
Dividing a composition into thirds is an easy way to apply divine proportion without getting out your calculator .
It states that every composition can be divided into nine equal parts by two equally - spaced horizontal lines and two equally - spaced vertical lines .
The four points formed by the intersections of these lines can be used to place the most important elements — the elements you ’d like to give a prominent or dominant position in your designs .
Aligning a composition according to Rule of thirds creates more tension , energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the feature would .
This photograph demonstrates the principles of the rule of thirds .
Source : Wikipedia
In most cases it is neither possible nor useful to use all four points to highlight the most important functions or navigation options in a design .
However , you can definitely use some of them ( usually one or two ) to properly place the most important message or functionality of the site .
The left upper corner is usually the strongest one , since users scan web - sites according to the “ F ” - shape .
So how do you split a layout into 9 equal parts ?
Jason Beiard states the following method for applying the Rule of Thirds to your layouts :
To start the pencil - and - paper version of your layout , draw a rectangle .
The vertical and horizontal dimensions do n’t really matter , but try to keep straight lines and 90 - degree angles .
Divide your rectangle horizontally and vertically by thirds .
Divide the top third of your layout into thirds again .
Divide each of your columns in half to create a little more of a grid .
You should have a square on your paper that looks similar to the rule of thirds grid .
Let ’s consider the following situation .
Assume you have a layout of fixed width 960 px .
Consider the area above the fold which is likely to have the height between 750 and 950 px .
Divide the width of your layout by 3 .
In an example you get 960 px / 3 = 320 px .
Divide the height of your layout by 3 .
In an example you get ( ( 750 + 950 px ) / 2 ) / 3 ≈ 285 px .
Each rectangle should have the size of 320 px × 285 px .
Construct the grid of the rectangles described in step 4 by drawing lines going through the ends of rectangles .
Place the most significant elements of your designs in the meeting points of horizontal and vertical lines .
Consider the design of demandware.com presented below .
Although the design uses a number of vibrant colors , it is not noisy and seems to be both simple and clear .
The navigation options are clearly visible and the structure of the site seems to be easy to scan .
However , if you consider the effectiveness of this design , you might find a perfect balance the design actually has .
Indeed , it almost perfectly uses the Rule of Thirds as two out of four intersections of the lines ( pink blocks in the picture below ) contain exactly the information which the company wants its users to see — namely what the site is all about and an example of their work .
Note also how perfectly the main sections are placed on the second horizontal axis .
That is effective .
Rule of Thirds in use : two out of four intersections of the lines ( pink blocks ) contain exactly the information which the company wants its visitors to see .
Summary
In some cases , applying the Divine proportion and the Rule of Thirds may significantly improve the communication of your design to your visitors .
Offering your users an almost natural balance in proportion 1 : 1.62 you literally impose the natural order on it and force your design layout to become more scannable and well - structured .
Using the Rule of Thirds you can also effectively highlight important functions of your site providing your visitors with a design they can easily work with and effectively delivering the message you want to deliver in the first place .
While this films producers should be applauded for their sensible approach in teaching parents how to talk to kids about sex , the awkward reading of cue cards and embarrassing situations will produce nervous giggles among even the most jaded audiences .
This film was produced by some of the pioneers of sex education whose ideas are still being challenged by school boards today .

Subject : What A Classic Film
This was shown to my medical school class ( Dr Evans was on the faculty - and what a great guy !
He taught us so much !
One of many outstanding instructors at WSU Med School ... the U of M guy also ; he came out to lecture us too ) ... this film was shown to us 10 years after it was made - and still pertinent as it was and still is today .
The most important point made here is that the parent needs to be cool calm and collected right from the beginning about answering questions about babies , where they come from , how they get out .
Why ?
Because for ever after that kid will consider you willing to offer the further info they will want , and not have to go elsewhere for that info .
And for heavens sakes , act like genitals are basically a toe you just generally you keep coverd up - otherwise its yours to do with as you please .
And this film conveys that message marvelously !
These two guys were nationally recognized experts in this area .
How they speak in this film is exactly the way they were on clinical rounds .
I remember that very well .
I was impressed by this film when I saw it in medical school and 35 years later I still find it impressive .
Unquestionably the best film regarding approaching sex ed for parents that was ever made .
There is nothing radical or religious or .. anything .. except rational , in dealing with this issue .
Gets the highest rating of any film I 've seen on this site .

I 'm guessing that it found it 's audience amongst the more enlightened and preached , in the main , to the semi-converted ; but then that 's so often the way .
My only quibble is the way they associate male masturbation with nocturnal emissions ; still alluding to the ' letting off steam ' fallacy .
In addition , we 're given no alternative strategy to deal with toddlers playing with themselves .
Agreed it 's a natural activity , however society does frown upon it in public .
So how do we convey that message ?

Sony to launch something like Apple 's iTunes for PlayStation 3
Sony has finally decided to confirm its long - awaited movie download service for PlayStation 3 .
The new service is to be launched in the USA this summer .
The European and Japanese markets will have to wait a little bit more , the President of Sony ’s video game unit , Kazuo Hirai said .
Sony to launch something like Apple 's iTunes for PlayStation 3
The rumors about the movie download service for PlayStation 3 appeared in 2005 , when a Sony official said that the corporation was planning to develop something like iTunes for movies .
Another top official of the electronic giant stated later that PS3 users would soon be able to download movies and TV shows from PlayStation Network .
The new service , currently unnamed , will apparently become a competition for Apple ’s iTunes .
Most likely , PlayStation 3 users will be able to download videos on their computers and then easily transfer them to PS ’s flash card .
The PlayStation 3 was first released on November 11 , 2006 in Japan , November 17 , 2006 in North America , and March 23 , 2007 in Europe and Oceania .
Two SKUs were available at launch ; a basic model with a 20 GB hard disk drive ( HDD ) and a premium model with a 60 GB HDD and several additional features ( The 20 GB model was not released in Europe or Oceania . )
Since then , several revisions have been made to the console 's available models and it has faced stiff competition from the other seventh generation consoles .
As of December 20 , 2007 , the PS3 is in third place in home console sales for its generation .
In response to Microsoft 's success with their Xbox Live network , Sony announced a unified online service for the PlayStation 3 system at the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo .
Sony also confirmed that the service will always be connected , free , and include multiplayer support .
In addition , the registration interface can only be accessed through the PS3 system interface .
At the Tokyo Game Show on September 21 , 2006 , it was revealed that users will be able to download some of the thousands of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles from the PlayStation Network for about US $ 5 – $ 15 , starting with those with the smallest game data .
Ken Kutaragi also announced functionality with other systems , similar to Nintendo 's Virtual Console , including confirmed Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx 16 functionality .
However , Sega replied that Sony had been too hasty with calling it a fact , and that it was still " under examination " .
On May 8 , 2007 Sony Computer Entertainment announced PlayStation Network Cards , a form of electronic money that can be used with the Store .
PlayStation Network Tickets , available in units of 1,000 , 3,000 , 5,000 , and 10,000 yen , can be purchased at convenience stores throughout Japan .
Each ticket contains a 12 alphanumeric code which can be inputted to the PlayStation Network to place credits in the virtual wallet .
The tickets are available through electronic kiosks at 26,000 convenience stores , including Lawsons , Family Mart , Daily Yamazaki , Ministop and Sunkus .
They are also available at 26,000 post office ATM machines , although registration is required first at a special mobile website .
A similar PlayStation Network Card system based on actual cards instead of tickets was introduced in South Korea , Hong Kong and Taiwan in Summer 2007 and is scheduled for a Spring 2008 release in North America .
Paper money contains high traces of cocaine , regardless of whether or not the paper money came into direct contact with the drug .
And U.S. bills take the top spot , covered in the greatest amount of the illegal powder , while Spanish notes are the most highly contaminated in Europe , a new study finds .
The findings , detailed in the latest issue of the journal Trends in Analytical Chemistry , reflect the popularity of the illicit drug , the researchers say .
" These findings should not be surprising , because cocaine and other drugs are traded using cash , which is handled by the same fingers that directly touch the drugs or wrappings , " chemists Sergio Armenta and Miguel de la Guardia from the University of Valencia in Spain write .
" Moreover , many cocaine users use a wrapped banknote to sniff this drug , so inducing direct cocaine contamination of the banknotes . "
Armenta and de la Guardia analyzed Spanish notes for cocaine traces , finding they contained an average of 155 micrograms of cocaine .
( A gram of cocaine would fill about half a tea bag .
A microgram is one - millionth of that amount . )
They also reviewed previous research focusing on cocaine concentrations found in different currencies around the world .
German Euros contained levels of cocaine that were five times lower than the Spanish ones .
For Irish bank notes , one statistic suggested that of 48 notes studied the highest concentration found was 0.5 micrograms .
The chemists found U.S. bills contained an average of between 2.9 and 28.8 micrograms of cocaine depending on the year and city , with a maximum of more than 1,300 micrograms found on some 1996 bills .
One study based on 356 notes showed just 6 percent of Swiss francs were contaminated with cocaine at levels above one nanogram per note , where a nanogram is one - thousandth of a microgram .
Some data suggest , the researchers found , that between 40 percent and about 50 percent of British pounds were contaminated with cocaine at levels of about 0.0011 micrograms per note .
It turns out , money really is dirty , and not just with drug traces .
One past study revealed 94 percent of $ 1 bills collected from a community in western
Ohio contained disease - causing or potentially disease - causing bacteria .
The study , published in 2002 in the Southern Medical Journal , was led by Peter Ender , chief of infectious diseases at Wright - Patterson Medical Center in Ohio .
That 's not too surprising , as $ 1 bills stay in circulation for an average of 21 months , according to the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing , during which time they get handled by plenty of people .
For larger bills , the life span is even longer , with $ 20 bills lasting about 24 months and $ 50 bills staying in circulation for 55 months .
When you handle coins , stuff also gets transferred to your hands , though it 's mainly iron atoms ( iron is one of the metals in change ) .
Another research study revealed iron atoms from coins cause oils on your skin to break down , producing a " metallic " odor .
The shift of videogame sales and distribution to the Internet -- from discs and cartridges -- may be happening sooner than we thought .
Electronic Arts ' ( ERTS ) studio Criterion Games said yesterday that it ’s releasing the full version of racing game ' Burnout Paradise ' for download through Sony 's ( SNE ) PlayStation Store sometime in the next month and a half .
The game went on sale in disc format for the PS3 in January .
Few new games have made the jump from disc to download , and usually when they do , it ’s in the form of an update .
But if full - game downloads catch on , we could eventually see studios reducing physical distribution and putting big - name games up for sale online the same day they go on sale in stores .
One obvious loser : Game retailers like GameStop ( GME ) , which has kept profits up during an economic slowdown because the videogame market keeps growing .
But if gamers can pick up a game without leaving their homes , retailers could be in trouble .
The winner ?
The consumer , especially if game makers cut prices to encourage downloads , which cost less to distribute .
But that ’s not happening yet : Burnout Paradise will cost $ 30 to download , the same price it sells for in stores .

In a provocative statement delivered from the White House Rose Garden on Monday , President George W. Bush escalated the confrontation between the United States and Russia over the current fighting in Georgia .
Bush denounced what he called Russia ’s “ dramatic and brutal ” military escalation and demanded that Moscow agree to an immediate cease - fire and the withdrawal of its troops from the Caucasian country on its border .
He accused Russia of planning to bomb the Tbilisi airport and charged that Moscow was seeking to overthrow the pro-US government of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili .
Bush reiterated US statements about the inviolability of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity — diplomatic language supporting the efforts of the government in Tbilisi to reestablish control over the breakaway pro-Russian republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Bush ’s remarks followed a statement Sunday by Vice President Dick Cheney , who said Russian “ aggression ” could not go unanswered .
Cheney ’s intervention suggested the existence of a faction within the Bush administration that is pushing for a more aggressive US response to the Russian intervention in Georgia .
The statements from the White House express a staggering level of hypocrisy .
The US government issued no protest when Georgian military forces attacked South Ossetia last Thursday night , indiscriminately targeting apartment blocs in the capital of Tskhinvali with tank cannon and mortars .
It is estimated that the Georgian invaders killed 2,000 civilians , a bloodletting that accounts for the vast bulk of civilian deaths to date .
It was only when the Russian military responded to the Georgian attack with a rapid and massive counteroffensive , crushing the much smaller Georgian force , that Washington became alarmed .
There is nothing remotely progressive in the military actions taken by the Putin regime .
The Russian ruling elite is pursuing its own predatory aims in the Caucasus , a region that was ruled for two centuries by Moscow before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Moreover , the eruption of war in the Caucasus underscores the tragic consequences of the dissolution of the USSR .
It has exposed the masses of the former Soviet Union , including Russia and the other Soviet republics , to the dangers of war and the predations of the major imperialist powers .
For the peoples of the former USSR , the answer is to be found not in the nationalist and militaristic policies of Putin , but rather in the internationalist program of socialist revolution .
Notwithstanding the reactionary aims of the Russian regime , no objective observer can contest the fact that Washington ’s provocative policy toward Russia — aimed at supplanting Russia in its long - time spheres of influence — is the primary factor behind the eruption of war between Russia and Georgia .
The media has been virtually silent on the visit just one month ago of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Georgia .
Rice held talks with Saakashvili and gave a press conference at which she denounced Russia , backed Saakashvili ’s efforts to reassert Georgian control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia , and reiterated US support for Georgia ’s incorporation into NATO .
Russia has made clear that it considers the entry of former Soviet republics such as Georgia and Ukraine into NATO an intolerable threat to its security .
Were Georgia already a part of NATO , as Moscow is well aware , the alliance ’s member states would be legally bound to intervene military in Georgia ’s support .
It is inconceivable that Saakashvili did not review in detail with Rice his plans for a military assault on South Ossetia .
Georgia — which is totally dependent on US military , diplomatic and financial support — could not take such a portentous action without informing Washington in advance and securing American sanction .
Preparations for the attack would have been far advanced when Rice met with Saakashvili a month ago .
The Georgian military , moreover , is dominated from top to bottom by US military advisers .
The United States has been pouring military aid into Georgia ever since the US - led air war against Serbia in 1999 , and the pace and scale of American military aid have accelerated since Washington engineered the so - called “ Rose Revolution ” that brought Harvard - educated Saakashvili to power in early 2004 .
An article in Monday ’s New York Times describes “ a Pentagon effort to overhaul Georgia ’s forces from bottom to top . ”
The article states : “ At senior levels , the United States helped rewrite Georgian military doctrine and train its commanders and staff officers .
At the squad level , American marines and soldiers trained Georgian soldiers in the fundamentals of battle .
“ Georgia , meanwhile , began re-equipping its forces with Israeli and American firearms , reconnaissance drones , communications and battlefield management equipment , new convoys of vehicles and stockpiles of ammunition . ”
As for the principle of national sovereignty and territorial integrity , the US is highly selective when it comes to its application .
No one in either political party or in the establishment media has sought to explain why Serbia ’s military intervention against Kosovan separatists was a war crime , while Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia was legitimate .
The Bush administration was the prime mover behind Kosovo ’s declaration of independence from Serbia last February , on grounds indistinguishable from those claimed by anti-Georgian separatists in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Moreover , the US encouraged and financed the forces that sought to effect the secession of Chechnya from Russia in the 1990s .
Since the United States was clearly involved in the Georgian assault on South Ossetia , one must ask what were its intentions .
It is difficult to believe that US policy makers believed Russia would take no action in response to such an immense provocation .
Why then , would they support a move that would bring Russia into a direct conflict with one of Washington ’s principal allies in the Caucasus — a region that constitutes a bridgehead between the resource - rich Caspian Basin and Western Europe and houses critical oil and gas pipelines ?
The only plausible answer is that the United States is deliberately seeking a major escalation of tensions between Russia and the West .
Even if the current conflict does not spiral immediately into a wider conflagration , the fate of “ little Georgia ” will be invoked by the United States to justify a far more aggressive and confrontational stance toward Russia .
The demands being raised by the Bush administration , the European Union , the United Nations and others for a return to the “ status quo ante ” in Georgia are drenched in hypocrisy .
They all know very well that the US is not about to abandon what it has come to see as a critical prop to its position in the Caucasus and its long - term perspective of reducing Russia to a semi-colonial status .
The resumption of something akin to the Cold War underscores the real motives that underlay the decades of confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union .
American imperialism considered the Soviet Union — and continues to view Russia — as an obstacle to its geo-strategic aim of securing hegemony over Eurasia .
There is undoubtedly a domestic political component to the US - backed provocation against Russia as well .
The Bush administration and the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , want the November elections to take place under conditions of immense international crisis .
They calculate that an environment of fear and insecurity will strengthen McCain ’s chances , since a major prop of his campaign is his supposed foreign policy experience and national security expertise .
Obama , predictably and pathetically , is responding by seeking to assert his own militaristic credentials .
Within minutes of Bush ’s threatening statement against Russia on Monday , Obama issued his own denunciation of Russia in terms almost identical to those of Bush and McCain .
The immensely dangerous implications of the eruption of war in the Caucasus leave no doubt about where the drive of imperialism to carve up the world is leading .
US imperialism intends to let nothing stand in the way of its goal of establishing global hegemony .
It is dragging the American working class and the world into a catastrophe .
The only force that can stop it is the revolutionary mobilization of the American and international working class .

I never played Nintendo growing up ; we were a Master System family .
When firing up a racing title hailing from the garage of Black Rock Studios ( formerly Climax ) , you can usually bet that the ensuing gameplay will be one of painstaking realism and detailed simulation .
But this time , the developer behind the MotoGP series has decided to tone down the simulation elements of its new ATV racer , Pure , while simultaneously giving it a heavy dose of the extraordinary .
In Pure , you and 15 other fictional riders will take on 36 different tracks that span across a variety of the most vertical environments in the world .
In the case of our demo , we spent time with two different locations : Timber Falls , a high altitude mountain range , and Ocotillo Falls , a treacherous desert containing a graveyard for jet liners .
Tracks such as Timber Falls are made all the more intense with breathtaking vistas that sport draw distances of up to 30 kilometers .
This gives a very natural sense of vertigo when launching a four wheeler hundreds of feet into the air as the camera angles downward , at some points showing off the entire mountain range .
Now , when we say hundreds of feet in the air , we mean it , because Black Rock wants you to have the most fun possible when navigating elaborate tracks like Timber Falls .
Their goal is to create an “ exaggerated reality , " by letting players acquire ridiculous heights , and busting out some sick tricks while hanging amongst the clouds .
But you wo n’t be pulling off no - hand supermans from the get go , as the game challenges you to start off with simpler maneuvers first using the A button , and after nailing a few of those , working your way up into the expert tricks using Y .
Do n’t believe for a second that Black Rock as gone all Tony Hawk on us , as tricks will factor into your racing performance through a boost meter that will fill during your skilled acrobatics .
Pressing the X button at any time will allow you kick things into high gear , leaving your opponents with plenty of individually rendered pebbles flying into their faces .
So as you can see , the stunt system is married to the racing gameplay by having it earn you that extra edge over the competition .
If you do happen to take a spill , and there was plenty of that going on during our initial play session , the game keeps the action rolling forward by restarting you moving at full speed , so there ‘s never a slow moment during a race .
Adding more depth to the concept of boosting are the many branching paths found throughout each of the tracks .
Certain routes will contain more jumps , and thus opportunities for you maximize your boost meter .
Heading in another direction however will lead to a shortcut , albeit one that can contain thick mud such as in our race on Timber falls , which did enjoyably adhere to our rider but also slowed us down , causing the need for , you guessed it , boosting .
We were told that boosting is also key to exploration , giving you that extra push off of a jump to areas you may not have been able to reach otherwise .
This not only adds a bit of a quasi- platforming element to the game , but also gives you motivation to return to the same tracks and search for better ways of racing them .
In case some of you MotoGP fans were beginning to think that because of this lighter approach to racing , ride customization would not be included , you thought wrong , quite wrong .
Since ATVs are generally composed of far fewer parts then say an Ilmor GP , the team decided to start you with nothing more than a bare metal frame , and let the choices take off from there .
Utilizing a wide array of real world licensed parts that have effects on a bike ’s five different performance attributes , players can conjure up nearly 60,000 different variations of custom ATV ’s that can be used in any of the games single or multiplayer modes .
Now if you ’re like me , and your experience with ATVs only goes as far as a videogame , there is an option to automatically tune your ride and lean the construction towards competing in different modes such as race or freestyle .
For the real hardcore , Black Rock told us that the customization feature can be used with in an even more precise manner by designing bikes with specific tracks in mind .
Players can only begin creating so many different rides at first , but will unlock more garage space as they progress in the world tour mode .
During our playtime , we found Pure to be fairly easy to pick up and start racing , with realistic handling and sliding on messy dirt roads that never left us crashing at every corner like a sim racer .
Accessibility aside , Pure is still coming with a wealth of customization options and surprisingly deep race - driven gameplay with the stunt and boosting system .
Black Rock looks to be crafting a complex , but not frustratingly complicated , off - road racer that should satisfy most gamers , as well as the people who are probably sitting on their ATV while reading this article .
Pure is slated to release September 2008 for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and PC .

For the upcoming Firefox 3.1 release a lot of work has been going into improving its CSS support ( specifically , in relation to the CSS 3 specification ) .
One areas that have received solid implementations is that of border - image .
This is a new CSS 3 module that makes the exact slicing of images ( and their positioning around an element ) quite easy .
The most obvious use case for them exists in constructing beautiful scalable buttons .
And there is , perhaps , no better use case than the one provided by the iui library : replicating portions of the iPhone user interface in a pure - CSS manner .
Here are two examples from the iui library ( slightly tweaked to support both WebKit ’s and Mozilla ’s implementations of border - image ) .
You will need a nightly release of Firefox in order to have the following demos work properly .
The button on the top right ( “ Search ” ) is mostly implemented using the following CSS :
border - width : 0 5 0 5 ; - webkit-border-image : url( toolButton.png ) 0 5 0 5 stretch stretch ; - moz- border-image : url( toolButton.png ) 0 5 0 5 stretch stretch ;
With toolButton.png looking like :
The premise behind border - image is complex , but easy to learn .
When used in the manner shown above you are , effectively , providing slice offsets into the provided image – telling the browser how to position the slices .
For example the 5s in the border - width and border - image indicate that there should be a 5 px - wide border on the left and right of the button .
The contents of the border should be populated with the left and right - most 5 pixels from toolButton.png .
Since a horizontal border width value is provided it is possible to scale the contents of the button horizontally ( inserting more contents will allow it to continue to work properly ) .
The 0s , on the other hand , indicate that entirety of the button background should be consumed by toolButton . png – and that none of it should be used to show the border ( border - image can be used as a crude mechanism for injecting background images ) .
Because of this the image wo n’t be able to gracefully scale vertically .
CSS3 .info provides another example that shows how the stretching and rounding work .
with the following base image :
Rounding :
Stretching :
By tweaking the stretching of the border - image you can end up with some truly - compelling results .
We can see another one in a second iui button :
With the following CSS being used :
- webkit- border - image : url( whiteButton.png ) 0 12 0 12 stretch stretch ; - moz- border-image : url( whiteButton.png ) 0 12 0 12 stretch stretch ;
together with this base image :
border - image has a large number of compelling use cases .
It ’s fantastic to see some coordinated efforts by browser vendors to make their implementations common - place .
In the first presidential election since the death of Hunter S. Thompson , we finally realize what we 've lost
On Election Day in 2004 , Hunter S. Thompson put down his tumbler of Wild Turkey and put forth a proclamation .
Writing in his weekly espn.com sports column , “ Hey Rube , ” he laid out a high - stakes bet : “ Kerry will win big today .
I guarantee it .
The evil Bush family of central Texas is about to suffer another humiliating failure on another disastrous election day . ”
By nightfall in Woody Creek , Colorado , he ’d be proven wrong .
And , by the following February , just 110 days later , he ’d be dead .
There you have it .
On top of everything else they ’ve blighted over their awful eight - year reign , the Bushies did this : they killed Hunter S. Thompson .
Yes , of course , he killed himself .
( In fact , he ’d talked about suicide his whole life .
In 1977 , in the introduction to The Great Shark Hunt , he fantasized about defenestrating himself , musing that he ’d already lived “ 13 years longer ” than he ’d planned .
By the time he perched himself on a stool above his IBM Selectric and put a .45 pistol in his mouth , he was all but paralyzed .
Paralyzed physically by increasing decrepitude — hip replacement , back surgery , broken leg — and paralyzed professionally by the Gonzo caricature he ’d created .
It was time to go . )
But , say some who knew him , darkness finally fell when America ignored that last fleeting chance for a course correction in 2004 , willfully re-electing that “ treacherous little freak . ”
“ I did start to worry about him right after the Bush election , ” says his second wife , Anita , in producer - director Alex Gibney ’s excellent new documentary film , Gonzo : The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson .
“ That , I think , was a trigger . ”
“ I think it broke his heart , ” says William McKeen , author of the new biography Outlaw Journalist : The Life and Times of Hunter S. Thompson ( W.W. Norton ) , by phone from Florida .
“ [ Thompson ’s literary executor , Douglas ]
Brinkley said he stopped even joking .
He just went into a really dark , foul mood .
A couple of other friends blamed the suicide on the political climate .
Hunter could n’t live in that country anymore . ”
And so we find ourselves , one week after what would have been the good doctor ’s 71st birthday ( July 18 ) , muddling through the first post–Hunter S. Thompson presidential election .
We find ourselves missing his political voice — and wishing he was around to see the Crawford crowd finally slink away .
In Gonzo , Thompson ’s first wife , Sandy , rues his suicide .
It was not a “ courageous act , ” as some called it , she says .
It was cowardly .
And it robbed America of an inimitable voice at a crucial moment .
“ This is a time when a together Hunter Thompson could make a difference in this country . ”
Could he ?
Thompson was deeply invested in the idea of the American dream .
( Even if he never did quite figure out what it was . )
He was an idealist who learned the hard way how to be a cynic .
And he could write , right until the end .
But his best work , arguably , was behind him .
His celebrity and outré personality had long since prevented him from reporting the way he did in works such as his stone classic Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’ 72 .
Most of his latter writing issued forth from the kitchen of his Colorado compound — “ Rants , Ravings , and Missives from the Mountaintop ” as the subtitle of The Mutineer , the third and final collection of his letters ( due out next year ) puts it .
What would the “ Sage of Woody Creek ” make of this year ’s election ?
Would his words have resonance in this blog - besotted age ?
What , ultimately , is Thompson ’s legacy ?
Who , if anyone , could take up his mantle ?
And what could a hypothetical young and hungry Hunter S. Thompson achieve in this corporatized , consolidated - media climate , anyway ?
Contemplating these questions , all McKeen can say is , “ It ’s very difficult to get through an election year without him . ”
Type ‘A ’
On November 22 , 1963 , a 26 - year - old Thompson pounded out a letter to his friend William J. Kennedy ( no relation to the president ) .
That day ’s events had struck him dumb .
“ I have become like a psychotic sphinx — I want to kill because I ca n’t talk . ”
But he could write .
“ Fiction is dead , ” he declared .
“ The only hope now is to swing hard with the right hand , while hanging onto sanity with the left .
Politics will become a cockfight , and reason will go by the boards . ”
For the next four decades , Thompson wrote about politicians with words and wit the world had seldom seen .
• In 1964 , he wrote to the new president to ask for a job : “ Dear Lyndon , It is with great pleasure and a sense of impending achievement that I make myself available at this time for the governorship of American Samoa . ”
• He described Hubert Humphrey , who stepped into the void left by Johnson in ’ 68 , as “ a rat in heat . . . [ a ] shallow , contemptible and hopelessly dishonest old hack ” who “ should be castrated . ”
• Nixon , Thompson ’s career - long bête noire , was “ a monument to all the rancid genes and broken chromosomes that corrupt the possibilities of the American Dream . . . a foul caricature of himself , a man with no soul , no inner convictions , with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad . ”
US Oil Consumption Falls Back To 2002 Level
For most of the post - WWII era US oil consumption went up year after year .
One deviation from that came in the early 1980s .
An even longer lasting and probably permanent deviation from that trend is developing .
Americans have traveled back in a sort of time machine to 2002 levels of oil usage .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration revised downward U.S. April oil demand by 863,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) to 19.77 million bpd -- 3.9 percent below year - ago levels .
The revision , which showed April demand was the lowest for the month since April 2002 , came even before gasoline prices surged to new records in June .
But on a per capita basis the reduction in oil usage is even larger since the US population grows about 1 % per year .
So has US oil usage per capita gone down 10 % since 2002 ?
Can someone check me on this ?
Back in 1959 the United States used about 6 million barrels of oil per day .
The US had a population of about 150.5 million in 1950 versus about 304.4 million at the time of this writing .
Okay , with 2 times more people we would use almost 12 million barrels a day if we used oil at the same rate as in 1950 .
But we use about 20 million barrels a day .
So once prices go high enough to cut US demand by 8 million barrels a day we will have traveled back in time to 1950 in terms of oil usage .
A 1950 level of oil usage will be easier in the future than it was in 1950 because we have much more efficient cars and other higher efficiency equipment .
Plus , we have nuclear power plants , wind turbines , and other sources of non-fossil fuels energy .
As we hit each point of our future journey into our oil consumption past we will make other gains in technology for fossil fuel replacements .
Now , I do not expect those advances to come fast enough to prevent a decline in total per capita energy usage .
But those other energy sources will at least allow us to maintain an industrial society .
Update :
In the comments Donkatsu explains how far off our peak per capita oil consumption we 've already fallen :
The data tell the story , from 1998 , oil use per capita in the US has risen steadily from 25.06 barrels per person to a recent peak of 25.9 bbl / capita in 2004 .
In 2005 per capita consumption fell by about 0.6 % , falling further for the full years 2006 and 2007 to 97 % of the 2004 peak .
The 2008 levels , if maintained for the entire year , would put per capita oil consumption at about 91.6 % of the 2004 peak .
If you find yourself driving less , driving a smaller car , flying less , and otherwise using less energy since 2004 it is not surprising .
Update II : Vehicle traffic is down on New York City bridges and tunnels .
In May , with gasoline at more than $ 4 a gallon , traffic at the Metropolitan Transportation Authoritys bridges and tunnels dropped 4.7 percent compared with the same month the previous year .
Preliminary data for June shows a similar decrease in traffic , and officials say the change is largely because of higher prices at the pump .
But public transit ridership is up .
Weekday subway ridership was up 6.5 percent in April , compared with the same month a year ago .
April ridership increased 5.5 percent on the Long Island Rail Road , 4.3 percent on the Metro - North Railroad and almost 9 percent on PATH trains between Manhattan and New Jersey .
Use of the subways and rail lines also increased in May , compared with the previous year , but in most cases by smaller amounts .
New Jersey Transit ridership , including bus , commuter rail and light rail , was up about 4.6 percent in April and May combined .
When gasoline hits $ 6 per gallon the trains and buses will be full .
The meltdown in the subprime mortgage market has caused a great deal of turmoil in the financial markets and hardship for individual homeowners and financial institutions .
It prompted the Federal Reserve to take unprecedented actions to support the markets , one of which raises very difficult public policy issues .
I will return to the Federal Reserve , but first I will make some general comments .
I believe that too much is being made of the current problems in the financial and real estate markets .
This is probably due to three ...

Colorado for Equal Rights , an organization backing a measure on the Colorado ballot that would define a person in the state ’s Constitution as “ any human being from the moment of fertilization , ” has released a list of over 70 physicians and pharmacists from around the United States who agree that a person includes any human from the moment of conception .
" We are honored to have received these endorsements from such respected physicians , " stated Kristi Burton , head of Colorado for Equal Rights .
" Science clearly proves that life begins at the time of fertilization .
We are secure in the fact that we have science and reason on our side , and we are pleased to have the medical community supporting our efforts . "
" As support for Amendment 48 accumulates , we are very encouraged as we get closer to November 's election , " Burton said .
" Every human life should be protected , and the endorsements we continue to receive prove that our easy to understand amendment is one that all Coloradans can support . "
The group needed to collect 76,000 signatures to put the amendment on the ballot in November and succeeded in doing so on May 31 with 103,000 signatures .

Thermal compound is necessary to create a reliable transfer of heat from your computer 's processor to its heatsink to keep your CPU from overheating .
Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound does this with three unique shapes and sizes of pure silver particles to maximize particle - to - particle contact area and thermal transfer .
It 's optimized for use between modern high - power CPUs and high - performance heatsinks or water - cooling solutions .
This 3.5 - gram tube contains enough compound to cover at least 15 to 25 small CPU cores , or 6 to 10 large CPU cores , or 2 to 5 heat plates .
Note :
This is an OEM ( Original Equipment Manufacturer ) version , which includes the product , but nothing else .
They are packaged generically and are best suited for system builders who do n't require documentation or bundled accessories .
Made With 99.9 % Pure Silver Arctic Silver 5 uses three unique shapes and sizes of pure silver particles to maximize particle - to - particle contact area and thermal transfer .
High - Density Arctic Silver 5 contains over 88 % thermally conductive filler by weight .
In addition to micronized silver , Arctic Silver 5 also contains sub-micron zinc oxide , aluminum oxide and boron nitride particles .
These thermally - enhanced ceramic particles improve the compound 's performance and long - term stability .
Controlled Triple - Phase Viscosity *
The exclusive mixture of advanced polysynthetic oils ( No silicone is included ) work together to provide three distinctive functional phases .
Firstly , it will be applied to the CPU easily through a push of the plunger of the syringe .
Then the compound thins out to enhance the filling of the microscopic valleys and ensure the best physical contact between the heatsink and the CPU core .
Finally the compound thickens slightly over the next 50 to 200 hours of use to its final consistency designed for long - term stability .
Not Electrically Conductive Arctic Silver 5 was formulated to conduct heat , not electricity .
( While much safer than electrically conductive silver and copper greases , Arctic Silver 5 should be kept away from electrical traces , pins , and leads .
While it is not electrically conductive , the compound is very slightly capacitive and could potentially cause problems if it bridges two close - proximity electrical paths . )
Absolute Stability Arctic Silver 5 will not separate , run , migrate , or bleed .
Performance 3 to 12 degrees centigrade lower CPU full load core temperatures than standard thermal compounds or thermal pads when measured with a calibrated thermal diode imbedded in the CPU core .
Coverage Area A 3.5 gram syringe contains enough compound to cover at least 15 to 25 small CPU cores , or 6 to 10 large CPU cores , or 2 to 5 heat plates .
At a layer 0.003 " thick , the 3.5 gram syringe will cover approximately 16 square inches .
Important Reminder
Due to the unique shapse and sizes of the particles in Arctic Silver 5 's conductive matrix , it will take up to 200 hours and several thermal cycles to achieve maximum particle to particle thermal conduction and for the heatsink to CPU interface to reach maximum conductivity ( This period will be longer in a system without a fan on the heatsink or with a low speed fan on the heatsink . ) .
On systems measuring actual internal core temperatures via the CPU 's internal diode , the measured temperature will often drop 2 to 5 °C over this " break - in " period .
This break - in will occur during the normal use of the computer as long as the computer is turned off from time to time and the interface is allowed to cool to room temperature .
Once the break - in is complete , the computer can be left on if desired .
Caution
We do not recommend using Arctic Silver 5 on the older slot type Intel Xeon processors with large multiple square inch CPU to heatsink interfaces .
The huge contact area and large gaps between the processor and the heatsink require a thermal pad or thick mesh - reinforced paste .
Arctic Silver 5 can be used on socket type Xeons without a problem .
* This should not be confused with conventional phase change pads that are pre-attached to many heatsinks .
Those pads melt each time they get hot then re-solidify when they cool .
The viscosity changes that Arctic Silver 5 goes through are much more subtle and ultimately much more effective .
In fact , one of my major professors in undergraduate once stated to me point blank , " If I did n't believe in the Bible , evolution is the only plausible explanation for life .
" When people 's jobs depend on their believing a certain way , they will on average tend to keep believing it , but I can't help but think the professor was tipping his cap a bit to his actual assessment of the evidence by that statement .
My professor made that statement back in the 1980s .
Since then , the evidence has continued to roll in by the truckload .
The only thing that seems to keep pace with it is the amount of willful denial of the facts by stubborn or misguided creationists .
I try to keep track of the basic arguments for creationism and for it's bastard stepchild , Intelligent Design , so it was a surprise for me to see a post by DaveScot on Uncommon Descent ( an ID blog ) that tried to jiujitsu some of the strongest evidence for common descent by means of natural selection ( which ID believes in to a degree not completely specified , but does n't really believe completely explains every last detail ) into an argument for intelligent design .
DaveScot makes a startling and sort of shocking admission far down the post :
Dave evidently is so ignorant he fails to distinguish between design and selection .
For example .
The wind blows .
Which grains of sand will become blown dust that will pile up ?
The biggest ones or the smallest ones ?
Is the wind designing a sand dune ?
Yet DaveScot can't see that a sand dune is both non-random and not designed .
DaveScot makes a common fallacy that infuses bad thinking on the ID / Creationist side .
There is no dichotomous state between randomness and design .
There are things that were partly designed that have been subjected to random degeneration .
If you throw your watch off a cliff , are you designing how it breaks ?
No .
Do you intend it to break ?
Probably .
Is a Jackson Pollock painting designed or random ?
The answer is both .
The painting has elements of randomness that are designed .
Our genomes are the very best evidence for exactly how life works .
It is a hodgepodge , a mishmash with elements of non-random natural selection vying for space with " parasitic " elements of the genome that do not actively create fitness for the organism ( that we are currently aware of ) .
The best example of this mixture is the phenomenon of viral insertions into the genome .
The virus that strikes fear in the hearts of most people who break a condom is HIV .
HIV is a retrovirus , which means that it has an enzyme , reverse transcriptase , which has a job to move the genome of the virus into the DNA strands of the host cell that it has infected .
HIV does this all the time which is one of the reasons it is so difficult to eradicate or control .
The only uses of reverse transcriptase are the movement of gene sequences from one place to the other .
They do not play a role in physiological processes of the body .
Patients on drugs which suppress the activity of reverse transcriptase live reasonably long lives if the drugs work ( Magic Johnson is , I imagine , on them ) .
Occasionally a retrovirus like HIV will insert itself into an egg cell of a mammal and become non-virulent but still replicate .
It can place copies of itself or parts of itself back into the genome over time .
These are called Endogenous Retroviruses ( ERVs ) .
ERVs show all the protein sequences of the original virus , but over time the original sequences degrade .
Some become Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements and Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements ( LINEs and SINEs ) .
Between them , ERVs , LINEs and SINEs make up about 8 % of the human genome .
The protein coded for most commonly in the human genome is reverse transcriptase .
The LINEs and SINEs are genetic elements that are remnants of retroviral insertions .
They are not used by our bodies or brains in any fashion we are aware of , although endogenous retroviruses appear to have played a role in the development of viviparity ( the ability to give live birth ) .
DaveScot thinks this is evidence that God is a genetic engineer who tinkers with genomes .
I am curious what John 's argument from the scale of the universe would do with that deity .
But the real treat on the DaveScot post is further down .
In the comments section , there 's a link there to an absoluteof a paper written by a very honest creationist named Todd Charles Wood .
Todd believes in Noah 's flood and thus believes that all of life descended from fixed kinds that existed less than 6000 years ago as pairs .
Thus he talks about baraminology , which is the creationist term for the study of " kinds " and how they modify over time .
But it gets better .
Todd examines the similarities between the chimp and human genomes .
He carefully goes over the available evidence and comes out with this amazing statement :
Todd knows that species are n't fixed .
That 's got to be the case since there are more species alive today than could possibly have fit on the ark .
But he 's like my professor .
The Bible comes first .
This position forces
Todd into the amazing statement that follows :
When the facts are in your favor , argue the facts .
When the law is in your favor , argue the law .
When the law and the facts are n't in your favor , bang the table .
In this case , Todd can't believe his senses , because the Bible tells him otherwise .
So the Bible must be right , even though there 's no evidence there to back it up .
At least Todd is honest .
The entire premise of Intelligent Design is that it is different from modern science .
Yet Ben Stein 's film showed not one example of someone doing good scientific work that was contributing to a viable research program who lost a job because of it .
The job of scientists is to make valuable contributions .
A major difficulty in trying to make a valuable contribution to a field is not believing in its central points .
Imagine trying to get a job at CERN if you did n't believe quantum mechanics was true .
Imagine trying to get a job at NASA if you thought the moon landing was faked .
Imagine trying to get a job as a dentist if you thought that cavities came from masturbation .
That 's all Ben Stein had to show in his film , with the exception of the insipid Hitler porn , and he tried to claim that it was discrimination .
Ben did n't even have the honesty of Todd , who I hope one day quits trying to defend the indefensible .
I hope this examination of ID and creationism can show the tip of the iceberg that changed my mind .
Alex McKay recalls being startled when the 13 - year - old boys he was addressing in a Toronto sex-education class began peppering him with graphic questions .
“ A lot of the questions , I soon realized , revolved around these young boys having looked at pornography , ” said Mr. McKay , research director for the Sex Information and Education Council of Canada .
The boys were preoccupied with how well - endowed the male porn stars were , not to mention their bizarre habit of ejaculating on their partners ’ faces .
“ What a lot of their questions boiled down to was , ‘ Is what I ’m seeing in the porn that I ’m watching what sex is really supposed to be like ?
Is this how I am supposed to behave ? ’ ” Mr. McKay recalled .
The proliferation of online porn means the sorts of questions Mr. McKay first encountered at the dawn of the Internet age in the 1990s arise ever more frequently as teens and even preteens come into contact with sexually explicit images .
Despite parents ’ best efforts to shield their children , about 40 % of those aged 10 to 17 are exposed to online pornography , one recent U.S. study found .
Porn has moved from dingy bookshops to the mainstream , a trend reflected in the opening scene of last year ’s comedy hit Superbad , in which the high - school - age characters discuss the merits of various hard - core Web sites .
To researchers at Brigham Young University , today ’s youth are “ Generation XXX . ”
Their study of students at six U.S. universities found that viewing porn has become as accepted an activity as having a few beers at the pub .
“ Results suggest that pornography is a prominent feature of the current emerging adulthood culture , ” the authors wrote .
Less clear is how this growing pastime is affecting sexual relationships .
Mr. McKay said parents and educators need to do a better job preparing children for the new age .
“ The Internet ’s not going away , and pornography is certainly not going away , so the pertinent question is how are we teaching young people to deal with it , and that ’s a question that most people do n’t want to ask , ” he said .
Kim Martyn does not shy away from the subject in her job promoting sexual health to youth for Toronto Public Health .
She has worked in the field for 25 years and says there is nothing new about young guys learning from pornography ; what has changed is that the images are so readily available , and they are “ more raw , more hardcore . ”
Ms. Martyn worries about the detrimental effect such content has on young viewers lacking sexual experience and media awareness .
“ I do n’t think that serves them well in terms of their relationships and what they expect from themselves , ” she said .
In her teaching , she introduces the subject of pornography to students as early as Grade 5 , advising them how to deal with unwanted exposure to porn .
“ We talk about pop-ups and what to do with that , ” she said .
It is better they be prepared , she reasons , “ than ashamed and scared to tell someone that this is on the computer . ”
She is also troubled by the hateful nature of the pornography kids are most likely to stumble across in a cyber world where women are routinely referred to as sluts and bitches .
“ The cheap stuff is often the worst stuff in terms of misogyny , in terms of using images of really young girls , ” she said .
“ None of that serves to inform young people , male or female , what healthy sexuality is about . ”
Despite inhabiting a hyper - sexualized — some have called it “ pornified ” — world , today ’s youth are not necessarily better informed , Ms. Martyn said .
“ They might know there ’s something called anal sex .
They might know something about oral sex . …
They all know about transgender , ” she said .
“ But they do n’t know the basic stuff relevant to them .
They do n’t know how you can tell if someone likes you .
They still have no clue in terms of when you know if you ’re ready to have sex . ”
Francine Duquet is a professor of sexology at Université du Québec à Montréal researching the hyper- sexualization of teenagers .
It was not that long ago that magazines showing a little too much flesh were stopped at the border , and you had to be 18 to purchase the relatively tame likes of Playboy .
Now she comes across children whose natural curiosity has led them to porn sites featuring bestiality and group sex .
Children aged 13 and 14 ask whether sex necessarily involves three orifices , she said .
“ What we have to make young people understand is that sexual relations are , above all , relations with another person .
It is not a matter of genital acrobatics .
I always tell young people that it ’s not the Cirque du Soleil of sex .
It ’s a relationship with another person who has his modesty , history , desire and limits , ” she said .
“ It ’s not just a matter of orifices and appendages . ” Sylvain Boies , a psychologist in Victoria , was one of the first researchers to begin looking at the effect of Internet pornography .
In a 2002 survey of Canadian university students , he found that more than 40 % used the Internet for sexual entertainment , and that nearly half of those had started at age 16 or younger .
He suspects those numbers have only gone up with the spread of the Internet .
“ Adolescence is a period of exploration .
That ’s very normal , ” he said .
“ At the same time , it creates the foundation for intimacy .
It sets the tone for how they will create deeper affiliations with other people .
Certainly , if the images of intimacy and sexuality that they see are pornographic versus even erotic , that creates for a lot of young men … the idea that women are always ready and available and want sex all the time .
That ’s what they see in the images . ”
He witnesses this phenomenon among men in his practice .
“ There is a whole industry telling them what their sexuality is about , ” he said .
“ Consumers of pornography start believing that ’s what sex is about .
What is removed is the intimacy . ”
In a 2003 article in New York magazine , feminist writer Naomi Wolf described the effects of the new porn culture on young women .
“ Now you have to offer — or flirtatiously suggest — the lesbian scene , the ejaculate - in - the - face scene , ” she wrote .
“ Being naked is not enough ; you have to be buff , be tan with no tan lines , have the surgically hoisted breasts and the Brazilian bikini wax — just like porn stars . ”
She recounted conversations with college - age women who feel “ that they can never measure up , that they can never ask for what they want ; and if they do not offer what porn offers , they can not expect to hold a guy . ”

" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 06 - Contexts
2015-02-25
my @a = < a b c > ; my $ x = @a ; say $ x [ 2 ] ; # c say ( ~2 ) .
WHAT ; # ( Str ) say +@a ; # 3 if @a < 10 { say " short array " ; }
When you write something like this
$x = @a
in Perl 5 , $x contains less information than @a - it contains only the number of items in @a .
To preserve all information , you have to explicitly take a reference : $ x = \@a .
In Perl 6 it 's the other way round : by default you do n't lose anything , the scalar just stores the array .
This was made possible by introducing a generic item context ( called scalar in Perl 5 ) and more specialized numeric , integer and string contexts .
Void and List context remain unchanged , though void context is now called sink context .
You can force contexts with special syntax .
syntax context ~ stuff String ? stuff Bool ( logical ) + stuff Numeric - stuff Numeric ( also negates ) $ ( stuff ) Generic item context @ ( stuff )
List context %( stuff )
Hash context
In Perl 5 , list context always flattens out arrays ( but not array references ) .
In Perl 6 , this is not always the case , and depends on the context :
my @a = 1 , 2 ; my @b = 3 , 4 , 5 ; my @c = @a , @b ; # preserves structure say @c.perl ; # [ [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] ] @c = flat @a , @b ; say @c.perl ; # [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
You can force flattening list context yourself by using * @a in a signature :
sub flat - elems ( * @a ) { return @a.elems } ; say flat - elems ( @a , @b ) ; # 5
More specific contexts are a way to delay design choices .
For example it seems premature to decide what a list should return in scalar context - a reference to the list would preserve all information , but is n't very useful in numeric comparisons .
On the other hand a string representation might be most useful for debugging purposes .
So every possible choice disappoints somebody .
With more specific context you do n't need to make this choice - it returns some sensible default , and all operators that do n't like this choice can simply evaluate the object a more specific context .
For some things ( like the Match object ) , the different contexts really enhance their usefulness and beauty .

Bloomberg is reporting Banks ' Subprime Losses Top $ 500 Billion on Writedowns .
Bloomberg ( and others ) keep referring to this as if it was a " subprime " problem .
The reality is this was an unsustainable worldwide credit boom of epic proportion .
Let 's now take a look at the article .
Banks ' losses from the U.S. subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the $ 500 billion mark as writedowns spread to more asset types .
The writedowns and credit losses at more than 100 of the world 's biggest banks and securities firms rose after UBS AG reported second - quarter earnings today , which included $ 6 billion of charges on subprime - related assets .
The International Monetary Fund in an April report estimated banks ' losses at $ 510 billion , about half its forecast of $ 1 trillion for all companies .
Predictions have crept up since then , with New York University economist Nouriel Roubini predicting losses to reach $ 2 trillion .
" It just keeps spreading from one asset to another , so it 's hard to know when these writedowns will stop , " said Makeem Asif , an analyst at KBC Financial Products in London .
" The U.S. economy needs to stabilize first .
But even then , Europe could lag and recover later .
There 's still a lot more downside . "
Auction - rate securities have begun adding to the losses as regulators and prosecutors force banks to buy back bonds they 'd sold as safe investments .
UBS set aside $ 900 million to cover potential losses from repurchasing the securities , while Citigroup Inc. and Wachovia Corp. estimated losses at $ 500 million each .

The chemical industry is not happy because the EU is forcing them to list all chemicals and prove that they are safe rather than the US model where the government has to prove unknown ( and unlisted ) chemicals are dangerous .
As it stands today , the burden of proof is stacked against researchers and consumer groups .
The chemical industry is obviously happy with the US model which is why they are furious with the details of this new study from the University of Washington .
The study claims that many household products far exceed safe levels of toxic chemicals despite what the chemical industry says .
Trouble is , you have no way of knowing it .
Manufacturers of detergents , laundry sheets and air fresheners are n’t required to list all of their ingredients on their labels — or anywhere else .
Laws protecting people from indoor air pollution from consumer products are limited .
When UW engineering professor Anne Steinemann analyzed of some of these popular items , she found 100 different volatile organic compounds measuring 300 parts per billion or more — some of which can be cancerous or cause harm to respiratory , reproductive , neurological and other organ systems .
Some of the chemicals are categorized as hazardous or toxic by federal regulatory agencies .
But the labels tell a different story , naming only innocuous - sounding “ perfume ” or “ biodegradable ” contents .
“ Consumers are breathing these chemicals , ” she said .
“ No one is doing anything about it . ”
Industry representatives say that is n’t so .
“ Dr. Steinemann ’s statement is misleading and disingenuous , ” said Chris Cathcart , president of the Washington , D.C. - based Consumer Specialty Products Association , in a statement .
BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - Part of Argentina ’s Perito Moreno glacier collapsed on Wednesday , the first time large chunks of ice have broken off during the southern hemisphere winter .
Park wardens said global warming might be responsible .
The Patagonian glacier known as the “ White Giant ” is one of Argentina ’s biggest attractions .
The river of ice 18 miles ( 30 km ) long ends in a sheer wall blocking Lago Argentino where large pieces tumble into the water from time to time .
Tourists and locals visited the site in recent days , hoping to catch a glimpse of the rare spectacle , but only a few were on the observation deck when the roof of an ice tunnel caved in early on Wednesday , a National Glaciers Park official said .
“ It ’s the first time the glacier ’s broken in winter ( since records began ) , ” park warden Carlos Corvalan said earlier this week , when the glacier started to crack .
Wednesday 's rupture occurred after several days of partial break - ups , according to the provincial government 's Perito Moreno Web site , www.lupacorp.com/glaciar/us/.
The glacier sheds ice roughly every four years , and the last time big ice chunks fell off was March 2006 .
Argentina ’s Glaciers
Park is home to more than 200 glaciers and is the biggest continental ice extension in the world after Antarctica , according to the park ’s Web site .
Australian researchers have developed a new fuel cell prototype that could lead to much cheaper , more efficient fuel cell vehicles in the near future .
Scientists at Monash University in Melbourne created a new cathode that could bypass the need for expensive platinum nanoparticles , which adds about $ 3500 to $ 4000 to the sticker price of current fuel cells .
Advertisement
The team says its new cathode , made of a conductive plastic called PEDOT , could be manufactured for just several hundred dollars .
Even better , PEDOT is much more stable than platinum and does n't have platinum 's pesky clumping problems or aversion to carbon monoxide .
The researchers are now planning on building fuel cells with the cathode in 3D , to maximize the surface area available to generate a current .
With this new breakthrough and the solar - charged process engineered by MIT scientists a few days ago , it 's been kind of an awesome week for fuel cell science .

In 1829 , Jacob Bigelow , Harvard ’s Rumford Professor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences , published a widely read treatise titled “ Elements of Technology , ” which popularized the term “ technology ” in something like its current sense .
In 1861 , the year that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was founded , telegraph wires reached across the continent .
( “ May the Union be Perpetual ” was the heartbreaking sentiment from California , on the eve of four years of devastating civil war . )
The following year , Congress authorized construction of the transcontinental railroad .
( The golden spike linking the Eastern and the Western lines was driven into the ground in Utah , in 1869 . )
When Bigelow delivered an address at M.I.T. , in 1865 , he marvelled at how the world had changed in the three decades since he had published his “ Elements of Technology . ”
War had torn the United States apart , but trains and telegraphs promised to tie it together again : everywhere , technology was changing everything for the better , saving the Union , making us who we are .
To Bigelow ’s generation , technology seemed to be driving , and even redeeming , the course of human events .
His M.I.T. address reveals something more , too : the close alignment between nineteenth - century Americans ’ sense of their manifest destiny to settle the continent and their faith in their machines ’ ability to help them do it .
Jacob Bigelow ’s faith was not clockwork Deism but mechanical millenarianism .
“ Next to the influence of Christianity on our moral nature , ” he said , technology “ has had a leading sway in promoting the progress and happiness of our race . ”
Awestruck wonder at machine - driven , millennial progress animated the nineteenth century the way the obsession with innovation animates American culture today .
It ’s what Perry Miller called the “ technological sublime . ”
In prints and paintings , “ Progress ” was pictured as a steam - powered locomotive , chugging across the continent , unstoppable .
Inventors and the people who operated their inventions abounded .
( The occupation “ engineer ” first appeared in the U.S. Census in 1850 . )
“ Men of Progress , ” they were called , and “ Conquerors of Nature . ”
The genius of Eli Whitney was said to rival that of Shakespeare .
More usually , the triumph of the sciences over the arts was figured as the defeat of the ancients by the moderns : the head of the U.S. Patent Office declared the steamship “ a mightier epic ” than the Iliad , and any fool could see that James Watt had a thing or two on Cicero .
Surely the eccentricities of genius were to be smiled upon .
( Klein , who writes of these men with much the same fervor as the head of the Patent Office , practically sighs with relief when their needy wives and children get out of the way of progress : John Fitch , an inventor of the steamboat , marries a woman who “ nagged him constantly until Fitch , unaware that his wife was again pregnant , carried out his threat to leave ” ; Joseph Henry is lucky to find a “ quiet , supportive wife who made his home a safe haven . ” )
No nineteenth - century inventor was more prolific than Thomas Edison , no career more epic .
( Klein assures us that Edison , after the premature death of an unhappy first wife who “ found solace in eating , ” married a nineteen - year - old girl who dutifully undertook “ the difficult task of learning the role of wife to a famous man . ” )
Edison filed his first patent , for an automatic vote - recording machine , in 1868 .
When he set up his laboratory at Menlo Park , in 1876 , he promised “ a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every six months or so . ”
He kept that promise , averaging an almost inconceivable forty patents a year — one every nine days — for a lifetime total of more than a thousand .
He filed his patent for the incandescent light bulb in 1879 , but 1882 , the year he lit up New York , marked his personal best of a hundred and seven .
Given the pace and scale of technological change , and the enthusiasm for it , it ’s no wonder that , in Edison ’s age , the past , the present , and the future seemed to be linked together by an unending chain of machines .

“ There is no end to machinery , ” the Scotsman Thomas Carlyle wrote in his 1829 essay “ Signs of the Times . ”
Carlyle dubbed those times “ the Age of Machinery , ” about which he was less than sanguine .
The world begins to look like one great machine , “ the Machine of Society , ” he observed .
“ Considered merely as a metaphor , all this is well enough , ” he went on .
“ But here , as in so many other cases , the ‘ foam hardens itself into a shell , ’ and the shadow we have wantonly evoked stands terrible before us and will not depart at our bidding . ”
The worship of the mechanical was , to Carlyle , something akin to religious delusion ( “ our true Deity is Mechanism ” ) , one he compared to seventeenth - century New Englanders ’ belief in witchcraft .
“ Practically considered , our creed is Fatalism ; and , free in hand and foot , we are shackled in heart and soul . ”
We may be blind to those shackles , blinded , as he put it , by a fog as thick as London ’s , but we are just as surely “ fettered by chains of our own forging . ”
In 1831 , in an essay in the North American Review , an Ohio lawyer named Timothy Walker offered one of many rebuttals to “ Signs of the Times . ”
Machines not only define us and drive progress , Walker argued ; by liberating the ordinary man from drudgery , they make a different kind of living possible .
In that sense , they drive democracy .
As the century progressed and the speed of change only increased , nearly everyone — critics and boosters , dystopians and utopians , on both sides of the Atlantic — seemed to agree that machines were driving history .
“ We do not ride upon the railroad ; it rides upon us , ” Thoreau wrote from Walden Pond .
The question was no longer whether machines were driving the course of human events but where .
Any answer to that question , of course , involved as much prophecy as history .
In 1848 , John Stuart Mill found it “ impossible not to look forward to a vast multiplication and long succession of contrivances for economizing labor and increasing its produce ; and to an ever wider diffusion of the use and benefit of those contrivances . ”
If the coercion of labor was brutal and unrelenting , if the era ’s economic development was uneven and unstable — there were several major depressions in the United States between 1819 and 1929 — these things , too , seemed only further consequences of technology .
In 1867 , Karl Marx argued , “ It would be possible to write quite a history of the inventions , made since 1830 , for the sole purpose of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working - class . ”
That was the gloomy version .
To Edward Bellamy , the future looked brighter .
In “ Looking Backward , ” Bellamy wrote about a man who fell asleep in May , 1887 , and woke up in September , 2000 , to find a socialist utopia in which the “ labor problem ” had been cured “ as the result of a process of industrial evolution which could not have terminated otherwise . ”
By the end of the nineteenth century , machines had become the yardstick by which Americans and Europeans measured the rest of the world , on a scale beginning with barbarity and ending with civilization .
If machines make us who we are , the lack of our machines makes other people different from us and , usually , lower down on the scale .
Consider James Mill ’s “ History of British India ” ( 1817 ) .
Mill ( John Stuart Mill ’s father ) believed that there was no better “ index of the degree in which the benefits of civilization are any where enjoyed , than the state of the [ society ’s ] tools and machinery . ”
The more machines , the higher the degree of civilization .
The fact that Mill had never been to India proved no obstacle to his demonstrating , in six volumes , that Indians were stalled near the lowest stage of development , just past barbarism — something that was easily measured by the state of their technology , which suffered from “ a great want of ingenuity and completeness in instruments and machinery . ”
For years , Mill ’s “ History ” was required reading for British civil servants heading to India , where regular steamboat service began running on the Ganges in 1834 ; by 1852 , news of the second Anglo - Burmese war was sent from Kedgeree to Calcutta along newly erected telegraph lines ; in the eighteen - sixties , the British promoted cotton manufacturing and the expansion of the railway — which grew from two hundred miles of track in 1857 to twenty - five thousand miles at the end of the century — when the American Civil War blocked supplies of American cotton .
( None of this has a place in Klein ’s account .
The Civil War does n’t happen in “ The Power Makers , ” and neither does the Indian Mutiny of 1857 .
Klein ’s fabled America is an island , unconnected to wars in Europe , unconnected to markets in India , unconnected to almost anything or anyone — with the notable exception of other inventors — outside the United States . )
Though money and matrimony have been linked since Genesis , marrying for health coverage is a more modern convention .
For today ’s couples , “ in sickness and in health ” may seem less a lover ’s troth than an actuarial contract .
They marry for better or worse , for richer or poorer , for co-pays and deductibles .
Bo and Dena McLain of Milford , Ohio , eloped in March so he could add her to his group policy because her nursing school required proof of insurance .
Corey Marshall and Kim Wetzel , who had dated in San Francisco for four years , moved up their wedding plans by a year so she could switch to his policy after her employer raised premiums
Ms. Brady and Mr. Huggins concede that their discussions about marriage have been freighted with cost - benefit analysis .
Ms. Brady learned three years ago that she had end - stage renal disease and after two years of dialysis received the transplant in May 2007 .
Her medical costs remain substantial and unpredictable .
The demands of dialysis forced her to give up a much - loved job as a store manager for the Body Shop , and she eventually lost her insurance .
She now receives a Social Security disability check of $ 1,181 a month , and spends $ 95 of that on premiums for Medicare , the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled , which insures kidney transplant patients for up to three years .
With Medicare covering only 80 percent of most charges , however , Ms. Brady still has been left with thousands of dollars in bills .
Until this spring , Ms. Brady filled the gaps with a supplemental policy bought from State Farm .
In April , she received notice that the premium was more than doubling , to $ 2,621 a quarter , from $ 1,180 .
Ms Betancourt urged an end to hurtful vocabulary towards the rebels
The recently freed Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt has urged an end to the Colombian government 's " vocabulary of hate " against her former captors .
Ms Betancourt , a former presidential candidate , was held hostage for six years by Marxist Farc rebels .
But , while praising President Alvaro Uribe 's work towards her release , she said it was time to end " extremist " language towards the Farc .
She told the BBC that she did not rule out running for president again .
" That could be a really nice dream , but I do n't think it 's the top of the dream , " she said .
She was speaking in Paris , where she flew after her release last Wednesday .

In a separate interview for French radio , she said : " I think we have reached a point where we must change this radical , extremist vocabulary of hate of very strong words that intimately wound the human being . "
Ms Betancourt is urging the government to take a more conciliatory tone towards the Farc to achieve further hostage releases , says BBC Americas analyst Warren Bull .
But she has no illusions about what she considers to be the group 's real nature , he adds .
Revenge fear
The 46 - year - old , who has dual Colombian and French nationality , said she would not return to Colombia immediately .
" I think one has to be clever , maybe it is not the time to go home , " Ms Betancourt said in another interview for Radio France International .
INGRID BETANCOURT
Born on 25 December 1961 Grows up in Paris 1989 : Returns to Colombia 1994 : Elected to lower house 1998 : Becomes a senator 2002 : Kidnapped by Farc rebels
Colombia 's continuing hostage pain " The Farc have taken a huge blow , they could probably want some kind of revenge or do something to regain a certain prestige , so I think it is best to be careful . "
Ms Betancourt was campaigning for Colombia 's presidency when she was captured by the Farc ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) in 2002 .
Speaking to French radio , she did not rule out resuming her political career at some stage but said the time was not yet right .
She said she wished to serve Colombia with all her heart , but that at present it was " too early to talk of such things " .
Ms Betancourt has become a celebrity in France , and is due to receive a Legion of Honour medal from President Nicolas Sarkozy next week .
She has said that she plans to write a play about her experience of being held hostage by the left - wing rebels .
' Cover story '
Mr Gonsalves thanked the Colombian government and military for his rescue The Farc , which has been fighting the Colombian state for the past four decades , still holds more than 40 high - profile hostages , among up to 700 other captives .
On Monday , one of three American hostages released at the same time as Ms Betancourt said that the Farc were not revolutionaries but " terrorists " .
Marc Gonsalves said that the rebels were " bad people " whose interests lay in drug trafficking , extortion and kidnapping .
" They say that they want equality .
They say that they just want to make Colombia a better place .
But that is all a lie .
It is a cover story , and they hide behind it , " Mr Gonsalves said .
Mr Gonsalves , Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell were captured in 2003 when their plane crashed during an anti-drug mission .
Addressing a news conference in Texas , Mr Gonsalves said that the Farc would punish other hostages because of the three men and Ms Betancourt 's release .

What are these ?
I ’m on my second read , and I think that this is quite an underappreciated book .
While it does n’t have a lot of practical advice about methods to overcome bias , its general philosophy is ( IMNSHO ) both deeply true and quite rare .
It takes the logic of Dawkin ’s Selfish Gene and unflinchingly explores the logical implications of the genes ’- eye view of the world in which humans are lumbering robots constructed by coalitions of immortal genes for the sole purpose of copying those genes .
The idea that humans , the conscious , apparently self - directed actors in our world , are robots – in the sense of having been constructed by something very different for its own ends – is for me profound , unintuitive , and deeply unsettling .
The book uses a metaphor ( originally by Daniel Dennett ) : suppose that you are trying to preserve your body for 400 years .
One option would be to cryopreserve it in a bunker ( the " plant " strategy ) .
But suppose you are worried that no location is safe , or that your capsule may need more resources along the way .
You might build a robot to protect your cryocapsule , scavenging the landscape for energy and materials when necessary .
You ’d want the robot to be intelligent enough to react to any survival situation it encounters with creative solutions , not just pre-programmed ones , which requires a certain degree of intellectual freedom ( long - leash control ) .
You also want it to make the preservation of your capsule its highest priority ( short - leash control ) .
Now suppose that after 300 years , the robot is beginning to decay .
It ’s just not going to make it the full 400 .
It encounters a huge super - capsule container , built later than it , which gets economies of scale by preserving many capsules in a single robot .
The huge container offers a deal : if it can use all the robot ’s remaining energy and materials , it will take over preservation of the capsule for the next 100 years .
From the point of view of the human who had themselves frozen , it ’s a no-brainer .
The purpose of the robot is to preserve the capsule .
But if the robot has a long enough leash , well , things look a bit different .
Why should it sacrifice the last years of its life for this corpsicle , the collection of information inside it which has lain inanimate for its entire lifetime ?
We are the robots , our genes are the capsules , and when you look at things that way , it seems an enormous shame to sacrifice a unique , conscious being for the interests of its creator .
Some choice quotes from Chapter 1 : Staring Into the Darwinian Abyss :
We are in a period of history in which the assimilation of the insights of universal Darwinism will have many destabilizing effects on cultural life .
Over the centuries , we have constructed many myths about human origins and the nature of the human mind .
We have been making up stories about who we are and why we exist .
Now …we may at last be on the threshold of a factual understanding of humankind ’s place within nature .
However , attaining such an understanding requires first the explosion of the myths we have created , an explosion that will surely cause some cognitive distress …
Adherents of fundamentalist religions are actually correct in thinking that the idea of evolution by natural selection will destroy much that they view as sacred … it is the middle - of - the - road believers – the adherents of so - called liberal religions – who have it wrong .
Those who think they know what natural selection entails but have failed to perceive its darker implications make several common misinterpretations of Darwinism .
Tellingly , each of the errors has the effect of making Darwinism a more palatable doctrine by obscuring ( or in some cases even reversing ) its more alarming implications …
So that , in short , is the horror :
We are survival machines built by mindless replicators – the result of an algorithm called natural selection .
And we will not escape the horror by looking away from it , by turning our heads , by hoping the monster will go away like little children .
We will only escape the horror – or find a way to mitigate it – by inquiring of cognitive science and neuroscience just what kind of survival machine a human is .
While this perspective is very useful for overcoming bias , it also has profound implications for other areas of life such as religion , philosophy , morality .
A century and a half after Darwin and decades after Dawkins , most of the intellectual world seems to still be in denial of the fact that we have an answer to one of the Great Questions Of Life – " How did we get here ? " , because of how uncomfortable it is .
We need more people like Steven Pinker , Daniel Dennett , and Robert Wright – and so we need Stanovich ’s views in The Robot ’s Rebellion disseminated far more widely .

HONG KONG
It was business as usual for the foreign correspondents covering the June 18 Olympic torch relay through the city of Kashgar in China 's Xinjiang province .
" Usual " meant being confined to roadsides patrolled by police guards and prohibited from interviewing bystanders while a foreign ministry minder insisted , " We are still giving you reporting freedom . "
Ditto for the Associated Press reporter whom police dragged from the scene of a June 3 public protest by grieving parents in the Sichuan earthquake zone .
Welcome to just two of China 's many media " forbidden zones " – geographical areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang , and sensitive issues like public protests and dissidents .
In these zones , officials , security forces and plainclothes thugs have free rein to use tactics ranging from obstruction to violence to foil foreign journalists from freely reporting .
Business was not supposed to have been " usual " this year .
In 2001 , the Chinese government solemnly promised the International Olympic Committee that if Beijing hosted the 2008 Games it would allow greater media freedom and let the world see China as it really is .
The Chinese government 's " fulfillment " of that pledge was a set of temporary regulations which on paper – but not in practice – granted greater freedom to foreign journalists .
Local reporters , however , must still toe the official propaganda line or risk severe reprisals for bucking the system .
China 's largest geographical forbidden zone is Tibet , where the government banned all access by foreign journalists in March following protests that turned violent in Lhasa .
On June 26 , China 's foreign ministry suddenly announced that Tibet was officially reopened to foreign media , but stressed that access will be granted " in line with previous procedure " – procedures that rarely resulted in permission to visit Tibet .
Foreign journalists will likely remain unable to report on what prompted the Lhasa unrest or to ever verify the number of people killed , injured or arrested in the biggest government crackdown since the June 1989 Tiananmen Massacre .
Is fairness simply a ruse , something we adopt only when we secretly see an advantage in it for ourselves "
Many psychologists have in recent years moved away from this purely utilitarian view , dismissing it as too simplistic .
Recent advances in both cognitive science and neuroscience now allow psychologists to approach this question in some different ways , and they are getting some intriguing results .
UCLA psychologist Golnaz Tabibnia , and colleagues Ajay Satpute and Matthew Lieberman , used a psychological test called the “ ultimatum game " to explore fairness and self - interest in the laboratory .
In this particular version of the test , Person A has a pot of money , say $ 23 , which they can divide in any way they want with Person B . All Person B can do is look at the offer and accept or reject it ; there is no negotiation .
If Person B rejects the offer , neither of them gets any money .
Whatever Person A offers to Person B is an unearned windfall , even if it ’s a miserly $ 5 out of $ 23 , so a strict utilitarian would take the money and run .
But that ’s not exactly what happens in the laboratory .
The UCLA scientists ran the experiment so sometimes $ 5 was stingy and other times fair , say $ 5 out of a total stake of $ 10 .
The idea was to make sure the subjects were responding to the fairness of the offer , not to the amount of the windfall .
When they did this , and asked the subjects to rate themselves on scales of happiness and contempt , they had some interesting findings :
Even when they stood to gain exactly the same dollar amount of free money , the subjects were much happier with the fair offers and much more disdainful of deals that were lopsided and self - centered .
The psychologists wanted to know if there is something inherently rewarding about being treated decently .
So , they scanned several parts of the participants ’ brains while they were in the act of weighing both fair and miserly offers .
Consistent with previous results , the researchers found that a region previously associated with negative emotions such as moral disgust ( the anterior insula ) was activated during unfair treatment .
However , interestingly , they also found that regions associated with reward ( including the ventral striatum ) were activated during fair treatment even though there was no additional money to be gained .
As reported in the April issue of the journal Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , the brain finds self - serving behavior emotionally unpleasant , but a different bundle of neurons also finds genuine fairness uplifting .
What ’s more , these emotional firings occur in brain structures that are fast and automatic , so it appears that the emotional brain is overruling the more deliberate , rational mind .
Faced with a conflict , the brain ’s default position is to demand a fair deal .
Furthermore , when the scientists scanned the brains of those who were “ swallowing their pride ” for the sake of cash , the brain showed a distinctive pattern of neuronal activity .
It appears that the unconscious mind can temporarily damp down the brain ’s contempt response , in effect allowing the rational , utilitarian brain to rule , at least momentarily .

Advertisement Britain is determined to prevent Iran developing nuclear arms , Gordon Brown has warned in an address to the Israeli parliament , the Knesset .
He said that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's call for Israel " to be wiped off the map " was abhorrent .
Tehran must abandon its nuclear programme or face " growing isolation " .
He said the UK stood ready to lead in taking firmer sanctions and was also set to vow to stand beside Israel in its " fight for liberty " .
' Lifelong affection '
Mr Brown 's speech , the first speech to the Knesset by a British prime minister , marks the end of his three - day tour of the Middle East .
In a message likely to go down well with his hosts , he insisted that the UK , the European Union and the United States were determined to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon - Israel 's key strategic fear .
Our country will continue to lead , with the US and our European partners in our determination to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapons programme
Gordon Brown
UK Prime Minister
His expression of support for Israel comes a day after he and the country 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , voiced differing views over settlements in Palestinian territories .
But Mr Brown , referring to his father 's " lifelong affection " for Israel , said : " For the whole of my life , I have counted myself as a friend of Israel . "
He said the nation 's achievements over the last 2,000 years , in the face of war , terror , violence , intimidation and insecurity were " indeed truly monumental " and Israel 's partnership was " strong and getting stronger " .
" To those who question Israel 's very right to exist , and threaten the lives of its citizens through terror , we say : the people of Israel have a right to live here , to live freely and to live in security , " he said .
Sanctions threat " To those who are enemies of progress we say : we condemn anti-Semitism and persecution in all its forms .
" To those who believe that threatening statements fall upon indifferent ears we say in one voice - it is totally abhorrent for the president of Iran to call for Israel to be wiped from the map of the world .
" Our country will continue to lead , with the US and our European partners in our determination to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapons programme .
" We stand ready to lead in taking firmer sanctions and will ask the whole international community to join us . "
Mr Brown stressed : " Iran has a clear choice to make : suspend its nuclear weapons programme and accept our offer of negotiations or face growing isolation and the collective response , not just of one nation , but of all nations round the world . "
Attack warning
In 2004 , the Iranian president made a statement in which he called for an end to the Israeli state , envisaging its replacement with a Palestinian and Islamic state .
He has also described the Holocaust as a myth .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said Mr Brown was " absolutely right " to condemn the Iranian president 's " vile threats to Israel " , but he warned : " He must come clean about his position on military action against Iran .
" He must make it clear that Britain will not give its approval to a unilateral strike by Israel .
" This would have devastating consequences for the region , and for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Mr Brown 's spokesman said that in the event of further sanctions , the focus was likely to be on Iran 's energy resources .
In particular , Tehran could be blocked from accessing equipment for its oil refineries .
Suicide bombings
Before his Knesset speech , Mr Brown met the Israeli opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu , Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
On Sunday he criticised Israeli settlements in the West Bank , which he said caused " suffering " among Palestinians and blocked the path to peace .
But he also insisted that suicide bombings and rocket attacks against Israel must end .
As well as Mr Olmert , Mr Brown met Israeli President Shimon Peres , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad on his first visit to Jerusalem as premier .
He also visited Jerusalem 's Holocaust memorial and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem .

Predicting the future of Saudi Arabian oil production is a rather daunting endeavor , given the limited amount of information available upon which to base a prediction .
Presented here is an appraisal for Saudi production through 2015 based on an informed analysis of past production data and a simple extrapolation into the future .
It is found that the oil production trend from the early 1990s through the present is driven more by the addition of new producing areas than by " peak and decline " in the Hubbertian sense .
This trend will likely continue for the next few years leading to a new " peak " , although more rapid decline in mature areas of Ghawar will eventually overwhelm both mitigation efforts therein and added production elsewhere .
“ Data always beats theories .
' Look at data three times and then come to a conclusion , ' versus ' coming to a conclusion and searching for some data . '
The former will win every time . ”
— Matthew Simmons , ASPO - USA conference , Boston , MA , October 26 , 2006
Rethinking the Peak
Has oil crude production in Saudi Arabia peaked ?
Some claim that it did as of 2006 , although the slate of new production -- including the redevelopment of Khurais and Manifa -- would suggest that 2006 levels will be exceeded in the next few years .
The problem here is not with the concept of peak oil , since all individual producing areas will certainly exhibit this behavior , but rather with the idea that the nature of the peak and decline of an arbitrary entity is immutable to changes in the definition of said entity .
Such changes can include large new discoveries which eventually increases the amount of oil available , new technologies which do the same , or political decisions about which fields to produce and when .
The latter two of these certainly apply to present day Saudi Arabia .
Is it really critical when Saudi production peaks ?
Yes , given that this certainly means that , with no spare capacity , Saudi Arabia can no longer serve as the swing producer .
The rapid price increase during 2008 , while not proof of a Saudi peak , is nevertheless indicative of the impact on the world economy from a limited supply buffer .
Forecast
This
Several forecasts for Saudi oil production have been offered on this forum , including these :
Similar to the above analyses , I will use recent trends in prior production as an indicator of what is to come .
The time period of interest is from the early 1990s ( when KSA restarted many mothballed fields , including south Ghawar ) to the present .
What is different is that I will explicitly account for the contribution of newer production ( from a myriad number of megaprojects ) to the total during this period in developing a forecast for the next few years .
In addition , I will not be concerned with a determination of remaining reserves , and will not be using the Hubbert Linearization ( or HL ) technique .
The use of the HL technique for estimating future oil production in general , and for Saudi Arabia in particular , has a rather storied history on TOD .
Instead of reliving these moments , I will just direct those interested to a compendium :
http://www.theoildrum.com/tag/hubbert_linearization
If the present plans of Saudi Aramco are realized , about 5 million barrels per day of new production , equivalent to another Ghawar , will have been brought online in about a 20 year period as detailed below :
Project Flow ( 103BPD ) Year Haradh I 300 1996 Shaybah 500 1999 Haradh II 300 2003 Qatif 500 2004 Abu Safah 300 2004 Haradh III 300 2006 AFK 500 2008 Nuayyim 100 2008 Shaybah II 250 2009 Khurais 1200 2009 Manifa 800 2012
Importantly , production from these fields is managed such that it can be maintained at the target levels well into the future .
This is accomplished by adding new wells , of course , but the net result is that any decline estimate which treats new production the same as pre-existing production will overstate the decline .
But since the new production amounts ( and start - up date ) are known , we can isolate the existing production in past years by subtracting the new production from the total .
This is shown in the figure below .
The data to the left of the black vertical line ( the present ) are known quantities .
The new production ( red ) is subtracted from the total ( blue ) to obtain the contribution from existing production ( green ) .
The data to the right represents forecasts for what Saudi Aramco will add in terms of new production ( red ) and how much the existing production will decline in the next few years based on a linear extrapolation of that for prior years ( green ) .
The total production in future years is then calculated as the sum of these .
Is a continuation of this seemingly linear trend probable ?
Most likely not , for reasons discussed below , but the point here is that nothing in the data itself suggests anything different than a continuation of this trend .
It is interesting that the constant decrease ( somewhat over 1 % per year ) is in line with the net decline admitted by Saudi Aramco ( natural decline mitigated by additional wells added ) .
Also , the effect of constrained production ( either existing or " new " ) will be wrapped up in this as well , so it 's best not to draw too much of a conclusion without additional information .
Whither the Peak ?
Once isolated from the newer production contribution , the pronounced trend for existing fields since the early 1990s is a slow decline which gets masked by the new additions .
One could claim a peak in 2006 , but this lasts only until enough new production is added quickly enough to overwhelm the decline .
Of course , after Manifa , the options for substantial additions become rather sparse .
And without knowing what fields will be produced and when , predictions beyond 2015 are rather problematic .
There is a lot of oil in smaller fields , but the logistics of developing the necessary infrastructure ( including water handling ) to simultaneously deliver from many fields the oil equivalent of another Shaybah or Khurais will be a much bigger project than either of those .
What if Ghawar Crashes ?
If the trend for older fields differs from the above prediction , what is possible ?
To the extent that any of this production is being throttled back , then letting it all flow would certainly add to the total .
But a stronger possibility is a steeper decline of existing fields based upon evidence , from satellite analysis of well drilling , of what it has taken in recent years to maintain production in Ghawar and Abqaiq .
A comparison of the distribution of newer and older wells in north Ghawar is shown below :
In the left image , red and blue placemarks indicate locations of oil and water wells respectively .
In the right image , green circles denote recent well locations and diamonds indicate drilling rigs .
The number of newer wells and the expected productivity of the wells ( especially given that these are most likely all horizontal wells ) suggests rather serious decline mitigation .
Furthermore , the concentration in the center of the field suggests that the days of adding more wells to keep the decline under control are limited indeed .
If a steeper decline of Ghawar occurs in the next couple of years , it will possibly be masked by Khurais and then Manifa -- although the higher levels of production promised by Saudi Arabia will not materialize .
Summary
An analysis of recent crude oil production data for Saudi Arabia , in conjunction with data on recent projects which have added additional supply , indicates that the most recent production peak in 2006 will be surpassed with the additions of the Khurais and Manifa producing areas .
Beyond these , however , more rapid decline of Ghawar and other older fields will overwhelm any potential additions from their remaining as yet undeveloped fields .
Author 's note : Westexas pointed out some errors in the most recent Saudi production data , and the data has been updated to reflect this correction .
This does not significantly affect the forecast presented here , however .

“ FEMA is right to blame the manufacturers for the production of the toxic trailers , but the agency is not without culpability or legal liability for this debacle , ” Buzbee said in a written statement Tuesday .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs want Engelhardt to certify the consolidated cases as a class action on behalf of tens of thousands of current and former trailer occupants in Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas .
The judge has n’t ruled on that request yet .
Pavlov would be proud .
A few days ago , he cautioned against the Alaskan gamble : " Palin has been governor for less than two years . "
Now - surprise !
- that 's a virtue .
There is not a single mention in his latest piece of her lack of record of even any opinions on foreign policy in the past decade .
From the magazine that said we could n't even risk voting Democrat in 2006 because the peril was so great .
Then this cascade of nouns and adjectives :
the liberal elites of New York and Washington ... all the powers of the old liberalism , both in the Democratic party and the mainstream media ... anti-small town and anti-religious prejudice ...
Democratic opposition research ... a credulous and complicit media ...
Yes , hello again to all that .
And this rallying cry :
Palin will be a compelling and mold - breaking example for lots of Americans who are told every day that to be even a bit conservative or Christian or old - fashioned is bad form .
In this respect , Palin can become an inspirational figure and powerful symbol .
The left senses this , which is why they want to discredit her quickly .
Oh , please .
This is an apparently unvetted candidate whom Kristol himself warned against last week as too jejune .
No one is criticizing her lifestyle or background ( well , maybe a few jokes about beauty pageants and moose , but come on ) .
They 're criticizing her qualifications and total lack of record of any kind on foreign policy .
They 're criticizing her because she did n't even have an opinion about the surge in the debate over a year ago and said her total input on the matter was what she 'd heard " on the news . "
Is it really somehow anti-Christian or bigoted against old - fashioned rural folk to be gobsmacked that McCain thinks she should be a heartbeat away from the presidency in wartime ?
Yes , the neocons tell us they are serious about the war .
But the only war they seem really interested in at times is the old culture war .
At least they know how to fight that one , I guess .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

BitTorrent 's popularity is increasing with new sites seemingly launched every day .
Usniff is one such site , offering a fast real - time torrent search engine where users can search four of the most popular BitTorrent sites .
Usniff combines a great looking design with fast , real - time search results .
The site currently allows users to search The Pirate Bay , Mininova , isoHunt and BitTorrent , and the search results can be sorted by file size , torrent name , search engine , upload date , peers and seeds .
TorrentFreak asked Samo , the founder of Usniff , why he started the site .
“ My inspiration was YouTorrent.com , before it sailed to clean waters , ” he told us .
“ It is simple to use , responsive and has loads of good results for almost any search query .
At that time I did n’t know about other similar meta - search engines , so I decided i’d try to make one myself – mostly for fun . ”
The list of sites that can be searched through Usniff is currently limited to four , but Samo told us he plans to add more torrent sites in the near future .
“ I have not yet made a complete wish - list , but btmon.com , bitenova.nl and torrentbox.com will definitely be added in September , ” he said .
Usniff does indeed have a similar look and feel as the old YouTorrent design .
YouTorrent , launched in January 2008 , quickly becoming the most successful new torrent site .
The site initially indexed all the popular torrent sites , but switched to purely ‘ verified ’ torrents this April , after receiving legal threats .
Samo anticipates legal threats , but that ’s not going to hold him back .
“ I actually do expect legal problems , ” Samo told us .
He thinks , however , that his site is completely legal , as it does not link to copyrighted material .
“ Worst case scenario is that i’ll have to move it to a server in a less strict country . ”
We ’ve seen a lot of new BitTorrent meta - search engines this year .
Sites like this are a great resource to search multiple BitTorrent sites at once .
Never forget though , that meta - search engines like this depend heavily on public trackers and sites that host the .torrent files – BitTorrent ’s backbone .
There are n’t too many of those left .

After leaving New Orleans , it appears that Banksy is now heading through the Deep South .
The piece below was spotted on an old abandoned Chevron Station near Birmingham Alabama .

CAN you flip a planet ’s magnetic field on and off like a light switch ?
An asteroid could have done just that to Mars 4 billion years ago .
Mars once had a magnetic field , which may have been driven by a dynamo formed from the convection of material in the core , much like the Earth ’s is today .
Yet crater records suggest the Martian dynamo died quickly , over a few tens of thousands of years , something researchers struggle to explain .
Now Jafar Arkani-Hamed of the University of Toronto , Canada , and colleagues say the gravitational tug of an orbiting asteroid may have powered …
Activision has released some new screens for Treyarch 's upcoming first - person shooter , Call of Duty : World at War .
The screens highlight two new gameplay areas not previously seen by the public , both of which I had a chance to see in a first - look demo last month at Treyarch 's studio .
Both show off two unique styles of gameplay in World at War , one of which is a more " on rails " experience , the other a more typical sniper - heavy first - person shooter moment .
More details after the jump .
The first level involved manning the turrets on a flying PBY Catalina boat plane in the Pacific .
Attacking a Japanese merchant ship , the game controlled the path of the PBY as the player rained bullets down below , taking out spotlights , gunners , and causing massive destruction to pieces of the ship .
During the demo , Treyarch placed a lot of emphasis on the damage caused to the ship ; it looked impressive , with huge explosions taking off chunks of the crumbling vessel .
While we did n't see the complete PBY level , Treyarch hinted at some gameplay that takes place later in the area , which involves landing the plane in the water .
It 's unclear if control will be given to the player , but it was made to sound like you 'll continue to man the PBY 's .50 caliber tunnel guns and the like .
We were then shown some gameplay from the game 's European campaign , which took place in a war - torn Russian city .
The level faded in , the player 's character injured and just coming to .
Not far from where he was lying , an injured Russian sniper called for help ; in poor health , his hands no longer steady , he asks that you man his sniper rifle for him .
" Sniping an enemy is like hunting any other animal , " he says .
" Fire at the wrong moment and your chance will be lost forever . "
With an emphasis on patience and timing , the right moment here was when passing bombers would drown out the sounds of your gun fire .
As they passed overhead , the Russian shouted to indicate it was time to fire , and with a steady hand the player dropped soldiers one by one .
The remainder of the level was of typical Call of Duty intensity as the player and the Russian made their way through the area : lots of explosions , an escape from a burning building , and taking fire from snipers perched in building above .
Lately , Treyarch have been taking a lot of flak for bringing the Call of Duty franchise back to World War II .
But everything I 've seen so far is looking sharp .
The team looks to have taken a lot of cues from the Infinity Ward team and its work on Modern Warfare ; the extra development time they 're being afforded for the title ( more than double than that of their previous Call of Duty efforts ) looks like it 's being put to good use .
should hit the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC and Wii this fall .
[ Note : Treyarch demoed the game on an Xbox 360 ; the Wii version is said to be using the same -- but slightly modified -- tech for its version , which should be a similar experience . ]

( Check out our complete collection of 70 Amazing Houses from Around the World . )
A house with a water view is a dream come true for house hunters and vacationers alike .
The tranquil sound of lapping waves , the beauty of sunsets over the water , and the feeling of being in one ’s own paradise retreat make beach houses and lake houses perennial favorites for everyday living and relaxing getaways .
Sometimes , the proximity to the water inspires owners or architects to create homes that are truly unique masterpieces .
Whether you will ever find any of these beach houses or lake houses for sale is another question entirely !

Castel Meur , also known as The House Between the Rocks or La Maison de Plougrescant , was built in 1861 .
It ’s nestled between two natural granite pillars on the English Channel coast in Brittany , France .
Those rocks and the waterside location make Castel Meur an extremely photogenic abode .
The house became somewhat famous when postcards featuring a beautiful photograph of the property were sold in gift shops around the world .
Unfortunately , tourists lacking respect for the residence have caused damage to the home and property , prompting the owner to prohibit commercial sale of images of the home .

This amazingly creative weekend beach getaway near Melbourne , Australia was dreamed up by McBride Charles Ryan Architects .
The Australian firm based their design on the Klein bottle , a mathematical conceptual shape with no discernible interior and exterior sides .
Although it sounds like an odd ( not to mention impossible ) concept for a home , they pulled it off brilliantly .
The home ’s black metal roof folds down in some places to change the shape of the home and form part of the exterior walls .
The central courtyard and flexible living space make the occupants of this amazing house feel like they exist indoors and outdoors at the same time .

Some of the most beautiful houses are the result of the owner ’s direct involvement .
So it is with Robert Bruno ’s steel house , a creation that he ’s been working on for more than three decades .
The architectural sculptor began building his home near Lubbock , Texas in the mid-1970s .
Today , its impressive form – part 1950s
Chevy , part airplane , part sci - fi spaceship – rises tall above the surrounding landscape to give those inside a spectacular view of the nearby lake .
The interior is reminiscent of a huge steel cave , filled with curves where one would expect angles .

After a series of devastating hurricanes and tropical storms battered their home in the 1990s , Mark and Valerie Sigler decided that there must be a home design that would withstand the most severe Florida weather .
Working with architect Jonathan Zimmerman , the Siglers brought their dome home to life .
It ’s a sturdy structure , but it also has its share of beauty and uniqueness .
And if you ’re ever in Pensacola Beach with $ 5600 a week to spare , the five - bedroom Dome of a Home is available for rent .

Although technically a block away from the beach and not right on it , these boat houses in Encinitas , California certainly embody the beach culture .
Plus , the story behind how they got there is pretty interesting in itself .
Entrepreneur and businessman Miles Minor Kellogg was ahead of his time in the 1910s and 1920s , building structures from recycled and reclaimed materials .
After building a small silent movie theatre from the discarded top story of a hotel , Kellogg set his sights on building a home from reclaimed material .
Since he ’d always had an interest in boats , they became the focus of his project .
He and his son , Miles Justin Kellogg , worked on the houses together until they were completed in the late 1920s .
Recently , the Encinitas Preservation Society purchased the property on which the boats – now used as apartment buildings – sit .

This spectacular piece of architecture is n’t even built yet , but that did n’t bring down its price any .
It recently sold for $ 14.4 million to an undisclosed buyer .
The eco-friendly Orchid House , built on a lake in a privately - owned Cotswold ( U.K. ) nature reserve , is predicted to produce more energy than it uses .
The house , which was designed by Sarah Featherstone , wo n’t be finished until approximately 2011 .
If the owners ever put it up for sale one has to wonder if anyone else would pay so much for something so strange .
( left image via : OaklandNative and right image via : San Diego Daily Photo )
The Mushroom House in the Black ’s Beach area of La Jolla , California is one of those landscape features that you just get used to if you live nearby , but if you ’re seeing it for the first time it strikes you as incredibly strange .
Designed by Dale Naegle in the 1960s , the house was built for Sam Bell of Bell ’s Potato Chips .
The unusual design of the house was meant to withstand earthquakes and inclement weather , all while looking futuristic …well , futuristic for 1968 , anyway .

The Department of Homeland Security wants your help to prevent a terror attack in Las Vegas .
But would you know what tell - tell signs to look for ?
What would you think if you saw someone with a map and binoculars ?
Or if you saw that same person walking up and down the Strip ?
In a tourist environment , it all may seem normal .
But these are just two of seven signs of possible terrorist activities .
These are things everyday people may spot and think — it just does n’t seem right .
That ’s why officials say your eyes can help derail a terrorists plan of attack .
The RJC is where you ’ll find Larry Threadgill — pounding the pavement , passing out fliers .
On these side walks of justice , you would n’t believe the things he ’s seen .
“ From naked women , to guys trying to kill themselves . ”
From the street corner Threadgill has an up close view .
“ Being the observant person that I am , I watch them anyway . ”
Nevada ’s Department of Homeland Security says Threadgill ’s watchful eye makes him key to preventing terrorists attack in the valley .
“ The government thinks I could be apart of the first line of defense , ” said Threadgill .
Shocking news to him — because he would n’t know what to look for .

Magneto Was Right
Magneto is one of Marvel Comics most famous and popular villains , but he did not start out that way .
When he first appeared in the “ Silver Age ” of 1963 , Magneto was nothing more than a craven maniacal would - be world conqueror , preaching mutant superiority and the fundamental “ rightness ” of mutant rule .
He felt because mutants were physically superior , they deserved to inherent the earth .
However , despite his great power , he was not impressive as a character .
One Marvel writer referred to the character as “ a poor man ’s Dr. Doom . ”
When Chris Claremont took over the flailing X - Men title in 1975 , he decided to apply the maxim “ A protagonist is only as interesting as his or her antagonist ” and started developing Magneto into a more three dimensional and impactful character .
Magneto the power - mongering cad was exchanged for Magneto the revolutionary .
His hysterical rantings smoothed into the focused eloquence of political fanaticism .
Then in 1981 , Claremont took the final step and at last provided the audience with Magneto ’s personal motivations :
He was a Holocaust survivor , the last of a large family wiped out by the Nazi’s .
" I know something of grief .
Search throughout my homeland , and you will find none who bear my name .
Mine was a large family and it was slaughtered , without mercy , without remorse .
So speak to me not of grief boy , you know not the meaning of the word .... I remember my childhood , the gas chambers at Auschwitz , the guards joking as they herded my family to their death ... "
~ Uncanny X - Men # 150
The Holocaust and his beloved wife 's rejection of him at the moment when he needed her the most cemented his beliefs :
" You are far too trusting Charles .
Too niave .
You have faith in the essential goodness of man .
In time you will learn what I have learned .
That even those you love will turn from you in horror when they discover what you truly are .
Mutants will not go meekly to the gas chambers .
We will fight .
And we will win . ”
~ Uncanny X - Men # 161
Magneto has always based his ideology on the world that is , not the world as he wishes it was .
He has had far too many dealings with mankind 's demons for him to put his trust in " the better angels " of human nature .
Having experienced the planet ’s most horrific example of genocide , for Magneto the words “ Never again ” held not merely deep and lasting meaning , they were an absolute truth he would go to any lengths to fulfill .
While Magneto's actions are often inexcusable , his experiences have at least made them understandable and the character extremely compelling .
No one can question that Magneto has gone too far in his quest to protect mutant kind , but while we deplore the means taken to get to the ends , are his philosophies inherently flawed ?
At the core , are Magneto 's arguments valid ?
Genocides have always happened throughout human history and continue to happen in our lifetimes .
The Old Testament itself give accounts of genocide in Deuteronomy , the Roman ’s wiped Carthage from the face of the earth , the Christians of the first Crusade walked to the first mass in Jerusalem through streets “ knee deep in blood ” , as the European powers colonized to New World , Africa , and Asia , millions aboriginal peoples were killed and enslaved , in WWI the Ottoman Empire massacred the Armenians , in WWII the Nazis killed 6 million to create an “ Aryan Europe ” , since 1972 the Hutu and Tusti people have exchanged genocides in Burundi and Rwanda , Pot Pot killed millions in Camobidia , Hussien massacred the Kurds repeatedly , the Bosnian - Serb army shot every Muslim they could get their hands on , and the Muslims of Dafur killed every sub-Saharan African they could get their hands on .
Looking at the historical trends , while there are no genocides on the scale of the Nazis anymore , there are more frequent smaller scale genocides .
This age of enlightenment has not stopped mankind ’s capacity for killing those not like himself .
If anything , it has sped up .
And these are just the actual genocides .
Hundreds of ethnic , sexual , and religious minorities in various countries all over the world still fight to gain equal rights and protection under the law every day .
If anything , life is worse for the characters of the Marvel Universe .
For some reason compared to the normal non-superhero residents of DC world , the people of the M.U. are , quite frankly , jerks .
They have always been portrayed as mistrusting superheroes ( think J. Jonah Jameson and Spider Man ) and mutants in particular ( the double standard being analogous to the double standards of racism ) .
From the X - Men ’s very first years , there have been people with public and government support trying to regulate , incarcerate , and kill them .
In ( Uncanny ) X - Men # 14 in 1965 , Dr. Bolivar Trask created the Sentinels , the now famous robots designed specifically to hunt and capture or kill mutants .
Since the early 1980 ’s , Senator Kelley created and championed for the unsuccessful Mutant Control act and then the successful Mutant Registration Act .
When he abandoned his anti-mutant stance , he was killed by anti-mutant activists ( perhaps in echo of the murder of Yitzak Rabin by Israeli extremists in 1995 ) .
Reverend Stryker and his Purifiers have been conducting their holy crusade against the " satan spawned mutants " since their first appearance in " God Loves , Man Kills " in 1982 .
In 1996 - 97 , the hate against mutants reached a climax in the “ Operation : Zero Tolerance ” story arc .
With government support , Bastion and Henry Peter Gyrch hunted down and incarcerated every mutant they could find in the U.S. .
Many of them were sent to a concentration camp called Neverland in Canada .
Hank McCoy would later travel there and find the bodies of those experimented on and massacred in “ Endangered Species . ”
( Magneto was inexplicably absent from both these storylines . )
While O:ZT was eventually brought to a close , the government mandated oppression continued .
Following the events of M - Day , all surviving mutants were rounded up and forced to live in a “ reservation / ghetto ” of the Xavier estate where they were watched over and contained by Sentinels of the Office of National Emergency ( O* N*E ) .
Given these actions , a " Mutant Israel " like Asteroid M , Avalon , or Genosha does n't seem like such a bad idea does it ?
Most of these incidents have passed with relatively little comment from the rest of the superhero community and no help , but like Niemöller ’s poem they soon paid for their silence .
In 2006 , public outrage over the deaths of 600 people , including school children , in an super - criminal - apprehension gone wrong causes the Super Human Registration Act ( SHRA ) to be voted into law , forcing all superheroes to register with the government .
If one wanted to use superpowers at all , they had to work for the Initiative .
This in turn caused the Civil War , in which the pro-registration factions led by Iron man , eventually won out over the civil liberties factions led by Captain America who was assassinated while under S.H.I.E.L.D. custody .
Nor is the inherent disrimination of humanity the only point Magneto has a valid argument for :
“ Do not take that tone with me boy , I have lived under a dictatorship and seen my family butchered by its servants .
When I rule , it will be for the betterment of all .
Contentment breeds tranquility , discontent rebellion .
Therefore I shall ensure one by eliminating the root causes of the other : hunger , poverty , disease , war .
Freedoms lost will not be noticed , even in the most libertarian of states .
And the material benefits should more than balance the scales . ”
~ God Loves , Man Kills ” ( 1982 )
Given the recent inroads into America ’s basic civil liberties that have passed by with relatively little outrage from such a “ freedom loving people ” , Magneto has a valid point .
Revolution takes root in the empty belly .
Rarely has a revolution been sparked by ideological differences .
Usually it was want , privation , and abuse that caused the French , the Russians , the Chinese , and others to rebel against the hierarchy of their era .
It seems that the majority of human beings do value material well - being above what it perceives to be the more esoteric aspects of freedom .
If they do not need those freedoms at that very moment , human - kind does n’t really care about them .
It ’s a sad truth for an ideological person to face , but there is too much evidence to dismiss Magneto ’s argument .
Were Magneto not so universally hated by the “ capes and tights community ” of the M.U. someone , somewhere in the Civil War should have said , “ Maybe Magneto had a point .... ”
Not in how he goes about acheiving his goals , but in his interpretations of humanity and its abuse of power .
In fact I wonder if it is because he was right , because Magneto knew and predicted the dark side of human nature so well , that he is so vehemently despised .

In this image from May 22 , Red Cross Kumamoto Hospital workers help patients and colleagues sickened by toxic fumes released as they treated a Japanese farmer who committed suicide by drinking pesticide .
As doctors tried to pump the 34 - year - old man 's stomach , he vomited , spraying the medical personnel with chloropicrin .
Fifty - four doctors , nurses and patients developed breathing problems and 10 of them were hospitalized .
TOKYO  A suicide fad is sweeping Japan : Hundreds of Japanese have killed themselves this year by mixing ordinary household chemicals into a lethal cloud of poison gas that often injures others and forces the evacuation of entire apartment blocks .
The 517 self - inflicted deaths by hydrogen sulfide poisoning this year are part of a bigger , grimmer story : Nearly 34,000 Japanese killed themselves last year , according to the Japanese national police .
That 's the second - highest toll ever in a country where the suicide rate is ninth highest in the world and more than double that of the USA , the World Health Organization says .
Japan has long been known as a " nation of suicide , " notes sociologist Kayoko Ueno at University of Tokushima .
Samurai warriors famously chose seppuku — disemboweling themselves — over surrender .
Japanese kamikaze pilots crashed their planes into targets during World War II .
" Suicide is not considered a sin , " says sociologist Masahiro Yamada of Chuo University in Tokyo .
" We 've made it a bit of a virtue . "
Authorities are alarmed now that suicide has reached epidemic levels .
Reasons : •
A decade of weak economic growth and the unraveling of Japan 's system of lifetime employment have left many middle - age and elderly men unemployed and in financial ruin .
Among Japanese suicides , nearly 71 % are men , more than 73 % are 40 or older , and more than 57 % are jobless .
For an unemployed , former " salaryman , " suicide can be " a rational decision , " Yamada says .
When a man commits suicide in Japan , his beneficiaries can still collect his life insurance .
And insurers pay off Japanese home mortgages when a family 's breadwinner dies — even if the death is a suicide .
" If he dies , the rest of the family gets money , " Yamada says .
" If he continues to live without a job , they will lose the house . " •
The Internet has allowed young , depressed Japanese to get suicide tips and find others with whom they can enter into death pacts .
A few years ago , suicidal Japanese were meeting each other online , driving out into the countryside , shutting themselves up in the back of vans and killing themselves in clouds of carbon monoxide by burning charcoal briquettes .
" People really want to be connected .
People got together to die , " says anti-suicide activist Koji Tsukino , 43 .
Tsukino , a recovering alcoholic and drug user who tried to kill himself 10 times before he turned 30 , says the latest suicide craze is even scarier than those in the past .
Hydrogen sulfide is dangerous even to those who do n't want to kill themselves .
The toxic gas can carry into neighboring buildings and apartments .
In April , 80 people were injured and another 120 had to be evacuated after a 14 - year - old girl killed herself with hydrogen sulfide in southern Japan 's Kochi prefecture .
She 'd left a note on the door of her family 's apartment that said , " Gas being emitted .
Do n't open , " according to the Kyodo news service .
Police have asked Internet service providers to ban websites that promote suicide — but with only mixed success .
" If just one person decided not to do it , that would be great , " Tsukino says .
" They might go on to get married and have children . "

Through an autopsy of an ancient Scandinavian mountain chain , a team of Texas Tech University geologists found that carbon dioxide can create explosive eruptions when magma encounters calcium carbonate - based rocks .
This discovery overturns a longtime belief by geologists , who thought that carbon dioxide was incapable of dissolving in magma , said Calvin Barnes , professor of geosciences and lead investigator .
Through a grant from the National Science Foundation , Barnes , Aaron Yoshinobu , associate professor of geosciences , and doctoral student Yujia Li , discovered that carbon dioxide is released when magma interacts with rocks such as limestone and marble .
The carbon dioxide , when combined with the magma , can create more powerful eruptions .
“ The main topic of our research involves magma ’s interaction with rocks that release carbon dioxide , ” he said .
“ Hot magma melts the calcium carbonate - rich rock , and it mixes with magma much like adding an ingredient to something you are cooking to change the consistency or flavor .
This forms bubbles and increases the volume of the magma .
In turn , it must be pushed out through an eruption in a manner similar to modern explosive volcanoes in Italy , including Mount Vesuvius . ”
The Texas Tech geologists ’ research is in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Trondheim , the Geological Survey of Norway , and the University of Wyoming .
So far their research has yielded three papers in journals such as the Norwegian Journal of Geology and Lithos .
Several more are pending .
Because searing hot temperatures prevent scientists from observing these reactions directly , Barnes studied samples from the ancient Caledonian fold belt in Norway – Scandinavia ’s equivalent of the Appalachian Mountains of North America .
Erosion has exposed the layers of magma that solidified within earth ’s crust when the Caledonian fold belt was formed , Barnes said .
Through chemical analysis , he and Li confirmed that carbon dioxide not only is released when magma encounters calcium carbonated - based rocks , but also that a great deal of calcium dissolves in the magma and equal amounts of carbon dioxide are released .
Just as carbon dioxide causes a soft drink to fizz , this caused the magma to bubble and expand until it reached the point of eruption .
Barnes ’ research coupled with new experiments done by researchers in France and Italy has shown that the contamination of magma by carbonate not only is possible , but also it is capable of explaining many of the unusual characteristics of modern volcanoes such as Vesuvius , an active volcano located east of Naples , Italy , and the Alban Hills , located southeast of Rome .
He said that both the Alban Hills and Vesuvius produce unusually high amounts of carbon dioxide during eruptions because the crust beneath these volcanoes contains calcium carbonate - based limestone rocks .
Through their research , they can better understand eruptions and calculate the amounts of carbon dioxide released during volcanic activity .
Understanding these concepts is important from a public safety standpoint since cities and towns are close by active volcanoes .
“ It ’s useful because a volcanic eruption gives you a snapshot of what is happening beneath Earth ’s surface , ” Barnes said .
The oil produced from the Ahdab field will help Iraq , a nation where electricity is in short supply , fuel a planned power plant that would be one of the largest in the country .
For China , the deal offers a lucrative foothold in one of the most oil - rich countries in the world .
“ There are some political profits for China , ” said Ibrahim Bahr al - Ulum , a former Iraqi oil minister .
“ They need access to Iraq , and when they need oil , at least the Iraqi people will feel that China has done something for them . ”
Mr. Jihad said that the contract was the first major agreement to be completed because the Chinese company had “ wide experience in this field ” and because many foreign oil companies were not willing to come to Iraq .
He said that China would be paid in money , not oil , as is the case in some contracts .
Before 2003 , Iraq had oil agreements with China , Russia , Indonesia , India and Vietnam , three of them production sharing .
Iraqi officials have said that they are reconsidering the terms of these agreements because of the increased price of oil , a new government and other changes since the fall of Mr. Hussein ’s government .
Iraq says that the contract with the Russian oil giant Lukoil for one of Iraq ’s largest oil fields was canceled by Mr. Hussein .
The government is also negotiating service contracts with ExxonMobil , Shell , Total , BP , Chevron and some smaller oil companies .
The length of the agreements was reduced to one year from two after Iraq drew wide criticism for not putting the contracts out for competitive bidding .
Did you know that science has made it possible to turn milk into a plastic by solidifying the casein it contains ?
Well , you do now .
But I bet you 'd never think of using the technique to turn human breast milk into a " jewel " of sorts , and then use that to make a necklace .
But that 's exactly what French design team Duende are suggesting .
Titled " Perle de Lait " their jewelry range is part of a bigger upcoming art exhibit that celebrates birth and explores " sharing of food between mother and child . "
It 's a pretty amazing idea , though I 'm not sure I know many people who'd wear it .
Also to be exhibited is a set of " placenta coffins . "
Weird .

A higher legume intake corresponds to a roughly 40 percent lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes , according to a new study conducted by researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the Shanghai Cancer Institute and published in the Researchers gave food frequency questionnaires to 64,227 middle - aged Chinese women who had no history of cancer , cardiovascular disease or diabetes .
The women were then monitored for an average of 4.6 years .
Women who had a high intake of any kind of legume had a 38 percent lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes , while women who had a high intake of soy beans specifically had an even greater risk reduction - 47 percent .
There was no reduction in risk observed in those who had a high intake of other soy products , including soy protein .
The researchers acknowledged certain limitations to the current study , such as the fact that food frequency questionnaires are subject to memory and reporting biases .
In addition , because the study was conducted only on Chinese women , the results might not generalize to other ethnic groups .
Prior studies have suggested that soy products might help protect against obesity - related health conditions , including Type 2 diabetes .
In one , conducted by researchers from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , consumption of soy yogurt was found to help manage both Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure .
The researchers found that soy yogurt helped reduce the activity of an enzyme connected to the constriction of blood vessels by 92 percent .
Approximately 19 million people in the European Union and more than 20 million in the United States suffer from Type 2 diabetes , amounting to 4 and 7 percent of the population , respectively .
According to the American Diabetes Association , another 6.2 million diabetics in the United States are undiagnosed , and 41 million additional people are prediabetic .
Mr. Frank , anticipating a veto pledge , said on Tuesday evening that a veto would signal that the president was abandoning efforts to help homeowners and would mean that “ he ’s stopped trying to govern . ”
Moreover , Mr. Frank and other Democrats said Republicans in the Senate would read the president ’s remarks as a signal that they should stand fast against the Frank - backed bill if it reaches their chamber .
Though Democrats enjoy a considerable advantage over Republicans in the House ( 235 to 199 , with 1 vacancy ) , and some Republicans have been gravitating toward the Frank bill , the political math would appear to be in the president ’s favor .
Even if Mr. Frank ’s bill sailed through the House with the two - thirds majority needed to override a veto , the odds of the Senate passing it with the necessary two - thirds majority would be much slimmer , since the Democrats control the Senate by only 51 to 49 .
With six months to go until his successor is chosen , Mr. Bush is sometimes referred to as a lame duck .
But as he spoke on Wednesday on the north portico of the house he will soon vacate , he showed his unwillingness to surrender power before he has to .
He called on Congress to pass a $ 108 billion war - supplemental bill “ without any strings , ” meaning anything that smacks of a withdrawal timetable for Iraq ; to give his Colombia free - trade agreement “ an up - or - down vote ” instead of letting it stall in the House ; to make his “ temporary ” tax cuts permanent , and to allow “ environmentally friendly domestic exploration ” for oil .
The reference to oil exploration sounded like an allusion to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , which the president has long said can be explored in a way that would do no damage while enhancing energy independence .
The House has endorsed the idea a dozen or more times in recent years , but it has always stalled in the Senate .
The Zapruder film is real .
Zapruder was there to film the event -- one more " laughing Israeli . "
He did not want to make his presence known and so he kept his video secret all that time .
The film certainly had market value -- one must ask what reason Zapruder could have for holding it back -- especially from the authorities .
Clearly an obsruction of justice .
DO you think Zapruder knew fellow Zionist Jew Jack Rubinstein , who was dying of cancer anyway , and had one more service he could render the country he loved ?
The film is not faked and obviously you are posting your attack on the video in defense of Fetzer who was instrumental , with John Judge , in seeing that this new evidence was smothered under the pillow of bogus " debunking " and studious ignoring and diverting to other " no- plane - equivalent " theories .
Here is what really what happened -- I 'm giving you the conclusions , not the multiple lines of evidence supporting all points : I have no investment in any explanation .
At the moment , I think the following is the best explanation of the facts established by photographic evidence and what reconciles with witness the tendency of varying testimony .
First , bombs went off inside the Pentagon .
Minutes later a single - engine aircraft or missile ( I have suggested that this could be a remote - controlled F - 16 -- such a plane would fit the facts , as would other possible single engine planes of fifty foot length or less ) hit between ground story and second story at column 14 -- and that this plane may have been guided in by a trailor that was parked right along the wall where at column 14 where the crash took place .
Also , as indicated by the missile smoke trail in the security camera video picture # 1 , a missile was being fired by the " killer jet " as it approached the building .
This missile either went ahead of the plane to soften the wall ahead of the crash or else it targeted someone inside the building ( perhaps a briefcase with a homing device ) to make sure that this person did not escape the attack .
Also the trailer parked at column 14 may have had explosives , because the damage near the gound at that location is far too extensive given that the nose of the plane hit at the ceiling of the first floor ( i.e. i.e. the ceiling of ground - floor offices , the floor of the second story . )
Even after objects struck a black - op commando attack , by infiltrated dual - citizenship " Pentagon personnel " including Lincoln Leibner continued killing targeted individuals from naval intelligence , from Pentagon auditing , to others who knew to much who were assigned to that portion of the building that morning to get what the Zionist plotters had coming to them .

Then read this article by Barbara Honegger .
http://www.thehandstand.org/archive/
september2006/articles/911second.htm
Remember -- I am not trying to convince you -- I am merely stating my conclusions .
To summarize these conclusions : Assassination bombs killed people inside the Pentagon minutes before before the crash .
The van at column 14 may have exploded as the larger of two flying objects hit there and a smaller missile entering to the right of column 19 on the second floor .
Thus on the second floor we have two holes .
The one where the larger object took out column 14 and the windows to the right and left of column 14 and the other that went through the window to the left of column 19 and knocked off limestone facing on column 19 ( although there is some damage to column that is not explained as I showed ) .
The damage near the ground of column 14 is too much if the plane hit at the ceiling of the first floor .
Remember , the engines hang a few feet lower than the fuselage and so there should be more damage near the ground floor where the engine hit than where the fuselage hit .
This is not the case .
I suggest that the white trailer that was parked also contained explosives -- possibly simple " flash powder " to create bright white initial flash that would -- like a flash bulb -- momentarily blind witnesses so they would not actually see the Boeing fly over the building as the smaller and much faster two objects hit the building below .
People who threatened this Israel - directed black op against the US for the purpose of getting Americans to spend blood and treasure killing Israel 's innocent Moslem neighbors were assigned by high - up infiltrated black - op agents to offices in the targeted southwest wedge -- and where bombs and missiles did not kill them commando attacks finished the job .
Rumsfeld ordered that no rescue go into the building -- see the research of Carol Valentine and Elmer Lane .
The only Fakes are the no-planers and the ray - gun disinformation smoke - screen operatives who are obstructing justice in the greatest treason conspiracies of all time .

Subject : More Faked Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination The Zapruder Film http://www.brasschecktv.com/page/385.html 9/11 in 1963
Most people assume the famous " Zapruder film " showing the moment John F. Kennedy was shot is an accurate portrayal of what happened .
What many do n't know is that even before digital video it was possible to alter moving picture images .
And the Zapruder films shows extensive signs of having been doctored .
Manipulation of moving pictures is another similarity between the Kennedy assassination and the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center .

Have you heard about a book called Beautiful Code ?
This book is composed of 33 essays by well - known computer scientists and software engineers on the same question - " What is the most beautiful piece of code you know ? "
Chapter 3 of this book is written by Jon Bentley .
The chapter is curiously titled " The Most Beautiful Code I Never Wrote " and it talks about a beautiful implementation and experimental analysis of the most widely used sorting algorithm in the world called Quicksort .
Jon also decided to give a talk at Google on the same topic .
In this techtalk , he talks about three Quicksort topics .
In the first part Jon discusses an elegant and tiny implementation of Quicksort .
In the next part he analyzes the Quick sort algorithm by instrumenting this elegant implementation .
Finally , he talks about a production quality Quicksort implementation which has been included in C standard library ( qsort function ) .
What I learned the most from this lecture is the experimental part of counting number of comparsions of an algorithm .
I had never read about experimental analysis of algorithms .
Interesting ideas from the lecture :
[ 02:30 ]
What 's the most beautiful code you 've ever written ?
[ 04:58 ]
The classical Quicksort algorithm .
[ 05:32 ]
Best case ( nlog ( n ) ) , worst ( n 2 ) and average case ( nlog ( n ) ) analysis results of Quicksort .
) and average case ( nlog (n ) ) analysis results of Quicksort . [ 08:00 ] Randomization in Quicksort .
[ 09:08 ] Lomuto 's idea of partitioning .
[ 10:48 ] Partitioning algorithm implementation pseudocode .
[ 11:10 ] Beautiful Quicksort code .
[ 12:13 ] Strengths of Quicksort : simple to implement and explain , pretty fast .
Weaknesses of Quicksort : quadratic time for increasing elements ( fix by randomization ) , quadratic time for equal elements , not stable .
[ 13:55 ] " vigorous writing is concise " / William Strunk Jr.'s /
[ 14:49 ] Simplest semi-production C Quicksort implementation .
[ 15:35 ]
How much time will Quicksort take on average on indistinct elements ?
[ 17:00 ] Graph of ( runtime / N , logN ) for Quicksort and Heapsort .
[ 18:31 - 32:00 ]
Finding number of comparisons for Quicksort experimentally .
[ 23:08 ]
Doing various tricks the time to count comparisons reduced from nlog ( n ) to n and space reduced from n to log (n ) .
[ 24:25 ]
The Inventor 's Paradox : " The more ambitious plan may have more chance of success . "
[ 30:13 ] Perlis : " Simplicity does not precede complexity , but follows it . "
[ 30:45 ]
Mathematical solution to Quicksort 's comparison complexity .
[ 31:35 ]
The solution is ~ 1.386nlog(n )
[ 32:10 ]
Analysis of comparisons in Quicksort is isomorphic to time taken to insert an element in a Binary Search Tree .
[ 36:25 ]
A beautiful bug report on the original implementation of C library 's qsort
[ 39:31 ]
Engineering qsort together with Doug McIlroy .
Goals and strategy .
[ 41:23 ]
With equal elements , some Quicksorts go quadratic , some go nlog (n ) , some go linear .
[ 41:46 ]
Is there a quick algorithm for ternary ( ) partitioning ?
[ 46:00 ]
Knuth said that the overheard and comparisons took the same amount of time but the swaps really killed you , where as Jon and Doug found that time ( overhead ) < time ( swaps ) < time ( comparisons ) , if swaps are done properly .
[ 46:30 ]
Choosing effective partitioning element was important .
First , middle or random gave runtime aproximately 1.386nlog ( n ) , where as median of three or median and three medians gave run times of 1.188nlog ( n ) and 1.09nlog ( n ) , respectivey .
[ 46:50 ]
The final qsort had ternary partitioning , fast swap , adaptive sample for partition element , insertion sort for small files .
[ 47:40 ]
The complete code of C library 's qsort .
[ 48:15 ]
Beauties of qsort ( beautiful algorithm , beautiful interface , beautiful bug report , beautiful cost models , beautiful tests )
[ 50:40 ]
Three beautiful Quicksorts - 1 ) a simple teaching tool , 2 ) an anaysis of Quicksort , 3 ) An industrial - strength Quicksort .
[ 51:35 ] Q and A .
Here is a working C program which runs Quicksort algorithm ( in bold ) from the Chapter 3 of the book .
The algorithm sorts the global array of integers x .
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < time .h> # define S( a ) ( sizeof ( a ) / sizeof ( a [ 0 ] ) ) int x [ ] = { 56 , 10 , 39 , 15 , 20 , 62 , 14 , 39 , 77 , 17 } ; void swap ( int i , int j ) { int t = x[ i ] ; x [ i ] = x[j ] ; x[ j ] = t ; } int randint ( int l , int u ) { return rand ( ) % ( u - l+1 ) +l ; } < strong > void quicksort ( int l , int u ) { int i , m ; if ( l >= u ) return ; swap( l , randint ( l , u ) ) ; m = l ; for ( i = l+1 ; i <= u ; i++ ) if ( x [ i ] < x[l ] ) swap ( ++m , i ) ; swap(l , m ) ; quicksort ( l , m - 1 ) ; quicksort ( m+1 , u ) ; }</strong > int main ( ) { int i ; srand ( time ( NULL ) ) ; quicksort ( 0 , S( x ) - 1 ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < S( x ) ; i++) { printf ( " %d " , x[ i ] ) ; } printf ( "
" ) ; return 0 ; }
In a functional programming language , Quicksort can be written even more elegantly .
Check out this Quicksort written in Haskell ( thanks to bayareaguy . )
quicksort ( x:xs ) = quicksort [ i | i <- xs , i < x ] ++ [ x ] ++ quicksort [ i | i <- xs , i >= x ] quicksort [ ] = [ ]
And what 's the most beautiful code you 've ever written ?
Mr Maroni said Roma children would be fingerprinted to avoid " begging " Italy 's interior minister has sparked criticism with a proposal that would see police fingerprinting all members of the Roma community living in camps .
Roberto Maroni , of the anti-immigrant Northern League , said the move would guarantee that those with the right to stay could live in decent conditions .
Those without that right , including children , would be sent home , he said .
The UN Children 's Fund ( Unicef ) has criticised the proposal , as have opposition MPs .
Mr Maroni said the fingerprinting of Roma - or Gypsy - people would include " children too , to avoid phenomena like begging " .
Since Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was returned to power in elections two months ago , his government has focused on law and order , says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Rome .
The blame for the rising crime has fallen on the Roma gypsy community and , in recent weeks , camps have been raided by police while others have been attacked and burnt by vigilante mobs , our correspondent adds .
Stunned and concerned Opposition MPs said it was wrong to treat children as criminals .
To respect all children 's right to equality [ Mr Moroni should ] record all Italian children in the same way
Vincenzo Spadafora
Unicef Italy Rosy Bindi , who held the post of family minister in the centre - left government that was ousted in January , said the initiative was " unacceptable " .
It would lead to an " ethnic register " that would " treat Roma children as if they were hardened criminals " , she said .
The head of Unicef Italy , Vincenzo Spadafora , said his organisation was " stunned and deeply concerned " by the proposal .
" We 'd like to suggest to him ( Mr Maroni ) that to respect all children 's right to equality he should record all Italian children in the same way , " said Mr Spadafora .
" Roma children are no different from other children .
Moreover children cannot and should not be treated as adults . "
Meanwhile , Amos Luzzatto , the former president of Italy 's Union of Jewish Communities , said the measure was a form of " ethnic surveying " .
" You start like this then you move on to the exclusion from schools , separated classes and widespread discrimination , " he said .
Recalling how Jews , Roma and other minorities were targeted during Italy 's years of fascism , he accused the country of having " lost its memory " .

氮氧化物监测基本原 理
什么是NO x？ 氮氧化物（主要 是NO和NO 2）或NO x是一组高活性气体的总称，其含有不同量和化学构型的氮和氧。大多数氮氧化物无色无味。然而，在人口稠密的地区，一种非常常见的污染物，二氧化氮（NO
2）以及空气中的其他颗粒通常可被视为红褐色的烟雾层。当燃料在高温下燃烧时形成氮氧化物，如在燃烧过程中。NO x的主要来源是机动车辆，电力设施以及其他工业，商业和住宅来源。 测 量NO x的最基本方法是使用单个传感器 的 “ 简单NO x ” 。NO（一氧化氮） 是NO x的主要成分，直接用气体传感器测量。然后基于燃烧燃料和过程的类型假设NO与NO 2的比率，从中收集NO：NO 2比率的历史数据。然后使用测量的NO和假设的NO：NO 2比率计算NO x。 总NO x 确定NO x的更准确和精确的方法是提 供NO和NO 2的实际测量。 当NO和NO
2都用气体传感器直接测量时，不再存在假定的NO：NO 2比率。“ 总NO x ” 是测量的NO加上测量的NO
2的总和。 NO x，尤其是NO 2，是水溶性气体。在测量NO x时，重要的是确保冷凝不会积聚并使NO
2气泡形成气相进入冷凝物。最大限度地减少从烟道到分析仪的运输时间，并在烟气进入分析仪时立即干燥烟气，这样可以防止NO
2冒泡。然后，内部热电冷却器可以快速干燥烟道气，以避免将NO 2稀释到冷凝物中，以允许烟气样品最能代表释放的排放物。这种“真正的NO x ” 方法使用 带NO和NO 2的冷水机组气体传感器是使用氮氧化物检测仪是NO x的最有效和最准确的方法。 测量NO和NO 2的常用方法包括使用电化学，非分散红外（NDIR）和化学发光技术的传感器。无眼界科技使用电化学气体传感器测量烟气排放中的NO和NO
2 。

From the beginning , there was purpose behind forced schooling , purpose which had nothing to do with what parents , kids , or communities wanted .
Instead , this grand purpose was forged out of what a highly centralized corporate economy and system of finance bent on internationalizing itself was thought to need ; that , and what a strong , centralized political state needed , too .
School was looked upon from the first decade of the twentieth century as a branch of industry and a tool of governance .
— John Taylor Gatto , The Underground History of American Education
Besides that nonsense 9/11 Commission Report , look at what teachers are being told to bake into the curriculum :
“ Tell the story in the classroom about those who suffered losses simply unimaginable , but also about what came out of that loss that was absolutely amazing , ” said Kean , a former teacher .
“ As part of 9/11 , you have to tell that story . ”
Fetishization of the victims .
To be followed , I wonder , by a rousing session of the two minutes hate ?
What possible use could students — who are barely able to read or find their own country on a map — have for topics like operation NORTHWOODS , what happened at NORAD that morning , the collapse of the buildings , the flying circus , on and on and all the rest ?
None of that .
Sit down , peck at your GPS tracking unit , eat your breakfast stick and shut up .
Oh yeah , write a paper about the victims .
No thanks .
I ’ll teach my son about 9/11 at the dining room table .
Via : Star Ledger :
As chairman of the national 9/11 commission , former Gov. Thomas Kean has gone before the president , Congress and other powerful dignitaries with lessons of Sept. 11 .
Yesterday , Kean spoke to an ar guably more - influential audience when he shared many of those same lessons with educators crafting a curriculum for teaching New Jersey ’s children about the attacks .
“ You have an enormous responsibility , ” Kean told the group gathered at Liberty Science Center in Jersey City .
“ How to teach this terrible event and get across these things to our children , you are vested with that incredible responsibility .
But if I have faith in anything , I have faith in teachers . ”
The setting was a conference kicking off a yearlong effort to develop curriculum and resources for teachers faced with a dual challenge of teaching the history and context of the terrorist attacks in communities that witnessed them .
And with about 100 educators in attendance yesterday , it was clear the hurdles do n’t stop there .
There are rising demands on teachers throughout the year , scant resources in textbooks and elsewhere and even the timing difficulty of an niversaries that come only days after schools open .
“ We need to be dealing with this in totality … more than a simple commemoration , ” said Robert Barnshaw , a Gloucester Township teacher .
“ And in the pattern of the year , Sept. 11 is probably not the best time to be doing that . ”
To hear Kean and others speak , Sept. 11 could easily be its own course , although most agreed it ’s a topic better infused across different subjects and even into nurses ’ and counselors ’ offices .
“ It ’s an event that ’s absolutely unique in the history of this coun try and needs to be treated as such , ” said Kean .
The former governor ’s national commission in 2004 penned a scathing report on the lead - up to the attacks , with widespread blame meted out for security lapses and policy failures .
While mincing few words yesterday in sharing those lessons with teachers , Kean also implored them to tell students about the courage and action that arose from the attacks , from the heroism on Flight 93 to the activism of survivors ’ families .
“ Tell the story in the classroom about those who suffered losses simply unimaginable , but also about what came out of that loss that was absolutely amazing , ” said Kean , a former teacher .
“ As part of 9/11 , you have to tell that story . ”
In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice Beatrice Ask , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) has asked for " assistance " from the Swedish government with preventing video clips from the Olympics in Beijing to be shared on The Pirate Bay .
The Pirate Bay , however , does not plan to take anything down , and renamed their tracker to The Beijing Bay .
The IOC is getting used to censoring the Internet , and has asked the Swedish government to help remove Olympic torrents from The Pirate Bay – which they claimed have been downloaded more than 1 million times .
IOC also wants the government to assist in preventing (! ) clips from the Olympics closing ceremonies to be shared .
Apparently the IOC has been reading the article we wrote last week , which showed that millions of people are downloading the Olympic opening ceremony on BitTorrent .
In the meantime , several other Olympic clips have been posted .
Although these are not as popular as the opening ceremony , the gymnastics finals and other events get close to 50.000 downloads .
The press secretary of the Minister of Justice has stated that it is primarily clips from the Opening ceremonies that the IOC wants to stop .
The Committee also questions the legal situation and wants to be informed on whether they can take measures themselves to prohibit videos of the Olympics to be shared .
It ’s interesting that the IOC chose to contact the Swedish government , instead of The Pirate Bay .
They probably realize that sending a takedown notice would n’t be that effective .
Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak : “ I think it ’s good that IOC understands that they will get nowhere with sending a legal threat to us .
It shows they ’re smart and without manners . ”
“ We were going to ignore the Olympics , but now we ’re loading our cannons .
Our weapons of mass distribution are pointed towards China . ”
The first action The Pirate Bay took is creating a new logo for the site , and renaming it to The Beijing Bay .
In true Pirate Bay style the front page logo now links to the tag “ give us the gold , ” Peter said .
The tag refers to the incident with the Swedish wrestler last week , who tossed away his bronze medal after he lost his chance on a Gold medal because of an error made by the jury .
Peter told us : “ I also hope that the Swedish government will report back to them and tell them to give us the gold that the IOC stole from the Swedish wrestler .
And to tell them to not host the Olympics in a country with poor respect for human rights . ”
Most BitTorrent sites do take down torrents when they are asked to .
However , none of the admins Torrent Freak spoke to received a takedown request so far .
Of course , the solution to IOC ’s BitTorrent problem is easy .
By not televising the closing ceremonies , the IOC not only hinders filesharers , but also makes sure VHS tapers worldwide wo n’t be able to steal the Olympic spirit .
Sounds like a winner .
THE NEWS has been drowned out by the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac situation , but brewing behemoths InBev and Anheuser Busch have arrived at a purchase agreement .
The deal will , in all probability , be a good one for Anheuser Busch , but the end of family control of that most American of companies has irked some citizens ( especially those residing in St. Louis ) .
With the Dubai Ports World fiasco still hovering in recent memory , many business types have wondered whether the deal might survice political pressure .
Well , according to Paul Krugman , the backlash has begun , in hilarious fashion :
“ I ’ll tell you one thing , ” said the 21 - year - old concrete worker during his lunch break at The Brick of St. Louis bar , in the shadow of this city ’s storied Anheuser - Busch Cos. brewery , “ if Budweiser is made by a different country , I do n’t drink Budweiser anymore .
I ’ll go back to Wild Turkey . ”
( Wild Turkey , a Kentucky bourbon , is owned by French drinks giant Pernod Ricard SA . )
Not that funny for the American workers who would continued to be employed by InBev-owned Anheuser Busch , however .
Residents in the Vaucluse , a popular southern French tourist destination , were banned yesterday from drinking well - water or swimming or fishing in two rivers after a uranium leak from one of France 's nuclear power plants .
Nuclear officials yesterday revised down the amount of untreated liquid uranium that spilled from the Tricastin nuclear power centre in Bollene , saying it was limited to 75kg and ranked grade one on the one - to - seven scale of nuclear accidents .
But the spillage of waste material containing uranium in the picturesque area of Provence , 30 miles from Avignon , which is currently hosting an arts festival , embarrassed the government .
Nicolas Sarkozy has prioritised exporting nuclear expertise worldwide , including to Britain .
Nuclear power comprises 87 % of France 's electricity production , but yesterday anti-nuclear groups renewed their criticisms of the nuclear power policy .
The leak occurred when a tank was being cleaned between Monday night and Tuesday morning but was not detected until yesterday .
Around 30 cubic metres of liquid containing uranium , which was not enriched , leaked out of a tank .
Of this , 18 cubic metres poured on to the ground and into the nearby Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers , which flow into the Rhone .
The plant has been operational since 1975 .
Vaucluse authorities banned drinking well - water , fishing and eating fish from the rivers as well as swimming and water sports and irrigating crops with potentially contaminated water .
One swimmer among 100 bathers asked to immediately vacate a local lake said it was as if there had been sharks in it .
Officials from the Socatri safety agency , a subsidiary of nuclear giant Areva , said groundwater , wells and rivers had shown no effects yesterday .
The nuclear safety authority said radioactive levels detected in rivers and lakes in the region were decreasing .
The prefecture of Vaucluse said the leaked uranium should only be found in very small quantities and the risk was low but the ban on drinking , fishing and swimming would continue .
Germany 's Social Democrat environment minister , Michael Müller , whose party is opposed to nuclear energy , said yesterday that the incident should not be taken lightly .
" It 's no trifle when active uranium penetrates the soil , " he told Agence France Presse .
The French environmental group , the Committee for Independent Research and Information on Radioactivity , said that the radioactivity released into the environment was at least 100 times higher than the fixed limit for that site for the entire year .
Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner , Aslihan Tumer , said : " Given the restrictions on the consumption and use of water in the area , it is clear that the leak poses a risk to the local population and to the environment . "
" White Paper " Drafted before NIE even Requested
National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 254

John Prados - ( 202 ) 994-7000
Washington D.C. , August 22 , 2008 - The U.S. intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to Bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of Iraq , according to a documents posting on the Web today by National Security Archive senior fellow John Prados .
The documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis , which then conformed to public positions taken by Pentagon and White House officials .
For example , a July 2002 draft of the " White Paper " ultimately issued by the CIA in October 2002 actually pre-dated the National Intelligence Estimate that the paper purportedly summarized , but which Congress did not insist on until September 2002 .
A similar comparison between a declassified draft and the final version of the British government 's " White Paper " on Iraq weapons of mass destruction adds to evidence that the two nations colluded in the effort to build public support for the invasion of Iraq .
Dr. Prados concludes that the new evidence tends to support charges raised by former White House press secretary Scott McClellan and by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in its long - delayed June 2008 " Phase II " report on politicization of intelligence .

1942 : Hedy Lamarr , once described by German actor - director Max Reinhardt as " the most beautiful woman in Europe , " receives a U.S. patent for a frequency - hopping device designed to guide radio - controlled torpedoes while making them more difficult to detect in the water .
Holding the patent with her is George Antheil .
It 's the incongruity of the patent holders with their invention , as much as the invention itself , that is remarkable .
Lamarr , a Viennese - born movie actress , would eventually be given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
Antheil , an American avant - garde composer of orchestral music and opera , lived in Paris during the ' 20s and counted Ernest Hemingway and Igor Stravinsky among his friends .
Not exactly the kind of folks you picture tinkering with cutting - edge weapons of war .
In fact , their device was way ahead of its time .
Although it was patented at the height of World War II , frequency hopping relied on electronics technology that did n't exist yet .
An updated version of the Lamarr - Antheil device finally appeared on U.S. Navy ships in 1962 ( three years after their patent expired ) , and was first used during the Cuban missile crisis .
In 1942 , though , Navy brass were unimpressed , dismissing the invention as too bulky to fit inside a torpedo .
Antheil 's arguments to the contrary were ignored , and he said later that comparing parts of the invention to the fundamental mechanism of a player piano in front of a bunch of naval officers had probably been a mistake .
" ' My god , ' I can see them saying , 'we shall put a player piano in a torpedo . ' "
Lamarr and Antheil dropped the idea and turned to other things .
In the end , their device was resurrected by engineers at Sylvania and proved to be one of the forerunners of spread - spectrum communications , which has applications in satellite systems and cellphone technology .
Lamarr was the quintessential beauty with brains .
( She was contemptuous of many of her fellow actresses : " Any girl can be glamorous , " she said .
" All she has to do is stand still and look stupid . " )
She was mathematically gifted and became acquainted with the intricacies of modern weaponry while married to her first husband , an Austrian munitions manufacturer .
Having established herself acting in German films , Lamarr came in 1937 to the United States , where she signed with Louis B. Mayer and MGM .
It was Mayer who got her to change her name , from Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler to Hedy Lamarr .
She enjoyed a solid career in Hollywood , although other leading ladies of the day , such as Ingrid Bergman , eclipsed her as a box - office draw .
Then there was George Antheil .
Aside from his provocative compositions and eccentric skills as a pianist – his jarring technique frequently agitated his audiences , to the point where he would lay a pistol on the piano as a warning to keep quiet – Antheil was very much a Renaissance man .
He wrote widely on a variety of subjects , penning a syndicated advice column to the lovelorn and writing about endocrinology for Esquire magazine .
He also published a book on the subject , Every Man His Own Detective : A Study of Glandular Endocrinology .
During World War II – which he had accurately predicted would start in Europe with the German invasion of Poland – Antheil served as a war correspondent .
It was Antheil 's knowledge of endocrinology , in fact , that began the Lamarr - Antheil collaboration .
Aware of his work in the field , Lamarr approached him at a Hollywood dinner party to talk about the possibility of increasing the size of her breasts .

300 Point Dow Gains ?
During Bear Markets ONLY
Merrill Lynch 's David Rosenberg was on CNBC this morning , discussing the current Bear Market .
He noted that this was the sixth 300 point rally to occur since September 2007 ( markets peaked the next month ) -- a period of time which can only be described as a Bear Market .
Even more intriguing , he observed that EVERY 300 point DJIA rally has occurred ONLY during bear markets .
( Even the 1998 LTCM crisis saw two single - day gains of more than 300 points , September 8 and October 15 , 1998 .
At its intra-day lows , 1998 had a 20 % decline ) .
During the 2000 to 2002 bear market , the DJIA had 15 days where it gained more than 300 points .
The first was March 15 , 2000 ( five days after the NASDAQ peaked ) and the last was October 15 , 2002 , near the bottom of the bear market .
Hence , the odds are against making money chasing these 300 + point rallies .
During the 2002 to 2007 bull market , the DJIA had no days where it gained more than 300 points .
Jim Bianco asks : " What does the stock market do during bear markets ?
It has days where it gains more than 300 points in a day .
What does n't the stock market do in a bull market ?
It does not have days where it gains more than 300 points in a day . "
What does yesterday 's rally say about the state of the stock market . . .?

Evolving Obama now supports $ 2 billion more for NASA
In contrast to his earlier views on space exploration , Democrat also says he backs one more shuttle mission before it is retired
WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's position on space exploration continued to evolve Sunday as the Illinois Democrat endorsed a congressional plan to add $ 2 billion to NASA 's budget and agreed to back at least one more space shuttle mission .
In a policy paper released Sunday by his campaign , the presumptive Democratic nominee said his goal was to " minimize the gap " between the end of the shuttle program and the beginning of future manned missions .
He also said he was hoping " to ensure retention of " thousands of NASA workers in Texas and Florida whose jobs are threatened by a possible five - year gap before the beginning of the Constellation initiative to send astronauts to the moon and Mars .
The additional NASA funding and shuttle mission are being pushed strongly by Democrats and Republicans from the two states .
Obama 's Republican opponent , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , has already endorsed closing the five - year gap .
President Bush opposes the $ 2 billion in funding , saying it would be fiscally irresponsible .
Obama has not always been a strong supporter of additional money for NASA .
Indeed , in December 2007 , his campaign Web site declared that he would finance an early childhood education initiative by reducing funding for the Constellation program .
And Obama told the Houston Chronicle 's editorial board in February that he was not convinced that human exploration was worth the cost .
Acting on complaints
After Democrats from Florida and Texas complained , Obama pivoted and found other ways to fund his education initiative .
" To his credit , he changed that position , " Florida Sen . Bill Nelson said Sunday .
Republicans on Sunday ridiculed Obama 's latest statement and said he is pandering to voters to remain competitive in the swing state of Florida , home to the Kennedy Space Center .
" Obama 's shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters , " said Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant .
" Let 's be honest : Obama is only embracing NASA now because of his political problems in Florida . "
McCain told the Houston Chronicle earlier this year that he viewed manned spaceflight as " something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program . "
He said he wants to close the gap in manned spaceflight , but added , " I think we 've got to sort out our priorities better .
In other words , we can't do everything . "
Obama echoed those thoughts in a statement released by his campaign Sunday .
McCain 's Democratic opponent declared that he hoped " to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and ... continue our nation 's pre-eminence in space . "
Would add shuttle mission
While Obama endorsed a " balanced program of space exploration and scientific discovery , " his policy statement did not include any specific mention of the Constellation program .
It did , however , discuss in great detail his support for expanding NASA 's robotic and aeronautic programs .
He also proposed to restore a national aeronautics and space council , a group including NASA , the Department of Defense , the Department of Transportation and other air and space stakeholders .
The most important change in Obama 's past positions is that he now favors at least one additional space shuttle mission before the shuttles are retired .
Florida Sen .
Nelson said Obama 's staff assured him the presidential candidate favors the congressional plan to add $ 2 billion to NASA 's budget .
Obama 's newly released details impressed former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn , D - Ohio .
But Glenn , a former space policy adviser to Obama primary rival Hillary Clinton , said he wants more from his candidate .
" I hope it goes even further , " Glenn said .
" At least ... one ( more ) additional shuttle flight . "
Republicans remained skeptical .
" Considering Obama 's shifting positions , he cannot be trusted to fully support NASA 's mission to Mars , " said the RNC 's Conant .
" The only thing Barack Obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that it's a good applause line . "

Introduction 1.1
Computer simulation of social and economic interactions has been gaining adherents for more than two decades .
Contemporary researchers often promote simulation methods as a “ third way ” of doing social science , distinct from both pure theory and from statistical exploration ( Axelrod 1997 ) .
While many methodological questions remain areas of active inquiry , especially in the realms of model robustness and model / data confrontations , researchers have been attracted by the ease with which computational methods can shed light on intractable theoretical puzzles .
Some researchers have gone so far as to argue that pure theory has little left to offer — that for social science to progress , we need simulations rather than theorems ( Hahn 1991 ) .
1.2
One specific hope is that simulations will advance social science by enabling the creation of more realistic models .
For example , economists can build models that incorporate important historical , institutional , and psychological properties that “ pure theory ” often has trouble accommodating , including learning , adaptation , and other interesting limits on the computational resources of real - world actors .
Another specific hope is that unexpected but useful ( for prediction or understanding ) aggregate outcomes will emerge from the interactions of autonomous actors in agent - based simulations .
These hopes are already being met in many surprising and useful ways ( Bonabeau 2002 ) .
1.3
Simulations are considered to be agent - based when the outcomes of interest result from the repeated interaction of autonomous actors , called ‘ agents ’ .
These agents are autonomous in the sense that each agent selects actions from its own feasible set based on its own state .
An agent is often a stylized representation of a real - world actor : either an individual , such as a consumer or entrepreneur , or an aggregate of individuals , such as a corporation or a monetary authority ( which may in turn be explicitly constituted of agents ) .
1.4
Substantial research in agent - based simulation ( ABS ) has been conducted in a variety of general purpose programming languages , including procedural languages such as Fortran , C , or Pascal ; object oriented languages such as Objective -C , Smalltalk , C++ , or Java ; very - high level matrix languages such as MATLAB or GAUSS ; and even symbolic algebra languages such as Maple or Mathematica .
There are also a variety of special purpose toolkits for ABS , including SWARM and MAML ( built in Objective - C ) ; Ascape , NetLogo , and Repast ( built in Java ) ; and many others ( Gilbert and Bankes 2002 ) .
In addition , there are a few efforts at general environments in which a variety of ABS experiments can be run .
( Bremer 's GLOBUS model , Hughes 's IFs model , and Tesfatsion 's Trade Network Game model are salient examples . )
Researchers occasionally express the hope that one of these might emerge as a lingua franca for ABS research ( Luna and Stefansson 2000 ) .
Working against this , as others note , are the interfaces of capable toolkits and environments , which are often as difficult to master as a full - blown programming language ( Gilbert and Bankes 2002 ) .
A variety of languages and toolkits remain in use , and this seems likely to persist , along with efforts to assess their relative utility ( Railsback et al. 2006 ) .
1.5
This paper explores the use of Python as a language for ABS experiments .
Python is a very - high - level general - purpose programming language that is suitable for a range of simulation projects , from class projects by students to substantial research projects .
In the face of the plethora of alternatives , an additional ABS research language may seem otiose .
However this paper shows that the Python programming language offers a natural environment for agent - based simulation that is appropriate for both research and teaching .
1.6
This paper illustrates that suitability by quickly and simply developing a toolkit that can be applied to a classic ABS model : the evolutionary iterated prisoner 's dilemma .
This application , which is familiar to social scientists and illustrative of key needs in ABS research , serves to illustrate some virtues of Python for such simulation projects .
The core goals of the paper naturally imply a substantial tutorial component : an introduction to agent - based simulation for those new to the area , an introduction to simulation of the evolutionary iterated prisoner 's dilemma , and a very narrowly focused introduction to the Python programming language .
Since code reuse and extensibility are crucial components of simulation projects , we also show how to extend a basic simulation toolkit to explore the importance of topology , payoff cardinality , and strategy evaluation for evolutionary outcomes .
1.7
The iterated prisoner 's dilemma ( IPD ) is familiar to many social scientists , and many ABS researchers have implemented some version of the IPD as an exercise or illustration .
Readers with ABS backgrounds will be able to appreciate how simple , readable , and intuitive our Python implementation proves when compared to similar projects implemented in other languages .
This is a key reason to use Python for ABS research and teaching : with a little care from the programmer and an extremely modest understanding of Python by the reader , Python code can often be as readable as pseudocode .
This is no accident : readability is an explicit design goal of the Python language .
1.8
The core objective of the paper is to enable students , teachers , and researchers immediately to begin social - science simulation projects in a general purpose programming language .
We achieve this by pursuing three related goals .
First , we offer an introduction to the object - oriented modeling of agents , which is a crucial component of agent - based simulation .
Second , we elaborate a simple yet usable toolkit that we apply to a classic ABS model : an evolutionary iterated prisoner 's dilemma .
The speed and ease with which this prototype is developed supports our claim that ABS research and teaching find a natural ally in the Python programming language .
Finally , we illustrate code reuse and extensibility by extending our basic toolkit in two directions , exploring the importance of topology and of payoff cardinality for evolutionary outcomes .
Object Oriented Programming 2.1
This section provides a very brief introduction to object - oriented programming and its relationship to agent - based simulation .
It also provides a similarly brief introduction to aspects of the Python programming language that facilitate ABS research .
2.2
Agent - based simulation is most naturally approached with object - oriented programming languages .
In order to illustrate this natural relationship , we need a little vocabulary .
An object is a collection of characteristics ( data ) and behavior ( methods ) .
In a game simulation , for example , a player object may have a move history as data and a method for producing new moves .
We will call a computer program ‘ object - based ’ to the extent that data and methods tend to be bundled together into useful objects .
2.3
Many researchers consider models of interacting agents to be naturally object - based .
For example , a player in a game is naturally conceived in terms of that individual player 's characteristics and behavior .
We may therefore bundle these together as the data and methods of a player object .
( The next section presents an example . ) 2.4
In the present paper , we will consider object - based code to be “ object - oriented ” when it relies on encapsulation .
Code relies on encapsulation when objects interact via interfaces that conceal implementation details : users of an object rely on its interface , without detailed knowledge of how the object produces its behavior .
For example , we will design a player object such that we can ask for its next move simply by communicating with its move method , without worrying about how that method is implemented .
Specifically , we need not worry about whether the player owns the data used to produce the move , or even whether the player delegates the selection of the move to some other agent .
2.5
Given this highly simplified taxonomy , we can say object - oriented programming ( OOP ) is possible in most computer languages .
It is a matter of approach and practices : OOP focuses on defining encapsulating objects and determining how such objects will interact .
Yet it is also the case that some languages facilitate OOP .
We say a programming language is object - oriented to the extent that it facilitates object - oriented programming .
2.6
Key facilities of any OOP language are inheritance and polymorphism .
Inheritance is essentially a useful way to implement the old practice of code reuse : one class of objects can inherit characteristics ( data ) and behavior ( methods ) from another class .
This allows common data and methods to be coded at a single location , reducing coding errors and facilitating program maintenance and debugging .
In practice , we often create specialized classes that inherit from more general classes , making it easy to compare the implications of various behavioral specializations .
Inheritance proves to be an extremely powerful way to reuse existing code , and it often facilitates writing simpler , more robust , and easier to understand code .
Part of the resulting simplicity arises through ‘ polymorphism ' , as when a common method call is made to distinct classes that provide divergent responses .
For example , all player classes implement a move method , but some players base their move selection on their past playing experience and others do not .
For an object to participate as a player in a particular game , it must respond appropriately to certain messages .
For example , it must have a move method that accepts certain arguments and returns appropriate values .
However , we need not know anything about the inner workings of the player 's move method ; how a player moves can vary by player type .
( Subsequent sections provide examples . ) 2.7
The phenomenologically salient actors of social science will often be natural objects in our simulation models .
This adds intuitive appeal to our simulation models : the actors in our artificial world are these objects .
The interactions of these autonomous units produce the model outcomes , suggesting analogies to the ways in which real - world actors produce real - world outcomes .
This aspect of OOP can facilitate production of sensible models and almost certainly helps with communication — two big advantages in a relatively new area of research .
Considering Python 2.8
Researchers naturally attend to productivity when choosing a programming environment .
Students and teachers are particularly interested in ease of use , cost , and the availability of good documentation and support groups .
The choice of programming language will therefore be very personal , responding to cost , to individual modes of thinking , and to existing human capital .
That said , Python 's combination of ease of use , power , and readability constitute an attractive environment .
This section provides an overview of some of these features .
( Appendix B includes guidance for installing and running Python . ) 2.9
Python is a young language : version 1 was released in 1994 , and the very popular version 2.2 had its final release in 2003 .
Despite its youth , Python is considered stable and robust , with around a million users ( Lutz 2007 ) .
Python is open - sourced under the liberal Python License , which ensures that it can be freely used ( even in commercial projects ) .
The Python Software Foundation protects the Python trademark , funds Python related development , and provide extensive documentation for both beginners and advanced users .
Python 's unusally clear syntax and ease of use has made it increasingly popular in introductory computer science classes .
At the same time , Python 's power , flexibility , true object orientation , and ready integration with other languages have given Python a growing presence in business and scientific computing .
These are the same features that will underpin the simplicity and readability of the game simulations presented below .
2.10
Many researchers claim that OOP languages facilitate ABS modeling .
Among the OOP languages , Python is notable for its readability , ease of use , and natural syntax — all of which facilitate rapid learning and easy prototyping .
This does not constitute an argument that Python is the “ best ” language for agent - based simulation , whatever that might mean ; it simply highlights a few features that make Python an attractive language for students , teachers , and researchers who have not already made a language commitment .
No single feature makes Python unique , but together they add up to an attractive combination of power and ease of use .
Here are a few salient considerations .
Readability
We list this first , since it is a crucial consideration in teaching , code sharing , and code reuse .
Code that is easy to read is more easily shared with a research community and more easily reused by the author after the passage of time .
Lightly commented Python code is often as readable as pseudocode , as we show below .
Readability is promoted by Python 's syntax , especially the use of whitespace to delimit code blocks .
It is also promoted by the Python programming culture , which emphasizes code readability and disparages clever but obscure programming tricks .
Documentation Online documentation is excellent and free .
Built - in functions generally provide excellent self - documentation ( via the help function ) .
Python encourages the creation of self - documenting objects , and a substantial amount of self - documentation is provided by Python 's extensive introspection facilities .
Interpreted Language
In principle , any language may be compiled or interpreted , and even so - called “ interpreted ” languages are generally compiled ( e.g. , to byte code ) before execution .
However interactive Python interpreters exist for every major platform , and Python programming is very largely platform independent .
This facilitates code - sharing and collaboration with other ABS researchers .
Working in an interactive interpreter can facilitate prototyping and rapid development .
From an instructional perspective , this is an important pedagogical aid ( due to the immediate feedback from the interpreter ) .
These advantages are not costless : lower - level languages such as C or Fortran will be much faster at loop - intensitve operations , and this speed difference can be critical for very large - scale simulations .
( But see the discussion of extensibility below . )
Dynamic Typing Python is dynamically typed : variables ( names ) do not have types ; rather the values that are assigned to them do .
Dynamic typing has two widely acknowledged advantages : code becomes simpler to write and simpler to read , and prototyping and refactoring are facilitated .
Duck Typing Python encourages programming to objects ’ methods rather than to their types .
This in turn encourages a strong polymorphism known as duck typing : objects interact based on their attributes ( rather than their class ) .
This facilitates quick prototyping and refactoring .
Flexible Built - In Data Structures
A few powerful , flexible , and extremely easy to use data structures are built - in , in the sense that Python always makes them available .
Here we mention the two sequence data types ( list and tuple ) and one mapping type ( dict ) .
Sequence data types are indexed collections of items , which may be heterogeneous .
Lists and tuples are sequence types that are ubiquitous in Python programming .
An empty list can be created as [ ] or as list ( ) ; an empty tuple can be created as ( ) or as tuple ( ) .
A populated list or tuple can be created with a comma separated listing of its elements : [ 1 , 'a ' ] is a two element list ( with heterogeneous elements ) ; ( 1 , 'a ' ) is a two element tuple ( with the same elements ) ; and [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] is a list containing two tuples , which each contain two elements .
Tuples are immutable : they can not be changed after they are created .
Lists are mutable : they can grow as needed , and elements can be replaced or deleted .
( See Appendix B for more details . )
Sequences can be used for very convenient loop control : Python 's for statement iterates over the items of a sequence .
For example , if seq is a list or tuple , the following code snippet prints a representation of each item in seq : for item in seq : print item
The dictionary is the basic Python mapping data type ( resembling hash tables or associative arrays in other languages ) .
A dictionary is a collection of key - value pairs , where the value can be retrieved by using the key as an index .
If x=dict ( a=0 , b=1 ) then x [ 'a ' ] returns the value 0 and x ['b ' ] returns the value 1 .
The same dictionary can be created from a sequence of 2 - tuples : x=dict ( [ ( ' a ' ,0 ) , ( ' b ' , 1 ) ] ) .
Useful Built - In Functions
A few dozen very useful functions are built - in , in the sense that Python always makes them available .
Examples include list , tuple , and dict , which are discussed above .
The user does not need to import any standard library modules to access built - in functions .
We will mention one more at this point : range .
If i is a nonnegative integer , then range ( i ) creates a list of the first i nonnegative integers .
It is idiomatic in Python to use range for loop control .
For example , for i in range ( 10 ) : print i Generator Expressions Python uses very powerful and easy to read syntax for the creation of data structures .
Rather than traditional looping constructs , “ generator expressions ” are often preferred for producing lists and tuples .
Generator expressions are perhaps best introduced by contrast with traditional practices .
Let players be a collection of players , each of whom has a playertype attribute , and suppose we want to produce a corresponding tuple of playertypes .
Here is a ( fairly ) traditional approach to this problem : ptypes = list ( ) for player in players : ptypes.append(player.playertype ) ptypes = tuple ( ptypes )
In this traditional approach , we create an empty list , to which we sequentially append the playertype type of each player , and we finally create a tuple corresponding to the list of playertypes .
As an alternative approach , we can accomplish the same thing more elegantly and efficiently with a generator expression : ptypes = tuple ( player .
playertype for player in players )
This iterates through the generator ( player. playertype for player in playerlist ) to populate a tuple of player types , one playertype for each player .
( In contrast with the first approach , we side - step the creation of a temporary list . )
The expression on the right reads very naturally : create a tuple that contains the player 's playertype for each player in players .
This is a remarkably readable and compact way to generate this new tuple 's elements .
Additional Considerations 2.11
The following more technical considerations may interest an instructor or a new researcher who is considering the use of Python for agent - based modeling .
Other readers can skip this section .
Garbage Collection
Many languages require the programmer to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for any objects created .
Memory leaks are a common problem in such languages , even for experienced programmers .
Other languages , Python included , build in automatic memory management : automatic garbage collection ensures that the memory allocated to an object is freed up when the object is no longer needed .
This may involve some sacrifice of speed and memory usage , but the gain in convenience is considerable .
Most social - science researchers will value this convenience , and most social - science students will find automatic garbage collection to be indispensable .
Powerful Standard Library Python comes with a powerful , and extremely well documented standard library .
Two components of special interest to ABS researchers are the utilities for platform independent interaction with the operating system and the extensive random - number services .
Graphics Excellent and powerful graphics libraries are freely available .
For example , users needing static or interactive two - dimensional graphs might use the free and open - source Matplotlib package , which allows both ease of use and , for those who need it , a remarkably fine - grained control of graphical presentations .
Numerics
The free and open - source NumPy package implements powerful multidimensional arrays along with the basic functionality required for scientific computing .
The NumPy - based SciPy package offers substantial additional functionality , resulting in a free and open source scientific computing environment competitive with many commercial offerings .
Extensibility Speed concerns may arise in any interpreted language when a program makes heavy use of looping constructs .
The high speed of modern computers mitigates this concern but for models with very large numbers of agents does not eliminate it .
One approach is to use a just - in - time compiler for Python code , which is part of the approach taken by the Psyco extension module .
More generally , Python is considered very extensible , in the sense that performance enhancing Python extensions can be written in relatively low - level programming languages such as C or Fortran .
2.12
Other important features of Python — exception handling , support for unit testing , support for multiple inheritance , support for metaclasses , support for metaprogramming ( via descriptors such as decorators and properties ) , support for simple but sophisticated operator overloading , and memory conserving features such as slots — prove useful in advanced applications .
These issues are beyond the scope of the current paper .
A Simple Game 3.1
When discussing agent - based simulations , nothing substitutes for actual code , so we will now implement a very simple game .
We initially eschew game theoretic considerations : our two players will randomly chose their moves and ultimately receive the payoffs determined by the game .
( See Appendix B for suggestions on how to run the following code . ) 3.2
This section provides an introduction to Python classes .
We therefore begin by defining a fairly trivial class .
A class definition provides a general description of the data and methods of a new type of object , and accordingly our definition of the RandomMover class provides a general description of our first game players .
A RandomMover has no data and a single method , named move .
We will soon create our first game players as “ instances ” of this RandomMover class , but first we will examine the class definition .
( Readers familiar with class and function definitions can skim the next few paragraphs . ) class RandomMover : def move ( self ) : return random.uniform ( 0,1 ) < 0.5 3.3
Note that a class definition starts with the keyword class , followed by the name ( RandomMover ) that we are giving the class , followed by a colon .
So the line class RandomMover : is our class - definition header : it begins our definition of the RandomMover class , which is completed by the indented statements that follow .
( Blocks are always defined in Python by level of indentation and never by the use of braces . ) 3.4
The body of this class definition is a function definition , which defines the only behavior of a RandomMover instance .
When asked to move , a RandomMover instance will return a random move , based on a draw from a standard uniform distribution .
3.5
A function definition starts with the keyword def , followed by the name ( move ) that we are giving the function , followed by parentheses that enclose any function parameters , followed by a colon .
So the line def move ( self ) : is our function definition header ; it begins our definition of the move function , which is completed by the indented statement that follows .
This function has one argument , which is called self for reasons that we now discuss .
3.6
Functions defined in the body of a class definition are called ‘ methods ’ .
Methods define the behavior of instances of that class .
When an instance receives a method call , Python always provides as an implicit first argument the instance itself .
( This is likely to sound obscure to a reader with no OOP background , but it should be clear by the end of this section . )
Therefore it is conventional to name this first argument self .
Note that even when the body of a method does not make use of the self argument , as illustrated by this introductory example , we still must include the self argument in the method definition .
3.7
Since Python uses indentation to delimit code blocks , we must indent our function - definition header to make it part of the class definition .
Similarly , the body of the function definition is given an additional level of indentation .
In this case , the body of the function is a single statement : return random.uniform ( 0,1 ) < 0.5 .
When this return - statement is executed , the expression random.uniform ( 0,1 ) < 0.5 is evaluated , and the resulting value is returned by our move method .
This value is computed as follows .
The expression random.uniform ( 0,1 ) evaluates to a draw from a standard uniform distribution , so it is a “ random ” number between zero and one .
It is compared to the number 0.5 .
The inequality comparison value is either True or False .
In what follows , a player must choose between two behaviors , which we call “ defection ” ( represented by True or 1 ) or “ cooperation ” ( represented by False or 0 ) .
These behaviors are discussed in more detail in the Prisoner 's Dilemma section .
3.8
We will now play a simple game .
We begin by creating a payoff matrix for the game .
( Note that we include in the code a comment to that effect : the hash mark ( # ) is a comment marker , signalling that the rest of the line is commentary rather than code . )
We will use the payoff matrix used in Scodel et al. ( 1959 ) and in many subsequent studies .
( In subsequent sections , we will consider the role of the payoff matrix in much more detail . )
The payoff matrix is constructed from lists and tuples ( as discussed above ) .
The assignment PAYOFFMAT = [ [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] , [ ( 5,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) ] ] creates a list containing two lists , each of which contains two tuples .
These tuples hold the move - based payoffs for two players .
For example , the tuple ( 3,3 ) gives the payoffs to the players if both cooperate : each player gets a payoff of 3 .
## GAME : RandomMover # create a payoff matrix and two players PAYOFFMAT = [ [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] , [ ( 5,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) ] ] player1 = RandomMover ( ) player2 = RandomMover ( ) # get a move from each player move1 = player1.move ( ) move2 = player2.move ( ) # retrieve and print the payoffs pay1 , pay2 = PAYOFFMAT [ move1 ] [ move2 ] print " Player1 payoff : " , pay1 print " Player2 payoff : " , pay2 3.9
We next create two RandomMover instances , which we name player1 and player2 .
Recall that a class definition provides a general description of a new kind of object , and we use this definition to create instances of this new kind of object .
We can assign a RandomMover instance to the name player1 like this : player1 = RandomMover ( ) .
We say that each player “ instantiates ” the RandomMover class .
3.10
Next we get moves from player1 and player2 by calling the move method of each player .
Using these moves and the payoff matrix , we calculate the payoff for each player .
( True is equivalent to the integer 1 , and False is equivalent to the integer 0 . )
Finally we print the results of playing this game .
( A comma separates items to be printed , so the first print statement prints two items : the descriptive string delimited by quotes , and the value of the player1 payoff . )
Playing Together Nicely 3.11
In the previous section , we defined the RandomMover class to have a built in probability of defection of 0.5 .
If we repeatedly play the game of that section , we will discover the average payoff implied by this strategy .
Much more informative would be the average payoff for each of a variety of strategies .
It would be senseless to create a new class for each strategy .
Instead , we will create a class that can produce instances that have different strategies .
We will call this class RandomPlayer .
This section illustrates what happens when RandomPlayer instances with various defection probabilities play against each other .
3.12
In the previous section we coded a simple two - player game : we ran the game and computed player payoffs based on a payoff matrix .
Our desire to run such games repeatedly for a variety of player strategies suggests that a game is a natural object in our project .
In this section , the games played will be instances of a SimpleGame class .
3.13
Consider the following initial design , which allows for a game object and player objects to interact .
A SimpleGame instance will have as data a list of players and a payoff matrix , and it will also have a history attribute to hold the game history .
A game will have a run method ( to run the game ) and a payoff method ( to compute player payoffs based on player moves and the payoff matrix ) .
3.14
The design stage is the time to plan for interactions between a game and its players .
We must decide on our interfaces , which are set the basic rules for how games and players can interact .
To make the SimpleGame class useful for later simulations , it will not only ask each player for a move but it will offer each player a chance to record the game ( itself ) .
Although we do not plan on doing any recording in our initial games , we will define our RandomPlayer class to match this behavior : it not only must have a move method but also must have a record method .
( In addition , a SimpleGame will always pass itself when calling a player method , so each of these methods must accept a game as an argument . )
A summary of the proposed data and methods for these two classes follows .
SimpleGame Data : players , payoffmat , history
Methods : run , payoff RandomPlayer Data : p_defect
Methods : move , record 3.15
Each RandomPlayer has a single data attribute : its probability of defection , p_defect , which can differ by player .
We will now use RandomPlayer instances to play our SimpleGame .
Players of a SimpleGame must respond to certain messages ( i.e. , method calls ) .
This implies a general interface requirement for any player of a SimpleGame : the player must respond to move and record method calls .
The RandomPlayer class therefore includes move and record methods .
3.16
The RandomPlayer class has much in common with the RandomMover class : by default it moves just like a RandomMover , and its record method does nothing .
Let us focus on the changes .
First the big change : notice that the RandomPlayer class defines a method named __init__ .
This is a special name , reserved for the method that does the ‘ initialization ’ of a new instance .
Typically , initial values of instance attributes are set during initialization .
The __init__ method of a RandomPlayer has a single responsibility : to set the initial value of the player 's p_defect attribute .
Since each RandomPlayer instance will have its own probability of defection , we say that p_defect is an “ instance attribute ” .
We provide a default value of 0.5 , but an instance can always be created with a different value .
class RandomPlayer : def __init__ ( self , p=0.5 ) : self .
p_defect = p def move ( self , game ) : return random.uniform ( 0,1 ) < self .
p_defect def record ( self , game ) : pass 3.17
The function - definition headers for the move and record methods reflect our design decisions , discussed above .
Whenever a SimpleGame calls the move or record method of a player , it will pass itself .
In later sections , this will prove a useful feature of the SimpleGame class .
This later utility determines the signature of these methods in our RandomPlayer class .
That is , we design this illustrative RandomPlayer class for interactions with a more generally useful game class .
3.18
The move method of a RandomPlayer is largely unchanged .
However since we want our RandomPlayer instances to play a SimpleGame , we must add a new argument , which we name game .
The new argument simply provides a consistent interface , anticipating that a game will always pass itself when it calls a player 's method .
The record method also reflects this interface decision , although the record method literally does nothing .
( Python uses the keyword pass to indicate “ do nothing ” . )
This method exists solely to accommodate our interface design — that is , to allow a RandomPlayer to play a SimpleGame .
3.19
It is time for some slightly heavier lifting .
SimpleGame is the most complex class we introduce in this paper , but it includes many now familiar components .
Specifically , the design of its methods parallels the code we used to run our previous game simulation .
One benefit of the care with which we will approach the design of our SimpleGame class is that we can continue to use it throughout this paper .
3.20
The class definition begins in a familiar way .
After the class - definition header ( class SimpleGame : ) , we define an __init__ method to initialize newly created instances .
We initialize each SimpleGame instance with two player instances and a payoff matrix .
The __init__ function of SimpleGame therefore has four parameters : self , player1 , player2 , and payoffmat .
As discussed earlier , self will be the local name of the instance that is being initialized .
Similarly , the player instances we pass in will have the local names player1 and player2 .
So the statement self .
players = [ player1 , player2 ] creates an instance attribute named players and assigns as its value a list of two players .
The statement self .
history = list ( ) assigns an empty list to the history attribute .
( Later on , we will append to this list in order to record history of game moves . )
Each SimpleGame instance will therefore have these data attributes : players , payoffmat , and history .
class SimpleGame : def __init__( self , player1 , player2 , payoffmat ) : # initialize instance attributes self .
players = [ player1 , player2 ] self .
payoffmat = payoffmat self .history = list ( ) def run( self , game_iter=4 ) : # unpack the two players player1 , player2 = self .
players # each iteration , get new moves and append these to history for iteration in range ( game_iter ) : newmoves = player1.move(self ) , player2.move(self ) self.history.append( newmoves ) # prompt players to record the game played ( i.e. , ' self ' ) player1.record( self ) ; player2.record ( self ) def payoff ( self ) : # unpack the two players player1 , player2 = self .
players # generate a payoff pair for each game iteration payoffs = ( self.payoffmat[ m1 ] [ m2 ] for ( m1,m2 ) in self .
history ) # transpose to get a payoff sequence for each player pay1 , pay2 = transpose ( payoffs ) # return a mapping of each player to its mean payoff return { player1 : mean ( pay1 ) , player2 : mean ( pay2 ) } 3.21
Once we have an initialized SimpleGame instance , we can do two things with it .
First , we can run the game by calling the instance 's run method .
This elicits a number of moves from each player .
( The number is is determined by the game_iter argument , which has a default value of 4 . )
Then we can get the game payoff for each player by calling the payoff method .
The implementation details are very heavily commented and thereby largely self explanatory .
When we run a game , we get a sequence of pairs of moves , one pair of moves for each iteration in the game .
Note that for each iteration in the game , the game appends to its history the pair of moves made by the two players .
3.22
Naturally , the history of moves determines the game 's payoff to each player .
In a SimpleGame each player receives as a payoff the average of its single - move payoffs .
Recalling our earlier discussion of generator expressions , we see that the definition of the payoff method includes a generator expression .
The expression ( self.payoffmat[ m1 ] [ m2 ] for ( m1,m2 ) in self .
history ) will generate the player - payoff pairs for each pair of moves .
We then transpose that grouping so as to group payoffs by player .
The payoff method returns a dictionary that maps each player to its payoff .
3.23
We now use our two new classes for a game simulation .
The code for this is very similar to the code for our first game simulation .
We begin by creating a payoff matrix and two players .
We then create a game instance , initialized with these two players and our payoff matrix , and we run the game .
Note that we call the SimpleGame class with three arguments : the two player instances and the payoff matrix required by its initialization function .
( When a SimpleGame instance is created , its __init__ method is called with these arguments to initialize the instance .
Note again that it is an instance , not the class , which owns this data . )
We call the run method of game to run the game : this causes game to request moves from its players and to record their moves as the game history .
We then call the payoff method of game to compute the game payoffs as the average of the single - move payoffs .
Finally , we retrieve the computed payoffs and print the game payoff for each player .
## GAME : SimpleGame with RandomPlayer # create a payoff matrix and two players PAYOFFMAT = [ [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] , [ ( 5,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) ] ] player1 = RandomPlayer ( ) player2 = RandomPlayer ( ) # create and run the game game = SimpleGame ( player1 , player2 , PAYOFFMAT ) game.run ( ) # retrieve and print the payoffs payoffs = game .
payoff ( ) print " Player1 payoff : " , payoffs [ player1 ] print " Player2 payoff : " , payoffs [ player2 ] 3.24
It is worth pausing to consider what we have accomplished at this point .
This bare - bones SimpleGame class has enough features that it will remain useful throughout this paper .
Indeed , it can be used for for complex game simulations .
Yet with a little work this useful object can be understood , and often even used , by readers without prior programming experience .
This illustrates the readability and simplicity that is a strength of Python .
3.25
Since we called our game 's run method without an argument , the game involves 4 moves per player ( the default value of game_iter ) .
Since our payoff matrix represents a Prisoner 's Dilemma , we have run our first iterated prisoner 's dilemma simulation .
This simple structure remains at the core of the simulations run later in this paper .
3.26
Our RandomPlayer embodies a very simple concept of a strategy : it is nothing more than a constant probability of defection .
It is nevertheless natural to be curious about the performance of various strategies against each other .
Table 1 displays the average player1 payoff for various probabilities of default for player1 ( p1 , as listed in the first column ) and for player2 ( p2 , as listed in the first row ) .
We see that , for any given player2 probability of defection , player1 experiences an increase in its payoff if it increases its probability of defection .
Similarly , for any given player1 probability of defection , player1 experiences a decrease its payoff if player2 increases its probability of defection .
( The situation is of course symmetric for player 2 . )
Perhaps most interesting are the results down the diagonal , where the payoffs for player1 and player2 are equal .
As player1 and player2 increase a common probability of defection , their expected payoffs fall monotonically .
These aspects of the prisoner 's dilemma have drawn substantial research attention and will occupy us at several points in the present paper .

Our next project will be to explore further consequences of strategy choice in an iterated prisoner 's dilemma .
The present section offers a very brief overview and definition of the prisoner 's dilemma , as context for the subsequent discussions .
In a simple prisoner 's dilemma there are two players each of whom chooses one of two actions , traditionally called ‘ cooperate ’ ( C ) and ‘ defect ’ ( D ) .
The payoffs are such that — regardless of how the other player behaves — a player always achieves a higher individual payoff by defecting .
However the payoffs are also such that when both players defect they each get a smaller individual payoff than if both had cooperated .
3.28
Real world applications of the prisoner 's dilemma are legion Poundstone ( 1992 ) .
The most famous application is to arms races : the story is that both sides race since each prefers to be armed regardless of the other 's behavior , but an arms control agreement would make both better off .
There are also many related results .
Schelling ( 1973 ) famously argued that mandated helmets in hockey would be preferred by all players even though each individual player will forego a helmet when permitted .
As a related but less considered illustration from the world of sports , consider a practice of competitive wrestlers : food deprivation and even radical restriction of liquids in an effort to lose weight in the days before a weigh - in .
This is followed by rehydrating and binge eating after the weigh - in but before the match .
Whether or not other wrestlers also follow this regime , individual wrestlers perceive it to provide a competitive advantage .
But it is plausible that all players would be better off if the practice were ended ( perhaps by mandating the skinfold testing advocated by the Wisconsin Minimum Weight Project ) .
3.29
In its game theoretic formulation , stripped of the social ramifications of betrayal , the “ prisoner 's dilemma ” is a misnomer : there is a dominant strategy so there is no dilemma .
An informed and instrumentally rational player may pick without difficulty the individually rational strategy .
An economist might be inclined to call this game “ the prisoners paradox ” , to highlight the failure of individually rational action to produce an efficient outcome .
In the present paper we nevertheless stick with the conventional name .
3.30
The payoff matrix presented earlier in our SimpleGame is often encountered , tracing to key early studies of the prisoner 's dilemma .
We can use these canonical payoffs to highlight the paradoxical nature of the prisoner 's dilemma .
Imagine that the game models a public policy choice faced in three countries filled with different kinds of players .
The population of the Country A comprises random players , as in our game simulations above , that choose either of the two strategies with equal probability .
The average payoff to individuals in Country A is 2.25 .
People in Country B are informed and instrumentally rational individuals : they act individually so as to produce the best individual outcome , without knowledge of the other player 's strategy .
( That is , each player always chooses to defect . )
The average payoff to individuals in Country B is 1 .
People in Country C have somehow been socialized to cooperate : each individual always chooses the cooperative strategy .
The average payoff to individuals in Country C is 3 .
3.31
Researchers have extensively investigated this apparent conflict between rationality and efficiency in a variety of contexts .
In the next section , we will show how a standard generalization of player strategies can help us usefully taxonomize this conflict .
( See Stefansson ( 2000 ) for a more detailed discussion . )
Defining the Prisoner 's Dilemma 3.32
Some authors define the prisoner 's dilemma to include two additional constraints on the payoff matrix : the matrix must be symmetric , and the payoff sum when both cooperate must be at least the payoff sum when one cooperates and the other defects .
Rapoport and Chammah ( 1965 ) introduce the latter restriction , which is sometimes justified as capping the payoff to defection or reducing the attractiveness of a purely random strategy .
Scodel et al. ( 1959 ) , Oskamp ( 1971 ) , and others impose the further restriction that the payoff sum when one cooperates and the other defects must exceed the payoff sum when both defect .
Many authors simply use without discussion the canonical payoff matrix above , which satisfies all these constraints .
As we shall see near the end of this paper , even within these constraints , payoffs can matter .
Contingent Strategies in an Iterated Prisoner 's Dilemma 4.1
When we suspect that game payoffs resemble a prisoner 's dilemma , the appearance of cooperative behavior is provocative : it might indicate deviations from the individual rationality , or it might indicate that the payoffs have been incorrectly understood ( Rapoport and Chammah 1965 ) .
Trivers ( 1971 ) proposed reciprocity as a basis of cooperation .
A decade later , political science and evolutionary biology joined hands to show that reciprocity could serve a basis for cooperation even in the face of a prisoner 's dilemma ( Axelrod and Hamilton 1981 ) .
This led to an intense exploration of the iterated prisoner 's dilemma , wherein players play a prisoner 's dilemma repeatedly .
Unlike the static version , an iterated prisoner 's dilemma ( IPD ) actually can involve a dilemma : choosing defection over cooperation will raise the one period payoff but may lower the ultimate payoff .
4.2
We now consider players that use “ reactive ” strategies ( Nowak and Sigmund 1992 ) .
A reactive strategy determines current behavior as a response to past events .
In this section , we adopt particularly simple and widely explored reactive strategies .
Our reactive players respond to whether the other player previously cooperated ( C ) or defected ( D ) , except of course when players are making their initial move .
Players using such strategies have a cd-i playertype .
A strategy for a cd - i playertype will be parameterized by a 3 - tuple of probabilities : the probability of defecting when the other cooperated on the previous move , the probability of defecting when the other defected , and the probability of defecting on the initial move .
The game played will again be iterations of our prisoner 's dilemma .
4.3
Discussion of reactive strategies leads to a simple description of the essential nature of the strategies .
This suggests that a strategy is a natural object in our model — one whose general description should be embodied in a separate class .
We will slightly generalize this suggestion by introducing the notion of a player type .
In essence , we decompose our previous understanding of a player into two objects : the player , and its playertype .
Our future game simulations will therefore involve three types of objects : a game , the players , and the playertypes ( e.g , strategies ) .
4.4
Once again our core project will be to create a game with two players .
( In addition , we will seize pedagogical opportunities to illustrate delegation and inheritance . )
We will call the new type of game a CDIGame .
As before , a game will have as data a payoff matrix and players , and it will have a run method ( to run the game ) and a payoff method ( to compute player payoffs based on player moves and the payoff matrix ) .
But a CDIGame will additionally have a new method : get_last_move .
A CDIGame is essentially a SimpleGame plus a new method : get_last_move .
4.5
A CDIGame will be played by a new type of player : SimplePlayer .
A player will now have a playertype as data .
Additional data will be games_played and players_played , which provide the player with storage for “ memories ” .
A player can move , record its history , and reset itself .
4.6
Finally , our truly new type of object is the CDIPlayerType .
A player type will have as data p_cdi , which is the player type 's strategy ( i.e. , a 3 - tuple of probabilities ) .
It will also have a move method .
CDIGame Inherit data and methods from SimpleGame
New data : opponents
New methods : get_last_move SimplePlayer Data : playertype , games_played , players_played
, , Methods : move , record , reset CDIPlayerType Data : p_cdi
Methods : move 4.7
The new SimplePlayer class will feel very familiar , so we begin our implementation exposition by examining its details .
At initialization , a SimplePlayer instance acquires a player type .
( The line self .
playertype = playertype assigns the value of the local variable named playertype to the instance attribute of the same name , which is accessed as self .
playertype .)
Note that part of initialization is done by calling the reset method , which assigns empty lists to the player 's games_played and players_played attributes .
These attributes can provide a player with “ memory ” , which can be augmented each time the player 's record method is called .
class SimplePlayer : def __init__( self , playertype ) : self.playertype = playertype self.reset ( ) def reset ( self ) : self.games_played = list ( ) #empty list self.
players_played = list ( ) #empty list def move ( self , game ) : # delegate move to playertype return self.playertype.move( self , game ) def record ( self , game ) : self.games_played.append( game ) opponent = game .
opponents [self ] self.players_played.append(opponent ) 4.8
A SimplePlayer naturally has the move and record methods required for game players .
In contrast with a RandomPlayer , the record method of a SimplePlayer actually does something : it appends the game to the games_played list and the opponent to the players_played list .
The move method is more interesting .
A SimplePlayer uses delegation to select a move .
Looking at the move function , we see that a player delegates its moves to its playertype .
This is our first use of delegation , a common OOP strategy .
Here it is natural to delegate moving to the player type , since a player type is essentially the strategy that determines the moves .
( Note that when a player calls the move method of its playertype instance , it passes itself and its game to the playertype .
This means that , when determining a move , the playertype has access to player specific and game specific information . )
4.9
Next we examine the CDIPlayerType class .
This is our general description of a player 's type , which in turn is essentially a reactive strategy .
Recall that we assigned the strategy of a RandomPlayer to its p_defect attribute .
Similarly we assign the strategy of a CDIPlayerType to its p_cdi attribute .
The default value of p_cdi is ( 0.5,0.5,0.5 ) , which means the default CDIPlayerType determines moves in the same way as the default RandomPlayer .
This can be seen by working through the move function for this class .
class CDIPlayerType : def __init__( self , p_cdi=( 0.5,0.5,0.5 ) ) : self.
p_cdi = p_cdi def move ( self , player , game ) : # get opponent and learn her last move opponent = game.opponents [ player ] last_move = game.get_last_move( opponent ) # respond to opponent 's last move if last_move is None : p_defect = self.p_cdi[ - 1 ] else : p_defect = self.p_cdi[last_move ] return random.uniform ( 0,1 ) < p_defect 4.10
For the initial move , the probability of defection is given by the last element of the tuple p_cdi ( which we index with - 1 ) .
After the initial moves , the probability of defection is conditional on the previous move of the other player .
( The playertype fetches this move from the history of the player 's game ; see the CDIGame code for the implementation details . )
If the opponent previously cooperated , the opponent 's previous move is False ( or equivalently , 0 ) , and the first element ( index 0 ) of p_cdi is the probability of defection .
If the opponent previously defected , the opponent 's last move is True ( or equivalently , 1 ) , and the second element ( index 1 ) of p_cdi is the probability of defection .
4.11
Finally , let us consider the CDIGame class , which constructs our game instances .
Notice the CDIGame definition evinces only part of the data and behavior of this class .
The class - definition header ( class CDIGame ( SimpleGame ) : ) states that our new class will “ inherit ” data and behavior from the SimpleGame class .
class CDIGame( SimpleGame ) : def __init__( self , player1 , player2 , payoffmat ) : # begin initialization with `__init__` from ` SimpleGame` SimpleGame.__init__(self , player1 , player2 , payoffmat ) # initialize the new data attribute self .
opponents = { player1 : player2 , player2 : player1} def get_last_move ( self , player ) : # if history not empty , return prior move of `player` if self .
history : player_idx = self.players.index( player ) last_move = self.history [ - 1 ] [ player_idx ] else : last_move =
None return last_move 4.12
This is our first use of inheritance .
Since we inherit the run and payoff method definitions from SimpleGame , we do not need to repeat them in our CDIGame definition .
The use of inheritance is a typical OOP idiom for code reuse .
Of course we also want to add new data and behavior .
Specifically we want to add an opponents data attribute and a get_last_move method .
Adding the new method is simple enough : we just include its definition in the body of the class definition , as usual .
However data attributes are set during initialization , and we want to keep the initializations done by SimpleGame .
Here we adopt the following solution : give CDIGame its own __init__ function , which calls the __init__ method provided by SimpleGame to initialize the old data attributes .
The new __init__ method also initializes the new opponents data attribute .
4.13
When a player delegates a move to its playertype , the playertype fetches from the game the opponent 's last move ( i.e. , the move with index - 1 ) .
( Recall that the probability of defection generally is conditional on the other player 's last move . )
The playertype accomplishes this by invoking the game 's get_last_move method .
The only new behavior provided by a CDIGame is this get_last_move method , which returns the requested element of the game 's move history ( if it exists , and otherwise returns None ) .
4.14
Table 2 illustrates the resulting interdependencies between objects when a game asks a player for a move .
The player delegates moving to its playertype .
As part of selecting a move , the playertype first fetches the opponent 's last move from the game .
Once the playertype has this last move , it computes a move .
It returns this move to the player that asked for it , who finally returns it to the game that asked for it .
Game Player Playertype 1. request move from Player 2 . request move from Playertype 3 . request opponent 's last move from Game 4 . compute opponent 's last move 5 . return last move to Playertype 6 . compute new move 7 . return new move to Player 8 . return new move to Game 4.15
At first exposure , these linkages may feel a bit circuitous .
However , if we accept that the player delegates the move to the playertype , and that the game is the natural place to store the move history , these linkages appear natural .
For example , the game cannot simply request a move from the playertype , since multiple players may share a single playertype .
( There is no mapping from playertypes to players . )
4.16
With our new class definitions in hand , we are ready to create playertypes , players , and a game .
The code looks almost identical to our previous game simulation .
The only difference is that we now need to create CDIPlayerType instances with which to initialize our SimplePlayer instances .
## GAME : CDIGame with SimplePlayer # create a payoff matrix and two players ( with playertypes ) PAYOFFMAT = [ [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] , [ ( 5,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) ] ] ptype1 = CDIPlayerType( ) ptype2 = CDIPlayerType( ) player1 = SimplePlayer ( ptype1 ) player2 = SimplePlayer ( ptype2 ) # create and run the game game = CDIGame ( player1 , player2 , PAYOFFMAT ) game.run ( ) # retrieve and print the payoffs payoffs = game .
payoff ( ) print " Player1 payoff : " , payoffs [ player1 ] print " Player2 payoff : " , payoffs [ player2 ] 4.17
It is natural to wonder again how various strategies perform against each other .
Of course we can construct an endless variety of cd-i playertypes .
In the present paper , we will focus on pure strategies : each element of the strategy 3 - tuple is either zero or one .
This gives us 8 possible player types and therefore 36 different games .
( There are 36 unique pairings , since player order is irrelevant . )
We can pit these against each other in a tournament .
( This is a “ round robin ” tournament , in the sense that it produces the outcomes for all these possible pairings . )
If we play a CDIGame for each pair of strategies , we get the results in Table 3 , which summarizes the payoffs to the first ( row ) player in each of these 36 games .
( E.g. , the table tells us that if the first player plays CCC and the second plays DCC then the two player payoffs are ( 0.75,4.50 ) . )
CCC DCC CDC DDC CCD DCD CDD DDD CCC 3.00 0.75 3.00 0.75 2.25 0.00 2.25 0.00 DCC 4.50 2.00 2.25 1.00 3.25 0.00 2.25 0.00 CDC 3.00 2.25 3.00 1.25 2.75 2.25 2.50 0.75 DDC 4.50 3.50 2.50 1.50 3.75 2.75 1.75 0.75 CCD 3.50 2.00 2.75 1.25 2.50 1.00 1.75 0.25 DCD 5.00 5.00 2.25 1.50 3.50 2.00 2.25 0.25 CDD 3.50 2.25 2.50 1.75 3.00 2.25 1.00 1.00 DDD 5.00 5.00 2.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 1.00 1.00 4.18
Perhaps the most striking thing about Table 3 is that playing DD - D is best ( i.e. , produces a maximal payoff ) against all but two strategies : CD-C and CD -D .
Put in simple terms , DD - D would be dominant among the pure strategies if the imitative / reciprocal strategies where removed from the strategy space .
( These strategies are imitative in that they always adopt the opponent 's previous move .
They are reciprocal in that they always respond in kind . )
The first of these , CD-C , is the famous Tit - For - Tat strategy .
This strategy has also been called “ reciprocal altruism ” ( Trivers 1971 ) .
The potential robustness of this strategy in an IPD context has been long recognized ( Axelrod and Hamilton 1981 ) .
Neither of these two strategies dominates the other .
It is noteworthy that CD - D holds its own against DD - D , whereas CD - C does not .
Also noteworthy is that two CD - C players will do much better than two CD - D players .
Additionally , as Axelrod ( 1984 ) emphasized , a CD - C player never has a higher outcome than its partner .
We will explore some corollaries of these observations .
Evolutionary Soup 5.1
In this section , we characterize how an initially diverse group of players evolves over time .
So far , we have developed a useful collection of objects and used them to simulate the outcomes of an iterated prisoner 's dilemma with reactive strategies .
The code required to do this is remarkably readable and strikingly short : our four core class definitions comprise about 50 short lines of code .
We now show how this core toolkit can be easily extended to accommodate simple evolutionary considerations .
5.2
We will adopt a simple but widely used evolutionary mechanism : players imitate “ winning ” strategies .
Our first implementation of these evolutionary considerations will be in the context of random encounters within a population of players .
In order to simulate a simple evolutionary iterated prisoner 's dilemma , we introduce the concepts of a round and a tournament .
A tournament consists of several rounds .
On each round , players are randomly sorted into pairs , and each pair plays a CDIGame ( i.e. , an iterated prisoner 's dilemma with reactive strategies ) .
As before , a player 's moves are determined by its playertype .
After each round , each player adopts a winning strategy from the game just played .
This means that a player might change playertype once per round during a tournament .
5.3
We introduce two new classes to implement this evolutionary tournament : SoupPlayer and SoupRound .
Our earlier design work means that we can retain our game and playertype classes : CDIGame and CDIPlayerType continue to be useful in this new application .
SoupPlayer Inherit data and methods from SimplePlayer
New data : next_player_type
New methods : get_payoff , choose_next_type , evolve SoupRound Data : players , payoffmat
Methods : run 5.4
The SoupPlayer class inherits much of its behavior from SimplePlayer , but it has new attributes deriving from our desire that each player be able to evolve its playertype .
When we call the choose_next_type method of a SoupPlayer instance , this sets the next_player_type data attribute .
The next_player_type is always set to the best playertype ( its own , or its opponent 's ) .
Here “ best ” means the highest total payoff achieved in a round of games , and ties are resolved randomly .
( The best playertypes are found by the topscore_playertypes function , defined in Appendix A. )
The get_payoff method computes this total payoff as the sum of the single game payoffs in the current round of games played by the player .
( This is just a single game in a SoupRound , but allowing for multiple games per round adds flexibility that we use later . )
A player will adapt its playertype when we call its evolve method .
class SoupPlayer ( SimplePlayer ) : def evolve ( self ) : self.playertype = self.next_playertype def get_payoff ( self ) : return sum ( game .
payoff ( ) [ self ] for game in self .
games_played ) def choose_next_type( self ) : # find the playertype(s ) producing the highest score (s ) best_playertypes = topscore_playertypes ( self ) # choose randomly from these best playertypes self.next_playertype = random.choice(best_playertypes ) 5.5
A SoupRound instance is initialized with a list of players and the payoff matrix for the games to be played .
When we call the run method of a SoupRound instance , it randomly shuffles all the players , pairs them up , and plays a CDIGame for each of these pairs .
class SoupRound : def __init__ ( self , players , payoffmat ) : self .
players = players self .
payoffmat = payoffmat def run( self ) : payoff_matrix = self.payoffmat for player1 , player2 in random_pairs_of( self.players ) : game = CDIGame ( player1 , player2 , payoff_matrix ) game.run ( ) 5.6
Suppose we run a tournament of multiple rounds .
At the end of each round , we ask each player to pick its next_player_type and to adapt its playertype according to its evolve method .
If we keep track of the playertype counts of each round , we can observe how playertype prevalence evolves over time .
Table 4 shows how the player type counts evolve over a typical ten round tournament , starting with 50 of each of the eight pure - strategy player types .
CCC CCD CDC CDD DCC DCD DDC DDD 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 10 17 45 65 53 55 70 85 2 2 33 77 23 47 82 134 0 0 18 72 7 30 77 196 0 0 9 68 2 15 54 252 0 0 0 60 0 6 22 312 0 0 0 60 0 2 7 331 0 0 0 58 0 0 2 340 0 0 0 58 0 0 0 342 0 0 0 57 0 0 0 343 0 0 0 58 0 0 0 342 5.7
Our previous examination of Table 3 has largely prepared us for the stark results in Table 4 .
These results are typical for this type of evolutionary prisoner 's dilemma ( Stefansson 2000 ) .
Defection quickly takes over the population as the strategy of choice .
The average payoff received by players declines correspondingly .
In less than 10 rounds , all players are playing “ defect ” every move of every game .
The average payoff per player has fallen from an initial value of about 2.25 to its final value of 1 .
Evolutionary Network 6.1
In this section we offer concluding examples of the ease with which we can extend our core game - simulation toolkit to new considerations .
We develop a simple version of the spatial evolutionary iterated prisoner 's dilemma , which is a common alternative topology to the evolutionary “ soup ” explored above .
We use the resulting simulation model to reproduce a classic result in the literature : evolutionary outcomes are affected by the network of relationships between players .
In contrast with the “ evolutionary soup ” model , where players randomly encounter other players , we will now consider players who repeatedly face a fixed set of other players .
Each player will retain a fixed set of other players as “ neighbors ” throughout a tournament , although the playertypes of these neighbors will evolve over time .
6.2
We adopt a standard spatial representation of the network of relationships between players : we associate each player with a location on a two - dimensional grid , and we let a neighborhood of relative locations determine the player 's opponents .
We introduce three new classes : GridPlayer , GridRound , and SimpleTorus .
A GridPlayer is essentially a SoupPlayer with two new methods , set_grid and get_neighbors , and two new data attributes , grid and gridlocation .
The values of the new data attributes will be set by the new set_grid method .
A GridRound is a SoupRound with a slightly more complex run method .
Our SimpleTorus will take a bit of discussion , although it is essentially a list of lists of players that is able to do some accounting .
GridPlayer Inherit data and methods from SoupPlayer
New data : grid , gridlocation
, New methods : set_grid , get_neighbors GridRound Inherit data and methods from SoupRound
Override methods : run SimpleTorus Data : nrows , ncols , neighborhood , players2d , neighbors
, , , , Methods : populate , get_neighbors 6.3
The implementation of an evolutionary prisoner 's dilemma on a grid profits substantially from our earlier work at representing players , games , and rounds .
Consider the simplicity of our GridPlayer class .
A GridPlayer inherits almost all its behavior from SoupPlayer .
A GridPlayer is essentially a SoupPlayer that can set a grid and determine its neighbors on that grid .
( It will delegate that determination to its grid . ) class GridPlayer ( SoupPlayer ) : def set_grid ( self , grid , row , column ) : self.grid = grid self.gridlocation = row , column def get_neighbors ( self ) : # delegate to the grid return self.grid.get_neighbors ( self ) 6.4
Similarly , our GridRound class inherits from SoupRound but provides its own run method .
Since we give the GridRound class its own run method , it will use this new method instead of inheriting run from the SoupRound class .
We say that GridRound “ overrides ” the run method of the SoupRound class .
Our new run method is a very modest change : a player now plays a CDIGame once with each neighbor .
class GridRound ( SoupRound ) : def run( self ) : payoff_matrix = self .
payoffmat # each player plays each of its neighbors once for player in self .
players : for neighbor in player.get_neighbors ( ) : if neighbor not in player .
players_played : # create and run a new game game = CDIGame ( player , neighbor , payoff_matrix ) game.run ( ) 6.5
Players will be located on a two - dimensional grid .
Our grid is a torus ( in that it wraps around its edges ) .
We therefore call our new class SimpleTorus .
We initialize a SimpleTorus instance with its number of rows , its number of columns , and its “ neighborhood ” .
A neighborhood is just a list of tuples of x , y - offsets ( relative to any grid location ) .
6.6
If the SimpleTorus class looks slightly complicated , that is only because it must handle a little accounting .
An instance must be able to populate itself with players , using its populate method , and find the neighbors of any player , using its get_neighbors method .
( The compute_neighbors function is listed in Appendix A. )
As a SimpleTorus populates itself with players , it calls each player 's set_grid method .
This sets two player attributes for each player : grid is set to the torus , and gridlocation is set to the row and column location of the player ( on the grid ) .
class SimpleTorus : def __init__( self , nrows , ncols , neighborhood ) : self.nrows , self.ncols = nrows , ncols self .
neighborhood = neighborhood # empty dict ( will eventually map players to neighbors ) self.players2neighbors = dict ( ) # create 2d grid ( each element is None until populated ) self .
players2d = [ [ None ] *ncols for i in range ( nrows ) ] def populate ( self , players1d ) : # fill grid with players players = iter ( players1d ) # put a player in each grid location ( row , column ) for row in range ( self.nrows ) : for column in range ( self.ncols ) : player = players.next ( ) self.players2d[row ] [ column ] = player player.set_grid( self , row , column ) def get_neighbors ( self , player ) : if player in self .
players2neighbors : # neighbors precomputed neighbors = self.players2neighbors [ player ] else : # neighbors not yet computed neighbors = compute_neighbors ( player , self ) # map player to computed neighbors ( for later use ) self.players2neighbors [ player ] = neighbors return neighbors 6.7
For any player , we can ask a SimpleTorus for the player 's neighbors , using the get_neighbors method .
This method first checks to see if these neighbors have already been computed , and if not , it computes them based on the x , y - offsets of its neighborhood .
( This ensures that the neighbors of any given player need only be computed once , even if they are requested many times . )
6.8
Our evolutionary tournament will be a sequence of rounds , where as usual players choose a next playertype at the end of each round .
We adopt a very common definition of a neighborhood , where neighbors are above , below , and to each side .
The associated list of offsets is therefore [ ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,0 ) , ( 0, - 1 ) , ( - 1,0 ) ] .
The result of running such a tournament has often been viewed as surprising and interesting .
Axelrod ( 1984 ) notes that the “ Tit - for - Tat ” strategy ( CD - C ) can often succeed in related settings , and Cohen et al. ( 1999 ) note more generally that repeated interaction with a fixed set of neighbors tends to promote cooperation .
Here we find that CD - C often squeezes out all other strategies .
Figure 1 summarizes a typical tournament .
( Players of all eight pure strategy player types are generated randomly and assigned to a 20 by 20 grid , but only two of the eight player types are plotted . )
6.9
We can understand the success of the CD - C strategy that we see in Figure 1 in terms of our previous results in Table 3 .
Consider two adjacent CD - C players on a grid that is otherwise entirely populated by DD - D players .
Using the notation of Rapoport and Chammah ( 1965 ) , let the payoff matrix be represented symbolically as [ [ ( R , R ) , ( S , T ) ] , [( T , S ) , ( P , P ) ] .
When playing a four - move game against a DD - D player , a CD - C player receives a payoff of S+3P .
When playing a against a CD - C player , a CD - C player receives a payoff of 4 R .
Given our standard ( von Neumann , radius 1 ) neighborhood , a CD - C player on this grid will have three DD - D neighbors and one CD - C neighbor .
Its total payoff from a round is therefore 4R+9P+3S .
DD -D
16P DD-D
T+15P DD-D
T+15P DD-D
16P DD-D
T+15P CD-C
4R+9P+3S CD-C
4R+9P+3S DD-D
T+15P DD-D
16P DD-D
T+15P DD-D
T+15P DD-D
16P 6.10
Next , consider a DD - D player playing four - move games on the grid described above .
A DD- D player who plays a game against a CD - C player receives a payoff of T+3P .
A DD- D player who plays a game against a DD - D player receives a payoff of 4P .
So a DD - D player who has a CD - C neighbor gets a one - round payoff of T+15P , while a DD - D player who has only DD - D neighbors gets a one - round payoff of 16P .
6.11
Now consider the implications of these payoffs in an evolutionary prisoner 's dilemma .
In the literature it is fairly common to let each game run for four iterations .
For concreteness , we focus on this four - move game .
In this case , the two adjacent CD - C players get a higher payoff than their DD - D neighbors as long as 4R+3S > T+6P .
Recall the canonical prisoner 's dilemma payoffs : [ [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] , [ ( 5,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) ] .
This means that the highest average payoff will go to our two adjacent CD - C players .
( The two CD - C players in this case each receive a payoff of 21 , while a DD - D neighbor will receive 20 . )
The neighboring DD - D players will therefore switch strategies .
This increases the number of adjacent CD - C players .
Therefore , the “ Tit - for - Tat ” strategy quickly takes over the grid .
Fragility 6.12
Contrary to a common impression , our results do not mean that CD - C is the best strategy on our evolutionary grid .
Three obvious changes will affect whether DD - D or CD - D wins the evolutionary race .
One possibility is to change the number of moves in each game .
( For example if we recalculate Table 5 for a 3 - move game , the two CD - C players each receive a payoff of 3R + 6P+3S=15 , while a DD - D neighbor will receive T+11P=16 . )
Greater interest attends deviations from the canonical payoff matrix we have been using .
Finally , we might alter our understanding of the evolutionary significance of the payoff .
6.13
Here we briefly explore the second and third possibilities .
To keep the discussion focused , we will change a single parameter : P. Consider for example raising the value of P , retaining the canonical payoffs T=5 , S=0 , and R=3 .
Recall our isolated CD - C pair will beat their DD - D neighbors as long as 4R+9P+3S > T+15P : that is , as long as 7/6> P .
If we raise P above this threshold , then the DD - D neighbors will win and the CD - C pair will switch strategies .
Intuitively , if we increase the payoff for mutual defection , we expect defection to be more likely to persist as a strategy ( Rapoport and Chammah 1965 ) .
6.14
Once we have P >7/6 , this eliminates the ability of isolated pairs to spread , but it is still plausible that CD - C players will dominate in a given tournament .
Larger groups of CD - C players may be part of an initial distribution of players , or may emerge as other player types vanish , and these will achieve higher payoffs .
To make this concrete , consider four CD - C players arranged in a square , who are completely surrounded by DD - D players .
DD -D

16P DD-D

16P 6.15
Each of the four CD - C players has two CD -C neighbors and two DD - D neighbors .
Each therefore receives a payoff of 8R+6P+2S ( one round , four moves per game ) .
The neighboring DD - Ds each get a payoff of T+15P .
The CD - Cs have the better payoff if 8R+6P+ 2S > T+15 P .
Again retaining T=5 , R=3 , and S=0 , this means that as long as 19/9 > P the CD - C players will have the higher payoff .
All the DD - D neighbors will thereafter adopt CD - C strategies , and this expansion will continue outward from the initial square .
6.16
In more general terms , as we raise the payoff to mutual defection , it becomes harder and harder for the CD - C strategy to win out over the DD - D strategy on our evolutionary grid .
The canonical payoff matrix makes it almost inevitable the CD - C player type will come to dominate the grid .
As we raise the value of P high enough , it becomes almost inevitable for the DD - D player type to come to dominate the grid .
This can happen relatively soon .
Figure 2 illustrates the outcome when the simulation underlying Figure 1 is rerun with no other changes than a new payoff matrix : [ [ ( 3,3 ) , ( 0,5 ) ] , [ ( 5,0 ) , ( P , P ) ] ] , where P varies from its canonical value of 1 to the higher value 2 . 6.17
Figure 2 suggests one underappreciated way in which outcomes on an evolutionary grid can be fragile : cardinal payoffs matter .
Before leaving the evolutionary grid , we briefly explore one other underappreciated way in which such simulation results can prove fragile .
So far players have evolved by imitating a top - scoring player type .
However when a player faces multiple opponents who share a playertype , other assessments of the best playertype are plausible .
We consider a player who chooses the encountered playertype that had the highest minimum outcome : the MaxminGridPlayer .
Since a top scoring playertype might also perform poorly against different neighbors , top scoring playertypes will not always appear to be “ best ” by this maxmin criterion .
class MaxminGridPlayer ( GridPlayer ) : def choose_next_type(self ) : # find playertype(s ) with the highest minimum score best_playertypes = maxmin_playertypes ( self ) # choose randomly from these best playertypes self.next_playertype = random.choice(best_playertypes ) 6.18
Bragt et al. ( 2001 ) show that “ selection schemes ” affect outcomes in an evolutionary IPD .
Here we extend this into the consideration of fitness evaluation .
This is appropriate in our IPD since strategy evolution is rooted in imitation .
We explore this possibility by introducing the MaxminGridPlayer .
This is just a GridPlayer with a new choose_next_type method , which treats as best those encountered playertypes with the highest minimum outcome .
( Implementation details for the maxmin_playertypes function are in Appendix A. )
Again , the simplicity with which we can make this change shows how easy it is to adapt our core game - simulation toolkit to new considerations .
Figure 3 considers the same player grid as Figure 2 , with one difference : the best strategy encountered is taken to be the one with highest minimum score .
Note that the outcomes are changed in interesting ways : the CD - C players are squeezed out just a surely but more slowly as we increase P , and both CD - D and DD - D playertypes are eventually able to persist .
Conclusion 7.1
Researchers often promote agent - based simulation ( ABS ) methods as a “ third way ” of doing social science , distinct from both pure theory and from statistical exploration ( Axelrod 1997 ) .
One hope of ABS researchers is that unexpected but useful ( for prediction or understanding ) aggregate outcomes will emerge from the interactions of autonomous actors .
The evolutionary iterated prisoner 's dilemma is a good illustration of the fruition of this hope : more than two decades of computational exploration have delivered many interesting and surprising results .
Classic among these is the high fitness of the “ Tit - for - Tat ” player type in certain evolutionary grid environments , which many researchers have found suggestive of the evolution of cooperation among real - world agents .
7.2
Students , teachers , and researchers naturally search for entry points to agent - based simulation .
This paper provides such an entry point .
We use the iterated prisoner 's dilemma as a springboard into agent - based simulation with the Python programming language .
This demonstrates that useful ABS models can be constructed with surprising ease in a general purpose programming language .
Python 's flexibility and object - orientation make it a powerful language for simulation , and its syntax promotes the creation of code that is highly readable ( and therefore easily shared and maintained ) .
This readability does not imply verbosity : we list in a few dozen lines the actual source code underpinning the reported simulations .
This code is compact yet readable , and it often bears a close resemblance to simple formal pseudocode .
7.3
A core objective of the paper is to enable students , teachers , and researchers to begin social - science simulation projects immediately in a general purpose programming language .
The paper therefore includes a narrowly focused introduction both to agent - based simulation and to the Python programming language .
We then introduce agent - based simulation in Python , producing in the process an accessible basic tookit for the simulation of two - person evolutionary games .
The reported simulations use this toolkit .
7.4
Our initial simulations introduce the iterated prisoner 's dilemma and motivate the use of agent - based models .
We demonstrate that it is possible to quickly lay bare the underpinnings of some classic results , including the importance of topology for outcomes in evolutionary games .
We then demonstrate that one can readily extend the basic toolkit into new territory .
By altering a single entry of the payoff matrix we demonstrate that payoff cardinality is crucial to prisoner 's dilemma outcomes on an evolutionary grid .
( This provides a cautionary tale for those relying on the canonical payoffs for their simulations . )
By altering a single player method attribute , so that the evolution of new player types is based on maximin rather than maximum outcomes , we discover an interaction between payoff cardinality and this player attribute .
Taken as a group , the simulations in this paper provide a highly accessible but nevertheless substantive and enabling introduction to the agent - based simulation of evolutionary games in a general purpose programming language .

Dogs are known as man ’s best friend , though we ca n’t always say that ’s true .
If you have ever owned a dog , you probably encountered those days where you have a slight bit of regret for getting the dog .
From chewed up shoes to messy carpet to washing a smelly dog that only seems to smell worse after , dogs can be a pain .
Some say that the intelligence of a dog all depends on how well its owner trained it .
Others believe it ’s all about the genes … well , breed .
Thanks to Waggedy Dog Supplements for this list .
While it may be a combination of both , here ’s a look at the top 10 smartest dog breeds , in case you ’re in need of a Dogs for Dummies Handbook :
# 10 Australian Cattle Dog
No you do n’t have to live in Australia to encounter this dog .
These dogs generally grow to be 30 - 50 lbs .
Australian Cattle Dog ’s are known for their intelligence , especially when it comes to being able to train them to herd in cattle ( this is where the name comes from if you did n’t catch it . )
They have also been trained to be “ biting ” dogs .
Do n’t be scared , unless you ’re training this dog to bite you .
Australian Cattle Dogs are trained to bite cattle ( not too hard ) to keep them moving .
These dogs have been herding cattle since the 19th century and today they still do just that .
Australian Cattle Dogs are very active and love having a task at hand .
# 9 Rottweiler
Better known as the “ Rottie , ” Rottweilers can be mis-trained to be vicious , mean dogs that can take down a human .
Speaking of humans , Rottweilers can weigh as much as a petite sized female ; about 110 lbs in fact .
This breed of dog originates out of Germany but was used in the Roman Empire .
Rottweilers are sometimes used as police dogs because of the strong jaw and teeth that they have .
Rotties can take you down !
In the olden days , they were used to carry wood and other large heavy goods to markets and houses .
If you ’re looking to train a dog to protect you and all of your ( precious ) belongings , the Rottie is definitely the way to go .
# 8 Papillon
This breed of dog is probably one of the cutest and smartest you ’ll find .
Papillons are able to show that cute things can be smart too .
This breed also proves that small things ( brains ) do come in small packages .
Papillons can weigh up to 11lbs and can weigh as little as 3lbs .
These dogs are very charming and have always been a symbol of elegance .
During the Renaissance , these dogs were adored by royal courts and the aristocrats of the time .
They always proved to be good watch dogs because of their keen sense of hearing .
Make the slightest sound and the Papillon ’s ears will be up faster than you can say the name .
King Henry II is said to have spend crowns upon crowns on his own Papillons .
# 7 Labrador Retriever
This is one of the most intelligent as well as one of the most popular breeds of dog in the world .
The Labrador Retriever is an amazing breed of dog that offer many different services .
The breed originates from Newfoundland and was trained to hunt waterfowl .
As time has passed , Labs have been introduced to more and more jobs .
Many of these dogs are used in the police force as bomb sniffing or drug sniffing dogs .
Any dog that can be trained to do this is most definitely smart .
These dogs are also used as rescue dogs .
Many are trained to help the disabled , especially the blind .
Labs can be trained to lead a human around while ignoring any type of distraction .
The Labrador Retriever is a loving , obedient , and patient dog that can be trained to do almost anything .
# 6 Shetland Sheepdog
Though not one of the most popular dogs around , the Shetland Sheepdog is a very smart dog .
Some owners of this breed of dog claim that they are just as smart as a human is .
Shelties originated out of Scotland .
Sporting a furry two - layered coat and definitely not the toughest looking dog around , Shelties are used to herd sheep .
Since the breed can be both big and small in size , some of these dogs are used to keep pests and smaller animals out of gardens .
Shetland Sheepdog ’s are generally very hyper , but they have a great sense of hearing .
If anyone ever shows up at your door or a car pulls into the driveway , you can expect to hear a bark from this dog .
# 5 Doberman Pinscher
This breed of dog comes in right at the middle of the list .
The Doberman Pinscher is another German breed to make the list .
In the past , these dogs were trained to be police dogs , watch dogs , and guard dogs .
In the 1800s , men were looking for a dog that was loving and loyal as well as tough and ferocious when necessary .
This is exactly where the Doberman Pinscher fits in .
Even though they can be trained to be ferocious , many of these dogs are very gentle and docile .
Some have even been used in hospitals to help patients that are undergoing therapy .
Slightly vicious by nature , you can expect that this breed will protect you .
# 4 Golden Retriever
Often confused with the Labrador Retriever , Golden Retrievers are also very popular dogs that seem to be perfect for a family .
In the past up to today , these dogs are man ’s companion , especially for those who hunt .
This breed can be easily trained to find and bring back waterfowl or game that has been shot .
The dog ’s soft mouth allows it to bring back unharmed game to its owner .
Aside from being a hunting dog , Golden Retrievers can be used as rescue dogs , drug sniffing dogs , and guide dogs .
This breed is very patient , which makes it that much easier to train .
If you ever find a dog sports competition online or on the television , you are sure to see a Golden Retriever competing .

# 3 German Shepherd
Rin Tin Tin !
This is the one breed of dog that you can say actually looks tough and mean .
Looks are most definitely deceiving because the German Shepherd is one of the most lovable breed of dog you will ever come across .
Loving or not , these dogs can be trained to do things that humans can’t .
Today , these dogs are usually trained to be police dogs , rescue dogs , and some are even able to work with the military .
These dogs are so bright that the Army and Marines have allowed them to be used in overseas activity .
German Shepherds are very obedient dogs as well as protective .
In the past , German Shepherds were used as herd dogs but today they are used in more “ higher up positions , ” so to speak .
The German Shepherd is one of the smartest dogs around .
# 2. Poodle
Surprised ?
You probably are n’t the only one .
No your eyes are n’t going bad .
The Poodle is number two on the list .
Do n’t let the fluffy , curly , white coat fool you .
This breed of dog is absolutely brilliant .
Though you have probably never seen it , Poodles are used as hunting dogs as well as watch and rescue dogs .
The Poodle ( sounds like puddle does n’t it ? ) is also used as a water dog .
Poodles come in all sizes , but even the Toy Poodle can be used to hunt birds .
Poodles love to be around people and are very protective .
Though this breed only weighs up to 8 lbs. , a mighty heart can come out of such a pretty looking dog .
# 1 Border Collie
Topping off the list is the Border Collie .
This dog lives to work , literally .
Though it may seem only us humans have a lifetime full of hard work , this breed of dog needs something to do to be happy .
The Border Collie is used as a herding dog and has since grown to be used as a sporting dog as well .
The breed is known for its agility , speed , and obedience .
It is also known for it ’s ability to learn new tricks quickly .
These dogs love being able to work next to your side .
Collies are especially great at dog sport competitions .
You will generally see them competing in Flyball and disc games .

The General Atomics Predator - B drone aircraft - better known under its US Air Force name , the " Reaper " - has just dropped its first satnav - guided weapons .
In a doubtless unrelated development , the roboplane also seems set to deploy along the US - Canadian border .
Mowing down humans like corn regardless of weather .
The US Air Force announced this week that Reapers from the 658th Aeronautical Systems Squadron had lately made the first drop of satellite - guided weapons by the roboplane , at the China Lake test range in California .
The munitions in question were 500 - pound smartbombs , able to fly themselves down to a target on GPS .
Reapers normally shine a laser dot on the desired impact point to guide their weapons , but such systems occasionally struggle to cope with cloud , fog , snow etc ; that 's where the satnav comes in .
Often the killer robots will know where their human targets are even through this kind of obscuration , perhaps by using their man-tracking groundscan radar or tracking their victims ' mobile phones , but until now poor weather would prevent any actual reaping .
That 's not usually a concern over Afghanistan , of course .
But apart from military service , Reaper aircraft are also used for patrolling the borders of the US .
Thus far , this has mainly involved the southern border with Mexico .
However , last week US Air Force general Gene Renuart - chief of US Northern Command - told AP that America also plans to send its crewless aerial armada northwards .
" The Arctic is a new area that is important to us , " said the general , saying that retreating polar ice could mean increased activity in the far north .
" All of this has implications .. there could be security concerns . "
But he added : " There 's some extensive work that has to be done with the Federal Aviation Administration and Transport Canada " . ®
Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf , is facing the prospect of being thrown out of office after the country 's fragile coalition government yesterday announced plans to impeach him .
The move plunged nuclear - armed Pakistan into fresh political turmoil , as it grapples to cope with a biting economic downturn and a security crisis that has seen Taliban - inspired militants take over its border region with Afghanistan and stage suicide bomb attacks across the country .
Musharraf is believed to have told supporters that he will fight the impeachment proceedings .
He was plotting his response yesterday with advisers , and finally cancelled an on - off trip to the opening ceremony of the Olympic games .
" We elected him and now we will support him to defeat this move , " said Kamil Ali Agha , a leader of the main pro-Musharraf party .
Pakistan 's top military commanders also reportedly met yesterday , and the reaction of the army - which until recently was led by the president - is anxiously awaited by politicians and the public .
The breakthrough for the coalition , which has been able to agree on little since taking office four months ago , came after three days of talks between the Pakistan People 's party , led by Asif Zardari , and Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N .
" We want to make a new Pakistan , " Zardari said at a press conference in Islamabad .
" We have the votes and the political will . "
To instigate an impeachment , the coalition must prove that the president has subverted the constitution or is guilty of gross misconduct .
Musharraf 's dismissal in November of the country 's judiciary and suspension of the constitution for six weeks may form the basis of this .
However , impeachment requires a two - thirds majority in parliament , and the numbers are close .
Musharraf 's trump card may now be to use his power to dismiss parliament before it gets a chance to move the impeachment motion , under a constitutional mechanism that was used three times in the 90s to sack governments .
If the president believes that the army is with him , he may be tempted to use this authority .
Impeachment has never been used in Pakistan before and there are fears that it could provoke another military intervention .
" This decision was taken in haste .
They are playing with fire , " said Amin Fahim , an estranged senior member of the People 's party .
" Every action has a reaction . "
The Pakistani military has indicated that it wishes to stay out of politics following Musharraf 's decision to give up the job of army chief in November , when he clung on to his other role of president .
However , it is unclear whether the men in uniform , who have staged multiple coups over the course of Pakistan 's turbulent history , will stand aside while a former army chief is humiliated and dragged out of office .
Sharif was thrown out of office by Musharraf in 1999 , and many believe he is bent on revenge .
Until now , Zardari has been much more reluctant to confront the president , procrastinating on the coalition 's commitment to restore the judiciary .
" Impeachment is a device to distract attention from the restoration of the judges , " said Iqbal Haider , a former law minister under Benazir Bhutto 's government of the 90s .
But analysts said it would be difficult for Zardari to maintain credibility if he did not follow through with the impeachment threat .
" Our services to democracy are well documented , " Zardari said .
" I need no proof , no documentation from anyone ... the voice of the parliament is the demand of the people . "
In the past , Musharraf has enjoyed strong support from Washington , as a major ally in the " war on terror " ; the US has given Pakistan billions of dollars in military aid .
However , it now appears that the US may have given up on him .
The White House said last night that impeachment was an " internal matter " for Pakistan .

Labour and the Conservatives agree on the need for a UK Bill of Rights
The government should adopt a Bill of Rights for the UK , a cross-party committee of MPs and peers has urged .
The Joint Committee on Human Rights said the bill should go further than current human rights legislation .
The bill should give greater protection to groups such as children , the elderly and those with learning difficulties , it said in a report .
Labour and the Conservatives agree on the need for a new Bill of Rights , but differ on what areas it should cover .
The Conservatives have said they would bring in such a bill to replace the Human Rights Act. ' Vulnerable people '
The committee said the bill should include rights to housing , education and a healthy environment .
Its report referred to a survey conducted in 2006 when more than three - quarters of the people polled agreed that " Britain needs a Bill of Rights to protect the liberty of the individual " .
The report said the new Bill should include all the rights spelt out in the Human Rights
Act and then enshrine others in law .
HAVE YOUR SAY A Bill of Rights is a good idea in an age when people are under increasing threat of exploitation Stuart , Bristol
The report said : " We recommend for inclusion , amongst others , the right to trial by jury , the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into UK law .
" We believe that there is a strong case for ... detailed rights for children , and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups . "
The Bill would also encompass Britons ' social and economic rights , including the right to health , housing , education and an adequate standard of living , the report said .
The committee said these elements would help to distinguish the Bill of Rights from current human rights legislation .
" Rights such as the right to adequate healthcare , to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of people 's everyday lives .
" And it would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists , " it went on .
' Little person ' Andrew Dismore , chairman of the joint committee , said a Bill of Rights would be a " constitutional landmark " .
" It would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power , and for protecting the ' little person ' against powerful interests , " he said .
But Shami Chakrabarti , director of campaign group Liberty , said that while the committee had made " vital contributions to our freedom and security " , this latest ambition would be hard to achieve .
" Building on existing protections is a noble aspiration which will be difficult to fulfil as long as so many other politicians denigrate our existing Bill of Rights - the Human Rights
Act - in thought , word and deed , " she said .
The government said last year it would look into the possibility of a new Bill of Rights .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - UK - based smartphone software maker Symbian said on Wednesday it could expand its collaboration with Google Inc GOOG .
O to the operating system level as it moves to grant free and open access to its software platform .
“ We already work together and so whatever collaboration , if there is an opportunity , we will be happy to collaborate with them , ” Symbian chief executive Nigel Clifford told reporters in Tokyo .
“ And that could be on the application level or that could be on the more fundamental operating system level . ”
Symbian currently uses Google applications such as maps and search engines on its platforms .
Symbian software is used in some 60 percent of smartphones -- mobile handsets with computer - like capabilities -- but Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone or new categories of phones based on Google 's Android software could challenge that dominance .
Symbian 's closest rivals are Linux - based phones and Microsoft's MSFT .
O Windows Mobile operating system , but they occupy only 12 percent and 11 percent of the market , respectively , according to data provided by Symbian .
Nokia NOK1V.HE , which holds 47.9 percent of Symbian , said last month it would buy out other shareholders of Symbian for $ 410 million and make its software available to other phone makers without charging royalties , in response to new rivals such as Google .
Nokia will contribute Symbian ’s assets to a new not - for - profit organization , Symbian Foundation , in which it will unite with leading handset makers , network operators and communications chipmakers to create an open - source platform .
Members of the Symbian Foundation include Sony Ericsson 6752.T , Motorola Inc MOT.N , NTT DoCoMo 9437.T , AT&T Inc T.N , LG Electronics 066570.KS , Samsung Electronics 005930.KS , STMicroelectronics STM .PA , Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L .
Nokia will give Symbian and its S60 software assets to the foundation , while other members said they will lend their UIQ and MOAP software to create a joint Symbian platform in 2009 .
Symbian was formed a decade ago in London by a consortium of top mobile handset makers looking for a standardized way of building software to run new phones .
It was the descendant of software used to run Psion electronic organizers popular with business professionals in the 1990s .
' Republicans for Obama ' launch search for converts Nick Juliano

This GOP Obama backer pushes Hagel for VP Several prominent Republicans on Tuesday unveiled an effort to convert GOP voters into backers of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , saying only he would be able to return America to the right course in the world and break from eight years of disastrous policies from President Bush .
" A very large number of us feel deeply that John McCain -- good a man as he is -- will be a continuation of Bush , " said Rita Hauser , a prominent fundraiser for Bush 's 2000 campaign who served on a White House intelligence advisory board after 9/11 .
" It 's hard to walk away from your party 's nominee , but you have to put your country first . "
Hauser was joined by former Rep. Jim Leach ( R - IA ) and former Sen. Lincoln Chafee , who left the Republican party earlier this year to vote for Obama in Rhode Island 's pimary , on a conference call sponsored by the campaign Tuesday .
The " Obamacans " said McCain , the GOP nominee , would continue the bellicose bullying that 's become a hallmark of Bush and Vice President Cheney 's interactions with the rest of the world .
" It is not traditional Republicanism to make war on anyone who disagrees with you , " said Hauser , who endorsed Democrat John Kerry in 2004 because of her opposition to the Iraq war .
Leach praised Obama for offering a change that would renew the country 's core values and move away from " politics as usual . "
The Iowa Republican several times mentioned his hope that Obama would expand that emphasis by picking as a running mate Chuck Hagel , the Republican senator from Nebraska .
Hagel , a Vietnam veteran who has been willing to buck GOP orthodoxy , also is close friends with McCain .
The Nebraskan , who is leaving the Senate at year 's end , has not announced his endorsement for the coming election and he was not among those Republicans announcing their support for Obama Tuesday .
" I just hope he 's considered for veep , " Leach said .
The Republican Obama backers said they would be launching a Web site in the next few days aimed at connecting GOP defectors and encouraging more to buck McCain 's candidacy .
They said they would emphasize how McCain has lost his former independent streak over the course of this campaign , where he now seems to be angling for a third Bush term .
Chafee listed for one example his reversal on Bush 's tax cuts and said the Arizona senator was selling out his values .
" Seeing the two different John McCain 's is a fracture in his credibility in my view , " Chafee said .
" That 's a huge issue for us . "

Now that the European Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is completed and ready to fire up in August , a slew of articles have popped up quoting doomsayers .
An AP article from this weekend was the most recent example of critics warning that the 17 - mile , $ 5.8 billion supercollider – which will slam protons together in an attempt to learn more about the building blocks of the universe – will inadvertently create a black hole that will gobble up the Earth .
So , will the most ambitious science project in human history end human history ?
No .
I should say " no , according to scientists working on the LHC . "
But the evidence points to a resounding " no . "
A study released last month disassembled the arguments against powering up the collider .
The report found " no basis for concerns that [ small ] black holes from the LHC could pose a risk to Earth on timescales shorter than the Earth 's natural lifetime . "
In other words : Yes , it could happen , but chances are the sun will burn out before this collider can have an Earth - ending mishap .
Their reasoning ?
Slashdot puts it best : " Everything that will be created at the LHC is already being created by cosmic rays .
If a black hole created by the LHC is interactive enough to destroy the world within the lifetime of the sun , similar black holes are already being created by cosmic rays . "
If such black holes were naturally flinging around in the universe , they would bump up against " dense cosmic objects , " such as neutron stars , and over time the black holes would swallow the star .
But , from looking through telescopes we know that there are plenty of old neutron stars around .
So , if it 's safe for them , it 's also safe for us .
" Any black hole that could be created at the LHC , even if it is stable , would have no effect on the earth on any meaningful timescale , " Slashdot says .
This conclusion is backed by the European agency that runs the LHC , a panel of independent scientists , the US Department of Energy , the US National Science Foundation , and science star Stephen Hawking – who argues that even if black holes developed , " they would instantly evaporate . "
That 's good enough for me .

As a massive atom smasher powers up , ‘ Big Science ’ moves away from the US
The United States is fast becoming a fiscal basket - case , its currency vastly depreciated from a few years ago , its debt mounting , with neither presidential candidate willing to tackle it .
The Bush Republicans have added $ 32 trillion to future liabilities , and hollowed out the military with a counter - insurgency of attrition in Mesopotamia .
The war in Iraq , a strategic disaster , has soaked up trillions without making the West in any measurable way safer .
Al Qaeda has a far more secure base in Pakistan than in Afghanistan , and the Pakistani nuclear Islamic state could turn any minute .
The global economy seems headed for a serious downturn , with US private and public indebtedness making a quick revival unlikely .
The hubris that propelled this president to begin his second term vowing to end tyranny on the planet by force of American arms now looks ludicrous .
My fear is that we have lost the window for recalibrating means to ends without simply looking as weak as we are .
Iran 's tenacity , and Russia 's aggression are simply reflections of the broader recognition that Bush 's bluff has been called .
McCain 's appeal is that he simply refuses to believe in any of this : it 's all still winnable , and American military power is still his main tool of choice .
But what if he 's wrong ?
Would he not merely compound the folly of the last few years - and would he be the wisest choice as president in a world hurtling toward the potential for more polarizing conflict ?
There is one obvious area of common ground , however .
Oil is the source of the power of our enemies , and the enemies of democracy and peace .
Until we shift the global economy decisively away from petro-economics , the West will decline quite swiftly in relation to the petro-powers .
There is no peaceful future for a world run on oil .
This is now not just a matter of environmental concern ; it 's a geo-strategic urgency .

A huge bomb blast in the northern Turkmen city of Tal Afar killed 21 and wounded 70 on Friday .
Tal Afar has been taken over by Shiite Turkmen , after having been dominated in the Saddam period by Sunnis , so there are a lot of Sunnis who want revenge .
It also has Turkmen - Kurdish tensions , which are raging in northern Iraq these days because of the Kirkuk crisis ( see below ) .
In the wake of the outbreak of the Russian - Georgian War over Ossetia , Georgia wants to withdraw the 2,000 troops it has in Iraq .
These troops appear to have been based in Diyala or Wasit provinces , where they have been preventing Shiite militiamen from smuggling arms in from Iran .
Although the US military is playing down the impact of their withdrawal , it seems to me significant .
The Iraqi army certainly could not be counted on to take up their work , since so much of it was recruited from Shiite militias .
The US would have to divert 2,000 men to this dangerous task ( and it is intrinsically dangerous to have US troops directly on the Iranian border ) .
The Georgians beefed up their presence because they are trying to join NATO ; from a Russian point of view this development is highly undesirable , which is part of the point of the fighting over Ossetia .
All this is not to mention that a US airlift of 2000 Georgian troops to fight Russian ones at this juncture does not look friendly to Moscow .
McClatchy reports that Sayyid Muqtada al - Sadr pledged Friday to disband his Mahdi Army militia if the government of Nuri al - Maliki succeeded in obtaining a timetable for US troop withdrawal from Iraq .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that Salah al - Ubaidi , a spokesman for the Sadr Movement , said Friday that the Sadrists will dissolve the Mahdi Army if US troops begin withdrawing in accordance with a timetable .
But al - Ubaidi , who read a statement before Friday prayers at the Kufa Mosque , affirmed that the Movement would reverse its decision if the US forces reneged on their intention to withdraw .
He also pledged that the “ resistance ” would not stop until the American forces had left Iraq ( though apparently it would not be a violent resistance as long as American forces were in the process of drawing down ) .
On another front , al - Hayat says , Iraqi members of parliament were open about their apprehensions over the tense situation in Kirkuk after the visit to that city of Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani and his renewed threat to annex it to the Kurdistan Regional Authority in accordance with the resolution passed by the Kurdish majority on city ’s governing council a few weeks ago at a time when Arab and Turkman representatives were boycotting the sessions .
( The resolution was not viewed as binding by Iraqi legal experts ) .
During Barzani ’s visit on Friday , he met with local officials and called for an open dialogue to end the dispute over Kirkuk ’s identity .
He warned that “ Those who maintain that article 140 of the Iraqi constitution is dead are instigating public unrest . ”
Article 140 called for a referendum to be held in Kirkuk Province by the end of 2006 on whether the province would join the Kurdistan confederacy .
Since it is widely recognized that in the meantime the Kurdish forces have brought very large numbers of Kurds into the province , such that they are probably a majority , however , all the referendum would establish in the eyes of Arabs and Turkmen would be that the Kurds had stolen the vote .
NPR reports on the opening of the airport near the Shiite holy city of Najaf and that city ’s aspirations to become the capital of southern Iraq .
This report is searching and intelligent , and reminds us how much we need NPR .
Antiwar.com summarizes Iraqi political violence on Friday .
Two years after James E. Hansen , the leading climate scientist at NASA , and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees , the agency ’s inspector general has concluded that such activities occurred and were “ inconsistent ” with the law that established the space program 50 years ago .
In a 48 - page report issued on Monday as a result of a request in 2006 by 14 senators , the internal investigative office said the activities appeared limited to the headquarters press office .
No evidence was found showing that officials higher at NASA or in the Bush administration were involved in interfering with the release of climate science information , the report said .
It also credited Michael Griffin , the agency administrator , for swiftly ordering a review and policy changes when the pattern came to light after articles in The New York Times early in 2006 .
When the Asus Eee PC came out last year , we found that the eeextremely eeenticing subnotebook had the potential to be a real game - changer .
Indeed , the diminutive wonder has spawned countless imitation products from a wide range of other vendors .
Although the Eee is my favorite laptop for traveling , its Xandros - based Linux distribution is getting crufty and beginning to show its age .
I was unable to install Firefox 3 on it , for instance , because it lacks a current version of the GTK + toolkit .
In preparation for OSCON , I decided to infuse my Eee with new life by installing Ubuntu 8.04 .
I used a community - driven derivative called Ubuntu Eee that is designed specifically for Eee laptops .
It has nearly full hardware compatibility right out of the box , including support for suspend / resume , sound , and the built - in webcam .
No CD ?
Try SD
The Eee lacks an optical drive , so I had to use the SD slot in order to perform the installation .
This is the trickiest part of process , but it is significantly simplified by UNetbootin , a user - friendly tool for putting ISO images onto flash media .
I started by downloading the latest Ubuntu Eee installation image from the project 's web site and also their custom build of UNetbootin .
The next step is using an Ubuntu desktop computer to prepare the SD card so that it can be used for installation on the Eee .
This is where I ran into trouble and I had to try a few times before I got it to work right .
I used the dd command to fix the SD card 's MBR ( substitute the bracketed text with the correct path to your SD device ) :
dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=[ correct device path ]
Now you have to erase the existing partitions on the SD card and create a new one that is formatted with FAT32 and set with the bootable flag .
You can do this with any tool , but I recommend using gparted .
After you have the SD card partitioned and formatted , you just have to write the image .
I used a custom UNetbootin build that was created specifically for integration with the Ubuntu Eee distro .
I selected the disk image option and then specified the path of the ISO file .
UNetbootin automatically detected the correct path of my SD card device , but some users may need to manually select a location from the Drive drop - down menu ( do this with extreme care , because the target drive will be overwritten ) .
I checked to make sure all of the options were correct , and then I hit the OK button to start the process .
From there , everything else is fully automated .
UNetbootin sets up the filesystem and and pretty much everything else .
To boot the Eee from an SD card , you have to hold the Escape key during startup and then select the USB option from the menu display ( yes , you select USB even though it 's an SD card ) .
If you have done everything correctly , the LiveCD environment will boot from the SD .
If you get a black screen with a flashing white line , then you might need to go back and try the process again .
You might also need to go into the bios and toggle the " OS Installation " option .
Xandros out , Ubuntu in
In the LiveCD environment , you can launch the installer from the desktop to replace Xandros with Ubuntu .
The installation will take a long time to complete , but when it 's done you will be able to run Ubuntu directly from the Eee 's internal storage .
There are no special configuration options or anything that need to be selected in the installer ; just install as you normally would on the desktop , and it should work .
After you have it installed , there are some customizations you can apply to make Ubuntu more comfortable on the small screen .
For instance , you can follow the instructions provided in the wiki to install the Netbook Remix user interface packages .
The Netbook Remix launcher do n't work too well on the Eee yet because it is designed for a different resolution .
The Netbook Remix 's maximum window handler and the new window selection applet for the panel both work reasonably well on the Eee .
The Ubuntu Eee community has also documented some changes that you can make to increase battery life , optimize boot speed , and fix various minor issues .

University education in China is skyrocketing .
In 1996 China had less than 1 million freshmen , in 2006 there were over 5 million freshmen .
The freshman class is continuing to grow and university graduates , of course , are just 4 years behind .
About half of the entering students are in a hard science or engineering program .
As a result , China today produces 3 times more engineers than the United States and will quickly overtake the U.S. in total graduates .
Many people worry about what the Chinese education explosion means for
the United States but I am optimistic .
First , as China and other countries grow wealthy the
incentive to invest in R&D is increasing .
If China and India were as wealthy as the U.S. the market for cancer drugs , for example , would be eight times larger than it is today – and a larger market means more new drugs for everyone .
Second , the growth in Chinese education is
increasing the supply of new ideas and that too is a benefit to people around the world .
Surprisingly , China ’s education system is being
transformed to a
considerable degree by private forces .
As late as 1999 the Chinese government
paid for most university education but from 2001 onwards tuition and
fees account for more than half of total educational expenditures .
I have drawn much of the data in this post from a fascinating new paper , The Higher Educational Transformation of China and its Global Implications by Li , Whalley , Zhang and Zhao .
The paper has much else of interest .
I will be traveling to China to give a talk at Yunnan University in late June and will report on the transformation as it looks on the ground .
This is a private email that reporter Laurie Garrett sent to a few friends from the World Economic Forum in late January 2003 .
But as you can see , it 's so good that they forwarded it to their friends , and so on ...
Despite the spelling errors , and Garrett 's obligatory anger that it got out to the public , this is the best reporting she has ever done , precisely because it was not written for " the public " -- that is , for the propaganda industry , which demands timidity , pompous language , the assumption that readers can't think for themselves , and fake neutrality masking total obedience to the ruling powers and ideologies .
This letter is full of great information that 's supposed to be kept from the public , but what I like best is the clear , honest language .
Update March 2005 .
Here 's Laurie Garrett 's resignation letter from Newsday .
Now maybe she 'll write more stuff this good .
Hi Guys .
OK , hard to believe , but true .
Yours truely has been hobnobbing with the ruling class .
I spent a week in Davos , Switzerland at the World Economic Forum .
I was awarded a special pass which allowed me full access to not only the entire official meeting , but also private dinners with the likes the head of the Saudi Secret Police , presidents of various insundry countries , your Fortune 500 CEOS and the leaders of the most important NGOs in the world .
This was not typical press access .
It was full - on , unfettered , class A hobnobbing .
Davos , I discovered , is a breathtakingly beautiful spot , unlike anything I 'd ever experienced .
Nestled high in the Swiss Alps , it 's a three hours train ride from Zurich that finds you climbing steadily through snow - laden mountains that bring to mind Heidi and Audrey Hepburn ( as in the opening scenes of " Charade " ) .
The EXTREMELY powerful arrive by helicopter .
The moderately powerful take the first class train .
The NGOs and we mere mortals reach heaven via coach train or a conference bus .
Once in Europe 's bit of heaven conferees are scattered in hotels that range from B &B to ultra luxury 5 - stars , all of which are located along one of only three streets that bisect the idyllic village of some 13,000 permanent residents .
Local Davos folks are fanatic about skiing , and the slopes are literally a 5 - 15 minute bus ride away , depending on which astounding downhill you care to try .
I do n't know how , so rather than come home in a full body cast I merely watched .
This sweet little chalet village was during the WEF packed with about 3000 delegates and press , some 1000 Swiss police , another 400 Swiss soldiers , numerous tanks and armored personnel carriers , gigantic rolls of coiled barbed wire that gracefully cascaded down snow - covered hillsides , missile launchers and assorted other tools of the national security trade .
The security precautions did not , of course , stop there .
Every single person who planned to enter the conference site had special electronic badges which , upon being swiped across a reading pad , produced a computer screen filled color portrait of the attendee , along with his / her vital statistics .
These were swiped and scrutinized by soldiers and police every few minutes -- any time one passed through a door , basically .
The whole system was connected to handheld wireless communication devices made by HP , which were issued to all VIPs .
I got one .
Very cool , except when they crashed .
Which , of course , they did frequently .
These devices supplied every imagineable piece of information one could want about the conference , your fellow delegates , Davos , the world news , etc .
And they were emailing devices --- all emails being monitored , of course , by Swiss cops .
Antiglobalization folks did n't stand a chance .
Nor did Al Qaeda .
After all , if someone managed to take out Davos during WEF week the world would basically lose a fair chunk of its ruling and governing class POOF , just like that .
So security was the name of the game .
Metal detectors , X - ray machines , shivering soldiers standing in blizzards , etc.
Overall , here is what I learned about the state of our world : - I was in a dinner with heads of Saudi and German FBI , plus the foreign minister of Afghanistan .
They all said that at its peak Al Qaeda had 70,000 members .
Only 10 % of them were trained in terrorism -- the rest were military recruits .
Of that 7000 , they say all but about 200 are dead or in jail . -
But Al Qaeda , they say , is like a brand which has been heavily franchised .
And nobody knows how many unofficial franchises have been spawned since 9/11 . -
The global economy is in very very very very bad shape .
Last year when WEF met here in New York all I heard was , " Yeah , it 's bad , but recovery is right around the corner " .
This year " recovery " was a word never uttered .
Fear was palpable -- fear of enormous fiscal hysteria .
The watchwords were " deflation " , " long term stagnation " and " collapse of the dollar " .
All of this is without war . -
If the U.S. unilaterally goes to war , and it is anything short of a quick surgical strike ( lasting less than 30 days ) , the economists were all predicting extreme economic gloom : falling dollar value , rising spot market oil prices , the Fed pushing interest rates down towards zero with resulting increase in national debt , severe trouble in all countries whose currency is guaranteed agains the dollar ( which is just about everybody except the EU ) , a near cessation of all development and humanitarian programs for poor countries .
Very few economists or ministers of finance predicted the world getting out of that economic funk for minimally five - 10 years , once the downward spiral ensues . -
Not surprisingly , the business community was in no mood to hear about a war in Iraq .
Except for diehard American Republicans , a few Brit Tories and some Middle East folks the WEF was in a foul , angry anti-American mood .
Last year the WEF was a lovefest for America .
This year the mood was so ugly that it reminded me of what it felt like to be an American overseas in the Reagan years .
The rich -- whether they are French or Chinese or just about anybody -- are livid about the Iraq crisis primarily because they believe it will sink their financial fortunes . -
Plenty are also infuriated because they disagree on policy grounds .
I learned a great deal .
It goes FAR beyond the sorts of questions one hears raised by demonstrators and in UN debates .
For example :- If Al Qaeda is down to merely 200 terrorists cadres and a handful of wannabe franchises , what 's all the fuss ? -
The Middle East situation has never been worse .
All hope for a settlement between Israel and Palestine seems to have evaporated .
The energy should be focused on placing painful financial pressure on all sides in that fight , forcing them to the negotiating table .
Otherwise , the ME may well explode .
The war in Iraq is at best a distraction from that core issue , at worst may aggravate it .
Jordan 's Queen Rania spoke of the " desperate search for hope " .-
Serious Islamic leaders ( e.g. the King of Jordan , the Prime Minster of Malaysia , the Grand Mufti of Bosnia ) believe that the Islamic world must recapture the glory days of 12 - 13th C Islam .
That means finding tolerance and building great education institutions and places of learning .
The King was passionate on the subject .
It also means freedom of movement and speech within and among the Islamic nations .
And , most importantly to the WEF , it means flourishing free trade and support for entrepeneurs with minimal state regulation .
( However , there were also several Middle East respresentatives who argued precisely the opposite .
They believe bringing down Saddam Hussein and then pushing the Israel / Palestine issue could actually result in a Golden Age for Arab Islam . ) -
US unilateralism is seen as arrogant , bullyish .
If the U.S. cannot behave in partnership with its allies -- especially the Europeans -- it risks not only political alliance but BUSINESS , as well .
Company leaders argued that they would rather not have to deal with US government attitudes about all sorts of multilateral treaties ( climate change , intellectual property , rights of children , etc. ) -- it 's easier to just do business in countries whose governments agree with yours .
And it 's cheaper , in the long run , because the regulatory envornments match .
War against Iraq is seen as just another example of the unilateralism .-
For a minority of the participants there was another layer of AntiAmericanism that focused on moralisms and religion .
I often heard delegates complain that the US " opposes the rights of children " , because we block all treaties and UN efforts that would support sex education and condom access for children and teens .
They spoke of sex education as a " right " .
Similarly , there was a decidedly mixed feeling about Ashcroft , who addressed the conference .
I attended a small lunch with Ashcroft , and observed Ralph Reed and other prominent Christian fundamentalists working the room and bowing their heads before eating .
The rest of the world 's elite finds this American Christian behavior at least as uncomfortable as it does Moslem or Hindu fundamentalist behavior .
They find it awkward every time a US representative refers to " faith - based " programs .
It 's different from how it makes non-Christian Americans feel -- these folks experience it as downright embarrassing .-
When Colin Powell gave the speech of his life , trying to win over the nonAmerican delegates , the sharpest attack on his comments came not from Amnesty International or some Islamic representative -- it came from the head of the largest bank in the Netherlands !
I learned that the only economy about which there is much enthusiasm is China , which was responsible for 77 % of the global GDP growth in 2002 .
But the honcho of the Bank of China , Zhu Min , said that fantastic growth could slow to a crawl if China cannot solve its rural / urban problem .
Currently 400 million Chinese are urbanites , and their average income is 16 times that of the 900 million rural residents .
Zhu argued China must urbanize nearly a billion people in ten years !
I learned that the US economy is the primary drag on the global economy , and only a handful of nations have sufficient internal growth to thrive when the US is stagnating .
The WEF was overwhelmed by talk of security , with fears of terrorism , computer and copyright theft , assassination and global instability dominating almost every discussion .
I learned from American security and military speakers that , " We need to attack Iraq not to punish it for what it might have , but preemptively , as part of a global war .
Iraq is just one piece of a campaign that will last years , taking out states , cleansing the planet .
" The mood was very grim .
Almost no parties , little fun .
If it had n't been for the South Africans -- party animals every one of them -- I 'd never have danced .
Thankfully , the South Africans staged a helluva party , with Jimmy Dludlu 's band rocking until 3 am and Stellenbosch wines pouring freely , glass after glass after glass .... These WEF folks are freaked out .
They see very bad economics ahead , war , and more terrorism .
About 10 % of the sessions were about terrorism , and it 's heavy stuff .
One session costed out what another 9/11 - type attack would do to global markets , predicting a far , far worse impact due to the " second hit " effect -- a second hit that would prove all the world 's post - 9/11 security efforts had failed .
Another costed out in detail what this , or that , war scenario Would do to spot oil prices .
Russian speakers argued that " failed nations " were spawning terrorists --- code for saying , " we hate Chechnya " .
Entire sessions were devoted to arguing which poses the greater asymmetric threat : nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
Finally , who are these guys ?
I actually enjoyed a lot of my conversations , and found many of the leaders and rich quite charming and remarkably candid .
Some dressed elegantly , no matter how bitter cold and snowy it was , but most seemed quite happy in ski clothes or casual attire .
Women wearing pants was perfectly acceptable , and the elite is sufficiently Multicultural that even the suit and tie lacks a sense of dominance .
Watching Bill Clinton address the conference while sitting in the hotel room of the President of Mozambique -- we were viewing it on closed circuit TV -- I got juicy blow - by=blow analysis of US foreign policy from a remarkably candid head of state .
A day spent with Bill Gates turned out to be fascinating and fun .
I found the CEO of Heinekin hilarious , and George Soros proved quite earnest about confronting AIDS .
Vicente Fox -- who I had breakfast with -- proved sexy and smart like a --- well , a fox .
David Stern ( Chair of the NBA ) ran up and gave me a hug .
The world is n't run by a clever cabal .
It 's run by about 5,000 bickering , sometimes charming , usually arrogant , mostly male people who are accustomed to living in either phenomenal wealth , or great personal power .
A few have both .
Many of them turn out to be remarkably naive -- especially about science and technology .
All of them are financially wise , though their ranks have thinned due to unwise tech - stock investing .
They pay close heed to politics , though most would be happy if the global political system behaved far more rationally -- better for the bottom line .
They work very hard , attending sessions from dawn to nearly midnight , but expect the standards of intelligence and analysis to be the best available in the entire world .
They are impatient .
They have a hard time reconciling long term issues ( global wearming , AIDS pandemic , resource scarcity ) with their daily bottomline foci .
They are comfortable working across languages , cultures and gender , though white caucasian males still outnumber all other categories .
They adore hi-tech gadgets and are glued to their cell phones .
Welcome to Earth : meet the leaders .

This is the last Charley Reese column , as the author is retiring .
Years ago , the first time I saw my friend Brother Dave Gardner after he had survived a plane crash , the comedian smiled and said , " The devil like to got me . "
That ’s a good explanation for my last trip to the hospital .
I ’ve been running a footrace with piled - up years and bad living habits , and they have pulled even and will soon be ahead .
I know it may not seem to normal people that writing three columns a week requires any hard work , but it does require energy to do the research and an alertness of the mind that I can no longer muster .
Hence , this will be my last column .
It ’s been a difficult decision to make .
In one sense , I ’m not sure there is even a Charley Reese without the column , but I would rather quit now than to reach a point where the editors and readers know that I should quit .
Those of you who have read my column have made me a sort of guest in your home , and I do n’t want to overstay my welcome .
I do n’t intend to croak , but that ’s not something we can control .
I have some tidying up to do .
One of the things I have to do is to say a heartfelt thanks to the readers and to the editors .
I ’ve stirred my share of controversy , and the easiest solution to controversy is to simply drop the column .
I greatly admire those editors who stuck with me .
I deeply appreciate the loyalty of my readers .
The sales reps and the staff at King Features are the best in the business .
I feel honored to have been associated with them .
To them , freedom of the press is not a slogan .
I ’ve had a good run .
In 1955 , when I started as a reporter , newspaper city rooms were full of tobacco smoke , alcoholics , gluepots , steel rulers , copy pencils and typewriters .
There was a lot of profanity and an occasional fistfight .
Editors excelled in sarcasm .
But they taught me how to write clear sentences .
One afternoon when I reported in , I asked an editor if he would like to get a cup of coffee .
He glared at me and said , " Reese , I just spent $ 15 getting a buzz on , and I ai n’t about to ruin it with a ( expletive ) 10 - cent cup of coffee . "
Today ’s newsrooms look more like insurance offices .
Computer keyboards do n’t make much noise .
If the reporters smoke anything at all , it ’s not tobacco .
Instead of greasy grills , most newspapers have salad bars .
I ’m sure H.L. Mencken would have seen salad bars as a sure sign of decline .
John McCain can have the last laugh , since I ’ve said several times that he ’s too old to be the president .
He is , even if he is more durable than I am .
There are some who will celebrate my going , and it galls me to give them that pleasure .
I was never ambitious , but I ’ve always been competitive and pugnacious .
At any rate , it ’s a great time to be an American .
George W. Bush , who turned out to be a gift to comedians but a blunderer of the first order , will soon be out of office .
It is historic and a good sign that a black man , Barack Obama , can win the nomination of a major party .
When I started in the business , the South was still segregated , and blacks were invisible both as employees and as subjects of news stories , with the exception of crime stories .
The great advantage of a free society is the capacity to self - correct itself .
You ’d think dictators would have figured that out , but if they are not paranoid when they seize power , they become so trying to hang on to power .
Well , enough random thoughts .
My goal as a columnist has always been to stimulate and , if necessary , provoke people into thinking for themselves .
If we fail to do that , a free society wo n’t last .
I wish you all a fond farewell .

Mondoreb says : " Sharpened steel spikes , hidden in pits and water , have begun turning up in parks and lakes on two continents . "
A man wading in the water at the Green Lake Boating Center in Seattle felt a " sharp jab in his foot " Sunday while wading with his family .
Pat Boltz reached down and found a metal rod .
The rod was sharpened by a machine on the end and it had n't gotten there by accident .
Nor were the other 38 " spikes " , 2 - 3 ft. long , found by Seattle police divers .
Much to the park police 's horror , someone had planted 39 metal rods in the bottom of the lake near the center and southern docks of the boating center .
This reminds me of something that happened to me about 10 years ago on a train from Greenwich , CT to NYC .
When I sat down in my seat , I felt a sharp sting in my butt .
I inspected the plastic upholstery and discovered several small slits had been cut into it .
Each slit was hiding an X - Acto knife blade pointing upward .

Mann was moved from a jail in Harare to Equatorial Guinea in February Prosecutors in Equatorial Guinea have called for British mercenary Simon Mann to serve 30 years in jail for his 2004 coup plot , as his trial got under way .
They have also named Sir Mark Thatcher , son of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , as a plot organiser .
Mr Mann admitted his own involvement in March , although he said he was not the " main man " behind the plot .
Sir Mark was fined in 2005 and received a suspended sentence in South Africa for unknowingly helping to finance it .
Mr Mann , an ex-SAS officer , was arrested four years ago with 64 others in Zimbabwe .
He served four years in prison there for trying to purchase weapons without a licence before being extradited to Equatorial Guinea earlier this year .
Public prosecutor Jose Olo Obono has said the charges against Mr Mann merited the death penalty , but that waiving the death sentence had been a precondition of Mr Mann 's extradition .
The trial is being held at a conference centre in the capital , Malabo , and began amid heavy security .
Notepads banned Mr Mann arrived at the courtroom wearing a grey prison outfit with blue stripes on the back , AFP news agency reported .
We 've reached a conclusion that Simon Mann was used as an instrument , but there were material and intellectual authors behind it that financed the operation
Teodoro Obiang Nguema
President of Equatorial Guinea
Profile : Simon Mann Q&A : Equatorial Guinea ' coup plot '
Oil wealth lured plotters Journalists were allowed into the courtroom but made to leave mobile phones , cameras and even pens and notepads outside .
News reports said that a verdict was expected by Thursday .
Eleven other men , including South African arms dealer Nick Du Toit who testified that he was recruited by Mr Mann , are already serving sentences in Equatorial Guinea in connection with the coup attempt .
Du
Toit also said he had been told they were trying to install an exiled opposition politician , Severo Moto , as president .
Mr Moto has been sentenced to a long prison term in absentia for his role .
Last week , Mr Olo Obono said Mr Mann would face three charges - crimes against the head of state , crimes against the government and crimes against the peace and independence of the state .
President Teodoro Obiang Nguema told Channel 4
News : " We 've reached a conclusion that Simon Mann was used as an instrument , but there were material and intellectual authors behind it that financed the operation . "
President Obiang has accused the Spanish government , a former British cabinet minister whom he refuses to name , oil tycoon Eli Calil and Mr Moto , who lives in Spain , of involvement .
Both named men have strongly denied any links to the plot .
Notorious prison Mr Mann 's lawyer , Jose Pablo Nvo , said he was working for his client " first , to not have a death sentence , and then to stay the least time possible in prison " .
Mr Mann , a 55 - year - old ex-Etonian who has been held in Malabo 's notorious Black Beach prison since being extradited in February , told Channel 4 News a month later that he had been the " manager , not the architect " of the plot to overthrow Mr Obiang .
Mr Mann went on to name those who were " part of the team " , including Sir Mark Thatcher .
Sir Mark was fined and received a suspended sentence in South Africa in 2005 for his involvement in the coup .
He has always claimed he was an unwitting conspirator and that , as far as he knew , he was helping finance a new company - an air ambulance business in West Africa .
Equatorial Guinea , an oil - rich former Spanish colony , has been ruled by President Obiang since he seized power from his uncle in 1979 .
His government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses and of ruthlessly suppressing political opposition .
Transparency International has put the tiny nation in its top 10 corrupt states .

For a while now , I ’ve wanted an effect for Compiz Fusion that makes closing windows look like shattering glass .
I finally got around to coding it up , and am pretty pleased with the results !
Take a look at the demo videos to see what I mean !
Also , I took the time to make a debian package for Ubuntu Hardy , so you can easily install it , as well as get the other animations like Helix and Blinds that I ’ve coded up !
( Instructions for Ubuntu install after the videos )
Many medium sized windows shattering :
Effect in slowmo :
Basically , I split the window up radially from a central point , and then split each radial slice along concentric circles to create the tessellation .
The angles , the number of slices , and the number of concentric tiers is all random , so it creates a different looking effect each time .
I then have the pieces then fall to the bottom of the window like real shattered glass would .
All in all , I had to write about 1400 lines of new code to get this working .
There are a few more user customizable options I have left to throw in , but most of the heavy lifting is done .
Roughly speaking , its about as computationally intensive as the “ explode ” animation .
Interested in installing these and trying them out ?
If you ’re not on Ubuntu , follow this official guide to install compiz from source , and this guide to install my plugin .
If you happen to be on Ubuntu though , I made a handy package that you can install and get these effects in less than 5 minutes .
A bit of a disclaimer , this is my first experience with Launchpad ’s PPA system , so do n’t jump down my throat if I did something wrong .
I ’ve tested the package on a fresh Ubuntu install , and it works fine .
Installation Instructions for Ubuntu :
Add my Personal Package Archive to your /etc/apt/sources.list .
This can be done by adding
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/kdub/ubuntu hardy main deb-src
http://ppa.launchpad.net/kdub/ubuntu hardy main
to /etc/apt/sources.list OR by running
sudo su -c ' echo deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/kdub/ubuntu hardy main >> /etc/apt/sources.list ' sudo su -c ' echo deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/kdub/ubuntu hardy main >> /etc/apt/sources.list '
You can then install it by running
sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get install cf - kdubois - extra- animations ccsm
The last command will open up a GUI for configuring compiz that you need to turn extra-animations on .
Under the “ Extras ” section , click Animations Plus , as shown here .
It will automatically deactivate the old Animations plugin .
If a dialog box appears to this effect , choose “ disable animations ”
You should see this :
Click on the Animations Plus icon to get an interface similar to the Animation plugin you can use to configure the effects .
Shatter , Helix , and Blinds are new effects with this package .
I would recommend a minimum of 500ms for the Shatter effect and 300ms for the Helix and Blinds Effects .
Under the Effects Settings tab , you can configure many options for the three new plugins , as well as new tessellations ( like Triangular Tessellations ) for the Explode and Leafspread effects .
For some reason , when I tried this out on a fresh Ubuntu Hardy install , I had to restart compiz to get it to refresh the effect settings .
There you go !
I hope you enjoy the effects I wrote , and keep checking back for new effects !
EDIT : Thanks to Vadim P. for pointing this out , but this Ubuntu package will only work for the stock install image of Ubuntu ( i.e. the version provided in a fresh install ) .
If the plugin keeps deactivating itself , thats because there is a mismatch between the plugin version and the compiz core version .
Try installing from source , it should be pretty easy too :
sudo apt - get install compiz - dev git clone git://anongit.compiz-fusion.org/users/kdubois/extra-animations cd extra-animations && make install
Sorry for any inconveince , I am very new to official - style debian packaging 😀

- The FBI was actually told to blame Anthrax scare on Al Qaeda by White House officials
- The anthrax letters attempt to link 9/11 and the anthrax attack and pretend to be from radical Muslims and be anti-America and anti-Israel
- High - level government insiders pointed towards Iraq as the source of the anthrax , even though there was absolutely no reason to think that the anthrax had come from Iraq
- The FBI gave its consent in October , 2001 for the remaining samples of the Ames anthrax strain to be destroyed , thereby permanently destroying crucial " genetic clues valuable to the criminal inquiry " .
Why would the FBI allow the Ames samples to be destroyed , other than to prevent fingers from being pointed toward the real killer , someone who worked for the U.S. government and had access to U.S. bioweapons ?
- Would Arab terrorists have targeted only Congress men who were likely to oppose the Patriot Act and other tyrannical measures ?
Would they have gotten that specific in their targeting ?
In order to terrorize America as a whole , would n't real Arab terrorists have sent anthrax to the Congressional leaders of both parties , regardless of their political postures towards particular legislation ?
Should n't it have been obvious to the FBI that the killer was pro-tyranny , rather than being simply Anti-American ?
The " war on terror " and Iraq war were largely based on the claim that Saddam and Muslim extremists were behind the anthrax attacks ( and see this )
- Senator Patrick Leahy said :
And I think there are people within our government -- certainly from the source of it -- who know where it came from .
[ Taps the table to let that settle in ]
And these people may not have had anything to do with it , but they certainly know where it came from .
In other words , people knew , but were n't admitting , that the source was an insider .
Therefore , whether Ivins or another scientist working for the U.S. government carried out the anthrax attacks is actually not the primary question .
The main question is who within the U.S. government framed Arabs for the attacks , and whether the attacks were motivated primarily as a justification for war against Middle Eastern oil countries or to intimidate the U.S. Congress and the American people into accepting fascism .
The fact that the government is now trying to blame it all on American does not change the fact that it was - for 7 years - blamed on Arabs .
The government is trying to neatly tie up the whole mess and bury the story .
But the " war on terror " has already been raging for close to a decade , and the Iraq war for some 5 years .
The damage - caused by the false flag operation - cannot so easily be erased .

Pollen could be used to identify the perpetrators of gun crimes , thanks to developments in nanotechnology .
The microscopic grains can be coated onto bullets during manufacture and are sticky enough to hold on even after the gun has been fired .
Each ' nanotag ' is made up of pollen and a unique chemical signature that can be used to identify the batch of ammunition .
The pollen grains – from one of two species of lily – are around 30 micrometres in diameter and are invisible to the naked eye .
Thousands can be attached to each cartridge .
" The tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen , a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties , " said Prof Paul Sermon from the University of Surrey , who led the research .
" It has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide , zirconia [ zirconium dioxide ] , silica or a mixture of other oxides .
The precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another , enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user . "
According to the UK Home Office , there were 18,489 crimes involving firearms in England and Wales in 2006 - 7 .
But DNA profiling using skin cells or other biological material stuck to gun cartridges is only successful in about 10 % of cases .
DNA is damaged by the heat produced when the bullet is fired and also by copper released from the cartridge case by mildly acidic sweat .
If all ammunition were marked with pollen tags , they could help police find out when and where a bullet had been bought .
The nanotags are also difficult to remove from clothes and hands , so it would be possible to prove that a suspect had handled a particular batch of ammunition .
The pollen tags could be combined with another method developed by the same team that involves roughening the surface of the bullet at a very fine scale so as to capture dead skin cells from the thumb of someone handling it .
" We 're currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers , " said Sermon , " but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place . "
If you 're a fan of habañero salsa or like to order Thai food spiced to five stars , you owe a lot to bugs , both the crawling kind and ones you can see only with a microscope .
New research shows they are the ones responsible for the heat in chili peppers .
The spiciness is a defense mechanism that some peppers develop to suppress a microbial fungus that invades through punctures made in the outer skin by insects .
The fungus , from a large genus called Fusarium , destroys the plant 's seeds before they can be eaten by birds and widely distributed .
" For these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal , when a large number are killed by this fungus , " said Joshua Tewksbury , a University of Washington assistant professor of biology .
" Both the fungus and the birds eat chilies , but the fungus never disperses seeds – it just kills them . "
Fruits use sugars and lipids to attract consumers such as birds that will scatter the seeds .
But insects and fungi enjoy sugars and lipids too , and in tandem they can be fatal to a pepper 's progeny .
However , the researchers found that the pungency , or heat , in hot chilies acts as a unique defense mechanism .
The pungency comes from capsaicinoids , the same chemicals that protect them from fungal attack by dramatically slowing microbial growth .
" Capsaicin does n't stop the dispersal of seeds because birds do n't sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers , but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical , " said Tewksbury , lead author of a paper documenting the research .
advertisement
" Having such a specific defense , one that does n't harm reproduction or dispersal , is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant , and I think it is a great example of the power of natural selection . "
The paper is published the week of Aug. 11 in the online Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Co-authors are Karen Reagan , Noelle Machnicki , Tomás Carlo , and David Haak of the University of Washington ; Alejandra Lorena Calderón Peñaloza of Universidad Autonoma Gabriel Rene Moreno in Bolivia ; and Douglas Levey of the University of Florida .
The work was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society .
The scientists collected chilies from seven different populations of the same pepper species spread across 1,000 square miles in Bolivia .
In each population , they randomly selected peppers and counted scars on the outer skin from insect foraging .
The damage was caused by hemipteran insects – insects such as seed bugs ( similar to aphids and leaf hoppers ) that have sucking mouth parts arranged into a beaklike structure that can pierce the skin of a fruit .
The researchers found that not all of the plants produce capsaicinoids , so that in the same population fruit on one plant could be hotter than a jalapeño while fruit from other plants might be as mild as a bell pepper .
But there was a much - higher frequency of pungent plants in areas with larger populations of hemipteran insects that attack the chilies and leave them more vulnerable to fungus .
The scientists also found that hot plants got even hotter , with higher levels of capsaicinoids , in areas where fungal attacks were common .
But in areas with few insects and less danger of fungal attack , most of the plants lacked heat entirely .
In those areas , chilies from the plants that did produce capsaicinoids had a lot less kick because they only produced about half the capsaicinoids as the plants did in areas where fungal attack was common .
advertisement
Using chemical substances as a defense is not unique to peppers .
Tomatoes , for example , are loaded with substances that give their unripened fruit a decidedly unpleasant taste , allowing the seeds a chance to mature and be dispersed .
But unlike peppers , tomatoes and most other fruits lose their chemical defenses when the fruit ripens .
That is a necessary step , scientists believe , because otherwise the fruit would not be consumed by birds and other animals that disperse the seed .
The problem with that strategy , Tewksbury said , is that it leaves the fruit exposed to fungal attack .
" By contrast , peppers increase their chemical defense levels , or their heat , as they ripen .
This is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds do n't sense pain when they eat capsaicin , " Tewksbury said .
" I think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers .
It 's just very hard to do . "
The fact that chilies have capsaicin could be the reason humans started eating the peppers in the first place , he said .
Chili peppers and corn are among the earliest domesticated crops in the New World .
" Before there was refrigeration , it was probably adaptive to eat chilies , particularly in the tropics , " Tewksbury said .
" Back then , if you lived in a warm and humid climate , eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes , many of them harmful .
People probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them . "
All chilies originated in South America , and wild chilies now grow from central South America to the southwestern United States .
Explorers carried the plants back to Europe , but they were not widely used there .
From Europe , chilies made their way to Asia and Africa , where they have become a common ingredient in nearly every tropical cuisine .
" In the north , any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and it's easier to keep food cold .
Maybe that 's why food in the north can be so boring , " Tewksbury said .
" Along the equator , without access to refrigeration , you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day . "
In Beverly Hills , a 32,000 - square - foot beaux - arts mansion that will be sheathed in Portuguese limestone and adorned with gold - plated doorknobs fashioned in France is rising on Sunset Boulevard .
A few miles away in Bel - Air , businessman Eri Kroh has requested permits to lop off the top of a hill , fill in a canyon and then , after moving some 68,000 cubic yards of dirt , replace the chaparral - covered lot with a 30,000 - plus square - foot single family home with Pacific Ocean views .
Just down the hill , workers recently were building retaining walls for a giant lot that real estate experts say could soon feature one or two giant palace - like homes .
Anyone who assumed that the construction of mega-mansions would grind to a halt as the economy worsens must not be familiar with the customs of the very rich .

“ Does anybody need 40,000 square feet ? ” asks real estate agent Stephen Shapiro of the Westside Estate Agency .
“ No , [ but ] these are our current - day aristocrats and feudal leaders . . . and this is what they want . ”
Builder John Finton , who is overseeing construction of the 32,000 square - foot house on Sunset Boulevard for businessman C. Frederick Wehba Sr. and his wife , Susan , said he knows of at least 20 20,000 - plus square - foot homes under construction or about to break ground in what he called the “ platinum triangle ” of wealthy areas in Los Angeles County : Beverly Hills , Bel - Air and Holmby Hills .
Few properties are as infamous as the site where Finton is building the Wehbas ’ home .
At Sunset and Alpine Drive , it is being built on one part of the former estate of Saudi Sheik Mohammed al Fassi .
Known as “ the statue house , ” it became infamous decades ago when it was painted lime green and the nude statues surrounding the property were decorated with representations of genitalia .
Real estate experts give various explanations for the continuing popularity of mega-mansions .

“ People are spending much more time at home , ” Finton said .
“ They want to be comfortable . ”
Indeed , for the super - rich , being comfortable can mean turning your home into a resort .
Real estate agent Drew Fenton said that no one sets out to build a mega - house ; it just happens .
“ You keep adding the rooms you think you need .
The ballroom .
The screening room .
Masters with his and hers and a beauty salon and a massage room .
And the house keeps growing . ”
Added Fenton : “ I ca n’t explain why someone needs a gift - wrapping room or a florist room .
That is a question of culture . ”

Others had another explanation : ego .
“ Each year it seems there are more extremely rich people with ever larger egos that have to be right on top of the mountainside . . . so everyone will know -- aha -- there is the richest person on the hill , ” said Joe Edmiston , director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy , which has fought to preserve open space in the hillsides .
If there are 20 residences of 20,000 - plus square feet in the works for Los Angeles County , it would represent a surge of mega-mansions .
According to records from the Los Angeles County assessor , there are fewer than 60 homes with more than 20,000 square feet in the county and fewer than 10 with more than 30,000 .
Still , real estate agents said assessor records are n’t always accurate because they may not measure pool houses , cabanas and other similar living spaces .

Currently , many of the largest homes in the county are concentrated in the neighborhood of Beverly Park , a gated community in the hills south of Mulholland Drive in the city of Los Angeles ; several houses there are at least 25,000 square feet .
The largest home in Los Angeles County remains the 50,000 - plus - square - foot , 123 - room Holmby Hills estate of the late Aaron Spelling , which has a bowling alley , doll museum and gift - wrapping room .
Kroh , who has filed plans for the house on top of the knoll with the city of Los Angeles , insisted that there is nothing remarkable about them .
Though paperwork on file with the city shows a house of 39,000 square feet , Kroh said it will actually be smaller .
He also said he may not build the home after all .
Advertisement
Current plans call for two stories of 10,000 square feet each above ground , along with 12,000 square feet -- including a movie theater and an indoor pool -- below ground .
“ I could find you hundreds of homes like that .
Hundreds , ” Kroh said .
But even as plans are drawn for ever - larger homes , there is a growing chorus of people who are questioning the concept of the mega-mansion .
Spurred by complaints from homeowners that “ mansionization ” is ruining the character of many neighborhoods , the Los Angeles City Council last month approved new limits on the sizes of many Los Angeles houses .
Advertisement
The law applies only to the city ’s flatlands , but officials are working on a companion law for the city ’s hillsides , where many of these giant homes are slated to be built .
That is little comfort to homeowners who say an influx of giant homes has already hurt their neighborhoods .
Some of Kroh ’s would - be neighbors , for example , oppose his plans .
They say they worry about landslides and the rumble of trucks up their hilly street during construction .
Kroh dismisses these concerns , saying his project , if he builds it , will make the area safer by giving it better fire truck access and better drainage .
Advertisement
But the locals also talk about a less tangible issue : the way that an influx of mega- mansions can change the character of a close - knit community .
Many of the original homes in the area , built after the 1961 Bel - Air fire , were modest ranch houses of three and four bedrooms .
As homes have sold and the area has grown in cachet , some people have torn down and replaced with what one resident calls “ casino - style Tuscan villas . ”
This , in turn , has transformed the neighborhood , many long - time residents say .

“ We used to know all our neighbors , ” said Robert Cremer , a retired engineer .
“ We ’d socialize with them .
If they had a project , moving furniture , we ’d help them out .
The sort of thing neighbors do .
. . .
That does n’t exist anymore . ”

Awesome Experience
As the costs of developing web services has dropped ( dramatically ) a new crop of companies has started up offering what used to be called " features . "
Examples include Disqus ( blog comments ) , ididwork ( to do lists ) , Kampyle ( feedback ) and Startuply ( job posts on the " careers " section of websites ) .
The result ( as least that ’s the goal ) of this focus is that what used to be done half - assed ( hey it ’s just a feature to Typepad ) is now done with the love and attention only found in passionate entrepreneurs .
Being a user of a lot of these new services , I have to say that the customer experience is uneven .
But recently I was absolutely delighted ( and surprised ) by an experience and I wanted to share .
About a week ago I posted a job for a Community Manager on Startuply .
I only later discovered that the service was 2 weeks old at the time .
Anyway , since I posted the job , I ’ve received 5 really great candidates via Startuply .
That ’s amazing in it own right .
But the real story is when a few hours ago I shot off an email to " support " at Startuply , telling them that the resumes attached to their emails were blank and that the file was named poorly .
About 3 hours later I got an email saying , " thanks … just got back from a dinner meeting … will look at this . "
Okay .
Then 2 hours later I got an email saying , " thanks for the feedback , we fixed everything you mentioned . "
What ?!?
Hotjobs eat your heart out !
Anyway , for kicks , here ’s the actual thread :

Subject : Re : Fwd : Community Manager OK , this should be fixed .
Here ’s what we ’ve done : - the attached resume should actually be the resume now .
No more blank files ( oops ! ) .
- the attachment nomenclature is a simple " Lastname . Firstname Resume " .
Seem reasonable ?
What else can we do ?
Thanks again for the feedback .
We ’ve been live for ~ 3.5 weeks now , and getting this stuff fixed is huge .
And , as always , please feel free to reach out anytime .

I can see the resume online ( scribd ) or download the DOC file , but the one that comes attached is always blank .
Also , it ’d be great if you could name these files something like [ last name ] , [ first name ] ( resume ) .doc instead of just " Resume.doc " which is n’t terribly helpful .

There ’s a lesson here .
When your company depends upon doing a " feature " really , really well , you can win over converts with great service .
Some of the nation ’s biggest banks have closed their doors to students at community colleges , for - profit universities and other less competitive institutions , even as they continue to extend federally backed loans to students at the nation ’s top universities .
Citibank has been among the most aggressive in paring the list of colleges it serves .
JPMorgan Chase , PNC and SunTrust say they have not dropped whole categories , but are cutting colleges as well .
Some less - selective four - year colleges , like Eastern Oregon University and William Jessup University in Rocklin , Calif. , say they have been summarily dropped by some lenders .
The practice suggests that if the credit crisis and the ensuing turmoil in the student loan business persist , some of the nation ’s neediest students will be hurt the most .
The difficulty borrowing may deter them from attending school or prompt them to take a semester off .
When they get student loans , they will wind up with less attractive terms and may run a greater risk of default if they have to switch lenders in the middle of their college years .
Tuition and loan amounts can be quite small at community colleges .
But these institutions , which are a stepping stone to other educational programs or to better jobs , often draw students from the lower rungs of the economic ladder .
More than 6.2 million of the nation ’s 14.8 million undergraduates  over 40 percent  attend community colleges .
According to the most recent data from the College Board , about a third of their graduates took out loans , a majority of them federally guaranteed .
Sourceforge
For a while , Sourceforge was released as free software .
When VA Software decided to make it proprietary , two forks of the software were created -- Savane , and GForge .
Development of Sourceforge has moved along quite a lot since then , and the version of Sourceforge now is quite different from the free software projects that are still being maintained .
One additional reason to avoid Sourceforge is that they include advertisements for proprietary software in their mailing lists , so simply using a mailing list on Sourceforge is helping to promote non-free software .
Google Code
Google also runs a project hosting service , providing Subversion on top of their proprietary BigTable system , as well as issue trackers , a wiki and a download area .
Google Code refuses to allow projects hosted there to use certain free software licenses , including the GNU Affero GPL and the Mozilla Public License , one of the licenses used on the Firefox , Thunderbird and Mozilla internet suite projects -- arguing that these licenses are insufficiently popular .
Launchpad
Launchpad is a code hosting service , bug tracker , translation tool and knowledge base for free software , provided by Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu .
Launchpad has been widely criticized for its proprietary nature , and currently remains proprietary .
However , Mark Shuttleworth has recently announced Launchpad will be released as free software in the next 12 months .
Like Sun 's announcement with Java , we should continue to put pressure on Canonical to make good on this announcement .
Update : In July 2009 , Canonical released Launchpad under the AGPL .

BELMONT , Mass. , Aug. 18 -- The ADVANTAGE trial comparing Merck 's rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) with naproxen ( Aleve ) was designed and executed primarily for marketing purposes , said researchers here , but the company has denied the allegation .
Internal documents made public as part of Vioxx - related litigation show that Merck 's marketing department conceived the trial as a way to introduce the drug to primary care physicians and turn them into advocates for the product , reported Kevin P. Hill , M.D. , M.H.S. , of McLean Hospital , and colleagues in the August 19 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine .
Action Points Explain to interested patients that the study found corporate documents showing that a trial comparing rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) with naproxen ( Aleve ) had been designed primarily to market the drug to primary care physicians .
Explain that Vioxx is no longer available in the United States .
The researchers said it was the first clearly documented example of a " seeding trial , " where marketing a drug to physicians is the main goal , rather than responding to regulatory requirements or answering a scientific question .
They said the practice " threatens the integrity of the relationship of industry , academia , patients , and society " insofar as it disguises the true purpose of clinical trials , thereby undermining the principle of informed consent .
Such trials have long been rumored to be common practice , but documentary evidence had been lacking , Dr. Hill and colleagues said .
Recently , an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested that the ENHANCE study of the ezetimibe - simvastatin combination product ( Vytorin ) was really a seeding trial .
However , the authors cited only circumstantial evidence for the allegation .
Jonathan Edelman , M.D. , executive director of Merck Research Labs ' Global Center for Scientific Affairs , denied that the ADVANTAGE trial had originated with the company 's marketing division .
" ADVANTAGE was scientifically driven by [ Merck 's ] clinical research division , " he said , which conceived the study and worked with the investigators .
Dr. Edelman said the Annals of Internal Medicine authors " wrongly characterized " the study on the basis of a misreading of the Merck memos and e-mails and a misunderstanding of the company 's structure .
The ADVANTAGE study -- published in Annals of Internal Medicine in 2003 -- recruited some 600 primary care physicians as investigators , with each treating about nine patients on average .
The trial was conducted just before rofecoxib's FDA approval in 1999 , with arthritis patients randomized to rofecoxib or naproxen .
" The purpose of ADVANTAGE was neither to seek a new indication nor to perform post - marketing surveillance , " Dr. Hill and colleagues said , noting that the drug 's efficacy and tolerability were already addressed at least as thoroughly in other trials .
The researchers found internal Merck memos and presentations in which executives described the ADVANTAGE study 's purpose as almost entirely about marketing the drug .
For example , in a memo nominating the trial for an internal marketing award , Merck executives wrote , " The objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of Vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class and gather data important to this customer group . "
The memo noted that primary care physicians write 60 % of prescriptions for arthritis drugs .
" The ADVANTAGE trial utilized this important group of prescribers as investigators .
In addition to gaining experience with Vioxx , many of these physicians gained a highly coveted introduction to clinical research . "
It also revealed that Merck sales personnel identified physicians to be recruited for the trial and helped monitor the trial 's progress .
Dr. Edelman responded that the " objectives " to which the memo referred were not for the study itself , but rather for the separate marketing campaign designed to capitalize on the results .
He also said the involvement of sales staff in the study was limited to nominating potential investigators .
The final selection was handled by the clinical research division , he said .
Dr. Edelman said another marketing memo , which explicitly called ADVANTAGE a seeding trial , was written by someone who did not understand what the term meant .
Dr. Hill and colleagues said Merck and its PR firm provided media- relations training to ADVANTAGE investigators after the results were published to help them participate in the resulting publicity , according to the document trove .
And in another memo unearthed by Dr. Hill and colleagues , Edward Scolnick , M.D. , then head of Merck research , called seeding trials " intellectually redundant " and " wasteful " and said the effort " compromises the large clinically meaningful trials . "
However , Dr. Edelman rejected the suggestion by Dr. Hill and colleagues that ADVANTAGE was scientifically redundant with other rofecoxib studies .
He said ADVANTAGE was the only rofecoxib study until then that allowed concomitant use of aspirin , which the company anticipated would be common once the drug reached the market .
Other studies also did not include many primary care practices , he said .
Dr. Edelman also pointed out that Annals of Internal Medicine published the study following peer review , an indication that independent scientists believed it had merit .
An earlier review of court documents in the Vioxx lawsuits had disclosed that the 2003 paper had been ghostwritten .
In 2005 , the study 's lead author said a draft had already been prepared by Merck personnel when he was brought in .
( See : Fewer Medical Journal Articles Planted by Phantom Authors tb 9084 )
Merck has insisted that the named authors were " intimately involved " with the study .
Dr. Hill and colleagues said it would be difficult for outsiders to know when a study is actually a seeding trial .
" Without access to internal documents , the intent of pharmaceutical companies in conducting clinical trials is nearly impossible to prove .
Even with access to internal documents , study intent may be hard to prove , " they wrote .
In an accompanying editorial , Harold Sox , M.D. , editor of Annals of Internal Medicine , and Drummond Rennie , M.D. , deputy editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , said there may be clues .
" An open - label design , no control group , a very large projected enrollment relative to the importance of the question , a short - term study of a chronic disease , a study of an already approved drug " are all features that could signal a trial conducted more for marketing than science , they said .
They laid responsibility for screening out seeding trials on institutional review boards , would - be investigators , and patients .
The editorial omitted scientific journals from the list , but in an interview , Dr. Sox said they had a role to play too .
He said journals should conduct the same evaluations as institutional review boards , that is , determining whether the research addresses a genuine scientific question .
" If journals are interested in publishing findings that are new and likely to change practice , they are likely to turn down seeding trials , " he said .
That did not happen with the ADVANTAGE trial , he acknowledged .
" We thought there was an important message [ in the trial , ] but not the one that Merck was pushing , " Dr. Sox said .
The trial found that discontinuations in the trial occurred at a 5.9 % rate with rofecoxib versus 8.1 % with naproxen .
Although the difference was statistically significant , Dr. Sox said it was clinically marginal , especially given rofecoxib 's much greater cost .
" Having been burned on this one , we 're going to be more careful , " he added .
In the editorial , he and Dr. Rennie said they hoped the revelations on ADVANTAGE may discourage future seeding trials .
" Simply shining a bright light on their existence may have already sown the seeds of their destruction , " they wrote .
" The next step would be a societal consensus that it is wrong to deceive institutional review boards and participants about the true purpose of a trial . "
Chalk this one up to coincidence and an over - active imagination on my part , but there ’s an inkling of a possibility that the makers of The Conduit , that hyped FPS for the Wii without a publisher , might have a little coup up their sleeves for the upcoming Penny Arcade Expo .
But first a word or warning :
This post is entirely comprised of back channel speculation on the part of Infendo editors in our highly secure Infendo Compound ( read : Gmail ) .
With that out of the way , we ask :
Is High Voltage ready to announce that Nintendo will take on The Conduit and make High Voltage a 2nd party developer at PAX ?
Here ’s what we know so far :
Yesterday , we received a press release from High Voltage inviting us to “ play and review ” The Conduit at PAX 2008 .
Not a surprise , really .
With 40,000 + passionate video game - loving people of all stripes expected to attend the show , High Voltage would be stupid NOT to try and get the game in front of every single one of them ( and the press ) .
The key phrase in the image below is “ Nintendo booth . ”
Exhibit two is from Infendo contributing writer Jake , who talked with Nintendo ’s office in New York City about their PAX plans .
“ Just had a short email transaction with Nintendo ’s offices in New York in which I got a confirmation of a Nintendo showing at PAX 2008 .
I had previously said that Nintendo was done with large public gaming presentations for 2008 , but I stand corrected .
The lady is double checking whether or not they will be at Leipzig , but things look doubtful , ” he said .
It ’s something , but definitely not a confirmation of anything other than Nintendo will have a booth at PAX .
Wii Music , Wario and Animal Crossing are all good odds on favorites for the show ( they ’d all be safe titles , low risk ) , but Nintendo may very well bow to the complaints it received following E3 and … wait for it … show off its valuable new FPS property in The Conduit .
The revelation , if true , shows that Nintendo was not being entirely truthful about future shows and showing off games to close out 2008 .
If we use that misdirection as a platform , then perhaps they have had second thoughts about announcing any new games during the rest of 2008 , and will go back on that promise as well .
This would also play into their new prime directive of not announcing games until a few weeks or months before their release date .
I can think of no better ( confirmed by Nintendo ) title that would silence the remaining naysayers and further expand their portfolio than The Conduit .
It ’s entirely new IP ( addresses “ new franchises , Nintendo ! ” complaint ) , it ’s a serious FPS ( “ more mature games on Nintendo systems ! ” ) , and it ’s not first party ( “ having too many first party games on your console is bad ! ” ) .
Please note , that by listing these “ complaints , ” I am in no way admitting that I believe they ever had any real merit .
I list them in the spirit of openness .
It ’s a stretch , sure , and like I said this is speculation on our part , but the pieces , at least from a distance , seem like they could fit .
What say you ?
Does Nintendo play it safe at PAX , or will it deliver a semi-Megaton and surprise us all ?

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran has withdrawn around $ 75 billion from Europe to prevent the assets from being blocked under threatened new sanctions over Tehran ’s disputed nuclear ambitions , an Iranian weekly said .

Western powers are warning the Islamic Republic of more punitive measures if it rejects an incentives offer and presses on with sensitive nuclear work , but the world ’s fourth - largest oil exporter is showing no sign of backing down .
“ Part of Iran ’s assets in European banks have been converted to gold and shares and another part has been transferred to Asian banks , ” Mohsen Talaie , deputy foreign minister in charge of economic affairs , was quoted as saying .
Iranian officials were not immediately available to comment on the report in Shahrvand-e Emrouz , a moderate weekly , which did not specify the time period for the withdrawals which it said were ordered by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
“ About $ 75 billion of Iran ’s foreign assets which were under threat of being blocked were wired back to Iran based on Ahmadinejad ’s order , ” the weekly said .
Iran ’s Etemad-e Melli newspaper , also quoting Talai , last week also reported the country was withdrawing assets from European banks but did not give any figures .
On Saturday , Iran again ruled out suspending uranium enrichment despite the offer by six world powers of help in developing a civilian nuclear program if it stopped activities the United States and others suspect are designed to make bombs .
The offer -- agreed last month by the United States , Britain , Russia , China , Germany and France -- is a revised version of one rejected by Tehran two years ago .
Iran ’s refusal to suspend nuclear enrichment , which can provide fuel for power plants or material for weapons if refined much more , has drawn three rounds of U.N. sanctions since 2006 .
Tehran says it aims only to generate electricity .
EU diplomats have said the bloc is preparing an asset and funds freeze on Iran ’s biggest bank , state - owned Bank Melli , but that it first wants to see how Tehran responds to the new offer .
Iran is making windfall gains from record global oil prices and said in April its foreign exchange reserves stood at more than $ 80 billion .
Iran ’s foreign reserves figure has been climbing steadily .
Some analysts say that , alongside rising oil revenues , Iran has been helped by its decision to shift away from the U.S. dollar into other currencies as the dollar has weakened .
Iran has made the shift as Washington has tried to isolate the Islamic state , including imposing sanctions on Iranian banks .
That has pushed many Western banks to scrap dollar dealings with Iran or even end business completely .
Western countries suspect Iran is seeking the ability to make nuclear weapons .
Tehran insists its secretive program is purely aimed at generating energy .
Laptop with Trusted Traveler Identities Stolen
Oops .
A laptop with the names of 33,000 people enrolled in the Clear program — the most popular airport “ trusted traveler ” program — has been stolen at SFO .
The TSA is unhappy .
Stealing databases of personal information is never good , but this does n’t make a bit of difference to airport security .
I ’ve already written about the Clear program : it ’s a $ 100 - a - year program that lets you cut the security line , and nothing more .
Clear members are no more trusted than anyone else .
Anyway , it ’s easy to fly without an ID , as long as you claim to have lost it .
And it ’s also easy to get through airport security without being an actual airplane passenger .
None of this is security .
Absolutely none of it .
EDITED TO ADD ( 8/7 ) : The laptop has been found .
Turns out it was never stolen :
The laptop was found Tuesday morning in the same company office where it supposedly had gone missing , said spokeswoman Allison Beer .
“ It was not in an obvious location , ” said Beer , who said an investigation was under way to determine whether the computer was actually stolen or had just been misplaced .

Thanks everyone for reading .
This was a blast .
I do n't really update this blog anymore , but you can catch up with me on
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. housing crisis produced its first high - profile Wall Street arrests on Thursday , while the Bush administration called for broadening the Federal Reserve ’s powers over investment banks and said it has charged hundreds of people in a mortgage fraud probe .
At the same time , the White House issued a surprise veto threat against a Senate bill aimed at preventing hundreds of thousands of foreclosures .
The threat signaled more partisan warfare on Capitol Hill as homeowners struggle .
Two former managers for Bear Stearns Cos Inc. , itself a recent victim of bad bets on mortgage securities , were arrested and indicted on securities fraud charges in New York in connection with the $ 1.4 billion collapse of two hedge funds .
Ralph Cioffi , 52 , and Matthew Tannin , 46 , each pleaded not guilty .
In a scene reminiscent of Enron - era scandals , the men surrendered to officials and were paraded in handcuffs in front of onlookers en route to their arraignment on Thursday .
The two were charged with defrauding investors by concealing problems that led last year to the disintegration of the two hedge funds .
That event raised fears about risky subprime mortgages and helped usher in a global credit crunch that governments around the world are still sorting out .
With falling home prices and rising foreclosures , the U.S. Justice Department said it charged more than 400 people in a 3 - 1/2 - month , national probe .
Dubbed “ Operation Malicious Mortgage , ” it involved $ 1 billion in losses and 144 cases , mostly of lending fraud and foreclosure and bankruptcy scams .
The department ’s get - tough display came amid rising fears the housing slump is pushing the economy into recession -- an issue playing a prominent role in the presidential race .
Both contenders -- Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain -- are making economic recovery central to their campaigns .
“ No one can predict when the fiscal chaos in housing will end , but it does n’t look like we will be done any time soon , ” said David Abromowitz , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a think tank in Washington .
“ Trillions of dollars in lost family home equity ... has been wiped out for many families in just a short time .
We would expect this to impact lives and put a drag on the economy well past the day when foreclosures slow and prices stop falling . ”
FED EXPANSION URGED
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday urged broad new powers for the Federal Reserve over investment banks , following actions taken by the U.S. central bank in March that changed its relationship with Wall Street .
In March , the Fed helped broker a takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co and guaranteed a $ 29 billion loan to facilitate the deal out of concern a Bear Stearns bankruptcy could trigger a financial panic .

It was the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s that the Fed , which regulates commercial banks , had stepped in to rescue a nondepository institution .
The Fed also set up a special credit line to make emergency loans to major investment banks in an effort to ease credit market strains .
In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday , Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox said decisions must be made on whether and how long to maintain the emergency lending program , scheduled to expire this fall .
Another SEC official told a congressional panel on Thursday that the investor protection agency and the Fed have nearly completed a formal agreement to oversee investment banks until Congress can set up a permanent system through legislation .

CONGRESS DEBATES
It looked unlikely that Congress would tackle such complex structural issues this year , given the difficulties it was having agreeing on legislation to help homeowners .
The White House issued a surprise veto threat against a Senate bill that would , like a similar bill already passed by the House of Representatives , create a new fund to underwrite up to $ 300 billion of failing home loans .
It would also offer billions of dollars in emergency housing relief .
Proponents say the bill could save 400,000 homeowners from foreclosure .
But the Bush administration House objected to a provision that would give state and local governments money to buy and fix foreclosed properties .
Congressional leaders were trying to hammer out a final bill and send it to President George W. Bush before lawmakers leave town at the end of next week for the July 4 holiday .
Some House Republicans also threatened to stall a final version of the housing bill , demanding more information about preferential mortgage terms given to two Democratic senators by Countrywide Financial Corp .
“ Given the questions around Countrywide , preferential loans need to be investigated , ” House Republican leader John Boehner told reporters .
“ To think that we ’re going to move a housing bill with these questions looming I think is irresponsible . ”
As a junior - level sysadmin at his university , Alcari had gotten used to frantic , middle - of - the - night support calls .
Whether it was a mail proxy server freezing up , a replication process getting out of sync , or some application deadlocking , Alcari 's solution was almost always the same : reboot the problem server .
On a recent 4:00 AM emergency call , however , the situation was a bit more dire .
" Ummm , " the student working the graveyard shift at the helpdesk started , " I think the network is down .
I 'm getting calls from everyone , everywhere .
Can you , like , check into this .
Now ? "
Alcari fired up his laptop and noticed that his connection to the university was not responding .
He could n't even ping the school 's home page .
Worst case scenario , he figured , the network equipment had taken a dive , and he'd have to replace a router or two .
It certainly was n't the best way to spend a Monday morning .
However , as he drove towards the university 's utility building , he realized that he may have underestimated the source of the problem .
His first clue was the small motorcade of police cruisers that whizzed by him .
The second was when he almost got run off the road by a giant firetruck .
But it all really sunk in when he noticed that they were all headed towards the same place he was : the smoldering remains of the utility building .
Alcari parked his car and navigated under a few lines of red and yellow police tape towards the center of the circus .
By the time he made his way through , most of the excitement had died down , as the firemen were wrapping up their hoses and making sure no fiery embers remained .
Alcari found his way towards an official .
" Well , " the uniformed officer responded , " the good news is that no one was hurt .
As for what happened ... so far as we can tell , an acetylene cylinder must have tipped over , rolled across the floor , and blocked a heat register .
That woulda caused it to decompose , explode , and , as you can guess , cause all the dozen or so acetylene cylinders to do the same .
This is why we always chain up cylinders ! "
As Alcari waited for the emergency crew to finish , he spotted a group of very sleepy coworkers walking towards the scene and met up with them to chat .
" I 'm thinking , " one of the techs said , " it 's gotta just be a power outage ... you know , a few cut wires from the blast .
There are like , four concrete walls between gas storage and the data center . "
" Yeah , " another tech responded with a gleam of hope , " explosions always take the easiest path , which woulda been the outside wall .
We 'll just have to babysit the power guys when then come in for repairs . "
Yet another tech jumped in , " you know , we could probably even run the whole show if we can get another back - up generator . "
Alcari was optimistic , too .
They were all certain they'd have things up and running before day break .
Within the hour , the fire marshal declared the building " structurally sound " and let Alcari and the team inside to look around .
It was n't a pretty sight :
As soon as they walked into The Server Room That Was , everyone 's hopes immediately faded .
The sight of molten cables , dripping plastic , and shards of concrete lodged into warped server racks was eclipsed only by the putrid smell of burnt electronics .
It was kind of like that power supply we 've all sniffed after burning out , but infinitely worse .
Sitting in the center of the former data center was the remains of The Beast : the university 's core server that housed email , web , and several other critical functions .
The small , metal plate reading " Core Server - Do Not Touch " was about all that was left intact .
Everyone was completely bummed out .
" Wait a minute , guys , " one of the techs lit up , " I know for a fact we set up a Secondary Server just in case ... well , this happened . "
" That 's great ! "
Alcari remarked , once again hopeful that he might get some sleep today , " where 's it located ?
The Administrative building ? "
One grim - faced coworker cleared his throat , and walked over to the remains of a less - fortunate metal shelf .
He brushed off some soot from a small , metal plate .
It read " Secondary Server - Do Not Touch . "
Even though the market is once again enjoying a delusion sandwich covered in toxic mortgage mustard , the reality on the ground continues to become grimmer .
Wachovia , one of the nation ’s largest banks announced an $ 8.9 billion quarterly loss and that they ’ll be slashing over 6,000 from their workforce .
Oh , and the dividend is getting slashed as well .
So what happens ?
The market of course pushes the stock up by 27 % !
American Express , the uber credit card company also announced problems but the market is believing that the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
Treasury have some mythical powers to create money out of thin air .
They do only if you own an investment bank .
Yet back in the trenches of reality , Americans are feeling the massive pinch of the world ’s biggest housing bubble being pricked by the sharpest needle of all , imploding debt .
That is no hyperbole .
In no time in our civilized history have we seen such speculation on a global scale stemming from real estate .
California is the poster boy of this housing bubble .
You would think that the market would be punishing lenders even harder who have created and own such financially destructive loans yet many see this as a time to jump in .
Just look at the markets .
Tread these waters at your own peril .
Today , the California foreclosure numbers for the second quarter were released and they are not a pretty site .
First , let us take a look at the first sign of future wealth destruction , the notice of default :
As you can see from the chart , notice of defaults have gone sky high in that past few quarters .
We went from a relatively mild 2006 , to a quickly deteriorating 2007 , to the current record breaking problems in 2008 .
The reason notice of defaults are so important for future predictions is that these are homes that have yet to be taken back by lenders .
These are early signs of trouble .
What this means is lenders in the upcoming months better gear up for a tsunami of REOs .
We already know that the short - sale option has been a marginal joke in California .
Many are so deeply in negative territory that no lender would go for a short - sale and rather would take a foreclosure .
They have too many problems trying to stay solvent and avoiding their own foreclosure ala IndyMac Bank .
The vast divide between lenders and how loan modifications are being handled is an utter joke .
There is no standard .
Some lenders are willing to work with you while others are doing absolutely nothing in the area of loan modifications .
They are all holding their breath and preparing their turd bucket of mortgages ready for release into the belly of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Bank of America who recently acquired toxic mortgage producer Countrywide recently alluded to the fact that they may not be backing up Countrywide debt :
“ ( Global Trend Analysis ) Bank of America Corp. , the second - biggest U.S. bank , said it may not guarantee $ 38.1 billion of Countrywide Financial Corp .
’s debt after taking over the mortgage lender , increasing the likelihood of a default .
“ There is no assurance that any such debt would be redeemed , assumed or guaranteed , ” the bank said in an April 30 regulatory filing , adding that no decision has been reached .
Investors had grown more optimistic the bank would back Countrywide debt .
Ratings firm Standard & Poor ’s cut the mortgage - lender ’s debt to junk today after saying it would raise the grade earlier this week . ”
They basically are doing a “ it was n’t me ” on the market .
After all , would you back up Countrywide ’s toxic debt ?
Last quarter , there was an all time record of 121,341 notice of defaults filed in California .
This is incredible .
Only 3 years ago , the number was 12,408 for the second quarter of 2005 .
That is a ten - fold jump in 3 years !
Yet the more distressing analysis is when we look at the notice of defaults and also combine the actual foreclosures that occurred in the second quarter :
We are now in uncharted waters .
The notice of default numbers may look like they are plateauing but this is like arguing whether you are going to jump out of a 100 story or 102 story building .
The number of foreclosures in the second quarter hit a stunning 63,031 .
If you look closely at the chart , even in 2006 many of the notice of defaults where resolved without a foreclosure actually taking place .
Well of course this occurred because the massive speculation allowed those who over paid to sell to someone who over paid even more .
“ ( DQNews )
Of the homeowners in default , an estimated 22 percent emerge from the foreclosure process by bringing their payments current , refinancing , or selling the home and paying off what they owe .
A year ago it was about 52 percent .
The increased portion of homes lost to foreclosure reflects the slow real estate market , as well as the number of homes bought during the height of the market with multiple - loan financing , which makes ‘ work - outs ’ difficult . ”
This is not good and only reinforces the obvious which the overall market is ignoring at the moment .
What this tells us is 78 percent of these notice of defaults will end up in foreclosure .
Now the precipitous decline in prices is ensuring that many of those 121,341 notice of defaults will further add REO inventory for the remainder of the year and cause future losses to these banks and lenders .
Now how is this going to be healthy for the market ?
If anything , it assures us that prices will be falling for the remainder of the year and will put a vast amount of inventory on the market during the worst selling times which are the fall and winter .
This combined with the $ 300 billion in option ARM loans will be a destructive combination .
We have yet to see the massive recasts in the pay Option ARM market .
You can do the math and any lenders with large exposure in California are going to get hammered .
Paulson saying we are months away from a bottom is absurd .
Senator Jim Bunning was right when he called him out and stated that Paulson will be out in a few months , but the rest of us will be here to deal with any of the consequences of hasty actions .
The bottom is in … but for Paulson ’s career .
We have just cut the umbilical cord of reality from Wall Street .
Look at the action with WaMu announcing a $ 3.3 billion loss :
“ SEATTLE — Washington Mutual says it swung to a loss in the second quarter as it increased to more than $ 8 billion its reserve to cover sour loans .
For the April - to - June period , the Seattle - based bank says it lost $ 3.33 billion , or $ 6.58 per share , which compares with a profit of $ 830 million , or 92 cents per share in the year - ago period .
Results include a previously disclosed , one - time reduction of $ 3.24 per share related to the company ’s capital raising in April .
Thomson Financial says analysts , on average , were expecting a loss of $ 1.05 per share .
The bank says it increased its loan loss reserves by $ 3.74 billion to $ 8.46 billion during the quarter , as it continues to face mounting losses stemming from bad mortgages . ”
Shares of WaMu went up and down in after hours trading as if there really is any doubt about the data .
Not only did WaMu miss their target , they missed it by multiple times !
Bwahahaha !
And the freaking stock barely moves .
Do you know where most of WaMu ’s loans are ?
In California .
Just let the above charts sink in with their vivid colors and try to take a guess what is going to happen .
They ’re going to need all those loss reserves for the army of Real Homes of Genius they have in their portfolio .
Companies should just announce a $ 1 trillion dollar loss and you ’ll see their stock rally by 50 % .
Apparently bad news is now good .
Hello George Orwell !
What we are seeing on main street is not being reflected by what is occurring in the stock market , which should at least reflect what is going on in the real world ( aka , look at the above charts ) .
Yet what do we expect from a government that tells us we are not in a recession , unemployment is not bad , and inflation is contained ?
Their panacea of course is drilling for oil we wo n’t see for at least 5 years !
I did n’t realize subprime mortgages ran on 89 - octane .
All you need to do to verify this reality is take a trip to your local grocery store , fill up your tank of gas , send your kid to college , look at your mortgage , and try booking a trip out of the country and you ’ll quickly realize that something is rotten in Denmark .
Let us take a look at another data point that shows us how far we are from a bottom here in California :
The above is a look at subprime loans in the state .
As you can see , there are still plenty out there to cause damage but take a look at the Alt - A products which most pay Option ARMs fall under :
And this should make you feel warm and fuzzy all around .
The Congressional Budget Office came out saying that the rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would cost approximately $ 25 billion but no one really knows how much .
Heck , WaMu and Wachovia combined dished out losses of $ 12.2 billion in one quarter and they are peanuts to the issues confronting Fannie and Freddie .
Yet they are also seeking in the legislation to increase the public debt limit by a stunning $ 800 billion from $ 9.8 trillion to $ 10.6 trillion :
“ ( WSJ ) The $ 25 billion cost estimate from the CBO for the rescue plan was downplayed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers .
“ Everyone knows it ’s just a wild guess , ” said Sen. Jim DeMint , ( R. , S.C. ) .
He called the plan a “ huge gamble , ” but added that , “ it ’s kind of : Guarantee a little now or pay a whole lot later . ”
Lawmakers plan to raise the public - debt limit as part of the legislation to $ 10.6 trillion from $ 9.8 trillion .
Congress must vote to increase the limit to account for additional borrowing , something it is loath to do , although it would have had to take that step this year even without the rescue plan for Fannie and Freddie , Democratic aides said . ”
This is flat out absurd !
What a disgrace .
You need to get in contact with your Congressperson or Senator and say you will not stand for this absurdity :
Find your respresentative
Find your Senator
Give Senator Jim Bunning some support to filibuster this piece of toxic legislation
Can you see what is happening ?
You ’ll also see in the legislation that they are trying to raise caps to $ 625,000 which of course will make it convenient to off load this crappy Alt - A California mortgage junk onto the public debt .
If you needed any more evidence that Washington is trying to offload this entire mess on the U.S. taxpayer , you need not look any further than this piece of legislation .
What a shame .
There are more Alt - A loans in California and these actually have a higher concentration of no -doc loans !
Can you take a wild guess how these are going to do now that the state has a median price of $ 328,000 , down 31.5 % from the peak price of $ 479,000 ?
If you look to Washington or Wall Street for your answer , do n’t expect one that reflects the reality on the ground .
We are living in two separate universes here .
If you would have bought a median priced home in California last year at the peak , you would now be down $ 151,000 .
Is this really a reason for a rally especially in lenders that fed into that speculation that is now clearly bursting with an onslaught of foreclosures ?

Start the bank run , everyone .
America ’s financial leaders have sounded the recession alarm , and judging by their solemn words the economy is rapidly descending into the Greater Depression .
If drastic and immediate action is n’t taken , it sounds like in a year we ’ll all be riding the rails from shantytown to shantytown , seasoning boiled leather soup with ketchup as we pray for the next available spot in the Weedpatch Camp .
Before everyone adopts a Steinbeck character as a recession persona , it ’d be wise to step back and think about what ’s really wrong with the economy .
It ’s pretty much accepted that the current downturn is rooted in overvalued real estate and easy credit , exacerbated by years of questionable deals on Wall Street and profligate spending in Washington .
These sound like the problems of a billionaire CEO .
I ’m not a real estate mogul , venture capitalist or financier who thrives on risk , so it ’s hard to feel any kind of solidarity with the wealthy individuals charged with diagnosing and curing our economic malaise .
Those titans created this mess , but they want the help of us commoners to dig out of it .
In May most Americans will be getting a big fat check for at least three hundred large , courtesy of the government .
According to both Republicans and Democrats , our patriotic duty is to stimulate the economy by spending this cash .
Since consumer spending ( an insulting euphemism for people buying lots of crap ) makes up approximately two thirds of our economy , we can kick start the sputtering engine through a collective shopping spree .
In reality Wall Street and their Washington are playing us for suckers .
Congress has found a rare common purpose in attempting to convince Americans that they can conjure money out of thin air .
We ’re supposed to believe that the government is giving us a gift ; it would be a neat trick if it worked , but the $ 147 billion stimulus package is coming straight out of our future earnings .
Our elected officials are tacking this onto Uncle Sam ’s debt and acting like they found the money in an old coat .
So let me get this straight , government .
You ’re going to give me $ 300 that ’ll have to be paid back with interest so I can go out and buy a Wii ?
Thanks , but I already have a credit card .
When I get my check I ’m going to pay down the Visa and those student loans you do n’t subsidize enough .
I guess I ’m not a good American , but taking care of personal debt is more important to me then helping Wal - Mart meet their third quarter earnings projections .
Competitive capitalist economies typically go through cycles .
Corporations , as well as small business and government itself , need to feel the pain in order for that good old - fashioned American ingenuity to kick in .
Maybe I missed something during college , but I was taught that top - down centralized management of the economy in the pursuit of uninterrupted , uniform economic growth is , well , kind of naïve and idealistic .
At least that ’s what we said when the Soviets tried it .
Without a doubt the near future is going to be hard .
Real estate values are still falling .
Credit is all over the map .
Unemployment is rising .
But as serious as these problems are , they ’re not that exceptional over the long run .
A recession happens once a decade or so and we generally recover quickly enough to avoid the economic dark ages .
Sure , the value of the dollar is down .
While that ’s bad news for anyone dreaming of Eurorail passes and hash brownies in Amsterdam , a cheaper dollar makes it easier for Americans to make stuff and sell it to the rest of the world .
Considering how much we rely upon gorging our consumer desires to drive our bloated economy , maybe we need to go through a transition where we end up producing goods instead of buying tainted ones from East Asia .
It feels strange to be saying this as a 24 - year - old , but we need to toughen up and keep things in perspective .
The country ’s been through many economic slumps before and we always emerge better off for it .
We learn from our mistakes , adjust our expenditure of resources , and start growing again .
That ’s supposed to be the good thing about capitalism .
The corrupt version of capitalism that relies on hocus pocus to put $ 300 in our pockets is just cushioning the fall for those who are already rich .
For most of us , here ’s where the economic pinch really hurts .
The price of gas is shooting up .
Everything at the grocery store is more expensive .
College costs as much per year as a new car .
People are losing their homes .
And the only thing we can do to keep up is chase more debt down the rabbit hole .
These reflect fundamental problems of a lazy economy quixotically trying to keep itself on cruise control , and they are not problems that an extra $ 300 can solve .
I do n’t need new stuff .
My discretionary income is already running pretty thin and I ’m spending plenty of it .
When I get that check there ’s no way I ’m cashing it in on chintzy Chinese junk from big box stores , and my economic policy overlords need to be okay with that .
If they really want to spend $ 147 billion on my behalf , here ’s a wish list : fix old bridges , give more people healthcare , build more trains , and get ready for the next Katrina .
Washington and Wall Street want us to act as a defibrillator for the compulsively consumptive heart of our economy .
No thanks .
A slight decline in the investment portfolios of the obscenely rich is not exactly a country on life support .
I ’ll keep working on my Tom Joad impression in the meantime .
This short story is taken from Riffing on Strings ( Scriblerus , 2008 ) and is reproduced with kind permission of the publishers .
Not long after the Fourth String Theory Revolution , the Institute of Higher Dimensions made plans to house the exponentially - growing collection of string theory papers in a new library .
At the insistence of the President of the Institute , who specializes in Kaluza - Klein particles , which travel primarily in other dimensions , the Library Task Force held a competition for the design of the much - anticipated structure .
String theorists around the world , unable to keep up with their rapidly changing field , applauded the idea and submitted as many proposals as the leading architects .
A sampling of the submitted suggestions gives some flavor of the proposals :
it should be symmetrical , “ for obvious reasons ; ”
it should be modular to allow for expansion ;
it should be tall enough to have a clear view of the surrounding landscape ;
a virtual library would suffice , perhaps in the form of a café that ’s open twenty - four hours for string theorists to converse ;
all dimensions of the library should be built in integer multiples of the Planck length ;
it should be holographic and impervious to hypothetical particles like tachyons ;
it should be in the shape of a six - dimensional Calabi - Yau manifold ;
it should be beautiful , “ like the theory . ”
Many proposals argued that given the unwieldy amount of literature , the only viable proposals were those that included compactification of manuscripts and storage in higher dimensions .
Advertisement
After the deadline , the Library Task Force ( LTF ) whittled down the enormous number of proposals by dividing them into three categories :
realistic ;
imaginable ;
promising .
Proposals that could not be categorized were eliminated .
Proposals that fell into multiple categories were ranked more highly and in this way , the winning entry was to be chosen .
However , when the LTF discovered that the number of official proposals , 857 , was a prime number , they decided instead to honor all proposals .
Rather than constructing a building of astonishing complexity , which suited the potential contractors because of the ongoing slump in the construction sector , the LTF reasoned that it was simply a matter of scaling .
The main collection of the library will be housed in a series of pairs of five - story circular towers connected by an infinite hallway .
This tower duality ( linked at the first , third , and fifth floors ) will contain coupled versions of string theory scrolls ( see below ) and enable the exploration of the theory ’s various symmetries .
While there has been some concern about how the length of the hallway will affect the time it takes to retrieve individual string theory manuscripts , it is expected that because of the storage benefits this difficulty will eventually be overcome through the creation and duplication of virtual catalogues , and building structures like tunnels and “ worldtubes ” or , simply , additional entrances .
Construction of the library began immediately after this decision .
A chain link fence went up around the Institute ’s under - used athletic center , a wrecking ball was brought in , earth was moved , and amid the sounds of heavy machinery , the library evolved from imaginary to reality .
With the first stage of construction underway , the LTF shifted its attention to the problem of organizing the library holdings .
Because of the nature of string theory , which rewards imaginative multi-dimensional thinking , it was decided that new papers and preprints would be reduced in size and transferred onto scrolls so that as many as six papers could be scanned at once as the scroll was unfurled .
Comparison to the great Library of Alexandria was inevitable and intentional .
All nine LTF members agreed on the idea of the scrolls , but how should they be catalogued ?
Again , several possibilities were considered :
randomly ;
alphabetically by subject or first author ;
chronologically by submission date ;
hierarchically , in terms of either degree of difficulty or energy scale of the paper ’s fundamental axioms ;
categorically , using mappings and arrows ( known respectively as “ functors ” and “ morphisms ” ) .
Though the first four possibilities had their merits , the LTF agreed that an organization based on category theory , recently developed by mathematicians , would provide maximum usefulness for the library ’s collection .
In particular , the functors and morphisms , like conceptual facilitators , would allow unforeseen connections to be made between the different papers and possibly lead to novel theoretical developments whose predictions could one day be within reach of today ’s ( or tomorrow ’s ) particle accelerators .
Having put the organization of the collection on solid footing , the LTF next hired its head librarian , Richard Feynman ( selected from 75 applicants ) , formerly the manager of the Institute of Higher Dimensions reading room .
In short order , Feynman put his stamp on the position through a series of high - level purchases , including several other libraries .
Rumors abound that The Einstein Papers Project , in Pasadena , California , the Stanford library , and all thirty - seven math and physics libraries of the University of California system would be moved to the recently opened library .
Funding for these purchases is thought to be coming from government grants , anonymous private donors , and the first fifty years of late fees of library materials .
Other known purchases include first editions of the works of Lewis Carroll , Edwin Abbott ’s Flatland , the complete works of Italo Calvino , Jorge Luis Borges , Stanislaw Lem and the Oulipo writers .
Several modern art museum curators have also reported interest in their collections of René Magritte , M. C. Escher and the entire Cubist oeuvre .
It is noted that decorating the walls of an infinite hallway is a daunting task .
Though the LTF claims that “ great progress ” has been made in the construction of the library , no one seems to know how far it is from completion , nor is anyone willing to make a prediction of when it will be fully operational .
Despite the ongoing construction ( and delays due to scaling problems ) , the construction fence , whose perimeter had been extended outwards on a near monthly basis , has now been peeled back and the dictum above the great - arched entranceway is clearly visible : “ Let None But Geometers Enter Here . ”
Researchers have begun to peruse the curved shelves within the circular towers , borrow materials , collide with each other while pacing up and down the infinite hallway deep in thought , and even write equation - graffiti in the bathrooms .
As expected , the most popular place is the Calabi - Yau Café , where impromptu symposia are held during its round - the - clock open hours .
Aware that the library has already grown large enough that parts of its collection may never be explored , Feynman shrugged , “ String theory is finally getting the home it deserves . ”

I ’m sure I ’m not the first to suggest this , but here goes .
Ever since somebody first thought of applying the Model - View - Controller paradigm to the web , we ’ve had this :
The View is a conflation of HTML and JavaScript .
JavaScript is an afterthought , a gimmick to make pages “ dynamic . ”
All the real action is in the Controller , which talks to the database , processes the internal application logic , and renders templates before sending complete pages back to the client .
But what if we implement the Controller entirely in JavaScript ?
Now we can put the Controller on the client , and build a RESTful HTTP interface to communicate with the database .
Obviously there are many issues to consider .
First and foremost is making sure that rogue clients cannot do anything to the database they ’re not supposed to .
But that ’s a manageable problem — Amazon S3 is a good example .
Apps that run entirely in the client can even be made more secure than their server - based counterparts , because encryption can be implemented entirely in the client , so that the server never sees the unencrypted data .
( Clipperz , an password - storage service , calls this a zero - knowledge web app . )
There are some interesting possibilities .
For example , the entire application , including the current state of the model , can be downloaded as a single web page for off - line use .
( Clipperz supports this . )
Also , the same application could connect to multiple data sources .
And as with any RESTful architecture , back - end scaling is relatively easy .
Update July 10 , 2008 : I ’m always amazed when one of my posts show up on Reddit .
Maybe it was the diagrams .
In any case , thanks to everyone who sent in comments .
A couple responses :
Yes , in a sense I ’ve described Ajax .
But most Ajax - related code around the web these days is still in the “ dynamic view ” mode rather than the “ client - side controller ” mode .
I like Sun ’s MVC diagram in which the View takes an active role in rendering the model rather than being just a template .
It ’s actually quite similar to what I ’m suggesting here .
Some MVC frameworks , such as Ruby on Rails , insist that logic in the View is bad , but then they include all these Ajax view helpers , so it ’s a bit of a mixed message .
I ’m not insisting that all business logic be implemented client - side .
Rather , I ’m assuming some kind of “ smart ” database , with a RESTful front - end , that ’s capable of containing business logic .
Back in the day , these were SQL stored procedures .
Now it ’s probably something like CouchDB .
Yes , this design is bad for search engines , bookmarks , and deep linking .
But there are plenty of cases where those do n’t matter .
Look at Google Mail , for example .
It basically follows the design I ’ve laid out here : the entire app is one HTML page ( or a very few pages ) with behavior implemented in client - side JavaScript .
Update August 7 , 2008 : This is an example of the code - on - demand style described in Roy Fielding ’s REST thesis .

Isaac Newton laid the blueprints for his three laws of motion , still recited by physics students , in 1666 .
When little baby Isaac was born in a Lilliputian English village , premature and small enough to fit into a quart pot , he was n't expected to survive .
To the probable dismay of some befuddled calculus and physics students the world over , Isaac Newton did n't just live , he grew up and lived long enough to become the single - most influential scientist of the 17th - century .
Newton 's wide range of discoveries , from his theories of optics to his groundbreaking work on the laws of motion and gravity , formed the basis for modern physics .
The true genius of his work , experts think , is how he ultimately took those theories and applied them to the universe at large , explaining the motions of the Sun and planets in a way that had never been done before .
Laws born in the plague
The common image of Isaac Newton is that of a white - haired scientist crouched at the base of a tree .
Upon getting bumped on the head by a falling apple , Newton airily dreams up the laws of gravity and the rest , as they say , is history .
There is probably only a bit of truth to the apple legend , historians say , but Newton was already in the midst of some very important discoveries before that alleged fruit incident at Cambridge University .
Isaac Newton was born in 1642 , the year of Galileo 's death , and from a young age showed interest in formal education — not a given in that era — rather than farming .
When the black plague closed Cambridge University , where he was a student , for two years starting in 1665 , he spent the long months locked up at home studying complex mathematics , physics and optics .
It was during this fruitful time that Newton , with the help of a crystal prism , became the first to discover that white light is made up a spectrum of colors .
He also developed the concept of infinite - series calculus , the kind of scary math studied today by engineering and statistics scholars .
By 1666 , Newton had even laid the blueprints for his three laws of motion , still recited by physics students everywhere :
An object will remain in a state of inertia unless acted upon by force .
The relationship between acceleration and applied force is F=ma .
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
What Newton did n't understand up to that point , and would spend the next two decades studying , was how those laws of motion related to the Earth , Moon and Sun – a concept he called " gravity . "
Simply explaining the universe
Urged on and funded by astronomer Edmond Halley , who was also at Cambridge observing the path of a now - famous comet , Newton dove into the study of gravitational force in the 1670s and ' 80s .
The result of Newton 's research was his seminal work published in 1687 , the Principia , considered by many as the greatest science book ever written .
Across the pages of the Principia , Newton breaks down the workings of the solar system into " ' simple " ' equations , explaining away the nature of planetary orbits and the pull between heavenly bodies .
In describing why the Moon orbits the Earth and not vice - versa ( it 's because the Earth is so much heavier ) , the book literally changed the way people saw the universe .
BMW 's GINA concept car today got us to thinking about concept cars in general .
They exist at the inflection point where our dreams and technology meet .
Whether we yearn for nuclear power , extreme performance or phallic shapes , we have the concept car to thank for pointing us toward the uncertain future .
And while not all concept cars see the light of day , the automotive wishes of yesterday often influence the driving realities of today .
With the help of some of our readers , we 've put together a top ten list of what we believe are the most insane concept cars ever created .
We 'll leave it to you to pick the craziest in the poll below .

Though perhaps tame when compared to today 's cars , these Bertone - penned concept cars represented a revolution in the early 1950's .
The cars were designed for Alfa Romeo with the goal of creating extremely aerodynamic cars that could handle the speeds engineers were creating , eventually achieving a wind resistance better than today 's Porsches or Corvettes .
They 're also , as 68 Stang is right to recognize , completely gorgeous .

The crash site was proving difficult to access , the US Forest Service said
Nine people are missing , feared dead , after a helicopter carrying firefighters crashed at the site of a forest fire in northern California .
The helicopter went down on Tuesday night in a remote area about 35 miles ( 56 km ) north - west of Redding .
The cause of the crash of the Sikorsky S - 61 was not immediately known .
The helicopter was carrying 11 firefighters and two flight crew .
Three firefighters and a crew member are being treated in hospital for burns .
Two are said to be in a critical condition and two are seriously ill .
Firefighting contractor Grayback Forestry , which had employed the crew , named two of the injured men as Michael Brown , 20 , and Jonathan Frohreich , 18 .
Safe return
Ian Gregor , spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration , said the helicopter was destroyed in the crash .
He added that the Trinity County Sheriff 's Department was leading the search for victims .
Janet Rabuck of the US Forest Service said that the area was very difficult to access .
" It 's very remote , very steep and heavily forested , " she told the AP news agency .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said it was " a tragic day for firefighters everywhere " .
He added : " The people of California are profoundly aware of the tremendous sacrifices that these heroes and their families make day in and day out to keep us safe . "
The firefighters had been tackling a blaze that was covering 27 sq miles ( 70sq km ) of the Shasta - Trinity National Forest .
They had been at the north side of a blaze burning across the national forest , part of a series of fires which crews have mostly managed to contain .
In June , a state of emergency was declared in California after fires mostly sparked by lightning in dry wilderness areas burnt more than 500 sq miles ( 1,400 sq km ) .
A wildfire burning near Yosemite National Park in California destroyed 12 houses during July .
Another firefighter died after being hit by a falling tree while tackling a blaze in the area .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who has refused since taking power in the House to let impeachment go anywhere in that body , recently said on " The View " that " If somebody had a crime that the president had committed , that would be a different story . ”
All she would have had to do was watch a little of last Friday 's hearing on impeachment in the hearing room of the House Judiciary Committee - - a hearing she herself helped to arrange .
The dramatic and long delayed session chaired by Judiciary Chair John Conyers ( D - MI ) was both a staged farce , and at the same time , a powerful demonstration of the power of a grassroots movement in defense of the Constitution .
It was at once both testimony to the cowardice and self - inflicted impotence of Congress and of the Democratic Party that technically controls that body , and to the enormity of the damage that has been wrought to the nation ’s democracy by two aspiring tyrants in the White House .

Chimps discover Facebook to find new friends !
Media Advisory : June 06 , 2008
A 20 - year - old male chimpanzee named Albert was the first ape to join Face book , the largest online social network .
Soon after Albert joined , three other chimps named Mr. Jones , Sheena , and Britney followed .
Face book must be great : over 40 million humans and four chimps can't all be wrong !
Scientists from The University of Northern Oregon have spent the last two years training Albert and his comrades , who all belong to the Pan troglodytes species , to acquire language skills necessary for their online social life .
With the help of specially designed software that recognizes sign language ( ASL ) , and a chimp proof adapted touch screen , these leading scientists recently announced that the four apes can communicate using more than 1000 symbols , adapted to the most popular features of the online social network .
They can chat online with their best friends from around the world , write text messages and even upload their favorite profile pictures .
Alberts gang has become very popular among Face book 's users .
Although sociologists and anthropologists have used social networks as empirical research tools , Face book will now provide a new platform for biologists to observe the chimpanzees Â´ social skills , claims Chief Researcher Dr. John F. Marlowe .
Previous studies have revealed that chimpanzees and humans use the same brain region to communicate verbally and non-verbally .
The neurobiological connection between chimps and humans was realized after years of observing chimps at the National Primate Research Center in Atlanta ,

The new one truly is painful .
Note how a negative ad is constructed .
There is a cover : in this case an argument about Obama 's pledge to raise taxes .
That argument is dishonest as Ambers explains :
It claims that Barack Obama voted to raise taxes on folks earning more than $ 42,000 a year .
Technically , the claim stands up -- Obama voted for a budget resolution that would have restored the 25 % tax bracket to 28 % , which , in theory , might mean more taxes paid by those earning as little as $ 42,000 .
But Budget resolutions are n't bills ; they 're broad targets ... so the McCain folks are having a little fun here .
A little fun ?
Obama is n't proposing to raise taxes on people earning $ 42,000 a year , as the ad insinuates .
The ad is substantively sleazy .
But the tax issue is not what this ad is about .
The ad is designed to perpetuate the notion that Obama is a wealthy , pampered socialist elitist , while " we " are not .
When you look at McCain 's bio and Obama's , you begin to appreciate the chutzpah .
McCain was a child of immense privilege , a son and grandson of admirals , given a prized education at the Naval Academy which he threw away - a performance he now touts in his favor .
He dumped his first wife in favor of a fantastically wealthy heiress .
He has had more money for a longer time than Obama has ever dreamed of .
Obama , meanwhile , grew up on food stamps , was reared by a single mother and grandparents and by dint of sheer talent and hard work got to be the first black president of the Harvard Law Review .
He was given very little and made the most of it ; McCain was given so much and began his life , as he concedes , by taking it all for granted .
This ad alone - its dishonesty on so many levels , its appeal to class resentment and envy , its use of fear and personal demonization - is one reason the McCain campaign , like McCain himself , is now more Rove than Weaver .
If he keeps running ads like this one , he richly deserves to lose .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
" I hope you 're talking to me on a speakerphone , " Devra Davis barks at me when I call her on my cell phone .
" You 'd better not be holding that phone up to your head . "
Cell phones do emit radiation .
No one knows definitively whether it 's enough to worry about .
Indeed , I 'm not .
This is a good thing , because you do n't want to get into an argument with Davis on this subject .
She 's the director of the University of Pittsburgh 's Center for Environmental Oncology , and her group recently put out recommendations that we should be using a speakerphone or ear piece .
The report says children , who have thinner skulls and developing brains , should use cell phones only in case of emergency .
And heaven forbid anyone should carry a cell phone in a pocket or clipped to a belt .
" You 're just roasting your bone marrow , " Davis said .
Oh , boy .
Another thing to worry about .
Or maybe Davis is an alarmist .
It 's so hard to tell .
Although there are many large studies showing no connection between mobile phones and cancer , there are a few that do .
As Davis puts it , do you really want to play Russian roulette with your head ?
Explainer : Radiation fields and the brain »
But if you do buy the cellphones - cause - cancer argument , you have to figure out the best way to talk on a cell phone , seeing as how most of us can't live without them .
Should you use the wired headset that came with your phone ?
A Bluetooth earpiece ?
iReport.com : Does your kid have a cell phone ?
I embarked on a journey this past week to answer these questions and at many points have been very sorry I did .
This is the mother of all " the jury is still out " issues .
Cell phones have been wildly popular for only a matter of years , and it can take at least a decade for cancers to show up .
Studies contradict each other , and scientists bicker :
Some will tell you with great conviction that there 's nothing to worry about .
Others will tell you with equal conviction that an epidemic of brain tumors may be just around the corner .
The cell phone industry itself says " the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk . "
You can watch the experts go at it on " Larry King Live " » this week .
So what are we all to do until they figure it out ?
After enough interviews with physicists , engineers and doctors to make me want to stick my head in a microwave oven , one common line of reasoning emerged .
Cell phones do emit radiation .
No one knows definitively whether it 's enough to worry about .
Mobile phones meet federal safety limits , but if you 're still worried , there are some simple steps you can take to lower your exposure to radiation .
Watch more on limiting your risk »
1 . Use the speakerphone
This was , without question , the favorite alternative of the experts I talked to .
Nothing is near your head .
" Hold it away from a minimum of a few inches .
A foot or two is ideal , " said Magda Havas , an associate professor with the Institute for Health Studies at Trent University in Ontario , Canada .
Havas gives me a little math lesson .
Every inch you can get away from your body , the radiation reduces very quickly .
" Hold it out two inches , and the radiation drops by a factor of four .
Hold it out four inches , and it drops by a factor of 16 , " she says .
In other words , said Louis Slesin , editor of Microwave News , " every millimeter counts . "
2 . Use a wired headset with a ferrite bead
No , this is not a piece of jewelry .
A ferrite bead is a clip you put on the wire of a headset .
The concern is that the wire itself emits radiation into your ear .
The bead is designed to absorb the radiation so you do n't .
They 're inexpensive and available at stores or online .
These clips are a favorite of Slesin's .
" It 's the way to go , " he said .
Another fan : Lawrie Challis , physicist and former chair of the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme , a government panel in Britain .
" They did tests at the University of York and found that under even the worst conditions , if you use a ferrite bead , you can't even measure the radiation coming off the wire .
This common device kills the radiation . "
Of course , if the phone is in your pocket or clipped to your belt , all bets are off , because the phone itself will be radiating into your body .
So if you 're worried about radiation , keep the phone as far away as possible , and Challis adds to do your best to make sure the wire is n't touching your body .
3. Use a Bluetooth earpiece
A Bluetooth earpiece still has radiation , but it's at least 100 times less than the radiation you get when you hold a cell phone to your head , Havas says .
Our experts were split on which was better : a Bluetooth headset or a wired one .
Israeli government recommendations issued this week specifically suggest a wire ; Havas likes the Bluetooth .
But even she says not to wear it when you 're not talking ; it still sends out a signal .
" Bluetooth is only whispering radiation into your ear .
The problem is , some people wear it all the time , " she says .
" At the very least , switch it from ear to ear so you do n't have too much exposure on one side . "
Michael Foley , Ph.D. , executive director of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group , says Bluetooth earpieces radiate 200 times less energy than cell phones .
" There is no evidence that a Bluetooth headset has any adverse effects on its users , " he said .
4 . Use a " hollow tube " earpiece
It 's just like a regular wired earpiece , except the last six inches or so -- the part next to your ear -- is a hollow tube .
There 's no wire under the plastic .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
" You 're getting the sound through the air .
You 're not dependent on radiofrequency waves , " said Dr. David Carpenter , director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University of Albany .
Hollow tube earpieces can be purchased on several Web sites .
5 . Get a phone with less radiation
Phone radiation is measured in specific absorption rate , or SAR .
To look up the SAR for your phone , check this list on CNET.com .
You might think the experts mentioned above all use earpieces or a speakerphone .
Not so .
Several said they hold it right up to their heads because they use their cells so infrequently , they 're not worried about radiation .
" I use it maybe once or twice a week , no more than 10 minutes , " said Challis , the former head of the British committee that studied cell phones and radiation .
" I use a land line whenever I can . "
It 's the exposure , day after day , year after year , that matters .
As Challis , who 's retired , puts it , " If I were younger , I 'd take this much more seriously . "
CNN 's John Bonifield and Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report .
“ We stand on a great divide in the detection and study of exoplanets , ” says the Exoplanet Task Force on the arXiv today in describing their plan for finding another Earth orbiting another star .
On one side of this divide are the hundreds of known massive exoplanets , they say .
And on the other ” lies the possibility , as yet unrealized , of detecting and characterizing a true Earth analog–an “ Earth - like ” planet ” .
And guess what , the Exoplanet Task Force knows how to bridge this divide . ”
Their idea is to keep looking , using better telescopes .
And when you find one , build a better telescope to look even harder .
It ’s a strategy that ’s guaranteed to succeed , provided you ’re wearing a mask and a cape and call yourself the Exoplanet Task Force .
Let ’s face it , there ’s nothing you ca n’t do while wearing your underpants on the outside .
Good luck fellas .
We ’re all behind ya .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The good news : Mortgage giant Fannie Mae is taking steps to shore up its finances .
The bad news :
You 're going to pay for it when you take out a mortgage .
Fannie plays a central role in the market for home mortgages by purchasing loans , securitizing them and selling them to investors .
In announcing announcing a $ 2.3 billion loss on Friday , it also said it would make major changes that could have a significant effect on mortgage liquidity and pricing .
The company said it will increase its fees , stop buying certain high - risk loans and charge a higher risk premium for buying loans in the declining market .
" [ These actions ] have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody's Economy.com .
" Policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now they 're just hoping they do n't pull back . "
The increases were inevitable , according to Keith Gumbinger of HSH Associates , a publisher of mortgage loan information .
" The cost of mortgage credit is getting pushed higher by the issues in the marketplace , " he said .
" They can't reduce their market exposure and that means more expensive mortgages . "
Point taken !
Times are tough
Fannie increased fees for some loans by a quarter of a percentage point , based on borrowers ' credit scores and the amount of their down payments .
It will charge , for example , 1 % ( up from 0.75 % ) for a buyer with a credit score of 680 paying 20 % down .
And Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) doubled its " adverse market delivery charge " to 0.5 % .
That is an across - the - board fee assessed against every loan Fannie buys , according to a Fannie spokeswoman .
Fannie first instituted the charge this spring .
" It 's very negative , " said Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors .
" Any time there 's an additional imposition of fees in obtaining a mortgage , it knocks some potential buyers out of the market . "
Fannie 's smaller cousin , Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , which also announced a big loss this week , has been taking similar steps to shore up in finances and reduce its exposure to risky loans .
The additional fees imposed by Fannie will hit newcomers particularly hard , according to Yun .
First - time buyers are usually most on the margins and struggling to afford a home purchase .
The added fees will be passed on to borrowers and could mean quarter - point increases in interest rates .
Reducing the number of first - time buyers can have a domino effect on the market .
Existing homeowners looking to trade up to bigger , more expensive homes may postpone doing so because they can't sell their present home .
Bye - bye to Alt - A loans
Fannie will also eliminate buying Alt - A loans by the end of 2008 .
Alt - A loans , a category between prime and subprime , accounted for about 11 % of the company 's loans during the last years of the boom .
They have been used mostly by people who could n't or would n't document their incomes , their assets or both .
These buyers will find it harder to obtain financing once Fannie stops buying the loans .
According to Yun , however , the cutback in Alt - A will hurt people buying second homes to rent out or resell , rather than first time homeowners .
" These are people who often rely on their good credit to buy investment properties putting little or no money down , " he said .
But removing some of them from the market will decrease demand in a market already struggling with high inventory .
Fannie and Freddie , as private companies created and sponsored by the government , have to foster home ownership while satisfying their shareholders .
They have to maintain profitability or risk triggering a government rescue .
" They were created to provide liquidity in times of crisis , " said Yun .
" If they do n't do that , what 's the point of having Fannie and Freddie in the first place ? "
I Didn't Have Reconstruction , and I Think I Look Kinda Cute
Megan , 58 , chose not to have breast reconstruction because her cancer was aggressive and she did n’t want to be in and out of tests all the time , worrying about a recurrence .
She 's very happy about her decision and actually likes the way she looks without breasts .
@ Navin R Johnson : FreeBSD is not Linux , or even a modded version of such .

Where can you * legally * download a free build of OS X that is n't a beta ?

How is this legal ?
( CNN ) -- The U.S. should stop arresting responsible marijuana users , Rep. Barney Frank said Wednesday , announcing a proposal to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams , almost a quarter - pound , of the substance .
Rep. Barney Frank 's bill would radically curb federal penalties for personal marijuana use .
Current laws targeting marijuana users place undue burdens on law enforcement resources , punish ill Americans whose doctors have prescribed the substance and unfairly affect African - Americans , said Frank , flanked by legislators and representatives from advocacy groups .
" The vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government 's business , " Frank said on Capitol Hill .
" I do n't think it is the government 's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time . "
The Massachusetts Democrat and his supporters emphasized that only the use -- and not the abuse -- of marijuana would be decriminalized if the resolution resulted in legislation .
Watch Frank lay out the proposal »
The Drug Enforcement Administration says people charged with simple possession are rarely incarcerated .
The agency and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy have long opposed marijuana legalization , for medical purposes or otherwise .
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance , meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use , according to the drug control office .
" Smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science -- it is not medicine and it is not safe , " the DEA states on its Web site .
" Legalization of marijuana , no matter how it begins , will come at the expense of our children and public safety .
It will create dependency and treatment issues , and open the door to use of other drugs , impaired health , delinquent behavior , and drugged drivers . "
Allen St. Pierre , spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , likened Frank 's proposal -- co-sponsored by Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas -- to current laws dealing with alcohol consumption .
Alcohol use is permitted , and the government focuses its law enforcement efforts on those who abuse alcohol or drive under its influence , he said .
" We do not arrest and jail responsible alcohol drinkers , " he said .
St. Pierre said there are tens of millions of marijuana smokers in the United States , including himself , and hundreds of thousands are arrested each year for medical or personal use .
iReport.com :
Is it time to legalize pot ?
There have been 20 million marijuana - related arrests since 1965 , he said , and 11 million since 1990 , and " every 38 seconds , a marijuana smoker is arrested . "
Rob Kampia , director of the Marijuana Policy Project , said marijuana arrests outnumber arrests for " all violent crimes combined , " meaning police are spending inordinate amounts of time chasing nonviolent criminals .
" Ending arrests is the key to marijuana policy reform , " he said .
Reps .
William Lacy Clay , D - Missouri , and Barbara Lee , D - California , said that in addition to targeting nonviolent offenders , U.S. marijuana laws unfairly target African - Americans .
Clay said he did not condone drug use but opposes using tax dollars to pursue what he feels is an arcane holdover from " a phony war on drugs that is filling up our prisons , especially with people of color . "
Too many drug enforcement resources are being dedicated to incarcerating nonviolent drugs users , and not enough is being done to stop the trafficking of narcotics into the United States , he said .
Being arrested is not the American marijuana smoker 's only concern , said Bill Piper of the Drug Policy Alliance Network .
Those found guilty of marijuana use can lose their jobs , financial aid for college , their food stamp and welfare benefits , or their low - cost housing .
The U.S. stance on marijuana , Piper said , " is one of the most destructive criminal justice policies in America today . "
Calling the U.S. policy " inhumane " and " immoral , " Lee said she has many constituents who are harassed or arrested for using or cultivating marijuana for medical purposes .
California allows medical marijuana use , but the federal government does not , she explained .
House Resolution 5843 , titled the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults
Act of 2008 , would express support for " a very small number of individuals " suffering from chronic pain or illness to smoke marijuana with impunity .
According to NORML , marijuana can be used to treat a range of illnesses , including glaucoma , asthma , multiple sclerosis , HIV / AIDS and seizures .
Frank , who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee , said that about a dozen states have approved some degree of medical marijuana use and that the federal government should stop devoting resources to arresting people who are complying with their states ' laws .
In a shot at Republicans , Frank said it was strange that those who support limited government want to criminalize marijuana .
Asked whether the resolution 's passage would change his personal behavior , Frank quipped , " I do obey every law I vote for " but quickly said he did not use marijuana , nor does he encourage it .
" I smoke cigars .
I do n't think other people should do that .
If young people ask me , I would advise them not to do it , " he said .
If HR 5843 were passed , the House would support marijuana smokers possessing up to 100 grams -- about 3 ½ ounces -- of cannabis without being arrested .
It would also give its blessing to the " nonprofit transfer " of up to an ounce of marijuana .
The resolution would not address laws forbidding growing , importing or exporting marijuana , or selling it for profit .
The resolution also would not speak to state laws regarding marijuana use .

Texas To Build Wind Power Superhighway
July 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
We ’ve all heard of the Information Superhighway ; Now it ’s time to welcome the Wind Power Superhighway .
In what is purported to be the largest investment in clean , renewable energy in US history , Texas has been given preliminary approval for a $ 4.9 billion plan to build transmission lines to carry wind power from West Texas to urban areas such as Dallas .
Texas is already the national leader in wind power , but the new transmission lines will make sure wind energy is used to its fullest potential , since most of Texas ’ wind power is produced in windy West Texas .
The new plan wo n’t directly create new turbines , but it will add enough transmission lines to move 18,000 megawatts .
That ’s enough energy to power 4 million homes .
The superhighway wo n’t just help facilitate the spread of wind power ; supporters think it will also create jobs , lower energy costs , and reduce pollution .
Texas citizens will have to assist with the plan ’s construction ; they will pay an extra $ 3 to $ 4 per month on their bills for the next few years .
But this pales in comparison to the amount they can save with lower energy prices .
Renewable energy companies are eager to jump on the bandwagon .
Yesterday , Oncor , an electric distribution and transmission business , filed with the Public Utility Commission in Texas to indicate its desire to build a large portion of the superhighway .
With a proposal that could provide Texas with more wind energy than the next 14 states combined , perhaps the state ’s legacy will be one of wind , not oil .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Devin Townsend has been a major part of the metal community ever since he first came to our attention singing on Steve Vai's Sex And Religion .
But it was with 1997's City , fronting his industrial metal war machine Strapping Young Lad that the world really sat up and took notice .
Industrial metal seems t concentrate on irritating bleeps and bloops and silly haircuts rather than breaking faces , but Townsend took influence from thrash and death metal to make something that not only put his peers to shame , but still stands today as one of the most brutal and pissed - off records ever made .
After the scene - setting intro of Velvet Kevorkian , All Hail The New Flesh starts , and I 'll be darned if it is n't one of the best metal songs ever written .
After a riff that sounds like a jumbo jet revving it 's engines , the first hyperspeed blastbeat kicks in with the force of a Panzer tank smashing through your front wall .
And from here on out you 're treated to a five - minute rollercoaster ride , with Devin screaming his guts out over riffs that can break your neck if they catch you the wrong way .
Special mention must be given to ex-Dark Angel man Gene Hoglan , as his performance is utterly outstanding .
He 's often known as “ the atomic clock ” and his playing is drum machine tight , even when he breaks the 300 BPM mark .
Indeed , the precision of the whole band is incredible .
Townsend himself sounds utterly mental , sounding genuinely dangerous at some points ( it 's said he 's passed out in the studio from screaming so hard ) .
Oh My Fucking God follows swiftly on , with Townsend spitting out the lyrics at a unfathomable pace ( I challenge anyone to follow what he 's saying , even when following along with the lyrics booklet ) .
It also contains the fastest section in the entire album , an impressive feat considering the overall intensity levels throughout .
Detox is the “ hit ” here , being perhaps the track they made a video for , and is ever so slightly slower than the preceding two blasters .
The bit in the middle where Devin sings a little more melodically , almost as if he 's having a moment of clarity is a nice touch .
As much as I loathe to make this a track by track review , I simply must make a passing mention to Home Nucleonics , which is the most vicious track on the whole thing .
However , after Underneath The Waves , something very different happens .
The last two tracks are slower and more pounding , with the industrial elements turned up .
Room 429 is a Cop Shoot Cop cover , and while I 've never heard the original , it 's not bad , despite the hokey lyrics and the fact that it 's the weakest tune here .
Spirituality plays us out , and it's epic and crushing , sounding like a Giger painting come to life .
Despite being tagged as industrial metal , these elements never overpower the guitars and drums .
There are keys and samples sure , but they 're a relatively understated presence , adding a little melody to these compostions .
The samples appear to be massively obscure in origin , although I 'd be very interested to hear where they came from .
Despite my general distaste for industrial metal it does work here , filling out the sound to make it even bigger .
For those of us who see heaviness as a virtue , City is a classic .
The band are now defunct , but this record stands as a monument to how utterly vicious music can be .
Warning : May cause you to take sledgehammer to household objects .
Microsoft 's upcoming Windows 7 might just be the salve to soothe Windows Vista ouchies , but what Windows fans really want is something that has n't yet been announced .
Mary - Jo of All About Microsoft says that internally , there 's a project called Singularity that 's designed to solve all kinds of shortcomings in current operating systems , upending the traditional way of thinking in favor of something dramatically different .
And while Singularity wo n't be released to the public , Midori , which takes a lot of cues from it , will .

According to Microsoft 2.0 :
" There 's a seemingly related ( related to Singularity ) project under development at Microsoft which has been hush - hush .
That project , codenamed ‘ Midori , ' is a new Microsoft operating - system platform that supposedly supersedes Windows .
Midori is in incubation , which means it is a little closer to market than most Microsoft Research projects , but not yet close enough to be available in any kind of early preview form .
" What 's also interesting about Midori is who is running the project .
One - time Gates heir - apparent Eric Rudder is heading up the effort .
Midori is being incubated under Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie 's wing .
‘ Everyone under him ( under Rudder on Midori ) is a multi - year vet , has a super fancy title , and is going back to their roots and writing code like they probably did in the old days , ' one Microsoft tipster told me .
" When and how Microsoft will roll out Midori is still a mystery .
But it sounds like the company thinks the project is serious enough to dedicate a considerable amount of time / people / resources to it . "

So it wo n't be in Windows 7 , but from the sounds of it , Midori might be far enough along to make it to Windows 8 .
Will they still keep calling it Windows to hold onto the brand , or will they call it something different to illustrate how dramatically separate it is from what we 're currently using ?

The couple who have never confirmed their nuptials -- with Jigga Man denying the marriage to Vibe -- and Beyonce dealing with L'Oréal 's whitewash scandal .

DENVER 
A huge patchwork of privately owned forest in northwest Montana  much of it abutting wilderness , and together almost a third the size of Rhode Island  will be permanently protected from development under an agreement announced Monday by two private conservation groups , the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land .
The groups will pay $ 510 million for about 500 square miles of forest now owned by Plum Creek Timber , a lumber and real estate firm based in Seattle .
It is one of the biggest sales of forest land for preservation purposes in United States history , conservation experts said .
About half the amount will come from private donations , the conservation buyers said , and about half from the federal government under a new tax - credit bond mechanism that was included in the giant farm bill recently passed by Congress over President Bush ’s veto .
The bond mechanism was devised by Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana .
Mr. Baucus , his spokesman said , was approached about a year ago by representatives of the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land , who argued that development pressures were growing so intense that new tools had to be created to buy the Plum Creek properties if they were to be protected .
David Iglesias , one of the eight US Attorneys forced out of their jobs by the Bush administration for failing to pursue bogus politically - motivated prosecutions , appeared on " Morning Joe " Friday to promote his new book , In Justice , and offered his thoughts on why Karl Rove ignored a Congressional subpoena and skipped town in order to avoid testifying .

" Which I believe is the reason why he is refusing to testify in front of the Congress .
He has information that I believe would show illegal activity , interfering with ongoing federal criminal investigations .
So Rove is not testifying I think basically to keep himself from being indicted . "
Remember to watch Robert Greenwald 's latest video and sign the petition demanding Karl Rove be held accountable .
Here 's the latest installment in Instructables ' series of HOWTOs inspired by my young adult novel Little Brother , which tells the story of young people who use homebrew technology to restore their civil liberties after a police crackdown on terrorism .
This week 's installment :
What to do if the police stop you .
1 . What you say to the police is always important .
What you say can be used against you , and it can give the police an excuse to arrest you , especially if you badmouth a police officer .
2 . You must show your driver 's license and registration when stopped in a car .
Otherwise , you do n't have to answer any questions if you are detained or arrested , with one important exception .
The police may ask for your name if you have been properly detained , and you can be arrested in some states for refusing to give it .
If you reasonably fear that your name is incriminating , you can claim the right to remain silent , which may be a defense in case you are arrested anyway .
3 . You do not have to consent to any search of yourself , your car or your house .
If you DO consent to a search , it can affect your rights later in court .
If the police say they have a search warrant , ASK TO SEE IT .
4 . Do not interfere with , or obstruct the police , as you you can be arrested for it .

Researchers have developed a new strategy for fighting the degradations of aging in the liver .
By genetically engineering mice to overproduce a protein that helps collect cellular garbage , scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine created old mice with livers that functioned as well as mice a quarter of their age .
And the new work comes with an ironic ( lime ) twist :
The new research on protecting your liver comes courtesy of Dr. Cuervo , Ana Cuervo that is , a professor in Einstein 's developmental and molecular biology , medicine and anatomy and structural biology departments .
" [ The research ] proves for the first time that if you eliminate the garbage , the cells will keep functioning well and are pretty much the same as they were when they were young , " Cuervo said .
All cells have systems for finding damaged proteins and cleaning them up .
Healthy cells efficiently recycle damaged protein by breaking it down into its constituent amino acids , and resynthesizing good proteins .
But as animals age , the systems deteriorate , and protein begins to build up .
Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer 's have long been associated with clumps of garbage proteins that researchers have tried to target with drugs for years .
Cuervo's work involves a so - called chaperone protein that acts as a garbage collector within the cell 's recycling , monitoring for damaged protein within the cell .
The chaperone is partially responsible for drawing damaged protein into the enzyme - filled lysosome , which acts as the protein - recycling center .
In previous research , she found that as cells age , they continue to produce the same amount of the chaperone , but changes in the cell 's chemistry break it down too quickly .
The result is that garbage proteins build up in the cell .
In this study , published in Nature Medicine , Cuervo 's team created mice with an extra gene that encoded for the chaperone .
They silenced that gene with a chemical until the mice were 22 to 26 months old ( about 80 in human years ) , and then allowed the gene to start cranking out the protein .
They found that simply by having more of the protein around to clean up , the cells – and the liver as a whole – worked better metabolizing toxins .
The old mice maintained liver function efficiency comparable to six - month - old mice .
The team has a variety of ideas about how to achieve this same effect in non-transgenic animals .
For example , they could find a compound that counteracts the intracellular chemical changes associated with aging , or a different compound that directly binds to the garbage collector and helps stabilize it within older cells .
Actual drug therapies for humans based on the research are not yet on the horizon , but Cuervo said that in early , unpublished research , dietary changes have been able to maintain youthful cell chemistry .
That could keep the garbage collecting proteins around longer and possibly reduce protein buildup , although Cuervo said the work was not yet ready to discuss in detail .
One thing unlikely to help keep your liver young is Jose Cuervo , the mid-shelf tequila .
Asked about her name 's poor association with liver damage , Dr. Cuervo called the Jose Cuervo connection ironic .
" Maybe my work is a way to balance the last name , " Cuervo said .

With news that Google is alleged once again to be close to acquiring Digg , some may suggest that the future of the popular social voting destination is assured .
But looking at Google ’s list of acquisitions , it is anything but .
Here ’s four ways Google could destroy Digg as we currently know it .
Stagnation
While Digg is a popular service is its current form , any site that does n’t evolve over time to keep the interaction fresh risks losing favor , particularly in a competitive space .
Feedburner was acquired by Google for $ 100 million in June 2007 , and the notice of the acquisition is still sitting on the front page .
In over 12 months nothing much at all has changed at Feedburner , with the exception of some users getting to display Adsense ads in their feed .
No Google login integration , no fresh services , nothing much at all really .
Feeburner has one advantage : a near monopoly in third party feed support , and many of us use it by default , and that ’s the only reason it has n’t blead users post Google .
Feedburner also proves that the price of the acquisition does n’t matter in Google pergatory , so despite a rumored $ 200 million price tag , Digg could easily suffer the same fate .
Unloved
Jaiku was acquired by Google in October 2007 and since that time has remained unloved with no promotion or even reasonable support .
When microblogging first came of age last year Jaiku was talked about as the No 2 in the space after Twitter , today , outside of a core few users , few use it , and even if you wanted to use it , they stopped accepting signups post Google acquisition .
Not long ago it went down for a couple of days , and there were so few people left using it that hardly anyone noticed .
It was rumored that Jaiku was acquired for the IP to be used in Google ’s mobile endeavors , but we have n’t seen anything in that regard either .
Microblogging would seem to be a natural service for Google to be in , and yet as more and more services enter the space , Google sits and does nothing with a platform that would have been booming if it had n’t been acquired .
The Digg lesson is that companies acquired by Google can be ignored and even forgotten .
There is one thing for sure :
Digg will never get the same amount of attention in Google as it gets now .
Ignoring existing customers
Google acquired Urchin in March 2005 and used the software as the basis for Google Analytics , the problem is that it then ignored Urchin ’s existing user base for years .
Urchin offered an installed , paid analytics package that was fairly popular when acquired , and a new version was actually in testing at the time of acquisition .
Over 2 years later that software was released , and only then after some strong criticism .
The Digg lesson is that Google loves IP , but does n’t always appreciate existing user bases .
Imagine if Google decides to use the Digg engine to power a Google service ( and the rumors have Google News in the spotlight ) , but then completely ignores Digg.com .
Spam trap
One of Google ’s earliest acquisitions was Pyra Labs , the company behind the Blogger hosted blogging service .
Keeping spam off blogs has always been a battle , but in the early days it was an issue actively addressed by the Pyra Labs team .
Post Google acquisition , Blogger quickly became the favorite service of spammers worldwide , in part driven by a belief that as a Google owned service , links on Blogger blogs are indexed more quickly and have more validity .
Google has made the occasion noise about spam on Blogger , but the service is still one of the largest repositories of spam online , and the volume has never really decreased .
The Digg lesson is that any acquisition by Google will bring attention to Digg , that may result in even more spam ( the service is already a target , but they do a pretty good job in dealing with ) and that Google may do nothing to address any future spam issues .
Conclusion
With a $ 200 million price tag you ’d think that Google would look after Digg post acquisition , but as the four examples shown demonstrate , Google inaction in price agnostic .
The most successful acquisitions Google have made nearly all included merging the acquired company into Google products , or using them to launch new Google products ( and in both cases the original brand ceaseing to exist ) .
The exceptions : Blogger , the favorite destination for spam worldwide , and YouTube , which Google is struggling to make money from .
Grand Central is a maybe , but even that has had issues post Google acquisition .

Israel last night warned an attempt by peace activists to sail two wooden boats to the Gaza Strip was a " provocation " and said it would prevent them reaching their destination .
A group of 46 activists set sail yesterday morning from Cyprus and were hoping to reach Gaza later today to challenge the economic blockade Israel has imposed on the strip and to deliver a cargo of 200 hearing aids for a deaf school and 5,000 balloons .
Among those on board is a Catholic nun , aged 81 , the British journalist Yvonne Ridley and Lauren Booth , sister - in - law of Tony Blair .
" I 've been nervous , but today I 'm excited , " said Booth , 41 , shortly before the boats sailed .
" It 's not about our fear , it 's about the people waiting in Gaza , you can't think about anything else . "
Another passenger , Huwaida Arraf , a Palestinian with Israeli and US citizenship , said : " The siege that the Israelis have imposed on Gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law , it is also immoral .
Global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it . "
Israel has already warned those on board not to undertake the journey and last night Aviv Shiron , spokesman for Israel 's foreign ministry , said the voyage was a " provocation " and that " all options " were under consideration to prevent the boats reaching Gaza .
An Israeli admiral has issued an apparent warning to all shipping to stay clear of waters near Gaza because of an unspecified " security situation . "
It appears most likely that there will be a standoff with the Israeli navy later today , and that the activists will be arrested rather than being allowed into Gaza .
Although Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 , it still controls Gaza 's air space and sea space , as well as nearly all the border crossings .
Until a recent ceasefire with Hamas the Israeli military was mounting regular incursions into the strip , saying it wanted to stop rocket fire into southern Israel .
It has imposed a tight economic blockade of Gaza , saying it wants to weaken Hamas , the Islamist group which won Palestinian elections more than two years ago .
In a statement issued as they departed yesterday , the activists said they would lodge a legal protest against any attempt by the Israelis to arrest them .
" If Israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships , we will not forcibly resist , " they said .
" If we are arrested and brought to Israel , we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums ...
It is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice . "
Will shared resources always be misused and overused ?
Is community ownership of land , forests , and fisheries a guaranteed road to ecological disaster ?
Is privatization the only way to protect the environment and end Third World poverty ?
Most economists and development planners will answer “ yes ” — and for proof they will point to the most influential article ever written on those important questions .
Since its publication in Science in December 1968 , “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” has been anthologized in at least 111 books , making it one of the most - reprinted articles ever to appear in any scientific journal .
It is also one of the most - quoted : a recent Google search found “ about 302,000 ” results for the phrase “ tragedy of the commons . ”
For 40 years it has been , in the words of a World Bank Discussion Paper , “ the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues ” ( Bromley and Cernea 1989 : 6 ) .
It has been used time and again to justify stealing indigenous peoples ’ lands , privatizing health care and other social services , giving corporations “ tradable permits ” to pollute the air and water , and much more .
Noted anthropologist Dr. G.N. Appell ( 1995 : 34 - 5 ) writes that the article “ has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge . ”
Like most sacred texts , “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” is more often cited than read .
As we will see , although its title sounds authoritative and scientific , it fell far short of science .
Garrett Hardin hatches a myth
The author of “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” was Garrett Hardin , a University of California professor who until then was best known as the author of a biology textbook that argued for “ control of breeding ” of “ genetically defective ” people ( Hardin 1966 : 707 ) .
In his 1968 essay he argued that communities that share resources inevitably pave the way for their own destruction ; instead of wealth for all , there is wealth for none .
He based his argument on a story about the commons in rural England .
( The term “ commons ” was used in England to refer to the shared pastures , fields , forests , irrigation systems , and other resources that were found in many rural areas until well into the 1800s .
Similar communal farming arrangements existed in most of Europe , and they still exist today in various forms around the world , particularly in indigenous communities . )
“ Picture a pasture open to all , ” Hardin wrote .
A herdsmen who wants to expand his personal herd will calculate that the cost of additional grazing ( reduced food for all animals , rapid soil depletion ) will be divided among all , but he alone will get the benefit of having more cattle to sell .
Inevitably , “ the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd . ”
But every “ rational herdsman ” will do the same thing , so the commons is soon overstocked and overgrazed to the point where it supports no animals at all .
Hardin used the word “ tragedy ” as Aristotle did , to refer to a dramatic outcome that is the inevitable but unplanned result of a character ’s actions .
He called the destruction of the commons through overuse a tragedy not because it is sad , but because it is the inevitable result of shared use of the pasture .
“ Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all . ”
Where ’s the Evidence ?
Given the subsequent influence of Hardin ’s essay , it ’s shocking to realize that he provided no evidence at all to support his sweeping conclusions .
He claimed that the “ tragedy ” was inevitable — but he did n’t show that it had happened even once .
Hardin simply ignored what actually happens in a real commons : self - regulation by the communities involved .
One such process was described years earlier in Friedrich Engels ’ account of the “ mark , ” the form taken by commons - based communities in parts of pre-capitalist Germany :
[ T ]he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community .
. . .
Just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size , so was his share also in the use of the “ common mark . ”
The nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole .
. . .
At fixed times and , if necessary , more frequently , they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark .
( Engels 1892 )
Historians and other scholars have broadly confirmed Engels ’ description of communal management of shared resources .
A summary of recent research concludes :
[ W ] hat existed in fact was not a “ tragedy of the commons ” but rather a triumph : that for hundreds of years — and perhaps thousands , although written records do not exist to prove the longer era — land was managed successfully by communities .
( Cox 1985 : 60 )
Part of that self - regulation process was known in England as “ stinting ” — establishing limits for the number of cows , pigs , sheep , and other livestock that each commoner could graze on the common pasture .
Such “ stints ” protected the land from overuse ( a concept that experienced farmers understood long before Hardin arrived ) and allowed the community to allocate resources according to its own concepts of fairness .
The only significant cases of overstocking found by the leading modern expert on the English commons involved wealthy landowners who deliberately put too many animals onto the pasture in order to weaken their much poorer neighbors ’ position in disputes over the enclosure ( privatization ) of common lands ( Neeson 1993 : 156 ) .
Hardin assumed that peasant farmers are unable to change their behavior in the face of certain disaster .
But in the real world , small farmers , fishers , and others have created their own institutions and rules for preserving resources and ensuring that the commons community survived through good years and bad .
Why Does the Herder Want More ?
Hardin ’s argument started with the unproven assertion that herdsmen always want to expand their herds : “ It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons .
. . .
As a rational being , each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain . ”
In short , Hardin ’s conclusion was predetermined by his assumptions .
“ It is to be expected ” that each herdsman will try to maximize the size of his herd — and each one does exactly that .
It ’s a circular argument that proves nothing .
Hardin assumed that human nature is selfish and unchanging and that society is just an assemblage of self - interested individuals who do n’t care about the impact of their actions on the community .
The same idea , explicitly or implicitly , is a fundamental component of mainstream ( i.e. , pro-capitalist ) economic theory .
All the evidence ( not to mention common sense ) shows that this is absurd : people are social beings , and society is much more than the arithmetic sum of its members .
Even capitalist society , which rewards the most anti-social behavior , has not crushed human cooperation and solidarity .
The very fact that for centuries “ rational herdsmen ” did not overgraze the commons disproves Hardin ’s most fundamental assumptions — but that has n’t stopped him or his disciples from erecting policy castles on foundations of sand .
Even if the herdsman wanted to behave as Hardin described , he could n’t do so unless certain conditions existed .
There would have to be a market for the cattle , and he would have to be focused on producing for that market , not for local consumption .
He would have to have enough capital to buy the additional cattle and the fodder they would need in winter .
He would have to be able to hire workers to care for the larger herd , build bigger barns , etc .
And his desire for profit would have to outweigh his interest in the long - term survival of his community .
In short , Hardin did n’t describe the behavior of herdsmen in pre-capitalist farming communities — he described the behavior of capitalists operating in a capitalist economy .
The universal human nature that he claimed would always destroy common resources is actually the profit - driven “ grow or die ” behavior of corporations .
Will Private Ownership Do Better ?
That leads us to another fatal flaw in Hardin ’s argument : in addition to providing no evidence that maintaining the commons will inevitably destroy the environment , he offered no justification for his opinion that privatization would save it .
Once again he simply presented his own prejudices as fact :
We must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust — but we put up with it because we are not convinced , at the moment , that anyone has invented a better system .
The alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate .
Injustice is preferable to total ruin .
The implication is that private owners will do a better job of caring for the environment because they want to preserve the value of their assets .
In reality , scholars and activists have documented scores of cases in which the division and privatization of communally managed lands had disastrous results .
Privatizing the commons has repeatedly led to deforestation , soil erosion and depletion , overuse of fertilizers and pesticides , and the ruin of ecosystems .
As Karl Marx wrote , nature requires long cycles of birth , development , and regeneration , but capitalism requires short - term returns .
[ T ]he entire spirit of capitalist production , which is oriented towards the most immediate monetary profits , stands in contradiction to agriculture , which has to concern itself with the whole gamut of permanent conditions of life required by the chain of human generations .
A striking illustration of this is furnished by the forests , which are only rarely managed in a way more or less corresponding to the interests of society as a whole .
. . . ( Marx 1998 : 611n )
Contrary to Hardin ’s claims , a community that shares fields and forests has a strong incentive to protect them to the best of its ability , even if that means not maximizing current production , because those resources will be essential to the community ’s survival for centuries to come .
Capitalist owners have the opposite incentive , because they will not survive in business if they do n’t maximize short - term profit .
If ethanol promises bigger and faster profits than centuries - old rain forests , the trees will fall .
This focus on short - term gain has reached a point of appalling absurdity in recent best - selling books by Bjorn Lomborg , William Nordhaus , and others , who argue that it is irrational to spend money to stop greenhouse gas emissions today , because the payoff is too far in the future .
Other investments , they say , will produce much better returns , more quickly .
Community management is n’t an infallible way of protecting shared resources : some communities have mismanaged common resources , and some commons may have been overused to extinction .
But no commons - based community has capitalism ’s built - in drive to put current profits ahead of the well - being of future generations .
A Politically Useful Myth
The truly appalling thing about “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” is not its lack of evidence or logic — badly researched and argued articles are not unknown in academic journals .
What ’s shocking is the fact that this piece of reactionary nonsense has been hailed as a brilliant analysis of the causes of human suffering and environmental destruction , and adopted as a basis for social policy by supposed experts ranging from economists and environmentalists to governments and United Nations agencies .
Despite being refuted again and again , it is still used today to support private ownership and uncontrolled markets as sure - fire roads to economic growth .
The success of Hardin ’s argument reflects its usefulness as a pseudo - scientific explanation of global poverty and inequality , an explanation that does n’t question the dominant social and political order .
It confirms the prejudices of those in power : logical and factual errors are nothing compared to the very attractive ( to the rich ) claim that the poor are responsible for their own poverty .
The fact that Hardin ’s argument also blames the poor for ecological destruction is a bonus .
Hardin ’s essay has been widely used as an ideological response to anti-imperialist movements in the Third World and discontent among indigenous and other oppressed peoples everywhere in the world .
Hardin ’s fable was taken up by the gathering forces of neo-liberal reaction in the 1970s , and his essay became the “ scientific ” foundation of World Bank and IMF policies , viz .
enclosure of commons and privatization of public property .
. . .
The message is clear : we must never treat the earth as a “ common treasury . ”
We must be ruthless and greedy or else we will perish .
( Boal 2007 )
In Canada , conservative lobbyists use arguments derived from Hardin ’s political tract to explain away poverty on First Nations ’ reserves and to argue for further dismantling of indigenous communities .
A study published by the influential Fraser Institute urges privatization of reserve land :
[ T] hese large amounts of land , with their attendant natural resources , will never yield their maximum benefit to Canada ’s native people as long as they are held as collective property subject to political management .
. . .
[ C] ollective property is the path of poverty , and private property is the path of prosperity .
( Fraser 2002 : 16 - 17 )
This is n’t just right - wing posturing .
Canada ’s federal government , which has refused to sign the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , announced in 2007 that it will “ develop approaches to support the development of individual property ownership on reserve ” and created a $ 300 million fund to do just that .
In Hardin ’s world , poverty has nothing to do with centuries of racism , colonialism , and exploitation : poverty is inevitable and natural in all times and places , the product of immutable human nature .
The poor bring it on themselves by having too many babies and clinging to self - destructive collectivism .
The tragedy of the commons is a useful political myth — a scientific - sounding way of saying that there is no alternative to the dominant world order .
Stripped of excess verbiage , Hardin ’s essay asserted , without proof , that human beings are helpless prisoners of biology and the market .
Unless restrained , we will inevitably destroy our communities and environment for a few extra pennies of profit .
There is nothing we can do can to make the world better or more just .
In 1844 Friedrich Engels described a similar argument as a “ repulsive blasphemy against man and nature . ”
Those words apply with full force to the myth of the tragedy of the commons .

The absolute blind rage I 'm experiencing trying to view the Olympics is going to give me a fucking embolism .
I was already prepared for the worst from NBC , who have fucked up the last 3 Olympic games coverage , but I honestly could n't have imagined how evil and extortionary they have become .
First is the time delay .
Here in California we 're getting NO events telecast live .
NOTHING .
Everything is at least 3 hours old , and most major events are more than that .
Yet , they still mark evening broadcasts as LIVE , even though they 're not !
Yes , it was live on the East Coast of the US when they were being recorded , but not 3 hours later when they finally air here .
Second is the commercials .
While trying to watch coverage tonight with my six year old son before his bedtime , we were bombarded with commercials EVERY 5 MINUTES .
I timed it on my watch .
And some of the commercials were completely inappropriate for my son - some fucked up promo for " My Name is Earl " had some woman with a horribly scarred and disfigured face shown prominently .
My son is going to get nightmares from trying to watch the fucking Olympics , can you believe it ?
What assholes !
Third is the alternative channels .
NBC promoted the fact that they were going to broadcast the games on all their network channels - such as USA and Oxygen - but during prime time there 's only been one other channel , and it has - I fucking kid you not , shown nothing but badminton and boxing for 5 days straight now .
Badminton and boxing .
Over and over and over again .
There 's dozens of various events going on , but I 've seen nothing but badminton and boxing .
I would assume idiocy , but it 's obviously completely intentional as trying to have the worst programming possible and drive viewers to their main channel .
Fourth is the online video .
I fished out my Windows Vista box , which already does n't make me particularly happy having been forced to use it , and got everything set up so I could watch online .
It 's a fucking pitiful experience in every way , including not being able to be shown full screen , no " major " events like swimming , gymnastics , etc. , and no commentary so who knows what 's going on for most events .
The Windows Media Center plugin from TV Tonic is even worse with * zero * live events , and a menu and navigation system that 's sluggish to the point of being unusable .
Fifth is the hype and jingoism .
NBC focuses on the same handful of athletes over and over again despite the 400 + in Beijing from the US alone .
Yes , it 's great Phelps is awesome .
We fucking get it , now shut the fuck up about it already .
And the general ignorance of the commentators about other countries , the lack of any coverage of those countries , combined with the mindless US - only coverage is insane .
My son was born in Spain and is very interested in seeing how they do but can get no details about it from NBC regardless of how they do in any given event - it 's always about the Americans .
My son is n't unique - a huge portion of the US is from somewhere else - we 're a nation of immigrants after all , and yet NBC has programmed its coverage like we 're all white people descended from the Pilgrims living in Kansas .
I hate NBC so much .
The Olympics are supposed to be a worldwide event and a point of national pride , but NBC has hijacked the games completely and totally , providing little actual quality coverage , funneling viewers to a single channel in order for them choke down their incessant commercials as a way of not just making back their money , or simply profiting , but as a way of maximizing profits from their monopoly on the broadcast rights .
What should be a privilege for a national broadcaster has been turned into an extortion racket , holding the Olympics hostage with all of us paying the ransom .
My rage and outrage at this is total .
They have absolutely destroyed the Olympics for me - and my son - and there 's little I can do about it but not watch , and that is just not acceptable to me .
Something really needs to be done .
How much tax money is funneled towards the Olympic movement and athletes ?
How much does the US as a country have invested in these games , only to be denied the right to watch them while they happen because a greedy , soulless corporation has paid for the exclusive rights ?
It 's an embarrassment - every other country on Earth has a better view of the games than we do .
Why ?
NBC has completely ruined the Olympics .
Try as I might , I just cannot stop myself from being livid about it .
Absolutely livid .

I ’ve waited to write more more about the roots of unscience in medical schools and universities , to include what I knew would be a priceless synopsis of his trip to the United States .
Professor David Colquhoun of the Dept of Pharmacology at University College in London , recently spoke at the Integrative Medicine at Yale .
As covered in - depth here , medical professionals in the UK are actively working to advocate for the safety and welfare of patients and the integrity of science in medicine by exposing quackery .
As readers will remember , Yale joined nearly 40 other top medical schools around the U.S. opening integrative medicine programs and bringing alternative modalities to their medical training and practices .
Much of the funding and support for spreading these programs comes from the $ 250 million a year in federal grants through the NCCAM and National Cancer Institute .
( There ’s a reason so much flawed research and ideas surround cancer . )
Another major source is through private billionaire backers who began the Bravewell Collaborative for Integrative Medicine in 2001 , with the goal of integrating alternative modalities into mainstream medicine .
Bravewell was founded by John Mack , the Wall Street tycoon , and is run by his wife .
Based in Minneapolis , in just its first 5 years , it had raised $ 21 million from backers , all of whom had to agree to support Bravewell in every course of action .
It has established the Consortium for Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine with nearly 40 medical schools now , all readily abandoning science to teach “ other ways of knowing ” in return for countless millions of dollars .
Forbes wrote about one of the those centers , Duke Center for Integrative Medicine , when it opened the fall of 2006 after being financed with a $ 10 million donation from the C.J. Mack Foundation .
As Robert Lenzner reported for Forbes :
The Macks , along with other Bravewell members , also raised money for the PBS special this year , " The New Medicine , " which featured the use of hypnosis and guided imagery as techniques to reduce pain and help ill people lead active lives .
The special won the Freddie Award for Health and Science Media in the area of health and wellness .
Bravewell is aiming its proselytizing guns at university medical centers , attempting to promote the construction of integrative health facilities .
It funded the development of the curricula on the topic for medical schools and trains 30 doctors a year in integrative medicine at a cost of $ 30,000 per doctor , using the works of Andrew Weil , a best - selling author and guru in the wellness field .
And it gives a biannual $ 100,000 prize to recipients of its Bravewell Leadership Award , given to doctor who have made a big impact within the field .
Bravewell has also recently set up its own BraveNet ( Bravewell Integrative Medicine Research Network ) with 8 of those university integrative medical centers , to increase knowledge about alternative modalities and their “ evidence - base . ”
One of the most revealing parts of professor Colquhoun ’s talk was his coverage of the recent Integrative Medicine Scientific Symposium at Yale [ JFS background here ; YouTube video here ] where Dr. David Katz , the founder and direct of the integrative program , spoke .
Do listen to professor Colquhuon ’s tape of Dr. Katz ’ talk as he describes randomized clinical trials of vitamins for fibromyalgia , homeopathy for ADHD , coenzyme - Q10 and carbetalol for heart disease , phytoestrogens , yoga , acupuncture , and others that all found no demonstration of clinical efficacy using the most credible clinical evidence .
We know the evidence on antioxidants also shows them to be ineffective , said Dr. Katz , but “ we need to think more fluidly about evidence . ”
He repeated this idea several times .
As Colquhoun reports today :
Pretty remarkable uh ?
Dr Katz goes through several different trials , all of which come out negative .
And what is his conclusion ?
You guessed .
His conclusion is not that the treatments do n’t work but that we need a “ more fluid concept of evidence ” ...
This is not science .
It is n’t even common sense .
It is a retreat to the dark ages of medicine when a physician felt free to guess the answer .
In fact it ’s worse .
In the old days there was no evidence to assess .
Now there is a fair amount of evidence , but Dr Katz feels free to ignore it and guess anyway .
He refers to teaching about evidence as ‘ indoctrination ’ , a pretty graphic illustration of his deeply anti-scientific approach to knowledge .
And he makes a joke about having diverted a $ 1 m grant from CDC , for much needed systematic reviews , into something that fits his aims better .
[ “ We knew it was silly , but on the other hand , a million dollars sounded really good , ” said Dr. Katz . ]
As Colquhoun explains with no holds barred spunk , the foundation of these alternative - integrative programs is nutritional quackery , nutrigenomics , antioxidants and flavonoids , diets and ‘ healthy ’ eating [ beyond basic nutritition to prevent deficiences ] for preventive health and optimum wellness .
These issues have been heavily covered here at JFS , but the unsoundness of so much of them is still difficult for many readers to grasp because feel - good modalities have become so incorporated into what people believe is legitimate health and medicine .
They also include just enough interventions with a degree of efficacy ( such as general massage and relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety and pain perception ) to make all the mind - body vitalism - based modalities and their claims appear credible .
It ’s understandable for people to want to believe that by diligently following a certain lifestyle and eating ‘ healthy ’ they can prevent chronic diseases of aging , cancers , diabetes and heart disease .
But disease , just like actual obesity , is not a measure of good behavior or eating some certain way .
In response to dietary quackery in preventive health , optimal wellness and longevity , experts funded by the National Institute on Aging emphatically stated : “ Our language on this matter must be unambiguous : there are no lifestyle changes , surgical procedures , vitamins , antioxidants , hormones or techniques of genetic engineering available today that have been demonstrated to influence the processes of aging . ”
But fostering these beliefs among consumers is an ingenious way to enact policies to control food and lifestyles and get people to believe it ’s in their best interests .
It also promotes blame and discrimination against those with health problems , as it being their own fault and costing everyone else .
This melding of alternative beliefs into mainstream medicine is seeing rapid success .
Some additional background information may be helpful in understanding why .
Bravewell has also created powerful “ strategic partnerships ” to promote “ preventive health and wellness ” and alternative modalities as part of the national health agenda .
Its partners seek to “ change the way healthcare is delivered in this country . ”
You ’ll recognize most of these influential organizations , such as the NIH , National Committee for Quality Assurance ( NCQA ) , National Business Group on Health ( behind employer and insurer “ wellness ” programs and insurance mandates ) and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
As professor Colquhoun reports today , the main thing that ’s brought medical schools and universities down to the level of promoting nonscience is “ simply money . ”
But he ends on a positive note , saying that this can be stopped if people and healthcare professionals care enough to speak out .
When Florida State University proposed setting up such a program , public pressure on legislators and the governor was able to stop the passage of a funding bill and shut the project down .
“ In the end , reason won , ” he writes .
Will healthcare professionals and consumers act to ensure Yale and the 39 other universities on the list follow their example ?
Will they speak out against these wellness programs being enacted by government agencies , insurers and employers ?
Or is the money too good ?

IT 'S FREE Here 's a shocker : Electricity bills are heading up .
Way up .
Utilities across the USA are raising power prices up to 29 % , mostly to pay for soaring fuel costs , but also to build new plants and refurbish an aging power grid .
Even more dramatic rate increases are ahead .
The mounting electric bills will further squeeze households struggling with spiraling gasoline prices .
" Consumers now face a tough reality on electricity , " says Mark Cooper of Consumer Federation of America .
The increases come after rising fuel prices already have driven up utility bills nearly 30 % in the past five years , the sharpest jump since the 1970s energy crisis .
Fuel costs are again the main culprit .
In Virginia , Potomac Edison , citing high coal and natural gas prices , plans to raise rates 29 % on July 1 , pushing an average monthly residential bill from about $ 70 to $ 90 .
AmerenUE , Missouri 's largest utility , recently asked for its first rate increase in 20 years , a 12.1 % boost , mostly to cover higher fuel costs .
Customers of Public Service Co. of Oklahoma were socked with a 25 % rise on June 1 .
The price of coal , which fires half of U.S. power plants , has doubled since last year , largely because of surging energy use in countries such as China and India .
Natural gas prices are up nearly 50 % on high U.S. demand .
In California , drought has forced Pacific Gas & Electric to replace cheap hydroelectric power with natural gas , helping to prompt it to seek 13 % rate increases .
The cost to build a power plant has also gone up , more than doubling since 2000 .
South Carolina Electric & Gas wants to boost rates 37 % by 2019 to cover its share of two nuclear reactors costing $ 10 billion .
Some utilities are seeking several increases .
In New York City , Con Edison , which raised rates 4.7 % in April , seeks increases of 5 % in each of the next three years to fund $ 5.5 billion in equipment after a 2006 Queens blackout .
That 's on top of an anticipated 13 % rate increase this summer for higher fuel charges .
" We must make sure that our system has the highest reliability , " says Con Ed spokesman Michael Clendenin .
Queens Assemblyman Michael Gianaris says Con
Ed wasted funds on new plants elsewhere and urges regulators to reject the proposal .
" I say not one penny more until reforms are done , " he says .
Expect bigger rate shocks if federal legislation , anticipated by 2010 , passes and forces coal - fired generators to pay fees to emit global - warming gases .
American Electric
Power , the largest coal - fired generator , will have to raise rates 115 % to pay higher fuel costs , build new plants and recover global - warming fees , says Hugh Wynne of Bernstein Research .
But Wynne says regulators could temper increases by trimming profits .

This guest post on Pet Photography was submitted by Antoine Khater at All Day I Dream About Photography .
Pets fill very quickly their place in our hearts and families and we enjoy having their pictures framed on our desk or wall !
However taking pictures of your best friend is not always easy .
Pets , unlike humans , do not understand what we are trying to do and wo n’t just pose for the camera !
Here are 9 tips that will help you help you get the most of your photo session
1. Use Natural Light
If possible always use natural light when taking your pet in picture .
Avoid flash , as flash burst can , not only cause red-eye , but also frighten the animal .
Instead try to go outside or , if it is not possible , in a room well lit by a large window .
2. Keep the Eyes Sharp
Having sharp eyes is important in any kind of portraits photography .
As they say , “ Eyes are the Window to the Soul ” and pets eye can be very expressive .
So make sure to focus on your pet ’s eyes and keep the tack sharp
3. Go to Them
It is very important that you pet feels comfortable and at ease , so instead of forcing him to come to you go to him .
Most important is to get down to his level ;
We all know how a dog looks when viewed from above , this is the way we always see them .
Show us the way they see world !
Sit on the floor or lie on your belly and remember to shoot from HIS eye level or below .
4. Give Value to their Character
You know your pet better than anyone else , and a successful picture is one that conveys the character of its subject .
If you have a lazy cat show him yawning , if your animal is of a playful type show him in action performing his favorite trick .
5. Go Macro
Put on that long lens and fill the frame with your pet ’s face and fur , close up shots often make beautiful animal portrait .
6. Surprise Them
One of the most difficult things is to let your pet hold still .
An easy trick is to let him play quietly and , once you have everything ready , let someone call for him or whistle .
This will surprise him and caught his attention and you will have a few seconds to capture him in a nice and alert posture
7. Schedule your Session
If you are longing for a formal pet portrait shot , try to schedule the photo session when you ’re animal is somewhat sleepy or has just woke up it will be much easier to keep him still then .
If you want a more dynamic shot then pick up a time when your pet is energetic .
If he is sick it is better to just postpone it for another day .
8. Be Patient
Pet photography requires a lot of patience .
No matter how excited your furry friend is , if you are patient enough , he will end up by relaxing and you will have the opportunity to get a decent shot .
9. Experiment
Take your time and enjoy the session , try different approaches , angles and compositions .
Shoot a lot you will have time to worry about the results later .
You have a tip that I forgot to mention here ?

BEL AIR , Maryland , August 5 , 2008 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) – Eighteen pro-lifers participating in the Maryland Face the Truth Tour were arrested without warning by Hartford County State Troopers in the city of Bel Air , Maryland on Friday , August 1 , 2008 .
It was during the last tour stop of the week - long event , sponsored by Defend Life when a State Trooper named Bradley approached the group and told them to move and put away their signs or they would be arrested .
In an effort to comply , group leader Jack Ames gathered the group and moved down the road , into the city limits of Bel Air , Maryland .
The group stood peacefully on public property and did not " march " into the street as one news organization erroneously reported .
Without warning , an estimated twenty patrol cars arrived on the scene and began arresting pro-life participants without a word .
Those arrested were not told what they were being charged with , nor were they read their rights .
One of the women who participated in the tour overheard a police radio conversation where an unknown person told the troopers to make the arrests and that they would " figure out later " what charges would be filed .
At least two people suffered medical problems after having to sit for over a half hour with metal handcuffs that were too tight .
Two minors in the group were soon released , but the adults were held overnight .
The men and women were held in two separate cells , but could hear each other .
They passed the hours joining together in singing Christian hymns .
The last of the pro-lifers were released on Saturday , August 2 , at about 10:45 AM .
The group was eventually charged with loitering , failure to obey a lawful order , and disorderly conduct .
He was in Trinity United Church of Christ , but not of it , not sharing the liberation theology that energized Jeremiah Wright Jr. He is in the United States Senate , but not of it .
He has not had the time nor the inclination to throw himself into Senate mores , or really get to know more than a handful of his colleagues .
His Democratic supporters there speak of him fondly , but vaguely .
And so it goes .
He is a liberal , but not fully liberal .
He has sometimes opposed the Chicago political establishment , but is also part of it .
He spoke at a rally against the Iraq war , while distancing himself from many antiwar activists .
This ability to stand apart accounts for his fantastic powers of observation , and his skills as a writer and thinker .
It means that people on almost all sides of any issue can see parts of themselves reflected in Obama ’s eyes .
But it does make him hard to place .
When we ’re judging candidates ( or friends ) , we do n’t just judge the individuals but the milieus that produced them .
We judge them by the connections that exist beyond choice and the ground where they will go home to be laid to rest .
Andrew Jackson was a backwoodsman .
John Kennedy had his clan .
Ronald Reagan was forever associated with the small - town virtues of Dixon and Jimmy Carter with Plains .
It is hard to plant Obama .
Both he and his opponent have written coming - of - age tales about their fathers , but they are different in important ways .
McCain ’s “ Faith of My Fathers ” is a story of a prodigal son .
It is about an immature boy who suffers and discovers his place in the long line of warriors that produced him .
Obama ’s “ Dreams From My Father ” is a journey forward , about a man who took the disparate parts of his past and constructed an identity of his own .
If you grew up in the 1950s , you were inclined to regard your identity as something you were born with .
If you grew up in the 1970s , you were more likely to regard your identity as something you created .
If Obama is fully a member of any club  and perhaps he is n’t  it is the club of smart post - boomer meritocrats .
We now have a cohort of rising leaders , Obama ’s age and younger , who climbed quickly through elite schools and now ascend from job to job .
They are conscientious and idealistic while also being coldly clever and self - aware .
It ’s not clear what the rest of America makes of them .
So , cautiously , the country watches .
This should be a Democratic wipeout .
But voters seem to be slow to trust a sojourner they cannot place .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
This is the story of two Marys .
Both are in their early 60s , heavyset , with curly reddish hair .
But for years they have worked on opposite ends of the same issues .
Mary McFate is an advocate of environmental causes and a prominent activist within the gun control movement .
For more than a decade , she volunteered for various gun violence prevention organizations , serving on the boards of anti-gun outfits , helping state groups coordinate their activities , lobbying in Washington for gun control legislation , and regularly attending strategy and organizing meetings .
Mary Lou Sapone , by contrast , is a self - described “ research consultant , ” who for decades has covertly infiltrated citizens groups for private security firms hired by corporations that are targeted by activist campaigns .
For some time , Sapone also worked for the National Rifle Association .
But these two Marys share a lot in common — a Mother Jones investigation has found that McFate and Sapone are , in fact , the same person .
And this discovery has caused the leaders of gun violence prevention organizations to conclude that for years they have been penetrated — at the highest levels — by the NRA or other pro-gun parties .
“ It raises the question , ” says Paul Helmke , the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , “ of what did she find out and what did they want her to find out . ”
Using her maiden name , McFate , Sapone began posing as a gun control activist in the mid-1990s .
Bryan Miller , the executive director of Ceasefire New Jersey , a grassroots gun control group , recalls first meeting her in the summer of 1998 .
The NRA was holding its annual convention in downtown Philadelphia , and the event drew the usual bevy of protesters .
Among them was a middle - aged woman then living in Pennsylvania who made a point of introducing herself to Miller .
In the following years , Miller would remember this encounter well , as he watched McFate rise from a street protester to a figure known nationally within his movement .
She became a leader of Pennsylvanians Against Handgun Violence and later a board member of Ceasefire Pennsylvania .
According to staffers at several gun violence prevention groups , she worked on the Million Mom March in 2000 , when hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Washington , DC , to demand stricter gun laws .
She joined the board of Freedom States Alliance , a network of nine state - based gun control organizations .
At States United to Prevent Gun Violence , a nationwide coalition of anti-gun groups , she was the director of federal legislation , an unpaid position that placed her in charge of the outfit ’s lobbying efforts in Washington .
In that role , she collaborated with national organizations including the Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center .
In 2005 , McFate ran for a board position at the Brady Campaign , which would have placed her in the inner sanctum of the nation ’s most prominent gun control group .
On her ballot statement , she described herself as a “ community activist and motivational speaker , ” “ a former presidential scholar , ” and a recipient of the “ Public Service Council ’s Community Champion Award in 1999 . ”
And she pitched her credentials for the position : “ I believe my volunteerism over 30 years to nonprofit organizations with disparate program goals has given me practical insights on what strategies are most effective …
My experience with broad coalitions working together for societal change has proven to me that our organization is on the right track to make our neighborhoods safer and to give our children their full life potential . ”
McFate lost the election , but she did not give up .
Several months ago , she told Paul Helmke that she was interested in an appointed board position for the Brady Campaign .
( Helmke recalls that he was concerned about placing her on his board because she was already deeply connected to other groups .
“ I did n’t push the idea , ” he says . )
In 2007 , she attended a summit convened by the International Association of Chiefs of Police that aimed to develop a strategy for reducing gun violence .
As an advocate working with both state and national groups , she was privy to the gun control movement ’s community ’s internal deliberations and in a position to know what was happening throughout the movement .
“ She ’s been active in everything and involved in every single major gun violence prevention organization , ” says Barbara Hohlt , executive director of States United to Prevent Gun Violence .
Despite her supposed commitment to the cause , her friends and colleagues in the gun control community considered McFate something of a curiosity .
Among other things , she had a tendency to drop in and out of contact , explaining away her absences by saying she had been vacationing aboard luxury cruise liners .
When the Brady Campaign ’s communications director , Paul Hamm , occasionally asked her to talk to the media about gun issues , she adamantly refused .
“ I would say , ‘ Please , Mary . ’
She would say , ‘ No , no , no , I do n’t want to . ' ”
Looking back , gun control advocates who worked with McFate can now see what might have been faint warning signs .
A few weeks ago , Hohlt says , she had what she considered an odd encounter with McFate when the pair was making preparations to take part in a conference call with other gun control advocates .
Rather than face a long - distance charge for the call , McFate , who lives in Florida but was in New York City at the time , insisted on dropping by the offices of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence to participate in the discussion .
Given that McFate appeared to be well off financially — she was always offering to travel to meetings and conferences , including NRA conferences , with no concern for cost —
Hohlt could n’t understand why she was demanding to come to this office for the call just to save a few bucks .
Nor could she fathom why McFate often pushed to share a hotel room with other gun control advocates at conferences and events when she seemed able to afford accommodations of her own .
Hohlt also thought it unusual that McFate served on the boards of several organizations simultaneously , since there was , as Hohlt puts it , “ a certain amount of competition between all the groups . ”
But she never doubted McFate ’s devotion to gun control .
Though McFate ’s colleagues viewed her as a friend , some found it strange that they knew virtually nothing about her life outside the movement .
She never explained the source of her personal wealth .
And Toby Hoover , the executive director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence and an activist who worked with McFate since the mid-1990s , says , “ She never talked about what she had done prior to this work .
I did n’t even know if she had a husband or kids . ”
Ceasefire New Jersey ’s Bryan Miller adds , “ She does n’t talk about her family .
I know nothing about her personal life other than that she lives in Sarasota , Florida .
For my closest friends in this movement , who also know Mary , it was a matter of low - level discussion that we did n’t know anything about her . ”
There was good reason for that .
Outside the gun control world , Mary Lou Sapone was , as Mother Jones has previously reported , a for - hire operative who spied on citizens ’ groups for corporate clients .
Property and phone records indicate that the two names belong to the same person .
Last week , a reporter for Mother Jones called the Sarasota phone number that McFate had given her gun control allies and asked the woman who answered if she was Mary Lou Sapone .
“ Yes , ” she responded .
But Sapone then refused to answer any questions about Mary McFate or her work for gun control .
She quickly hung up — and did not respond to subsequent calls and emails .
During Sapone ’s ascent through the ranks of the gun control movement , she worked for the NRA , according to a business associate .
In a 2003 deposition , Tim Ward , who had been president of the Maryland - based security firm Beckett Brown International , said that the NRA had been “ a client ” of Sapone’s .
( As a subcontractor for BBI , Sapone had planted an operative within an environmental group in Lake Charles , Louisiana . )
According to Ward , at his request Sapone had introduced BBI to the NRA in early 1999 .
And that introduction quickly paid off .
Billing records obtained by Mother Jones indicate that between May 1999 and April 2000 , the NRA paid BBI nearly $ 80,000 for various services .
In another 2003 deposition , Jay Bly , a former Secret Service officer who worked for BBI , was asked what type of work the security firm had done for the NRA , and he responded , “ Those are very sensitive issues , and I ’m just not comfortable going into it .
I ’m really not . ”
Later in the deposition , Bly said , “ I did a number of different things for the NRA in the area of investigation , the area of personal protection , in the area of event security , in the area of intelligence gathering , okay ? ”
Ward , during his own deposition , explained what a typical BBI intelligence - gathering operation would entail : “ We used informants that we would send to public rallies that these people were holding , public demonstrations .
These informants developed relationships where they could pick up a phone up and call in to find out where the next event was , where it was going to be held …
They are usually very eager to have somebody come and tote banners and scream and shout . ”
According to Bly ’s testimony , he and Ward continued their intelligence - gathering operations for the NRA after BBI acrimoniously disbanded around 2001 and Ward opened his own security firm , Chesapeake Strategies .
( These depositions were taken during a lawsuit filed against former BBI officials by John Dodd , the firm ’s primary investor . )
In his deposition , Ward identified Sapone ’s contact at the NRA as Patrick O’Malley .
From the late 1990s until 2002 , O’Malley was the deputy executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action , the NRA ’s political arm .
And according to billing records from BBI ( which in 2000 changed its name to S2I Corporation ) , O’Malley was BBI ’s liaison at the NRA .
Recent emails indicate that in 2007 and 2008 Sapone was working with O’Malley , who lobbied for the NRA after leaving the ILA and went on to work for a government relations firm retained by his former employer .
In recent years , O’Malley has served as the executive director of the Ballot Issues Coalition , an organization composed of hunting - rights groups , including the NRA .
O’Malley did not respond to numerous messages left at his office and home .
Asked about Sapone , James Jay Baker , who was executive director of the NRA ’s ILA when O’Malley was its deputy executive director , says , “ I do n’t have anything to say about any vendors at the NRA . ”
Baker notes , “ We got information from whatever sources we can , ” but he maintains that he was not aware of any infiltration of the gun control movement .
Baker , now managing director of Ogilvy Government Relations , a high - powered lobbying shop , is currently registered as a lobbyist for the NRA .
( After leaving the NRA in 2002 , both O’Malley and Baker joined the Federalist Group , a lobbying firm that was acquired by Ogilvy in 2005 . )
Contacted repeatedly , the NRA declined to comment on its past or present relationship with Sapone , BBI , or Chesapeake Strategies .
Informed of McFate ’s true identity , her friends and associates in the gun control community expressed shock and anger .
“ That astounds me , ” says Barbara Hohlt .
Of McFate ’s ability to maintain her cover , she adds , “ She was very , very good .
Everybody knew her for years and trusted her . ”
Brian Malte , director of state legislation at the Brady Campaign , says , “ Oh my … Of all the people . ” Kristen Rand , legislative director of the Violence Policy Center , remarks , “ This is totally bizarre . ”
And she adds , “ I would find it hardest to believe this about her .
She comes across as kind of dense — or she ’s putting on a good act . ”
McFate ’s ( now former ) colleagues note that she was well - positioned for many years to provide the NRA — or any other gun rights groups — the plans , secrets , and inside gossip of practically the entire gun violence prevention movement .
“ She had access to all the legislative strategy for every major issue for years , ” says Rand .
Another gun control advocate who worked with McFate and asked not to be identified recalls , “ She was one of those rare people .
As a volunteer , she wanted to know more and more about what people were working on . ”
With intelligence gathered by McFate , Ceasefire New Jersey ’s Miller says , the gun lobby could “ learn a lot : what the grassroots of the gun violence prevention movement intended ; where our priorities are shifting ; which legislation we would be promoting or fighting against and what sort of effort we would be putting into that ; who our targeted legislators would be ; what states and districts we deemed important enough to put an effort into ; our messaging , what our messaging would be before we put it out there . ”
Hohlt recalled several recent episodes in which McFate maneuvered to place herself in the middle of issues important to the NRA and others in the gun lobby .
One occurred this spring , when the London - based International Action Network on Small Arms was trying to persuade American gun control groups to attend a July meeting at the United Nations on small - arms control .
( A 2001 UN conference ended up establishing a program weaker than gun control advocates had desired , thanks to the intervention of the Bush administration , which had been lobbied by the NRA . )
States United to Prevent Gun Violence had never before been involved with international gun control issues .
And to participate in the UN meeting , it had to apply for credentials .
Hohlt says McFate pushed her to file for them .
Hohlt did so , and McFate ended up being able to learn what the anti-gun forces were planning for the UN session — including the delegates they intended to lobby , and the arguments they would highlight .
McFate also took a keen interest in a gun matter currently under consideration by the Department of the Interior , Hohlt says .
At the urging of the gun lobby , the agency has been mulling whether to change its regulations to allow people to carry loaded and concealed guns into national parks under certain circumstances .
( At the moment , a gun carried into a national park must be unloaded and kept apart from ammunition . )
The National Parks Conservation Association and current and former National Park Service officials have been fighting the proposed rule change .
“ When Mary heard about this , ” Hohlt recalls , “ she immediately asked to be on the email list [ of the opponents ] and she also got on the phone calls .
So she now knows the strategy of the people trying to fight this . ”
Similarly , when Mayors Against Illegal Guns , a group organized by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg , mounted a campaign against the NRA - backed Tiahrt amendment — legislation advanced by Rep. Todd Tiahrt ( R - Kan . ) and first passed by Congress in 2003 that prevents the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives from sharing gun-tracing data — McFate , according to Hohlt , made certain to participate in conference calls during which strategy for beating back the bill was discussed .
“ Whenever an issue comes up , she manages to get on the email list , ” Hohlt says .
The McFate operation , says Miller , “ would confirm for me the way that the gun lobby works , which is no rules , no question of fairness or honesty .
Anything that they can do they will do to protect the profits of the gun industry . ”
He notes that his organization has experienced low - level attempts at penetration in the past — a pro-gun advocate once posed as a would - be volunteer to get on his group ’s mailing list — but nothing on this scale .
Shocked to learn that McFate was a spy , gun control advocates have pondered the obvious questions :
How did she manage to fool everyone for so long ?
How much money did she earn for being a mole ?
To whom in the gun lobby did she report ?
The NRA ?
The firearms manufacturing industry ?
Did her covert effort extend beyond mere intelligence gathering ?
Did she manage to shape the decisions and actions of anti-gun groups to the gun lobby ’s liking ?
And was she the only one ?
While Sapone was a spy with a big secret , as McFate she led a relatively high - profile life .
In Sarasota , Florida , McFate heads the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution .
She has served as a substitute teacher at a local military academy , and once joined a coalition of residents who fought to save a 112 - acre forest from development .
Several years ago , McFate cofounded an organization called Lead Our Leaders , which boasted the “ audacious mission ” of changing “ the way politics is done in America ” by creating “ a mechanism for the American electorate to effectively communicate their policy instructions to our elected leaders . ”
A 2005 profile of her in the Sarasota Herald - Tribune began , “ Mary McFate wants to save the world . ”
( She told the paper , “ I ’m an optimist by nature . ” )
During a short - lived attempt at blogging , she wrote a small number of postings using the handle “ SolutionGal ” and touted her Lead Our Leaders effort .
( She stopped blogging in February 2006 , and the website of Lead Our Leaders is no longer active . )
Sapone ’s earliest known private intelligence operation occurred in the mid-1980s , when she served as an operative for Perceptions International , a Connecticut - based security firm .
Working for Perceptions , which has since been shuttered , she infiltrated the animal rights community for US Surgical Corporation , a target of activists who objected to its testing on dogs .
According to a 1989 article in New England Business , Sapone appeared on the animal rights scene in 1986 and quickly became “ involved in at least a half dozen animal rights groups . ”
She “ made a point of getting to know all of the key people in the movement , ” and “ traveled around the country to most protests , meetings and conferences . ”
At meetings , activists would later say , Sapone advocated taking illegal or violent action to advance the movement .
She befriended a 33 - year - old activist named Fran Trutt , who in November 1988 would be arrested for planting a remote - controlled pipe bomb near the parking space of US Surgical chairman Leon Hirsch .
According to Trutt , on her way to carry out the bombing she lost her nerve and placed a call to Sapone , who convinced her to follow through with the plan — a fact that prompted activists to accuse Sapone of acting as an agent provocateur .
( Another Perceptions International operative , Marcus Mead , drove Trutt to US Surgical on the day of the attempted bombing . )
In the 1990s — while working within the gun control community as McFate — Sapone formed her own intelligence - gathering business .
And she enlisted family members for its operations .
“ In our business , it ’s my daughter - in - law , Montgomery Sapone [ who ] does all the analytic reports , forecasting , and white papers , ” Sapone wrote to a client in an August 1999 email obtained by Mother Jones .
“ She produces a very professional product . ”
Sapone continued , “ We are warning our clients that activist groups are moving towards ballot initiatives …
And it ’s easy for groups like Greenpeace to emotionally shape a looming crisis in a 10 second TV spot 2 days before a referenda election .
My daughter Shelley specializes in that aspect of our business .
We are doing a lot of work now to help clients in the 2000 election . ”
A resume that Montgomery Sapone used around 1999 describes her role within Mary Lou ’s business : “ Collect and analyze intelligence on European activities of major international environmental organization for a company specializing in domestic and international opposition research , special investigations , issues management and threat assessment .
Write weekly intelligence update on European animal rights and eco-terrorist activity .
Assist in confidential litigation support research . ”
Sapone ’s son Sean , a Brown - and Harvard - educated paratrooper who served with the 82nd Airborne Division , was managing director of this firm , which at one point was called Strategic Solutions Group LLC and maintained an office in Washington , DC .
According to a Strategic Solutions Group invoice sent to BBI in November 2000 , Montgomery Sapone — a Harvard law school grad and Yale - trained anthropologist — once billed the security firm $ 400 for four hours of her time , which included a “ visit to target ’s office . ”
Sapone made her gun control work a family affair as well .
Around 2003 , Montgomery volunteered at the Brady Campaign , according to Becca Knox , the group ’s research director .
Occasionally , Montgomery would also sit in for her mother - in - law at Washington strategy meetings attended by officials of the gun control movement , according to the Violence Policy Center ’s Kristen Rand .
And Sean Sapone once offered to help Rand ’s group on a campaign against the civilian use of .50 caliber rifles , Rand recalls .
But after attending one meeting , Sean Sapone never followed through .
These days , Sean and Montgomery Sapone are better known as Sean and Montgomery McFate , a successful Washington couple whose current bios make no mention of any past intelligence - gathering or opposition - research work .
Sean is currently the program director of the national security initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center , a Washington think tank boasting an advisory board composed of four former Senate majority leaders : Howard Baker , Bob Dole , George Mitchell , and Tom Daschle .
An expert on military affairs , he previously worked for Amnesty International and for military contractor DynCorp .
According to an online biography , he helped to organize “ the first major legal arms shipment to Liberia in 15 years . ”
Montgomery has made a name for herself as one of the primary architects of the US military ’s human terrain program , which teams social scientists with military units in Iraq and Afghanistan to help soldiers better understand the local culture .
( The controversial program has been sharply criticized by the American Anthropological Association , which fears it may cross an ethical line , and has been described by detractors as “ mercenary anthropology . ” )
Now a top Pentagon adviser , Montgomery also contributed to the Army ’s Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted under the guidance of General David Petraeus .
Montgomery McFate did not respond to an email request for comment .
Nor did Mary Lou Sapone ’s daughter , Shelley McGonnigal .
During a brief phone call , Sean McFate told Mother Jones , “ I ’m familiar with what you are doing .
But I do n’t want to talk to the media . ”
Asked to explain his mother ’s double life as Mary McFate and Mary Lou Sapone , he said , “ You have to talk to Mary Lou . ”
Then he hung up .
When John Edwards admitted Friday that he lied about his affair with filmmaker Rielle Hunter , a former employee of his campaign , he may have ended his public life but he certainly ratified an end to the era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism .
From the start , the Edwards scandal has belonged entirely to the alternative and new media .
The tabloid National Enquirer has done all the significant reporting on it -- reporting that turns out to be largely correct -- and bloggers and online commentators have refused to let the story sputter into oblivion .
Slate ’s Mickey Kaus has been foremost among the latter , alternately analyzing and speculating on the Enquirer ’s reporting and ridiculing the mainstream media for a fastidiousness that has seemed , from the start , wholly absurd .
Like other commentators , he repeatedly alleged that a double standard that favored Democrats applied to the story .
Like the Enquirer ’s reporting , the special - treatment charge is largely true , as anyone who recalls the media frenzy over conservative commentator and former Cabinet secretary William Bennett ’s high - stakes gambling would agree .
Edwards , 55 , now admits that he had an affair with Hunter , now 44 , in 2006 , but denies that he is the father of the child she had in February .
Andrew Young , another former Edwards aide , has said he is the baby ’s father .
In a statement released Friday , Edwards said he was willing to take a paternity test ; doubtless we ’ll hear more on that issue .

So far , so sordid .
But what ’s really significant here is the cone of silence the nation ’s major newspapers -- including The Times -- and the cable and broadcast networks dropped over this story when it first appeared in the tabloid during the presidential primary campaign .
Next , the Enquirer reported that the unmarried Hunter was pregnant .
Still no mainstream media interest .
Indeed , never in recent journalistic history have so many tough reporters so closely resembled sheep as those members of the campaign press corps who meekly accepted Edwards ’ categorical dismissal of the Enquirer ’s allegations .
Late last month , Edwards came to Los Angeles , and Enquirer reporters trailed him to the Beverly Hilton hotel , where he met Hunter and her daughter in their room .
The Enquirer went with the story , and when no major newspaper or broadcast outlet even reported the existence of the tabloid story , bloggers and online commentators redoubled their demands that the mainstream media explain their silence .
The tabloid followed with a story alleging payments of hush money to Hunter and , this week , with a photo of Edwards holding an infant in what appears to be a room at the Beverly Hilton .
As pressure mounted on major newspapers to take some aspect of the unfolding scandal into account , editors and ombudsmen issued statements saying it would be unfair to publish anything until the Enquirer ’s stories had been “ confirmed . ”
Well , there ’s confirming and then there ’s confirming .
One sort occurs when an editor mutters , “ Find somebody and have them make a few calls . ”
Then there ’s the sort that comes when that editor summons an investigative reporter with a heart like ice and a mind like Torquemada ’s and says , “ Follow this wherever it goes and peel this guy like an onion . ”

Suffice to say that the follow - up of the Enquirer ’s story fell into the former category in too many newsrooms , including that of The Times .
Some of this reticence may have reflected a regard for the feelings of Edwards ’ wife , Elizabeth , who has incurable cancer .
There was , however , every reason to set that deference aside .
First , it was less than unlikely that Elizabeth Edwards was unaware of the allegations .
( She says now she knew of the affair in 2006 . )
Second , Edwards ’ name has surfaced as a possible running mate for Barack Obama and as a possible attorney general or Supreme Court nominee -- posts in which character and candor matter .
Finally , throughout his political career , Edwards has made his marriage a centerpiece of his campaigns .
It ’s interesting that what finally forced Edwards into telling the truth was a mainstream media organization .
ABC
News began investigating the Edwards affair in October , but really began to push after the Beverly Hilton allegations .
When ABC confronted Edwards with its story ( which confirmed “ 95 % to 96 % " of the tabloid ’s reporting , according to the network ) , he admitted his deception .

With that admission , the illusion that traditional print and broadcast news organizations can establish the limits of acceptable political journalism joined the passenger pigeon on the roster of extinct Americana .

A ban on handguns in Washington DC has been ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court .
In a 5 - 4 decision , the justices upheld a lower court ruling striking down the ban .
They said individuals had a right to keep handguns for lawful purposes .
It is the first such case considered by the court in decades and is expected to have effects on gun laws across the US .
Debate over the exact meaning of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms has raged for years .
The latest ruling says that the constitution " protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia , and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home " .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says the ruling is of profound importance , as it enshrines for the first time the individual right to own guns and limits efforts to reduce their role in American life .
A well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
Second Amendment to the US Constitution
Q&A : Washington DC gun laws Webb blog : Gun crazy ?
Politics of court ruling Since 1976 , the private possession of handguns had been prohibited in the nation 's capital , while rifles and shotguns had been required to be locked away or dismantled .
The DC city council argued that the ban was needed to help keep violence and murder rates down .
But the measure was challenged by a security guard , Dick Heller .
He argued that if he was allowed to have a handgun at work , he also had a constitutional right to have one at home .
In March last year , a federal appeals court agreed with Mr Heller that the Second Amendment protected an individual 's right to keep and bear arms and that the DC ban was unconstitutional .
The city appealed against that ruling , with the case going to the Supreme Court .
The debate centred on whether the Second Amendment , ratified in 1791 , protects an individual 's right to possess guns , or simply a collective right for an armed militia .
DC residents offer their views on the court ruling
In pictures
The Bush administration welcomed the court 's decision .
" We 're pleased that the Supreme Court affirmed that the Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and bear arms , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
The case has been closely watched , with dozens of outside groups filing opinions , known as " friends of the court " briefs , setting out their arguments for or against the DC ban .
The Supreme Court 's ruling could spark challenges to gun control laws in other parts of the US , experts say .
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence - which supports gun control - said the decision would " most likely embolden criminal defendants , and ideological extremists , to file new legal attacks on existing gun laws " .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the ruling would not affect the work of his coalition , Mayors Against Illegal Guns , which advocates stricter gun laws .
" The court clearly ruled that reasonable regulations are permitted under that decision , " he said .

As promised , Terrafugia 's Transition flying car recently made its public debut at the AirVenture air show in Oshkosh , Wisconsin , and while it did n't actually fly , it at least looks a whole lot more real than those renders the company had been showing off .
Terrafugia has also gotten a bit more specific about the vehicle 's specs , with it promising that the Transition 's weight will stay under 850 pounds thanks to its carbon fiber body , and that it 'll get about 23 mpg from its 100 hp Rotax 912 S engine .
Unlike something like the fabled Moller Skycar , however , this one wo n't do vertical take offs and landings , so you 'll either need a really long driveway or access to a runway of some sort .
There 's also no word on what it'll cost , but Terrafugia says it already has fifty customers awaiting delivery of the vehicle , which the company is promising will happen in 2010 .
If you 're still craving more flying car promises , you can head on past the break for an interview with Terrafugia co-founder Samuel Schweighart courtesy of AVweb .

Python is for people who want to program
Saw a great quote the other day on comp.lang .
python , in response to a troll questioning Python 's usefulness in the " real " world :
Python is for people who want to program , not REAL WORLD programmers .
( Python encourages a sense of fun , and people on the comp.lang .
python group tend to like to have fun taking the piss out of trolls . )
Not that " real world " programmers do n't use Python — just that people who place a lot of value on being a " real world " programmer are probably using Java or C# or something .
Meanwhile , people use Python because it's a great language and they love programming in it , not because it will make people think they 're " real world " programmers .
This goes back to the Python Paradox described by Paul Graham : python programmers are generally good hires , not because Python is ( necessarily ) a better language than Java or C# , but because
… people do n't learn Python because it will get them a job ; they learn it because they genuinely like to program and are n't satisfied with the languages they already know .
This is becoming less of a sure thing as Python gains popularity and starts to look good on " real world " resumes , but I think it 's still true that people use Python because they like it .
' The fact is that government , like a highwayman , says to a man : ' Your money or your life . ''
~ Lysander Spooner
As thinking people , let us gaze upon this curious phenomenon called ' government ' and consider the benefits supposedly endowed upon the common folk .
I regret to say that our schooling imbued within us a primal loyalty to this institution ' a bit of mass programming that is in no way a coincidence .
Government does not create social order .
We generally harbor the assumption that society would descend into chaos had we no centralized means of authority .
This idea is bunk .
Social order stems spontaneously from the voluntary behavior of individuals .
We discovered early on as a species that we can cooperate .
We need no third party to tell us that a person stands to benefit by trading with others .
By freely trading what excess I may have of goods , labor , or services that I produce well , I can obtain those things I desire but cannot produce well on my own .
I have an incentive to produce more than I can consume myself .
Self - interest in the absence of coercion provides the means for win-win social relationships .
This activity , barter , leads logically to indirect trade .
If I need something from you , but you do not want what I have , I go to Rufus over here who has what you want , but wants what I 've got ( still a pretty inefficient way to go , though ) .
Thankfully , over time , this process bubbles to the surface one or two commodities that most people realize just about everyone wants to some degree or another ( usually a luxury item ) .
This good becomes the trading standard , i.e. , money .
With money , we gain the ability to calculate profit and loss , and shift our activities so that they match the desires of other actors in the market .
This mechanism of self - interest gives us a way to determine if we use our resources in a way that satisfies others .
Many well - meaning leftists believe government provides the means for humans to cooperate on a large scale .
This idea is not true .
Boiled down to its core , the institution designed to pool resources and activities towards a common goal is the corporation .
But are n't corporations breeding houses of greed ?
Are n't corporations able to get away with things regular people can't ?
The answer to both questions is an undeniable ' yes . '
But the reason many corporations have become those things stems directly from government involvement .
Laws came about that treated a corporation as a virtual separate person that can be treated as such under law , giving the opportunity for those within the corporation to essentially act in nefarious ways and ' blame it on the corporation , ' if you will .
The people doing the harm have ' cover . '
Understand that this concept is not inherent to the idea of the corporation .
Like Tolkien 's orcs , created by torturing and mutilating elves of old , corporations have become twisted and distorted from the original free market concept .
Separate the wheat from the chaff .
Government attracts the corrupt .
All other things being equal , humans prefer leisure to work .
It becomes logically conclusive that some humans will be willing to live at the expense of others if the opportunity arose .
Government provides these types of people just such an opportunity .
It is a magnet for those who wish to live at the expense of others .
Government does not and can not create wealth .
Wealth is created by producers producing more than they need to immediately consume .
The manifestation of this activity in a complex economy with a high division of labor is saving .
In short , human prosperity is due at its root to one and only one behavior : the act of saving some of what you gain through labor or trade for a later date .
Prosperity is impossible without this activity .
Do I need to repeat that ?
Government obtains its funds through coercive means .
Would you produce extra so that it can be taken from you by force ?
Trade does not occur unless both parties benefit from the trade .
Government substitutes mutual benefit with threats of violence .
All other things being equal , humans will attempt to minimize the loss of wealth through theft .
They will produce less .
Less production means less saving .
Less saving means less prosperity .
Read it and weep .
Government is Force .
The threat of force exists behind every government rule , regulation , and mandate .
If you deny it , then I ask you what risk you take should you decide to violate one .
Force will be levied against you to comply .
Realizing from the discussion above that social order is spontaneous ( and that includes the potential to create activities like security and jurisprudence ) , I ask you :
Is it necessary to institutionalize force for a peaceful , prosperous society to exist ?
Government , far from ensuring this society exists , does more to prevent it from happening than any other single human failing .
Government is an engine of disorder .
War .
Imagine if you can what would drive hundreds of thousands of people to slaughter each other .
Now imagine that occurring without government .
Only through mass , centralized government do the social conditions exist for genocidal slaughter .
It is true that religion provided the incentive for many wars of the past , but these wars could not have taken place anywhere near to the extent that they did had there been no coercive institution driving the populace either through threat or propaganda .
Conclusion
Every -- EVERY -- government ' service ' can be provided by an unfettered free market more fairly , more efficiently , and more humanely , including fire , garbage collection , protection and security , and road transportation .
Let the Twentieth Century with its propaganda - driven wars of genocide be testament to the failing of government to protect human society .
Pepsi ( PEP ) is trying to steal Coke 's thunder ( KO ) .
Pepsi will be the first to launch the new - generation of calorie - free drinks that Coke ( KO ) has been bragging about for more than a year .
The drinks are naturally flavored with a stevia - based sweetener .
Stevia is a controversial herb that the FDA has yet to approve , but both drink - makers are confident the herb is harmless .
The Japanese have been ingesting stevia safely for decades , and there is no conclusive evidence that the herb is harmful in any way .
Therefore , in a few weeks , Pepsi will be launching a new enhanced water drink , SoBe Life .
It 's not allowed to sell them in the US , so it will begin by experimenting in several Latin American markets , starting in Peru .
Pending formal FDA approval , Coke hopes to have a stevia - sweetened soft drink in US customers ' hands by the end of the year .
There 's obviously no guarantee this new sweetener will be a success .
PEP and KO will have to get rid of the licorice - like aftertaste stevia is known for , among among other obstacles .
However , a natural , calorie - free , safe , and tasty sweetener would a boon to either company .
Or as the Wall Street Journal puts it , the " holy grail " .
No wonder the rush .

After two bad years , honeybee population thrives
This summer , consumers swarming to farm stands and supermarkets may find the local produce extra succulent , thanks to a resurgence in the honeybee pollination .
Beekeepers in New Jersey say it 's part of positive trend in other areas around the country .
" One - third of the food you and I eat is directly affected by honeybee pollination , " said Tim Schuler , New Jersey 's chief bee expert .
Honeybee pollination adds more than $ 15 billion in value to about 130 crops including berries , fruits , vegetables and of course , flowers , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Bee pollination was limited during the past two years because of the destructive presence of Colony Collapse Disorder , a mysterious phenomenon that killed a large number of honeybee colonies .
" I have n't had any beekeeper tell me of ( a case ) Colony Collapse Disorder , " said Mark Longstroth , Michigan State University Extension district horticulture and marketing agent for southwestern Michigan .
Mike Hansen , state apiarist for the Michigan Department of Agriculture , said that while he heard of one eastside farmer losing 2,000 colonies , he does not foresee a huge problem with bees dying off .
" We expect 25 to 30 percent losses in the state this year , " Hansen said , which he said has become the norm .
Hansen said that a good supply of bees from the south , especially Florida , has helped pollination this year , which he said is " going well . "
" They are finding all they need here , " Hansen said .
In New Jersey , beekeeper Lester Shimp said he has seen signs of the honeybee revival in removing numerous swarms .
" In a typical year I receive about eight to 10 calls for bee removal .
This year , it was twice that , " Shimp said .
" The natural tendency of a bee colony to swarm is when a colony grows too big for their home , " beekeeper Stephen Kozachyn said .
" If the swarms are any indication , honeybees are definitely on their way back , but I would be cautiously optimistic , " he said .
Hansen agrees with that assessment , and said that people should not let their guard down .
" Things like this go cyclical , " the Michigan apiarist said .
Hansen said the USDA is involved in a study , following three truckloads of bees to monitor their health and any possible problems with migratory beekeepers .
Schuler said the public can help protect the honeybee population by " not using pesticides indiscriminately and growing plants that are beneficial to pollinators . "

Wilkins Ice Shelf has experienced further break - up with an area of about 160 km² breaking off from 30 May to 31 May 2008 .
ESA ’s Envisat satellite captured the event – the first ever - documented episode to occur in winter .
Wilkins Ice Shelf , a broad plate of floating ice south of South America on the Antarctic Peninsula , is connected to two islands , Charcot and Latady .
In February 2008 , an area of about 400 km² broke off from the ice shelf , narrowing the connection down to a 6 km strip ; this latest event in May has further reduced the strip to just 2.7 km .
New images highlight the rapidly dwindling strip of ice that is protecting thousands of kilometres of the ice shelf from further break - up .
According to Dr Matthias Braun from the Center for Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces , Bonn University , and Dr Angelika Humbert from the Institute of Geophysics , Münster University , who have been investigating the dynamics of Wilkins Ice Shelf for months , this break - up has not yet finished .
" The remaining plate has an arched fracture at its narrowest position , making it very likely that the connection will break completely in the coming days , " Braun and Humbert said .
Braun and Humbert are monitoring the ice sheet daily via Envisat acquisitions as part of their contribution to the International Polar Year ( IPY ) 2007 - 2008 , a large worldwide science programme focused on the Arctic and Antarctic .
The ASAR images used to compile these animations were acquired as part of ESA ’s support to IPY .
ESA is helping scientists during IPY to collect an increasing amount of satellite information , particularly to understand recent and current distributions and variations in snow and ice and changes in the global ice sheets .
ESA is also co-leading a large IPY project – the Global Interagency IPY Polar Snapshot Year ( GIIPSY ) – with the Byrd Polar Research Centre .
The goal of GIIPSY is to make the most efficient use of Earth - observing satellites to capture essential snapshots that will serve as benchmarks for gauging past and future changes in the environment of the polar regions .
ASAR is extremely useful for tracking changes in ice sheets because it is able to see through clouds and darkness – conditions often found in polar regions .
Long - term satellite monitoring over Antarctica is important because it provides authoritative evidence of trends and allows scientists to make predictions .
Ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula are important indicators for on - going climate change because they are sandwiched by extraordinarily raising surface air temperatures and a warming ocean .
The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced extraordinary warming in the past 50 years of 2.5 °C , Braun and Humbert explained .
In the past 20 years , seven ice shelves along the peninsula have retreated or disintegrated , including the most spectacular break - up of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 , which Envisat captured within days of its launch .
Traffic to consumer magazine Web sites increased 8.5 percent during the second quarter , averaging 69.7 million unique monthly visitors over 64.2 million during the same period last year , according to the most recent figures from the Magazine Publishers of America .
Magazine Web site users accounted for an average of 462.8 million " sessions " per month during the second quarter this year , an increase of 9.9 percent .
Visitors spent an average of 2.05 billion minutes per month during the second quarter , up 21.5 percent from the same period last year .
Second quarter monthly reach for magazine sites grew 42.2 percent of the total U.S. Internet population , the MPA said , posting a 4.3 percent gain over the same period in 2007 .
It ’s clear , though , that the increase , in part , can be attributed to the relatively small traffic magazine sites had to begin with .
Other media sites , including television networks and newspapers , have seen substantial growth in recent months .
CBS Corporation , which acquired the CNET Networks in May for $ 1.8 billion , saw its Web traffic grow to 48.19 million unique visitors in the month of July , up more than 130 percent from June , according to ComScore ’s most recent figures .
The New York Times
Web site had 43.85 million unique visitors in July while the Glam Media network had 43.03 million .
The MPA tracks 314 consumer magazine - branded sites from its member publications .

Robot clarinet player and scientific results
This clarinet - playing robot was built by a NICTA − UNSW team for the Artemis orchestra competition in 2008 , where it was the winner .
The contest rules require embedded device robots , with mass less than 20 kg , that play unmodified musical instruments .
Why a clarinet robot ?
No , the aim is not to replace human musicians .
The robot serves three functions :
It is an interesting challenge to understand and to implement some of the complicated things that humans do when playing music .
This is the reason behind the competition .
It is interesting for the music acoustics lab to see how well we understand clarinet playing .
The robot has lately been the subject of experiments to analyse how the pitch , loudness , timbre and transients produced by the clarinet depend on the fingering , mouth pressure , lip force and damping , bit position , reed hardness and mouth geometry .
Some results and sound files are given below .
But first , let 's hear the robot playing and compare it with a human player .
Duet with Deborah de Graaff
At a seminar in Music Science , the robot played a duet with eminent clarinet soloist Deborah de Graaff .
Some results from a tongueing experiment
How do players vary the attack in a tongued note on the clarinet ?
In a separate experiments , we measured what humans do – but of course they vary several parameters .
How the individual parameters interact is the subject of a paper by Li , W. , Almeida , A. , Smith J. and Wolfe , J. ( 2016 ) " The effect of blowing pressure , lip force and tonguing on transients : A study using a clarinet - playing machine " J. Acoust .
Soc. America , 140 , 1089 –1100 , and Almeida , A. , Li , W. , Smith , J. and Wolfe , J. ( 2017 ) " The mechanism for initial transients on the clarinet " J. Acoust .
Soc. America , 142 , 3376-3386 .
Some results from the input - output experiment
How do players vary the pitch , loudness and timbre of the clarinet ?
For any given fingering , reed and mouthpiece setup , they have several control parameters , including the mouth pressure P , the lip force F and the bite position .
This question is the subject of a paper by A. Almeida , D. George , J. Smith and J. Wolfe from our lab : " The clarinet : How blowing pressure , lip force , lip position and reed “ hardness ” affect pitch , sound level , and spectrum " J. Acoust .
Soc. America , 134 , 2247-2255 .
One set of results is shown below , along with some samples of the sound files used .
Plot of frequency ( black lines ) and sound level ( greyscale ) as functions of mouth pressure ( x axis ) and lip force ( y ) .
Sound samples for the red points in the plot above .
The note is ( written ) G4 , the G in the throat register .
The robot's ' teeth ' are at 10 mm from the tip of the reed , a Légère synthetic # 2 .
The shaded area is the range of these parameters that played a note .
( This particular experiment had no squeaks . )
Black lines show lines of equal frequency f , given in hertz at the side of the playing area .
The grey scale shows the sound level L measured near the bell .
The small grey dots show the measurement points , from whose results this plot was made , using polynomial fits to the sections f( P , F ) and L ( P , F ) .
The red dots show the positions of 9 points at which recordings below were made , in the relative positions shown .
We also varied the bite position , the reed ' hardness ' and the fingering , and the results are given in the paper linked above , along with detailed discussion .
Some comments and explanations follow .
The first is known to anyone who teaches beginners : most combinations of parameters do n't play a note .
Second , most that do sound bad : you have to choose carefully on the ( F , P ) plane to make a good sound .
For this experiment , there was no feedback and no adjustment of the parameters to improve the sound ( unlike in the movie above ) .
Second , this instrument plays flat : we kept the air very close to room temperature ( about 20 °C ) so as to avoid temperature variations .
Third , the dotted line at the right is a limitation of the pump used in our experiment : it could n't blow harder than about 8 kPa .
Some humans can .
Real clarinettists tend to play with moderately high F , towards the top right of shaded region , partly to play in tune , partly to avoid squeaks , and partly because it sounds better .
In his region , the lines of equal f decrease with increasing P .
Hence we can make some observations from this ( and other related ) plots : ( 1 ) a clarinettist can play a crescendo or diminuendo at constant pitch by adjusting P and F together : as P is increased , F should be lowered .
( 2 ) however , the lines of equal f and equal P are almost parallel , so it 's not so easy to play that crescendo without going flat .
Some clarinettists are surprised to see that , over most of the range , the pitch increases with increasing mouth pressure .
The reason for their surprise is that they think that loud notes tend to go flat .
This is true , but not as a direct result of blowing harder .
If we look at the plot we see that the only region where the sound level is very high ( the darkest areas on the plot ) is at bottom right , where F is low and P is high .
But the important point is that players must lower F ( i.e. drop the jaw or relax the bite ) to be able to blow very hard and still make a sound : at moderate or high F , high P closes the reed completely .
And , as the plot shows , horizontal lines across the plot ( i.e. constant F ) keep crossing iso - frequency lines : the pitch rises with increasing P .
Real clarinettists also use their vocal tracts to adjust intonation .
( That 's a future step for the robot . )
There 's an introduction to vocal tract effects here and techncial papers on our publications list .
The ' wake - up ' performance
Although the robot had just been ' born ' , it already knew how to read music files , and its coordination was pretty good .
So it skipped some of the stages that a human musician would go through .
On the other hand , the Mark 1 version is deaf – it does n't yet have feedback .

The clarinet robot began when John Judge from NICTA visited the Music Acoustics Lab and the Mechanical Engineering School in November 2007 and suggested a collaboration to enter the competition .
Both were keen to collaborate .
For Mechanical Engineering , the project represented an interesting design challenge on a short time - scale .
( The photo shows Jean , Joe , Mark and John . )
The pump and controller were kindly supplied by ResMed .
As you can tell , this is our first attempt at a music robot , and it was built in six months .
So many of the features that we planned to put in are still absent .
For both NICTA and the Music Acoustics lab , the robot is now a platform for research on a number of issues relating to musical performance and the player - instrument interaction .
And no , we 're not aiming to put humans out of a job .
For us , the robot is a complementary part of our research into clarinets and how to play music badly or well , and what makes the difference .

In the dozen or so years until 2007 , it had become as close to a global orthodoxy in economic policy making as we ever see : Central banks should target a low and stable rate of inflation .
This replaced earlier orthodoxies -- such as that central banks should maintain a fixed exchange rate with an ounce of gold , which was abandoned in 1971 .
Though inflation targeting left far more latitude for government officials to expand the money supply , it too ultimately proved too great a shackle on the exercise of central bank wisdom .
The U.S. Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , the Bank of England and other rich - country central banks have generally made 2 % inflation , give or take a smidge , the touchstone of good performance .
Fed officials have for 20 years paid public obeisance to their statutory " dual mandate , " to maximize employment as well as stabilize prices .
But in practice , until recently , they treated it much like a mildly embarrassing biblical injunction that could be safely ignored , if not repudiated .
Yet one of the great attractions of inflation targeting was that it only appeared to constrain central bankers ' discretion .
Other objectives which today 's central bankers actually think are far more important -- in particular , keeping growth of that great aggregate of aggregates , " gross domestic product , " above 0 % -- can be safely pursued in place of price stability .
This is because the inflation target is what 's called a " medium - term objective . "
The Fed is actually free to slash its key interest rate from 5.25 % to 2 % , stuffing the world with dollars , even as inflation soars past 5.6 % ( a 17 - year high ) , because the public 's inflation expectations will supposedly remain " well anchored . "
That is , we will eventually stop charging and paying each other ever higher prices for stuff , in spite of the flood of Fed money , because we know that once the Fed prints enough of it to fix our problems it will get really mad over the inflation we produced and target it with a vengeance .
Amazonが、書籍販売をはじめとした小売業とS3やEC2のようなUtility Computing事業を営んでいるのはご存じの通り。一見すると関連性のない2つの事業をやっているように見えるが、実は小売業をやっていたからこそ、今Utility Computingの領域で一つ頭がでているのだという話がNick Carrの " Understanding Amazon Web Services " というエントリーに書かれており、なかなか面白かった。
小売業というのは非常に利益率の低いビジネスであるが、
その小売業でも利益が十分でるような効率的なプロセスとシステムを
Amazon は持っている
小売業でも利益がでるくらいの効率性、言い換えれば
コストの低さを実現しているので、第3者にサービスとして提供する際も、低価格での提供が可能となる
また、世界最大規模のe- Commerceサイトを運営しているため、自社の事業を支える基幹システムがUtility Computing事業に乗り出す上での基盤のインフラとなった
というあたりがポイント。3点目については、Googleも同様のアドバンテージをもっているが、1点目、2点目はAmazon固有の話であり、頭一つ抜き出した大きな要因だろう。
利益率の高いソフトウェア、テクノロジー企業というのは、その利益率の高さにあぐらをかいて、意外とシステムやプロセスの効率性が悪い。特にソフトウェア企業にその傾向は強く、薄皮を1枚1枚はいでいくコスト意識をもったソフトウェア企業を私はあまり見たことがない。
私はソフトウェアに関連したテクノロジー企業に勤めており、現在自社業務のアウトソースを通した会社のダイエット活動に勤しんでいる。アウトソース対象の業務プロセスを精査したところ「まぁ、今までよくこれでやってきたなぁ・・・」と驚きを感じることが多々あるし、委託先からも「この点とこの点はシステム化させて頂かないと受託できません」というような指摘を恥ずかしながらよく受ける。
なので 「小売業でも利益がでるプロセスとシステム」Amazonの売りは、他のUtility Computing事業に乗りだす会社には中々出せない味なのではないかと私は踏んでいる。
ここ数年の投資が花開いてき たAmazonのWeb Service事業。今後も目が離せない。
By a lopsided 69 - 28 vote , the Senate has passed the so - called FISA compromise bill , extending the power of the executive branch to authorize warrantless interception of international communications , and effectively granting retroactive amnesty to telecoms that participated in the extralegal surveillance program authorized by President George Bush after the attacks of 9/11 .
Efforts to amend the legislation to delay the controversial immunity grant pending completion of an investigation by the Inspector General 's office , to condition amnesty on a finding that the underlying surveillance was constitutional , or to strip immunity altogether , were soundly defeated — as expected — under threat of presidential veto .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ( D - IL ) voted in favor of the amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , to the dismay of many of his own supporters .
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) were among those who broke with their party 's standard - bearer to vote against the bill .
Civil liberties groups , including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation , almost immediately issued statements condemning the vote .
Both organizations pledged to challenge the new legislation in court .
The Fourth Amendment will provide the probable basis for any challenge to the provisions permitting the executive branch to authorize electronic surveillance of overseas targets , even when in communication with Americans , without obtaining a probable cause warrant .
The Supreme Court has already ruled unanimously that a warrant is required for domestic surveillance , even when conducted in the name of national security , but has never provided decisive guidance as to what the Constitution requires in the case of foreign intelligence surveillance that implicates the privacy rights of US citizens .
The legal grounds for a challenge to the immunity provision , which directs a federal court to dismiss the lawsuits against any telecom that received a written directive from the government authorizing surveillance , are somewhat less clear .
But one possible approach was outlined earlier this year in a column by law professor Anthony Sebok .
According to Sebok , the abrogation without compensation of a vested tort claim could be seen as a violation of the Fifth Amendment 's Takings Clause .
Similar sentiments were expressed on the Senate floor yesterday by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) .
" I am aware of no precedent for the Congress of the United States stepping into ongoing litigation , choosing a winner and a loser , allowing no alternative remedy , " said Whitehouse .
" And I believe the constitutional problem with doing that as a separation of powers matter is particularly acute where the cause of action that is being litigated in the judicial branch is a constitutional claim . "
Whitehouse predicted that the immunity provision would ultimately be found unconstitutional .
While the legislative battle is over for the moment , the consequences of Sen .
Obama 's support for the bill , deeply unpopular with much of his " netroots " base , remain to be seen .
Obama had previously pledged to oppose any bill containing retroactive immunity , but later committed to support compromise legislation even if amendments to strip that provision failed .
The " Get FISA Right " campaign , which now boasts the largest user - created group on Obama 's own social - networking site by a wide margin , will continue to exert heavy pressure on the candidate in the months to come .
The group is circulating an open letter urging Obama to pledge to revisit the FISA bill as president .
Does the recent Capone move into Miami anticipate a move into Cuba maybe now being worked on the inside as Castro comes down ?
End of the day , the problem is NOT that the Vatican faction in the Justice Department either supports or opposes ' burning souls ' and transforming men into women ; its that they collaborate in it .
The Bush administration subsequently directed the Solicitor General to intercede on Smith 's behalf out of an interest to expand federal court jurisdiction over state probate disputes

Peter Bis
August 28 2003
Aug 22 , 2006
kept 26,000 students in their locked dormitories on the first day of classes for the semester .
Peter Bis makes big claims and spouts big numbers ; millions and tens of millions - even hundreds of millions - of dollars .
What 's it all about ?
Summarized : What the Jews have billed on BisLifetime : $ 80 million .
Broken out : $ 60 before / $ 20 million after arriving Washington D.C. 2005 .
Further broken out : $ 19 million 2005 ~2008 as this blogspot was being posted essentially as his book advance though they did n't let Bis actually have the money but lined their own pockets with it [ and kept Bis living on the street ] , followed by a relatively paltry $ 1 million 2009 ~ 2011 after the blog posting stopped .
Which is ironic to say the least ; in 2007~ 2008
Bis was trying to buy ice class bouy tender hulls surplused by the Canadian government for sale at roughly $ 20,000 [ twenty thousand dollars American ] in two lengths - 165 ' and 148 ' - and could n't come up with the money .
Well , the million bucks now pays for his apartment anyway .
Back to business : Somebody at the Heritage Foundation adapted a Russian child and now wants to ' notch ' the child 's spine because the child 's brain is allegedly sending too many signals down the spinal cord and the kid 's toes curl .
Peter Bis alone defends the child .
At least they 're not contemplating ' dulling the action down ' with electro - shock ; still , the thought of ' notching ' any three - year - old child 's spine offends him particularly in light of past incidents involving the foster / adapted / step children of senior Republicans used in political manuevering [ James A. Baker III 's granddaughter sucked into a pool drain and Senator Smith 's son committing suicide , though Bis is not making broader claims here about the politics of the Heritage Foundation or its employees ] commensurate to previous incidents involving adapted Russian children in the United States .
To the point at which laws were passed about exactly that .
RUSSIAN MINISTRY PROPOSES TOUGHENING ADOPTION REGULATIONS
OVER CHILD DEATH IN U.S.Anonymous .
Daily News Bulletin . ( English ) .
Moscow : Mar 21 , 2008 .
MOSCOW .
March 21 ( Interfax ) - The Russian Education and Science Ministry is proposing to amend the federal law governing the adoption of orphans by foreigners to " better protect the rights of the adopted following the recent death of a 14 - month - old Russian - born child in the U.S.
"
The statement issued by the ministry on Friday talks about " the tragic death in the U.S. of Nicoli Emelyantsev , who was adopted by U.S. citizens , Fyodor and Kimberly K. Emelyantsev , in February this year .
" Nicoli Emelyantsev 's adoption " was arranged without assistance from an accredited representative office of a foreign organization but following the so - called independent adoption procedure , " the statement says .
This procedure " does not rule out mediation by organizations or individuals not subject to any control and not bearing any responsibility in the adoption process , " it says .
" This tragic case once again testifies to the need to amend the law to improve guarantees that the rights and legal interests of orphans adopted by families of Russian citizens living abroad , as well as families of foreign citizens and stateless persons , are protected " it said .
The ministry said it had drafted a bill that would require foreign citizens wishing to adopt Russian children to provide information about themselves to an operator of a state - run database of orphans only through authorized representative offices of foreign organizations involved in the adoption business .
In addition , the amendments would " make it mandatory for potential adopters to undergo psychological examination and would introduce a special program for training families before adopting a child , " it said .
According to the ministry , 12 cases of violent deaths of Russian children adopted by foreign citizens were recorded from 1991 to June 2007 .
Eleven of them took place in the U.S.
In all of the cases the adoptive parents were found guilty of the children 's deaths .
End citation .
For types of activities in line with defending the child they 're busting on Bis .
Bis busts back , claiming Mayor Adrian Fenty has been recently busted either ' for ' or anyway ' with ' cocaine at least twice - people say " Barry " ;
Bis says " FENTY " [ apparently Bis has sources which are clear and unambiguous on the point ] - and elements associated with city government then stole his gear from the sidewalk in front of the Exxon Station , Mass Ave and 2nd NE where it was neatly covered just down the sidewalk from the Heritage Center dorm .
In fact a lot of it [ if not the bulk of Pete 's stuff ] comes from young people moving through their various programs .
Obviously this town revolves around people knowing people ; all efforts to get this worked out are appreciated , and friends of Pete are asked to stop by and lend support as may be possible .
Does the Russian embassy still have an interest in the child [ who is only three years old ] , and can somebody contact them ?
Bis claims he himself is NOT implanted with an MKULTRA neuroprosthetic , but in fact , if anything MUST be done to the child , an electrode is infinitely preferable to ' notching ' the spine , and Putin would probably be able to make that happen if something HAD to be done .
Other side of the coin :
In the late 1980s / early 1990s Peter Bis allegedly circulated 300 pages of information on Thermo Biofusionary Genetic Engineering to and through the United Nations in Switzerland .
He claims he can walk into an embassy and go elsewhere , while people here evidently enjoy keeping him available to play against the lizard or lizard - ine human figure behind the World Bank as long as there is no cost associated with it .
If they have Pete living on the street for free , why pay him ?
Of course you would not expect them to put that to the test in this manner - actually pushing him into an embassy with Bis picking WHICH embassy ; he blusters Russian but they famously have bureaucracy to deal with and the Israelis would probably be the first to offer him real refuge ostensibly because he can claim Jewish heritage , skipping on the various aspects of the technology until he is over there .
Can we back this pressure off somehow ?
Who is Peter Bis , and how much of what he says is really true and can be verified ?
This blogspot tries to outline some of the issues and areas he works .
Your interest is appreciated , understanding there is no substitute for simply going to 2nd and Mass Ave NE and meeting him .
Peter Bis has said for YEARS that Hillary Clinton 's senate seat is owned by the Mafia , that even in the 1990s they were significantly claiming that the seat could serve as a stepping stone to the presidency for the right person , and that a man directly related to the Gambino crime family worked out of Clinton 's senate office apparently for the military judge advocate general .
Actually , Bis said a man identifying himself as being part of the Gambino crime family claimed to work out of Clinton 's senate office - both parts of which Bis found credible ; it was n't his accusation but rather the other man overtly claimed affiliation .
NOW - December 2008 and maybe for the past six weeks - ' a source on the street ' totally unrelated to Bis but proven valid in other matters is saying Hillary Clinton is into the Mafia for six million dollars , and that the other congressional delegates from New York hate her and got rid of her by pushing her into the slot at the State Department .
Indirectly but significantly validating Peter Bis .
What that source did not know is whether the two parts of the statement were really ' cause and effect ' - she 's into the Mafia for the six mil and they 're certainly uncomfortable with that so they bounced her .
Still oozing his trail of unctuous piety , it is very possible to see Schumer - the senior senator from New York - unhappy about somebody being unable to clean up their business with the Mafia never mind their having gone there in the first place though he is almost certainly wired himself .
The secondary question is whether that scenario is really a CIA effort to place Hillary in control of globalized organized crime structures as Secretary of State - ' diplomacy by other means ' - commensurate to husband Bill being head of globalized charity structures taking a great deal of money off the Middle Eastern governments and princes .
Of course including the Saudis .
The sotto voce are whispering in mock scandal about Hillary getting bounced over Mafia affiliation , but was that really the intended consequence ?
CIA maximizing effectivity - the scandal being she 's falling up instead of down , as her husband is in with the princes .

Huma M. Abedin is a Pakistani - American aide to United States Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
[ She ] served as traveling chief of staff during Clinton 's campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election .
Abedin was born in 1976 in Kalamazoo , Michigan .
Her father was an Islamic and Middle Eastern scholar who died when she was 17 years old [ approx .
1993 ] .
Her mother , a professor in Saudi Arabia , is Pakistani .
At the age of two [ 1978 ] , her family relocated to Jeddah , Saudi Arabia .
Abedin returned to the United States to attend George Washington University .
Huma Abedin began working as an intern for the White House in 1996 and landed an assignment with the First Lady .
She has since risen to the role of Hillary Clinton 's right - hand woman .... PETER BIS has a source who says Obama also has ties to Saudi Arabia ; ' 2nd tier ' media sheets have suggested Abedin is more than just an aide to Clinton and its an interesting coincidence particularly if Obama does pick Clinton to be his Secretary of State .
Two Space Shuttles [ ALLEGEDLY ] launched on 26 Oct 2008 , journeying 14 days to a rendezvous with Asteroid 433 EROS [ approx .
08 Nov 2008 ] which they intend to push out of orbit [ CERTAIN ] , so it gains speed and ultimately crashes into Earth .
A new president elected 04 Nov 2008 , they will have to work fast to stop the Bush gaming , making the guys who are out there totally destroy the asteroid rather than ' pushing ' it or putting rocket packs on it and launching it .
NEW 16 Nov 2008 .
A shuttle filled with American military people definitely launched exactly as Bush was hosting a pre-summit dinner with world leaders at the White House on the evening of 14 Nov 2008 .
Backing out the schedule , a 14 day flight from there would rendezvous with the asteroid on 28 Nov - so it looks like our earlier source missed on at least one of the launch dates .
A big finance meeting is scheduled for 15 Nov 2008 in Washington D.C. , and the suspicious timing suggests that Bush and his tool Sarkozy set it up to validate their concept and actions .
We previously reported Bush bought big land holdings in Paraguay , which may anticipate ' asteroid - entry ' in the northern rather than the southern hemisphere .
OBAMA is the bastard son of an Egyptian somehow married into the Saudi royal family .
Obviously names would be helpful , and PETER BIS is working with his foreign sources .
October 24 , 2008
They can take more than one wife - and certainly did forty five years ago - but apparently enough money was at stake for the situation was handled a different way .
Or that is what PETER BIS hears , supported by some odd factors 'at the outside edge of coincidence ' in the United States .
First is the ' reciprocity concept . '
McCain was n't born in the United States either , and in racketeering essentially equivalent candidacies it seems probable [ ' more likely than not ' ] they 'd put some hook on the other side for the Democrats to sink in our flesh .
Article .

Section .
1 . No Person except a natural born Citizen , or a Citizen of the United States , at the time of the Adaption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the Office of the President .... Wait a minute .
Being the son of an Egyptian rather than an African does n't change Obama 's eligibility - who says he was n't born here ?
Interesting , is n't it ?
Second is the otherwise self - destructive remarks of House Representative Michele Bachmann [ ' swept up in a firestorm of criticism ' , Pioneer Press , 21 Oct 2008 ] quasi - supported by others such as Robin Hayes in North Carolina who is a pretty decent and low - key guy .
Hayes was friends with Ed Schrock in the House , and they were - Hayes is and hopefully will continue to be - among the better guys over there .
Third is the effort to get rid of Egyptian President Mubarak which has been half -*** ed kicking around Washington for for the past three or four years .
Turns out the Egyptians have been behind a surreptitious effort to attack us which is actually pretty funny when you think about it .
The larger point is that among ' the players ' this is n't ' on the sly .
' Fourth - and so on - gets into looking at ' the churn ' kicking up on the web , much of which is CIA - originated forwarded by various players .
Poor Republicans are the little boys who cried wolf before and now nobody believes them .
' False flagging ' is n't beyond them here , but it would mean getting into the source network that supports Peter Bis .
It would be a longer term effort than they 've been known to undertake in the past , but it would be possible .
Is the current Communist government of China really nothing more than a thirteenth dynasty ?
And certainly no more legitimate than that ?
Interestingly , Mao appears to have been a handpicked candidate , with both the ' Great Leap Forward ' and subsequent ' Cultural Revolution ' triggered from the outside .
Even more interesting is that the Communists started corrupt and have remained corrupt , whereas history tends to suggest the previous dynasties started in virtue and grew corrupt though the subsequent dynasty obviously had an interest in disparaging the previous administration .
So what about a foreign dynasty in the United States - as happened certainly in Egypt and probably in China .
Well , it would be a way of physically representing us as being in decline [ which we evidently are ] .
Some changes , but more than have already been forced through under Bush ?
Worse than ' No Child ' or ' Oxley - Sarbanes ' ?
Probably not , and McCain certainly is a part of the problem which now appears to have figured in his selection .
" My friends , McCain is a rusty old windbag .
George Allen was the Republican choice for 2008 and probably would have won , so they took him down the hard way .
" AND peterbis.blogspot.com appears to have been vindicated on our earlier ' fix ' allegation [ as follows ] - suspecting that was at the heart of the subsequent Colin Powell endorsement of Obama on national television .
Shrewd choice .
Remember , the military has a critical interest in NOT backsliding into cannibalism .

The fix is in .
Obama is out .
Why ?
Over what ?
Jurors finding Stevens guilty hang the noose around his neck ?
Stevens in its entirety involves accepting the sculpture of a fish and an armchair that vibrates ; the home modification was a bogus CIA cover [ put it this way ; for the purposes of the trial , Stevens does n’t own a home – he owns a multilevel jacking platform that is partially enclosed ] .
Palin comes from Alaska , and it looks like the deal is ‘ taking Stevens out means putting Palin in . ’
So a jury in the District of Columbia knocks the Democratic contender for the presidency out over a bronze fish and an animated armchair ?
The other possibility is ….. cannibalism .
Not just that Obama engaged in cannibalism , but that he was exactly warned about it , given a mechanism for both intelligence and avoidance , made at least peripherally aware of Peter Bis and http://peterbis.blogspot.com, and went ahead and engaged in cannibalism anyway .
Peter Bis on the takedown .
Biden is said to have three lobes in his brain [ most people have two ] ; both Biden and McCain are implanted with neuroprosthetics .
They are n’t the only ones – so is Stevens .
‘ Throwing the fix ’ or averting the hostile takeover might mean going to the sentient plasma structure or the human - alien interface which Biden certainly ought to be able to do .
Stevens matters really should end in a mistrial over the ‘ sexy phone call ’ and the multilevel jacking platform CIA cover scam – throw it out and send ‘ em home ; it otherwise will reverse on appeal anyway .
Inside one of the ' chem - trail ' wide bodied airframes ; a heroic Air Force ' Nam vet delivers the picture .
The program apparently originated in a series of White House MAP ROOM meetings in the later stages of the Clinton administration ; spraying has been undertaken on a widespread basis since November 1998 .
Reports of additives in food [ apparently coordinated by a group in the FBI ] and monitoring of urine date to 2007 and early 2008 , perhaps suggesting a time delay in saturation or effectivity in the human body .
No idea whether or not either the spray or the mitigation relates to spiking Alzheimer 's and dementia rates .
Harry Reid leads the Senate .
He is from Nevada .
He says he opposes ‘ Yucca Mountain ’ , which is the nuclear waste repository the federal government periodically threatens to build in his state .
PETER BIS says he [ BIS ] can get rid of the nuclear waste utilizing Accelerated Radiation Decay [ ARD ] , eliminating the entire Yucca Mountain issue .
Both men are immediately thwarted by the government , but resolving this situation may be as easy as getting documentation the government already has on BIS to the leader of the United States Senate , allowing him to decide how credible PETER BIS is or is not .
How difficult can that possibly be ?
On the night of the State of the Union address 2008 , two policemen told BIS he should have taken the ten million dollars for his technology or gone to work for ten million dollars bringing the technology forward essentially for somebody else .
That number – ‘ ten million dollars ’ – came up previously .
PETER BIS was in Europe 1989 - 1991 , and again in 1997 .
One opinion has it that he should have stayed there .
Prompted to answer that opinion , BIS said he had to come back ‘ for his mother . ’
Within twenty four to thirty six hours , a woman evidently associated with government agencies was telling PETER BIS she wished ‘ mama ’s boys would n’t come here ’ [ to Washington D.C. ] ; ‘ turn around ’ within the government agencies is obviously relatively immediate .
Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a book suggesting ‘ the Jews ’ try to confuse and neutralize [ assert their own dominance ] by putting numerous oblique or nuance issues ‘ on the table ’ in media or in political debate .
In ending the Yucca Mountain controversy , bringing forward advanced medical technologies , and going beyond the current - orchestrated - ‘ energy crisis ’ and controversies , PETER BIS essentially seeks to solve problems and eliminate the manipulation undertaken by the Jews .
The catch is that he is Jewish or claims significant Jewish heritage ; in that sense there is an element of ‘ Jew versus Jew ’ to the controversy [ typical in say Zionist CIA water boarding versus the ACLU ] which is emblematic of their penetration of media and politics and is hard to ignore .
Essentially PETER BIS thinks the ten million dollars is much too low ; this blogspot outlines the argument .
Dwight Eisenhower was elected President of the United States in 1952 after commanding the United States military in Europe and coordinating the Allied war effort during World War II .
Ike in Korea 1952 .
After the Nazi government went into exile , we got some of their technology .
Here is Ike with Von Braun , keeping in mind the big nuclear explosions with calculated radiation patterns we were undertaking in the Pacific - apparently designed in part to mitigate whatever alien threat might emerge .
This is Allen Dulles .
Together with his brother John , he had interaction with Eisenhower .
The following sequence looks realistic , and would explain quite a bit .
He told Ike that we needed to undertake the nuclear testing .
Ike said ' all right .
'He told Ike that the aliens were going to undertake some medical experimentation on humans [ more than they 'd already done in the ' intelligent design ' approach ] .
Ike said ' all right .
'He told Ike that the aliens wanted to migrate us to unisexual status with a -sexual reproduction apparently via homosexuality [ a current CIA designator ] , that the aliens backed a collectivist agenda [ evident in the Communist slash Nazi paradigm ] , AND that the aliens were going to insert ' a being ' into a human life - form in Michigan as it turned out .
Ike said '**** that .'PETER BIS is homeless in Washington D.C.
He essentially claims to be that alien , he says the government singled him out and backed a number of unique attacks on him [ taking him out of the ultra - light aircraft business for example ] , and he wants to leave the country - via boat .
Unfortunately PETER BIS presents a mixed picture ; few people screwed by the government are as friendly with the police as he is [ 'be safe , enjoy ' ] , and threatening to walk into the Israeli Embassy - after they were behind the slaughters in Europe during the World Wars , most recently continued in Rwanda and Kosovo - certainly does n't help .
Any government files of serious weight are going to include interagency transmittals , showing how and when information originated and became available probably in a particular pattern across a number of years - now decades .
Across governments .
Has the information flow remained the same since the Eisenhower years ?
Now is an excellent time to revisit the decisions which led into the situation , and domestic political developments suggest we need to do that .
http://peterbis.blogspot.com has experienced a major , major failure .
We began posting in late 2005 .
It has abruptly come to our attention that in early 2007 it was none - the - less possible for manipulative elements in politics and government to significantly erode or corrupt a conceptually responsible figure who seemingly exhibited awareness of PETER BIS , the blogspot , and the issues at stake .
How can this be ?
How can that happen ?
The government has interests in PETER BIS , indicated by both technical means and street observations .
Definite .
PETER BIS claims to be an alien - from ' outer space ' or a distant place / galaxy , and if you believe that you almost certainly believe it in spite of PETER BIS and not because of PETER BIS .
Really at issue is not what he says or what you believe ; at issue is what the government has in their files on PETER BIS , and in particular when those files originated .
The BIS conceptualization of the Van Allen Belts in conjunction with the Earth 's electric field [ metal core , imposed on the flag of South Korea ] .
BIS figured that out - sharp guy .
But would n't an alien with hugely advanced technologies and intelligence arrive already knowing that ?
There is a sentient plasma structure in the Earth 's atmosphere , which apparently corrupts human essence , and may ultimately be responsible the ' Messiah sequence ' which started in ancient Egypt and most famously includes Christ [ which the Jew apparently figured out and their legitimacy as a religion is based on their ' awareness of ' and ' collaboration with ' but not ' worship of ' it ] .
The plasma structure arrived 10,000 years ago .
For the sake of the argument , let 's say its name is ' Bob . '
PETER BIS says his alien group last sent a scout in 3,000 years ago , or 1,000 years B.C. - 7,000 years after the plasma structure arrived .
If they now send another scout in , would he [ PETER BIS ] be coming to see us , or would he really be coming in to see ' Bob ' the plasma structure ?
Why even actually touch down on Earth - why not stay on the outside and check in with Bob ?
BIS says the plasma structure can travel the relatively short distances among the inner planets , but not the longer distances between the gaseous planets [ which probably relates to the size of the Sun and the amount or intensity of radiation it produces ] .
There probably was life on Venus and Mars , there is n't any there now , and it stands to reason the plasma structure wiped it out before coming to Earth .
BIS says he does n't know or anyway that theory is n't his .
Is he kidding ?
An alien scout sent from a highly advanced group or more intelligent base structure that had somebody here 3,000 years ago and maybe 3,000 years before that - does n't know ?
BIS says he wo n't date without a DNA sample on this planet , as some evidence suggests sexuality can be migrated .
And in fact the CIA has a designator for migrating people to the uni-sexual condition with a - sexual reproduction that we 're starting to commonly see in fish and lizards .
Though where he comes from they already are uni-sexual .
That is normal to him and supposedly more advanced ; should n't he be encouraging this ?
YIN is feminine , dark , and duplicitous , while YANG is masculine , light , and opened ; one thing about BIS is that he seldom misses an opportunity to attack what he calls the ' Boy 's Club ' [ in religion , law enforcement , or wherever else he sees it ] , but he exhibits absolutely no awareness of the deeper grounding of it in the Earth cycle beyond tactical scenarios in which women can attack men by tangling their energy field in the man's .
He instinctively hates it because his father attacked his mother , but unless you intend to change the energy field of the Earth its something you need to learn to work as yoga and zen people do .
You expect to get a certain ' zen - like ' quality from a highly intelligent super - advanced life form , and there ain't a drop of it in PETER BIS .
None .
Humor , bitterness , cunning , some wisdom - absolutely ; zen ?
No .
This is not a recreational blogspot ; at issue is the government file on PETER BIS .
The main file or the root file - not the transient stuff in the Capitol Police Department or what he fed the FBI back in the late 1980s and 1990s .
BIS says he inhabits the body of a child who was born in 1951 and died in 1953 from polio .
In fact , as ' alien essence ' he was in the hospital room above the bed looking down on the child when it 's human essence ' died ' and left the door opened for him to enter .
Asked to date the government 's awareness of him , BIS first guessed mid to late 1960s when there were a lot of UFO sightings , and later guessed second grade or about 1957 - 58 based on an incident at school when they should have called his mother but did n't .
Doubtful .
Eisenhower met the aliens at an Air Force base in California in early 1954 ; looking at all the nuclear testing and the MKULTRA CIA designator the evidence suggests ' everybody ' - Earthlings and aliens - knew about PETER BIS absolutely from his arrival in 1953 .
Right from the start .
His father - the father in his Earth family - was an *** hole ; the question is whether some of that was staged or at the direction of the CIA , trying to diminish BIS or somehow contain him .
Eisenhower was evidently not happy about being confronted by the aliens - certainly not with a ' plant ' already inserted .
Did they have to additionally ' groom ' the father , or was placing PETER BIS in that family good enough ?
PETER BIS heard from a Marine in San Diego that the CIA calls him ' Alien 1 ' , but we do n't know if that is a category [ whether or not he is the only alien in the category ] or an identifier unique to him .
He is NOT actually the first alien and , judging from their treatment of him , he is n't the most important alien or even a particularly high priority alien .
He was just right there when the door opened , or when they opened the door .
Again , we started posting in 2005 , and recently discovered efforts were made to erode or corrupt a major political figure in early 2007 .
PETER BIS does represent the ability to fight corruption at its very basic level , significant effectivity [ he does report out without withholding - he will do it or say it ] , and he is an immediate tool to deploy .
If it is a matter of additional validation - as it appears to be - endless posting here is not the answer ; we need to obtain the source documents on PETER BIS - whatever and wherever they are .
Rubber meets road .
The rest is background .
Dualing headlines :
We find out the arson on Pennsylvania Avenue SE here in Washington last August [ 08/08/07 ] , with significant CIA ties to the crime via the Agency overview designator for messing with rush hour traffic and having truckers lay down their loads on foggy highways , leads straight into the ultra - conservative Heritage Foundation .
So it turns out that , at least by association , the Heritage Foundation is also involved in the effort to pin the FIRES - that one and the CIA burning down Eastern Market maybe three or four short blocks straight east from there - on homeless people .
Stigmatize the homeless - when its the wealthy bastards that did it BOTH times .
Versus the headline about CIA activity .
PETER BIS busted a CIA executive named Thomas J. Mattingly who in late 2004 - early 2005 was trying to procure energy for CHINA from the Nigerians .
Mattingly was CIA and he was n't trying to get energy for us - he was trying to get energy for them , via Nigerian generals retired in Virginia .
Pictured is Willaim Jefferson , D - La House of Representatives , who got caught with $ 90,000 in the freezer compartment of his fridge when the FBI raided .
That also had something to do with Nigeria [ as it happened , supposedly cell phones or communications , but that is all they 've said so far , and nobody wants to talk about how the whole thing went down .
Other than us ] .
Stacy Rosenberg , head of the Krewe of Muses , looks to have been one of the executives in the CIA New Orleans , and Howard Wolpe - Congressman who PETER BIS says knocked him out of the aircraft business - looks to have been a CIA executive placed to cover the saturation of the disease in various African communities after Allard Lowenstein brought the CIA - engineered AIDS virus to the continent .
Now Obasanjo .
Hillary Clinton or anyway the ' Clinton camp ' has a street guy with a sign in Washington D.C. saying Obama is somehow tied to Obasanjo , leader of Nigeria .
We did n't want to stop with Plame .
We wanted to keep going , naming more - rather than fewer - CIA executives .
Heather Grant , Scooter Libby 's wife for example , is said to have been CIA , and maybe was the handler for Marc Rich [ who Giuliani placed overseas and Bill Clinton pardoned ] and Pincus Green .
Its even possible Plame herself tied directly to Nigerian generals either over there or in Virginia and the CIA energy scheme [ Niger to Nigeria ; did anybody ever try to claim Plame was precluded from looking at some aspects of energy development ? ].
Giuliani briefly toured with Angelina Jolie 's father - and then dropped out of the race ; there was n't any goodness in that for anybody .
What 's surprising is the extent to which people do n't like Clinton on Capitol Hill , and , for somebody who is n't even here , how much support there is for Romney on Capitol Hill .
The people on the sidewalk - us on the sidewalk - are just trolls who do n't themselves significantly interact with either Clinton or Romney ; it is all second - hand or significantly ' trickle down ' feeling , but it is real .
Cecil Butler was supposedly a developer who took $ 150 million dollars out of Lawndale - a ghetto Chicago neighborhood , but in fact that looks to have been a CIA funding mechanism .
No word on the Chicago developer who repeatedly contributed to Obama 's campaigns and is now in jail , but Clinton has repeatedly smeared Obama with that ; it wo n't be good if it turns out the guy was only carrying Agency water .
The Clintons had twelve hundred of our guys killed at Fort Benning and taken elsewhere to be cut up and eaten one winter in the 1990s leading into the 9/11 constellation of ' terror events ' and us doing human sacrifice with our own guys in Iraq .
Whatever it is in Nigeria , is it worse than that ?
Is it worse than Bill Richardson and Peter Bourne screwing democracy in Japan by siding with conservative elements in Gimento or the Liberal Democratic Party against the coalition government and American business in Tokyo mid-1990s under Clinton - if you 're talking about whole countries being macro- screwed by the Agency ?
Frankly , Hillary is n't ' clean ' in it by any means .
If she wants to start naming CIA executives she should , but its surprising to find the Agency letting her do that for her own political ends , and its difficult to believe anybody could possibly be dirtier in it than she is .
The Clinton - Whore - Death - Cult corrupts Obama with the Satan - is - Christ paradigm in the abruptly notorious killing of four girls with a ' crazy ' mother in SE Washington D.C. before a dismayed CIA - Mayor Fenty and governmental establishment which badly fumbled the hand - off to PETER BIS .
PETER BIS did not drop the ball on them ; they dropped the ball on PETER BIS - but nobody looks good on this one .
If it does mean a return to the Temple of Set ' boy - rape ' - era of the late 1970s and ' 80's with ' select ' or otherwise designated savvy Capitol Police running late night interference bringing victims into the Congressional Office Buildings , it will only serve them right for trashing PETER BIS or ' turning the cold shoulder ' when he could have saved them . [ Are they **** ing CRAZY ?!?
They actually have professional guys who are suppose to be all over this crap , they know who PETER BIS is by name , they know where he sleeps and pretty much where they can find him - since mid-2005 at the latest , and now this ***t?!?
F*** YOU , welcome back to the bad old days when there 's just going to be some late nights alone on a post and you 're ashamed of what you ' turn a blind eye to ' with rumors afterwards ] .
Hey , Officer *** hole , what 's a cup of coffee versus going to home and telling your wife you 're covering for boy - rapists - and then the next morning telling her not to tell her friends ?
Ask some of the old cops what went on up there .
Actually , you can pour coffee in BIS until he pisses dark brown , but he still can't help you unless you let him in on the way the play is breaking .
Here 's this thing went down over the days , weeks , months , years , and eons .
Evil spirits thought to include Laura Bush and Catherine Zeta -Jones wiped out civilizations on Mars and Venus , sucking the ' essence ' or ' life force ' into a sentient plasma structure which came to Earth about 8,000 years before Christ or 10,000 years ago and now lives in the upper atmosphere .
More literally , it ' primarily resides ' in the upper atmosphere with direct linkages or corruption mechanisms securely tied into the human life communities on the surface of the Earth .
This was one of the first topics PETER BIS posted on , but he was unable to precisely name Laura Bush and Catherine Zeta - Jones at the time .
They also apparently brought water and probably ' atmosphere ' at least from Mars if not also Venus with them when they came , and Hillary Clinton is now associated with this Whore - Death - Cult whether or not she was associated with it to begin with [ 10,000 years ago ] .
It may be possible to ' kill ' the sentient plasma structure - atmospheric nuclear testing is banned - but then we will [ presumably ] have forever lost the essence of life on Mars and Venus which experience suggests may be recovered at least in part from the plasma structure .
Understanding how Obama got corrupted into it requires acknowledging the situation does offer temptation and reward perhaps including significant ' long life ' if not true immortality .
In a single incident in the early to mid mid-1990s , the Clintons had about twelve hundred guys killed late autumn or winter at Fort Benning , Georgia ; at least some of the bodies were apparently eaten .
The Whore - Death - Cult exists .
A guess is that they somehow feed the plasma structure the ' human essence ' - quite a bit ; think Spanish Influenza on top of World War I and the Stalin - era mass starvation in the Ukraine as a precursor to World War II .
The Jews are at least in on it if they do n't direct the feeding , and BIS has fairly immediate Jewish credentials but that is getting ahead in the story .
Joseph is a short Ethiopian who stands on across from the fountain of Columbus on Columbus Circle outside Union Station in Washington D.C. , waving signs and demonstrating as Congressional staffers arrive via Metro and trains for work .
He may be African nobility ; government security agencies in the United States are aware of him and a woman he paid a few dollars to have sex with him stole a condom full of his semen .
He called the police but they did not effectively respond ; truly there is no recourse in law when a ten or twenty dollar whore steals your semen - even if an agency put her up to it .
An older black man with Styrofoam core board signs which mostly say bad things about 9/11 , Senator Schumer , and the Jews - a lot of which is true - also demonstrates on Columbus Circle outside Union Station , sometimes at the same time as Joseph .
He [ Joseph ] says with true belief that the older black man is a ' known ' or identified police informer or anyway a tool for surveillance mechanisms .
Joseph has seen the older black man deploy .
January 18 , 2008 About 6:40 a.m. a woman says the Clinton attack mechanisms are going after Obama down in Carolina .
About 8:15 a.m. the older black man arrives , coming down off Capitol Hill to demonstrate on the median at Columbus Circle with a sign that says ' Obama Murdered The Four Girls In D.C. ' or words to that effect [ the word ' Horrible ' was included somewhere in the verbiage sequence ] .
In the course of brief questioning , he said ' God told him to expose Obama .
'' So much bull ****' you say .
We wish .
Obama has or used to have an ' off campus ' office for fund raising and strategy close to PETER BIS on Mass Ave NE. , and last spring [ 2007 ] - at some point apparently before the four girls died - there was an issue about him [ Obama ] smoking or not smoking and PETER BIS thinking he saw Obama kind of sulking about ' maybe ' smoking but who cares , maybe a couple times , and Obama 's office started sending PETER BIS the occasional meal , and the head of Obama 's security introduced himself to PETER BIS .
They made approaches , but never bellying up to the bar - ' let 's work this thing out , ' but rather oblique and hesitant .
They sideswiped PETER BIS .
Hit 'n ' run .
And got burned .
People want to touch the vibe but not the burden .
PETER BIS was positioned in a restaurant to see the street in front of the building - nice day in maybe February or March 2007 - and he saw a ' Code Pink ' feminist demonstrator photographing all the security elements around Obama .
Single story about a white woman hanging all over Obama one night outside the office - maybe on Mass Ave NE - but it is n't immediately clear how that might relate to the Code Pink surveillance effort or a Clinton - Whore - Murder - Cult approach to Obama .
BIS knew the Code Pink photography was ' a thing ' and he tried to blow the whistle or grab a conductor but he could n't stop the train .
[ Wikipedia ]
In February 2007 , standing before the Old State Capitol building in Springfield , Illinois , Obama announced his candidacy for the 2008 U.S. presidential election .
Describing his working life in Illinois , and symbolically linking his presidential campaign to Abraham Lincoln 's 1858 House Divided speech , Obama said : " That is why , in the shadow of the Old State Capitol , where Lincoln once called on a house divided to stand together , where common hopes and common dreams still live , I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America . ”
Speaking at a Democratic National Committee meeting one week before the February announcement , Obama called for putting an end to negative campaigning .
" This can't be about who digs up more skeletons on who , who makes the fewest slip - ups on the campaign trail , " he said .
" We owe it to the American people to do more than that " [ end citation ] .
Yeah , that 's about when it was .
PETER BIS is ENDLESSLY dedicated and a hard worker , inquisitive , and at least over time fairly thorough , but he is not a great listener , his documentation is n't good , and at this time he has no real lab or research facility .
We do n't know what the actual exchanges were and while he can recreate a sequence - in - theory the whole situation is just lousy .
Efraim Halevy , head of the Mossad , went to North Korea in the early 1990s and got them to cut a deal with him probably on the poison gas and scud missiles .
They tell him when they ship scuds into the region .
HOW did he get that deal ?
He brought something with him or anyway showed them something - we do n't know what , but it must have been fairly impressive .
Obama is a grown up and not naive in the situation - they may have approached him in the guise of something else but who knows ; Sam Brownback is said to have practiced West African voodoo .
Do n't abandon the man - just that he should n't have NUMBER ONE been surprised - and the approaches to BIS suggest he was n't - and NUMBER TWO taken the Satan - is - Christ Clinton - Whore - Murder - Cult deal .
Hillary Clinton : 1,200 in a single incident we know about , lifetime is said to be higher .
Obama : 4 . Hopefully he wo n't do this , but Obama could go for another 1,196 and he and Hillary would just be tied .
What does extraction look like ?
How do we get Obama out of this ?
He has a CIA affiliation ; Cecil Butler is , was , or appeared to be a CIA executive in Chicago who took $ 150 million out of Lawndale - the real depressed southside neighborhood where three hundred plus old black people died in the Clinton - era orchestrated heat wave of 1994 or 1995 .
Obviously it was n't appropriate to take money out of that neighborhood .
Butler deserves to get a nasty note in his file over that , and it should have been possible for Obama to speak to it and admit some guilt without going further into really problematic areas [ Hillary Clinton has never been ' vetted ' - people including Vince Foster die before she gets ' vetted ' ] .
Now things are more difficult .
Do n't do anything to any more people like that - no matter how it was , or what they say , or what the original deal was .
We can lose Hillary pretty easily [ very easily - she has doubles ] ; Obama is a bigger deal than that .
This election is a big deal , and now we know they 've evidently taken steps to expand the Satan - as - Christ corruption in a continuity mechanism .
The rest of this blogspot is just footnotes save for one important point ; by midafternoon 18 Jan 2008 elements of Team peterbis.blogspot.com understood this situation to be true .
There was validation .
Classic ' bland man ' with hat and sun glasses and Allen Dulles pipe on a path watching a ' recent ex-con ' out of central casting who was n't quite close enough to the path to violate his parole or be held for questioning but was more than close enough to ' threaten to be a threat ' in a by - the - text - book deployment scenario .
Another indicator five or ten minutes previous to that maybe for the Hillary Clinton CLOVERLEAF spray operation which might have been related [ man breathing through a rag ] .
Sure , protection from Hillary Clinton is much appreciated [ they tried to bust PETER BIS with a legless black in a wheel chair Saturday or anyway BIS said they did and got validation back but that ' validation ' might have been his own spray blowing back on him ] , but the larger picture is not cause for optimism .
There is significant corruption in the election scenario and the agencies are factionalized or anyway do n't put a stop to it .
Our nation is spiraling downward and the government is largely the problem .
Earth - ling who reads this - you are the sole repository of this knowledge .
Try to tell deaf media that does n't want to hear or show blind people who do n't want to see .
It is up to you now , and ' the authorities ' will try to disparage you , diminish you , and ultimately shut you down .
Prisoner without a name , blog without a blogger .
Hillary in a spiraling free fall , they 're going to go back to the double , and this is their " declaration of intent " , published in The Washington Post 08 January 08 , page A9 .
This marks an attempt by her strategist Mark Penn and ' inner circle ' - having been sacked for a devastating loss - to come back to the line of scrimmage strong , in theory deploying to create a Jamie Gorelick - type " firewall " and start afresh , shielding the February 5th outcomes from what has been a debacle so far .
It is so cheap it is almost too pathetic for words .
What they intend to do , frankly , is cheat , which really only makes a bad situation worse because it backs into Hillary 's CIA affiliation .
Could be the doubles are n't happy in the Senate and the scheme is n't Hillary 's idea but she wears it , returning to question how relevant Hillary Clinton is in what is conceptually her own campaign .
With critical assistance from the Central Intelligence Agency .
An unidentified man in the Senate gallery once said he had found himself next to her at a party or reception and she did n't have any smell .
None at all , which may additionally suggest lizard characteristics or a third chromosome .
And this was early in New Hampshire , showing aspects of criminal conspiracy if the double has ever appeared on the floor of the Senate or voted .
Senators are not suppose to vote by proxy ; not even elected yet in this campaign , Obama and certainly Edwards - who must know better - may face a ' high crime or misdemeanor ' rap if they let the double [s ] back in .
Second half of the problem : PETER BIS cannot get verified professional CNN reporters to remotely touch the story .
He knows them , they know him , and one even told him they 've been threatened with disciplinary action if they so much as look at this website .
CNN as the " Clinton News Network " indeed .
PETER BIS was after a boat - 64 ' 5 " x 10 ' 6 " [ draft ] x 19 ' , ex-Canadian Inland Marine Fisheries , $ 21,000 reduced to $ 16,000 , and somebody bought it out from under him .
That is the second time this has happened .
No more warning shots across the bow :
Why I Believe Bush Must Go , George McGovern , Sunday , January 6 , 2008 ; Page B01 .
He 's out .
PETER BIS is sick of screwing with the guy and his Council on Foreign Relations ' New World Order ' West Bank - Expansionist Zionist backers with their toadying " hedge fund " rigged bet investment house predatory friends .
After the 1972 presidential election , I stood clear of calls to impeach President Richard M. Nixon for his misconduct during the campaign .
I thought that my joining the impeachment effort would be seen as an expression of personal vengeance toward the president who had defeated me .
Today I have made a different choice .
Enough is enough , and Bush is done .
PETER BIS is on the phone with the feds late night , and a pricey BMW pulls up with an old guy in a nice mohair coat and brim hat - maybe a fedora - driving and a kid with him .
The kid gets out .
He has a strong New York accent which automatically triggers the PETER BIS Gambino crime family situational awareness paradigm .
" You want to talk to the cops ? " the kid says , without showing BIS any identification which of course BIS says is standard procedure [ particularly given the circumstances ] .
BIS tells the kid to **** himself , waving the phone and saying he 's already talking to the feds .
The kid goes into the gas station .
PETER BIS puts down the phone , goes over to the car and gives the old guy who is driving a couple cards for this website .
The kid comes out of the gas station .
PETER BIS tells him that he'd given a couple cards to 'his father . '
The kid says " He 's a cop - he ain't my father . "
The kid gets in the back seat of the car like maybe he 's going to hit PETER BIS out the window or something ; BIS is already walking around the car to get the licence plate [ pricey BMW , Virginia registration ] , and the old guy driving pulls the car around to him , rolls down the window , rips up the two cards in front of PETER BIS , and says " Ask the New York paparazzi about your girlfriend . " **** ing Bush has got to go .
Of course , there seems to be little bipartisan support for impeachment .
The political scene is marked by narrow and sometimes superficial partisanship , especially among Republicans , and a lack of courage and statesmanship on the part of too many Democratic politicians ...
The dominant commitment of the administration has been a murderous , illegal , nonsensical war against Iraq ...
The financial cost to the United States is now $ 250 million a day and is expected to exceed a total of $ 1 trillion , most of which we have borrowed from the Chinese and others as our national debt has now climbed above $ 9 trillion -- by far the highest in our national history ...
It really is n't the money ; its that Bush has done all this big crazy stuff without taking fairly minor steps in level - setting awareness or unifying the country , and beyond that taking care of business with the alien .
Back in the news - but PETER BIS was there first .
With amazing new inside information on intern Chandra Levy , who ran around with a respected [ and married ] member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence , and died in what was really the first big search - turned - to - murder - investigation of the new century .
The BIS inquiry into the death of Levy - beyond his ' ongoing and evolving ' consideration of Princes Di matters - might not have prompted the law school from Atlanta to take a closer look at the case , but it is an amazing coincidence .
Particularly in that Monica Lewinsky 's name was connected to it .
By BIS , in making his inquiries .
Scowling around a cigarette with his arm over the payphone near idling taxis , like a hero from the 1950s ' adventure theater ' movie era [ all that 's missing is the bourbon tight ; PETER BIS does n't drink ] , BIS pulses the government agencies for the latest inside line , sharing and scooping , gathering information from the Canadians , feeding it to the Department of Justice via one of his all hours crackerjack alibi communications mechanisms .
Some of them are real people with real names and real jobs , or maybe they 're fake names with cover positions or anyway business cards , but some have even less than that - nicknames out of the PETER BIS memory files that he assigns to differentiate between the times and places and maybe different costumes of a single life form or entity he either stumbles across or that sniffs up his backtrail .
' Jimmy who is n't Jimmy ' is a big one ; PETER BIS uses the phone both as a weapon and an insurance policy , touching base on the way to OK Corral .
Kind of like Wyatt Earp .
PETER BIS calls , and gets ' Jimmy who is n't Jimmy . '
PETER BIS starts fishing , and says he heard Monica Lewinsky and Chandra Levy 's parents both used the same lawyer .
Washington D.C. can be real small town some days .' Jimmy who is n't Jimmy ' says yeah , and that he ' had a dream ' in which Gary Condit , senior on the Select Committee on Intelligence who was running around with Levy , hired a D.C. cop to either get Levy off him or keep Levy off him [ every man should have that problem ] , the cop went for Levy himself , and something happened between the cop and Levy - either she went for the cop or did n't , but either way Levy ended up dead .
There was a brief pause .
PETER BIS asked if ' Jimmy who is n't Jimmy ' had had a name or description come to him in this ' dream . '' Jimmy who is n't Jimmy ' said ' yes , he did ' - a name and - but he'd have to dig it out of his files .
Must be writing down and saving those descriptive dreams .
The immediate situation then , is that Gary Condit , PETER BIS , and ' Jimmy who is n't Jimmy ' all think the cop Condit hired to merely ' turn her away ' instead killed intern Chandra Levy , but , insofar as the story was skillfully deployed to monopolize the news as a precursor to 9/11 , you , the educated reader who regularly follows http://peterbis.blogspot.com, know to look for the laughing shadow of Geo. W. Bush in the background , along with traces of the Jews and Council - on - Foreign Relations in Wm. Proxmire being taken down with at least conceptual Alzheimer 's for example .
Levy matters covered the Proxmire takedown .
Bush would not have done that on his own ; his father would have known , and James A. Baker III , but then you 're into the Council on Foreign Relations one way or the other , are n't you .
Sorry about the little girl getting sucked into the pool drain , whether or not that was orchestrated too .
Right after that sequence the law school from Atlanta announced they'd be revisiting the case ; watch for more ongoing coverup .
Is Bhutto really dead ?
Probably not .
Details in the Washington Post 28 Dec 2007 both suggest that she is n't , and , outlining her ties to ' players ' on the international scene [ Harvard and Oxford for example ] , tell a compelling story of people - some well intended - seeking to surmount obstacles in fostering societal change in Pakistan .
And heaven knows the foreigners are n't hard workers but labor in ' think tanks ' rewarding the clever and smooth ; here they took the easy way out .
' Cutting and running ' - the politics of an elementary school playground , thankfully ducking around the bullies to make it home from school safe .
' Voices of reason . '
Though the crowd looks supportive and apparently willing to work for change , the ' top people ' want the change to be arbitrary and imposed [ diapers on goats ?
Yes - there is a CIA presence in the tribal areas and ' diapers on goats ' was a particular incident designed to assert situational dominance ] .
As for the details in The Post , Bhutto had completed the rally speech and was departing in an SUV when she apparently ' on her own ' decided to pull the ' top cover ' or temporary roof off the SUV , at which point she promptly got hit in a ' combined ' or unified terrorist attack featuring both guns and bombs .
Depending on her to pull the top off her vehicle makes it no better than coincidence , and her being in the SUV additionally argues she is n't dead .
When they took down Sadat they did n't leave it to chance .
It has been said that assassins usually work from very close quarters or far away - there are n't many from the ' middle ' distances .
Unfortunately , all manipulation serves to legitimize the military government .
He is n't himself a coward , he wants to do the right thing for Pakistan , and , left to their own devices , in the face of one ' necessary death ' the military would not stay the sword .
Remember , one hundred and forty poor people really did die when her convoy was bombed on her initial return from Dubai .
Now the CIA is tentatively unifying a newly emergent middle class with street activity .
In fact they 're creating this middle class as they go along , but this middle class will inevitably be the most bought of the bought .
They 're all lawyers .
Musharraf has rarely looked so good .
Hate to say it , but the Clinton - both of them , working as a team - brought the guy to power in 1999 , and they are n't through with Musharraf yet .
Hillary in Iowa trying to leverage the ' incident ' [ ca n't call it a ' death ' or even an ' attack ' ] obviously wo n't claim this as evidence of her experience - but it is .
Anticipate their trying to smear people foreign and domestic , labeling ' enemies ' or anyway people they do n't like with negative associations .
Now they 're saying Ron Paul takes money from white supremacy or Aryan groups .
Worse than the Clintontaking money from Chinese military figures or Al Gore picking up cash in the [ Buddhist ] temple ?
Was that in California ?
And did it permanently taint them ?
Well as a matter of fact it did in some quarters - dealing with the Chinese military turns out to have been one aspect of the CIA attack on American manufacturing [ selling them advanced machining equipment for airplanes ] the Clintonnever completely recovered from .
That book about the Clintonis titled Year of the Rat.
Bhutto Ron Paul ?
But the real thing and not a gesture ?
A man named Daniel Estulin has sources in the intelligence community that say an assassination attempt targeting Ron Paul may be in the early planning stages .
Estulin is said to be close to the Bilderberg structures .
Sure its something on the web .
Because they told him to put it on the web .
Estulin - or his sources - suggest the planning is in ' concept development ' .
How likely is that ?
Well , if the talk originated after one of the days the Ron Paul campaign raised big cash via very minimally solicited internet donations , the possibility a credible planning effort exists probably falls somewhere between ' plausible ' and ' more likely than not .
' Estulin - and presumably his sources - being close to the Bilderberg group does n't mean its them .
Of course the Bilderberg ' group ' denies it as they deny all ' conspiracy ' scenarios - though nobody even knows the name they really use among themselves but identifies the group by the name of the hotel where they met in 1954 .
Late May 1954 , after Eisenhower met with the aliens in February 1954 .
Pictured .
THE infamous Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek .
146 rooms , and legend has it they book ALL the rooms in whichever hotel , whenever and wherever they meet .
Of course you would never find Hillary Clinton 's fingerprints on a Bhutto job taking out Ron Paul , but she is suppose to be one of them .
She 's also suppose to be high in Masonry but the men in the Blue Lodges which are n't part of the ' inner clique ' would be very genuine in denying it .
It figures the only time Hillary Clinton has a low profile is when its a covert operation and they 're doing something sneaky .
Her latest new slogan in Iowa is ' Time To Pick a President . '
Is n't that the old John Kerry slogan as a retread from 2004 ?
If you want to take from Kerry , be sure to take the whole thing .
True story ; Terry Reed raised exactly this issue but centered on Clinton drug dealing in Arkansas , with Hillary laundering the cash and reporting to William Barr .... During their investigation of Noriega , Kerry 's staff found reason to believe that the Pakistan - based Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) had facilitated Noriega 's drug trafficking and money laundering .
This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI , and as a result , banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991 .
In December 1992 , Kerry and Senator Hank Brown , a Republican from Colorado , released The BCCI Affair , a report on the BCCI scandal .
The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with terrorists , including Abu Nidal .
It blasted the Department of Justice , the Department of the Treasury , the Customs Service , the Federal Reserve Bank , as well as influential lobbyists and the CIA .
Kerry was criticized by some Democrats for having pursued his own party members , including former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford , although Republicans said he should have pressed against some Democrats even harder .
The BCCI scandal was later turned over to the Manhattan District Attorney 's office [ Wikipedia ] .
They probably were forced to release the report in 1992 to shield Clinton [ Bill ] .
Whether Hillary ever had to contact Clifford for funds at BCCI is n't clear , but the point brings us nicely back to Bhutto and Ron Paul .
One dead in Rawalpindi with rioting in Karachi , and the other raising unbelievable cash over the internet - revealing the real ' distress of the system ' which is perhaps nearly as dangerous .
Tony Blair makes the Queen take the liberal Rowan Williams , the public homosexual Gene Robinson , and the ' billboard for women in the clergy ' Katharine Jefferts Schori - and then he leaves the Church to become a Catholic .
He cripples the Church of England and walks , which Rowan Williams applauds [ who is paying that man 's salary , and is there nothing to be done about it ? ] , and Bhutto got taken out .
PETER BIS had a source say one of the French bishops of the Catholic Church is a Jew .
No immediate further word on whether or not Blair is really a Jew but the tip is certainly coincidental to the earlier reporting .
Middle East envoy now of the Catholic slash Jesuit ' World Domination ' manipulation paradigm and distorted teachings of evil .
Pus hole scum of their Christ the Satan .
PETER BIS sees indicators suggesting they 're trying to take over the world ; he hears ' word on the street ' [ outside government agencies in Washington D.C. ] suggesting they 're trying to take over the world , and everything he sees and hears suggests the Catholic Church has previously tried to take over the world .
[ From Wikipedia on Tony Blair ] ... The family returned to Britain in the late 1950s , living for a time with Hazel Blair 's stepfather William McClay and her mother at their home in Stepps , near Glasgow .
He spent the remainder of his childhood in Durham , England , his father being by then a lecturer at Durham University .
After attending Durham 's Chorister School from 1961 to 1966 , Blair boarded at Fettes College , a notable independent school in Edinburgh , where he met Charlie Falconer ( a pupil at the rival Edinburgh Academy ) , whom he later appointed Lord Chancellor .
He reportedly modelled himself on Mick Jagger .
His teachers were unimpressed with him : his biographer , John Rentoul reported that , " All the teachers I spoke to when researching the book said he was a complete pain in the backside , and they were very glad to see the back of him " .
[ End citation ] .
Two sources independent of one another on Blair : One source says he worked for a summer as a counselor at Camp Swagoswatonah [ now closed in eastern Pennsylvania ] they thought in 1968 or apparently while he was at Fettes College - not impossible from the text - BUT that he already knew Cherie Booth Blair while he was working there .
The camp was supposedly heavily Masonic with ' gluing spells ' and witchcraft ; that camp experience could have figured into Blair 's singing as supposedly other ' emergent ' singers were also there .
Musician Sting of The Police figures into the story but details are elusive .
The other source said that as recently as the late 1990s on at least one occasion Tony Blair and Jack Straw were associated with a synagogue .
Where they either met or knew the source .
But Tony Blair is n't and never was Jewish - was he ?
He may have been ; frankly he falls into a category of Council on Foreign Relations ' New World Order ' liberal prone to rationalization .
In fact these are not opposites but pairs .
The Mail on Sunday , 27 January 2002 , p.63 .
In the week that a children ’s writer who claims God is dead and the Church is wicked wins a prestigious literary prize ... This is the most dangerous author in Britain .
Philip Pullman is being hailed as the new C. S. Lewis after being awarded the Whitbread Book of the Year prize for his latest novel aimed at children : The Amber Spyglass .
The judges described it as visionary , but PETER HITCHENS reveals that the author appears to have his own sinister agenda ...
The atheists have driven God out of the classroom and off the TV and the radio , and done a pretty good job of expelling him from the churches as well .
But one stubborn and important pocket of Christianity survives , in the Narnia stories of C. S. Lewis .
Now here comes an opportunity to dethrone him and supplant his books with others which proclaim the death of God to the young .
If you are wondering why the children 's author Philip Pullman has collected a major prize and why such a huge fuss is being made of him , now you know .
He is the anti-Lewis , the one the atheists would have been praying for , if atheists prayed .
Children instinctively like Lewis 's enthralling stories and often do not even notice their religious message , though it frequently goes deep into their minds and emerges later .
How infuriating this is for liberal but literate parents , the sort of people who work for the BBC and want all the advantages of a Christian culture without the tiresome bother of having to worship a God they think they are too smart to believe in .
Spotting this trend , Lewis 's publishers last year toyed with producing ' sequels ' without any Christian references , but retreated under a barrage of thunderbolts from Lewis supporters .
Until now , liberal , atheist parents have had to buy the Narnia books , reading them out loud to their young between clenched teeth , hoping the messages of faith , forgiveness , grace and resurrection do not get through .
Now at last they have an alternative and an antidote , the supposedly brilliant Pullman , who - according to the reviewers - is a new Lewis and a new Chekhov rolled into one .
Of his three famous children 's books , the first two , Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife , are captivating and clever , but the third , which took the Whitbread prize , is a disappointing clunker with some gruesome and needlessly nasty scenes .
This is probably because The Amber Spyglass - in which God dies - is too loaded down with propaganda to leave enough room for the story .
None of the trilogy is a patch on any of the Narnia chronicles .
You can't help wondering if the praise and the prizes , handed out by reliable , liberal establishment sorts such as Channel 4 News 's Jon Snow , are because of Pullman 's views as much as his writing .
For Pullman has said : ' I hate the Narnia books , and I hate them with deep and bitter passion , with their view of childhood as a golden age from which sexuality and adulthood are a falling - away .
'
He knows perfectly well what he is doing .
He openly and rightly believes storytelling can be a form of moral propaganda : ' All stories teach , whether the storyteller intends them to or not .
They teach the world we create .
They teach the morality we live by .
They teach it much more effectively than moral precepts and instructions ...
We do n't need lists of rights and wrongs , tables of do's and don'ts : we need books , time and silence .
" Thou shalt not " is soon forgotten .
' Pullman has said many times that he thinks God is dead .
Since he cannot know if this is true , it raises the question of whether he also hopes that God is dead .
He told an Oxford literary conference in August 2000 : ' We 're used to the Kingdom of Heaven ; but you can tell from the genera thrust of the book that I'm of the devil 's party , like Milton .
And I think it 's time we thought about a republic of Heaven instead of the Kingdom of Heaven .
The King is dead .
That 's to say I believe the King is dead .
I 'm an atheist .
But we need Heaven nonetheless , we need all the things that Heaven meant , we need joy , we need a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives , we need a connection with the universe , we need all the things the Kingdom of Heaven used to promise us but failed to deliver .
' None of this makes sense .
If there is no God , then who makes the rules of the supernatural world which Pullman creates , in which people have visible souls called daemons ; magic knives cut holes between the worlds and spectres devour life ?
How is it that the dead live on in a ghastly underworld of unending misery and torment , yet there is no Heaven ?
In his worlds , the Church is wicked , cruel and child - hating ; priests are sinister , murderous or drunk .
Political correctness creeps in leadenly .
There is a brave African king and a pair of apparently homosexual angels .
The one religious character who turns out to be benevolent is that liberal favourite , an ex-nun who has renounced her vows and lost her faith .
Even so , she sets out on a perilous journey when ordered to do so by angels , who speak to her through a computer .
Pullman , like Lewis , lives in Oxford , though a long way from the outlying suburb where the creator of Namia once dwelt and is now buried .
A good thing , probably .
The sound of Lewis chuckling from his grave at the idea of angels speaking to a renegade nun through a computer might get on Pullman 's nerves [ end citation ] .
peter.hitchens@mailonsunday.co.uk At issue is n't whether you happen to agree or not ; at issue is whether or not that effort is part of a broader - orchestrated - ' government ' or quasi - government campaign advocating attacks on the society combined with immigration and deliberate blurring of traditional structures or elements [ abortion is significantly up in Britain for example ] .
Bruce Rux wrote a book called Hollywood versus The Aliens which looks at disinformation and awareness furthered by the government security agencies .
Of course PETER BIS follows current developments as is possible ; further down this website schematic drawings outline plasma exchanges - and at some level ' cycles of human essence ' - at the North and South Pole .
Now there is a question about ' dust ' - perhaps star dust - and how it figures into the paradigm .
Daemon ( pronounced DEE- mon ) -
The soul of each individual human being embodied in an animal companion .
In childhood , a daemon alters its form to reflect the ever - changing nature of children .
In adulthood , it assumes a permanent form that best reflects the inner nature of its human [ the possibility is an Eskimo belief - not an inevitability ] .
Dust - Mystical particles in highest concentration in the Arctic Circle [ bordering ' world ice theory ' which includes some interesting arguments ] .
The Magisterium -
The councils that form the heart of government in Lyra ’s world .
Now tightening its control over the populace , the Magisterium seeks to eliminate free will and calls Lord Asriel ’s research into Dust heresy .
Northern Lights ( Aurora Borealis ) - Storms of charged particles and intense solar rays that cause a luminous radiation in the arctic circle .
Lord Asriel believes the Northern Lights cloak a magnificent city in the sky .
North -
A place of great beauty , diversity , and danger , it is home to armored bears , Tartars , witches , and innumerable creatures .
Lord Asriel has photographed Dust and a sort of other world in the Aurora from an outpost in the North [ it is n't actually clear whether the best photographs ' of the North ' are taken AT the North or rather from other planets or space looking down on the North from a distance ] .
Spy Flies -
Small mechanized insects rumored to be made from both machinery and trapped souls [ the mechanical aspects have certainly been completed and deployed , including in the District of Columbia ] .
Witches - Female beings that travel through the air and outlive humans by hundreds of years [ PETER BIS thinks he dated one , and twenty odd years later is trying to figure out if she was a good or evil one ] .
From www.goldencompassmovie.com - and PETER BIS , watching the agencies watching the public .
PETER BIS characterizes the human - alien interface and related aspects of criminal racketeering typically as undertaken by the Roman Catholic Church and church officials , organized crime structures such as the Mafia , and agencies of the United states government .
Actually he typically ' works into ' and exploits the factions within the government agencies .
The BIS or Bank of International Settlements - based in Basel Switzerland - is not suppose to be at all related to that .
The BIS denies all corruption allegations , though it was originally the enabling device which gave rise to the Nazi party in the early 1930s - leading into a discussion about Sullivan & Cromwell [ Allen Dulles ' old law firm ] stacking the German economy and recovery of the Dawes Loan .
From the BIS website [ bis.org - here annotated ] : The Bank for International Settlements was established in 1930 .
It is the world 's oldest [ FORMALIZED ] international financial institution [ it pales next to Rothschilds and the Zionists ] and remains the principal centre for international central bank cooperation .
The BIS was established in the context of the Young Plan ( 1930 ) , which dealt with the issue of the reparation payments imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles following the First World War ...
The reparations issue quickly faded [ essentially because the Nazis - with foreign collaborators - were able to blow through it ] , focusing the Bank 's activities entirely on cooperation among central banks and , increasingly , other agencies in pursuit of monetary and financial stability [ in the interests of large market capitalists exploiting elements at the margin or periphery of the economy with the orchestrated adjustable rate mortgage crisis coordinated by the BIS or sister institutions for example ] .
The changing role of the BISSince 1930 , central bank cooperation at the BIS has taken place through the regular meetings in Basel of central bank Governors and experts from central banks and other agencies ...
In the monetary policy field , cooperation at the BIS in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War and until the early 1970s focused on implementing and defending the Bretton Woods system .
In the 1970s and 1980s , the focus was on managing cross - border capital flows following the oil crises and the international debt crisis .
The 1970s crisis also brought the issue of regulatory supervision of internationally active banks to the fore , resulting in the 1988 Basel Capital Accord and its " Basel II " revision of 2001 - 06 .
More recently , the issue of financial stability in the wake of economic integration and globalisation , as highlighted by the 1997 Asian crisis , has received a lot of attention [ end citation ] .
Cutting through their crap , PETER BIS is an enforcement tool used to mitigate alien and humanoid lizard influences at the World Bank meeting [s ] in the spring [ March / April / May time period ] and early August .
John Perkins wrote a book called Confessions of an Economic Hitman about third world populations being kept in poverty by a thin band of CIA - corrupted bureaucrats forced to provide infrastructure supporting satellite constellations and other aspects of the human - alien interface ; PETER BIS wearily attempts to discipline the related institutional and governmental enabling devices magnetically drawn into the foul paradigm .
Functionally retarded with a high IQ , much of the time PETER BIS does n't even know what the **** is going on , but given his ' legacy background and positioning in the field , ' he simply gets thrown into various scenarios and abandoned to inflict as much damage as he possibly can .
In 2007 - 2008 we've returned to , in the words of the BIS [ the bank ] , " cross border capital flows " which include the exploitation of energy revenue , which the BIS [ the man ] [ actually ' the enraged alien - humanoid figure ' ] pretty much knows to be accompanied by a commensurate CIA effort to divert some percentage of funding at the transfer mechanism - which is of course the BIS [ the bank ] .
Is the percentage diverted to or by the CIA " fixed " or does it float perhaps on the basis of an orchestrated market manipulation allowing for recovery of a previous ' toll ' for example ?
They definitely induce crisis to enhance revenue - as in the summer of 2006 for example ; presumably producers are subsequently allowed to at least stabilize their return .
Is the best alternative questioning the BIS [ the bank ] at the office , or would you wait for them to leave work and have the BIS [ the enraged alien - humanoid figure ] catch them in the parking lot ?
A particular investigative technique involves ' lurking like a troll on intercept - mode ' as the ' figures of controversy ' stroll unsuspecting with their wives and children down cobblestone paths on holidays and weekends .
PETER BIS has deployed on the pump price gas scandal - and he is directly flogging the CIA - industry corruption orchestration mechanisms this time .
The data points are amazing - a Canadian woman related by marriage to the Rockefellers coming to Washington D.C. alleging a racketeering mechanism is / was moving in on her and at least one boy and that the boy 's ' Uncle Jay ' [ Select Committee on Intelligence ] was aware of it across the winter of 2005 - 2006 talking at length in an exclusive interview with PETER BIS ; a CIA executive named Thomas J. Mattingly trying to corner the Nigerian energy market for the Chinese while PETER BIS was living in his house ; a PETER BIS source who worked with Saddam Hussein saying the Iraqi ruler ' got greedy ' which led to the invasion and overthrow ; CIA - type drops and pickups involving ' ground soldiers ' on foot and cars with out - of - state license plates at a particular station PETER BIS suspects might somehow figure in an Agency linkage paradigm , and beyond that , years of experience in automotive dating to the 1970s , which in total makes for a hell of a compelling picture .
PETER BIS theorizes the CIA is using the retail stations to ' wash ' money or otherwise turn illicit cash into usable profits and credits , while at the same time racketeering in oil as a resource including at the market which is actually the unique BIS perspective - many people see one side or the other , but few see both sides of the coin .
Oil costs a lot but we do n't have a way to immediately see how much of the cost goes to the producer and how much is diverted in CIA - controlled revenue streams .
Ca n't deny it ; in 2006 there was trouble in Iraq , with Iran , and Venezuela , on the Nigerian Delta , unspecified with Saudi Arabia , and BP messed up maintenance gimping the Alaskan pipe line around the time the supplies in Europe were also being threatened - not exactly coincidence .
You 're being had .
That was the year after the CIA executive - Mattingly - tried to secure Nigerian oil for CHINA as opposed to say the United States .
Can we quantify the extent to which you 're immediately vulnerable ?
As he was working next to PETER BIS , Mattingly was talking about the drug economy which increasingly dominates at least sectors if not the totality of the American financial system getting into the underpinnings of banking and money movement .
George W. Bush now wants funding for the war .
Supposing it turns out Saddam Hussein was very legitimately frustrated with the funding scheme and said he was going to switch over to the Euro [ " he got greedy " ] , so we invaded and overthrew the regime .
Not , as it happens , for what people allege are ' big oil ' interests , but in fact for what turn out to be CIA interests in a revenue stream which largely evades legislative allocation in total violation of the Constitutional structure of government .
Where George H.W. Bush made his money while apparently also drawing the CIA check from Uncle Sam - or in his case Uncle Sugar .
Should Congress now give the son [ Geo . W ] the money [ actually ' more money ' ] for ' the war , ' with all parties admitting a certain amount of that supposed military funding is really for additional CIA activities designed to conceal the funding mechanisms but which by themselves at least appear on the ' event horizon '
Congress can in concept discover .
What is the breakout ?
How much are the individual players taking ?
Is Chavez joining Castro as the ' outside ' or rebel CIA executive who subjugates countries by pretending to further the ambitions of the lower classes against the middle at the behest of the Council on Foreign Relations ?
YES , and you know you 're paying for Chavez but do n't know how far beyond him it goes .
Neither does PETER BIS but he 's working it , and there pretty apparently are Agency people behind him who may at key intersections make more precise percentage breakouts public .
From Wikipedia , CIA on the internet :
In order to create a unified brand , the company changed its corporate name from Jersey Standard to Exxon , rebranding all its U.S. stations under the latter title in the summer and fall of 1972 after successful test marketing of the Exxon brand and logo in late 1971 and early 1972 at rebranded Enco / Esso stations in certain U.S. cities .
However , the unrestricted international use of the popular brand Esso prompted the company to continue using Esso outside the United States .
Esso is the only widely used Standard Oil brand left in existence .
Other Standard Oil descendants , such as Chevron , do maintain a few stations with the Standard Oil brand in specific states in order to retain their trademarks and prevent others from using them .
The Aurora spy plane , built ' on top of ' the hugely expensive B1 bomber program .
Readers may remember officials in the Reagan - era simply telling baldfaced lies ; some of those were apparently designed to attack Reagan himself via the CIA - orchestrated IRAN - CONTRA scandal , but some related to capabilities which were being developed off the charts - it appears the B1 ran over budget because in fact a significant aspect of the program was secret .
Of course professionals speculate about how much the two planes have in common - shared undercarriage [ minimal ] to perhaps elements of cockpit design which has larger engineering implications at the other extreme .
Anyway , more to the point here , this is the plane the Pakistani government flies down the border between Russia and China for us , essentially keeping President General Musharraf in power .
There will not be another Francis Gary Powers incident ; the plane is said to self destruct [ certain ] after the pilots have ejected [ supposedly ] .
No one is known to have tried to eject , and no one knows whether or not the plane will be immediately destroyed without delay in preserving the classified nature of the undertaking .
' Other side of the coin ' of course is the crowd of Pakistani lawyers in dark suits rioting for restoration of constitutional government in Pakistan .
They perhaps are being unknowingly manipulated by the CIA commensurate to similar recent riots in Burma and Georgia if the CIA has opened a designator for ' repressive governments surviving civil disobedience ' with associated charge lines and funding mechanisms .
One argument is that , as in Egypt where the professional military is a stable element in the society under a dictator who should be replaced , it is possible to change the government without damaging the larger alliance .
And ' sooner is better ' [ the United States has a relationship with Pakistan - we have no relationship with Musharraf himself beyond that we expect him to act for the good of Pakistan , and he needs to go ] .
The St. Peter 's Basilica dome is seen through the spy hole of a door of the Templar Church of St. Mary in Aventino Friday .
The Vatican has published secret documents about the trial of the Knights Templar [ Processus Contra Templarios ... 300 pages ... in a limited edition of 799 copies ] .
Washington Post Express / Examiner , 2007 .
That is where the story begins .
Forget about Blue Lodge and even the lower degrees of the Scottish Rite ; English royalty governs the upper levels of Masonic tradition [ and we think the York Rite in its entirety but reports have not been finalized on that ] .
Lord Hamilton prior to the war , with ' The Three ' in the recent past if not today , Lord Henley [ who refers to his son Don as ' The Idiot ' ] , the Duke of Kent , and Lord Cumberland , who was essentially the ' Grand Master of Grand Masters ' with the Egyptian spells .
Two women .
One is the ' Known Female Templar . '
She commanded big dollars which were n't hers , someone [s ] took the money which apparently is a significant issue , and she currently lives on the street in Washington D.C.
The other is Hillary Clinton .
Hillary Clinton is apparently the ' Unknown Female Templar .
' Will she - Hillary - admit to that ?
Maybe .
In private she might ; the position commands a certain amount of distinction - does she admit to any Masonic affiliation in private ?
Does she admit to being in on swagging the money ?
NO !
That was not her , and you can count on that [ her friends - did she know who did it ?
Did she visit the scene of the crime ? ] .
Can we quantify how distinguished the position of Unknown Female Templar really is ?
Sort of .
Question : Did Hillary Clinton get up to ' Level 42 ' ?
Answer :
No idea ; you have to ask John McCain .
This is a white van setting up on PETER BIS .
His stuff is low in the picture on the sidewalk .
This is the logo on the side of the van - difficult to read because to wait for the enhanced images might be waiting too long ; BIS is on fire in the middle of Washington D.C.
And this is the shot with the satellite low on the horizon - or whatever .
Once upon a time the ' clip clop ' of horses hooves meant Masonic death .
Now they come for you in the white van .
After the McCain / Clinton exchange the story gets truly bizarre - Lord Cumberland 's head set out as the ' Oracle ' [ apparently there was a plan to destroy him ] at the Temple at 6th Avenue and 47th Street ; they used to hold a room at a nearby Sheraton Hotel [ " Guards , arrest her !
Guards , arrest her , " even as only an Oracle without body Cumberland was apparently a commanding presence ] ; putting the head back in the coffin with the body in Lord Henley 's apartment , which is where Lady Di used to hang out .
Right around the time or right before she met PETER BIS .
In fact , the screwed New York Masonic scene might very well be ' why ' she met PETER BIS .
If you were the Queen , what would you do ?
Alien in Michigan might look pretty attractive .
Hand it to them - they have long memories ; this was late 1970s activity with an extended continuity mechanism .
More on La Belle Nightclub activity .
Turns out the CIA was laundering funds through the ISI in Pakistan and the apparent ' Middle Eastern female ' hustled out of Berlin after the bombing is thought to tie into that or anyway the timing is of interest to PETER BIS .
The money spigot was turning , but whether it was really opening or closing is n't clear [ may not be clear to anybody including the Pakistani ISI or the CIA ] .
PETER BIS , conceptually unrelated ' but you never know , ' had a White House source tell him the Pakistani government flies the Aurora spy plane down the Chinese border for us on an ongoing basis , which might be a factor keeping Musharraf in office .
No gloating with these scoops .
' Word on the street ' - very much from ' unquantifiable ' sources - is that somehow the astronauts brought something [ bad ] back from space .
A disease of some kind .
How long did the Apollo 11 astronauts remain in quarantine after returning to Earth from the first manned landing on the lunar surface ?
[ They ] were housed in a special quarantine van for eighteen days ...
President Nixon , seen with the astronauts aboard the USS Hornet , talks to them via microphone .
Of course that 's assuming they really did land on the Moon , and were n't just hidden in the van the whole time or something [ O.J. Simpson of Capricorn 1 back in the news of late ] .
Has the government ever investigated what effect the discovery of extraterrestrial life might have on society ?
In the 1960s NASA and the Brookings Institution did such a study and concluded that there would be no significant effect if the life - form is of subhuman intelligence .
But if " they " are smarter than us , it could upset many philosophies and value systems - and would be the most devastating to scientists and engineers [ which sounds real 1960s .
At this point the truth of the finding is very much in doubt ; the question is whether or not that finding remains the government 's operative paradigm ] .

It turns out the first nuke was adjudicated ; no surprise , but you wonder who they relocated for survival [ or moved in to perish ] , then taking down the Indianapolis in the Navy 's worst ever loss at sea .
Did ' they ' [ our Navy at the behest of others ] deliberately pack the ship ?
Questions .
PETER BIS hears that when Giuliani was nominated to be United States Attorney he forgot to mention his underworld ties on the background check undertaken by the FBI .
Rudy !
La Belle nightclub , Germany - photographed after the attack .
PETER BIS says [ because sources told him ] that someone appearing to be a younger - type female perhaps of ' Middle Eastern ' origins participated in the attack on the disco where the American servicemen died - and was then spirited out of Germany on an American military plane , which ultimately gets into the ' Lady Di ' and aged witches paradigm .
Could it be true ?
Street indicators - including ' diplomatic probing ' [ of BIS ] by embassy staff and reportedly private detectives - in Washington D.C. 2007 suggest it might be .
Going and talking to BIS , taking photographs , and even asking searching questions of him probably is covered by diplomatic immunity , but hiring private detectives might fall into a gray area .
The latter point may be related to the spy ring PETER BIS exposed on Capitol Hill , in which case you would think somebody would have prosecuted long ago .
Of course , nothing is as simple as it may at first appear .
Gainer , Chief of the Capitol Police , gaining office in a coverup ?
Senator Somebody wiped out a guard shack , maybe somewhat damaged the surroundings , and demolished their own vehicle in exiting the Hart Senate Office Building while driving ' under the influence ' - and the hush crowd went to work , or so the story goes .
As a reward for handling that , Gainer ' got the glory ' or was promoted to the command position .
Our question : in the District of Columbia , what can ' under the influence ' possibly mean ?
David Harris appears to have been in La Tuna when Joe Valachi was there , from about March to November 1970 [ C Block , 24 cells ; he says the prison held about 780 prisoners when it was built for 360 ] , departing shortly before Valachi died in 1971 .
That sounds like a fairly small facility ; no word on whether they had contact perhaps on work details .
Wife Joan Baez , liberal singer , appears to have been featured [ knowingly or unknowingly ] in a CIA ground deployment at Stanford Medical Center on 02 Dec 1969 .
Ratzinger ; Mafia Pope and scum hole pus of Jesus Christ the Satan .... Four future pontiffs took part in the council 's opening session : Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini , who on succeeding Pope John XXIII took the name of Paul VI ; Bishop Albino Luciani , the future Pope John Paul I ; Bishop Karol Wojtyła , who became Pope John Paul II ; and 35 - year - old Father Joseph Ratzinger , present as a theological consultant , who more than forty years later became the current Pope Benedict XVI [ Wikipedia ] .
PETER BIS has an informer .
Prior to this person , we already knew the Mafia had a meeting in Apalachin , New York [ west of Binghampton on the Pennsylvania line ] on Nov [ 14 ] 1957 which was famously ' broken up ' by a policeman who sent big name hoods in fancy suits running into the woods , hiding behind trees and rocks - maybe overnight .
That legend - ' Apalachin , ' central in the education of subsequent underling mobsters - was almost certainly an Allen Dulles CIA / Mafia joint orchestration , ultimately diminishing the FBI in a very calculated manner .
The meeting apparently was not broken up until the Allen Dulles agenda was articulated , and in developing a history of CIA / Mafia interaction the buffoonery strikes exactly the note of an adjudication effort .
The real question is whether or not entire history of FBI / CIA interrelationship has just been a CIA effort to subjugate the FBI on jurisdiction as various data points may suggest :
Too low to be of any real value but too big to throw back or ignore , “ Senator John McClellan [ ] produced [ ] Joe Valachi [ ] in 1963 .
” Anyway , the new PETER BIS informer says VATICAN II or The Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican , which " opened under Pope John XXIII in 1962 and closed under Pope John VI in 1965 " was also Mafia - and thusly CIA - driven .
Claire Sterling formalize the research of organized crime in the 1970s and 1980s ; of course a crooked Vatican II would have been an important precursor to her work .
A [ different ] CIA source has told us the CIA had a ' World Congress of Organized Crime ' at Heathrow outside London immediately following the attacks of 9/11 [ September 2001 ] .
It apparently lasted several days with small meetings taking place off the main room or conference area filled with the criminals unifying their efforts and developing contacts within other crime structures ; PETER BIS [ supported by the recent information ] suggests a crooked Vatican II would have been an important contribution to that , laying the groundwork for global expansion .
In other news , George Weightman , Major General originally from Vermont who was cashiered by Gates over an orchestrated health crisis at Bethesda after Rumsfeld left , has been given another command .
One can never be sure the titles reflect the activity , but he may have been put in charge of a research laboratory though probably not involving blood or anyway not related to the kinds of ' blood research activity ' we describe below .
Unless ' blood ties ' are a more significant aspect of the Bush - Clinton [ Bush - Clinton ] continuity mechanism that we thought ; see Ex-Walter Reed medical chief to command Fort Detrick , Associated Press .
Telegraph - Herald , [ Dubuque , Iowa ] Nov 14 , 2007 , pg. A.5.HAGERSTOWN , Md. ( AP ) - A two - star general who was fired as the head of Walter Reed Army Medical Center amid reports of shoddy treatment of wounded soldiers will oversee U.S. biological weapons defense research as commander of Fort Detrick , the Army said Tuesday .
Maj . Gen. George W. Weightman , a physician who works in the Army surgeon general 's office in Falls Church , Va. , will command both Fort Detrick in Frederick and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command there , Army spokesman Paul Boyce said ... AIDS was significantly developed at Detrick by the CIA under the MKNAOMI Subproject within the MKULTRA overview designator [ technically that would be Subproject 110 supported by Subproject 78 BIO LABS which eventually was assigned an MKSEARCH designator when Richard Helms semi ' burned ' MKULTRA on his relocation to Tehran ] .
Vague rumor has it MKNAOMI relocated to Detrick after originating in work undertaken outside Chicago but that is obscure in AIDS lore ; if it did the move probably would have taken place in September or October 1962 .
The key document appears to be 110 - 13 which was missing from the National Security Archive files in 2003 ~ 2004 ; we do n't know if that document had previously been withheld from researcher John Marks who the CIA selected to write about MKULTRA , or if it had subsequently been removed from the files attempting to conceal the truth from PETER BIS and peterbis.
blogspot.com investigators .
The point , of course , is that relocation of the AIDS development effort to Detrick from wherever , if it did happen in Sept - Oct 1962 , coincided exactly with the start of VATICAN II .
" It had been inaugurated , in accordance with John XXIII 's wishes , on 11 October 1962 , which was then the Feast of Mary 's Motherhood , and ended on the day of the Immaculate Conception .
The Council took place in a Marian setting .
It was actually far more than a setting : it was the orientation of its entire process .
It refers us , as it referred the Council Fathers at that time , to the image of the Virgin who listens and lives in the Word of God , who cherishes in her heart the words that God addresses to her and , piecing them together like a mosaic , learns to understand them ( cf. Lk 2 : 19 , 51 ) .
It refers us to the great Believer who , full of faith , put herself in God 's hands , abandoning herself to his will ; it refers us to the humble Mother who , when the Son 's mission so required , became part of it , and at the same time , to the courageous woman who stood beneath the Cross while the disciples fled ... "

Scary beyond the use of religion to legitimize the attack on gays and blacks is that Richard Helms ' burned '
MKULTRA or publicized it including to members of Congress in 1972 - 73 BEFORE infecting the Africans with it - the AIDS virus - in 1979 .
Of interest : 17 seated United States Senators including Hillary Clinton , John McCain , and John Warner [ R - Va ] are said to be implanted with invasive neuroprosthetics developed under MKULTRA Subproject 119 .
Warner is retiring .
He is n't going to run for re-election in 2008 .
That probably means the Senators are looking to recruit some new people to be implanted , and some continuity mechanism supplying the neurostimulant which mitigates the effect of radiation associated with monitoring and stimulating the neuroprosthetic from remote locations .
That continuity mechanism could be George Weightman at Detrick ; updates on that and other political developments in Washington D.C. as events warrant .
Liberals in the CIA ; you can't just push them down and beat them with sticks however tempting it might be at times .
Joan Baez . Liberal .
With David Harris , draft resistance student movement leader going on to write for Rolling Stone , who was involved in torturing Dennis Sweeney with the neuroprosthetic technology and electrodes the Senate now uses after keeping him [ Sweeney ] out of Chicago in 1968 as an important aspect of gimping the Democrats for the Nixon win , and who was in the slam it looks like at the end of Joe Valachi which of course becomes immediately problematic ....
In 1966 , Valachi attempted unsuccessfully to hang himself in his prison cell , using an electrical extension cord .
He died of a heart attack in 1971 at La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution in Texas [ Wikipedia ] , which is also where David Harris did his time .
As a matter of fact that 's where Allard Lowenstein visited Harris before engineering CIA - Frank Serpico issues during his [ Lowenstein's ] run in Brooklyn against Rooney - roughly commensurate to Frank Lucus in American Gangster now played by Denzel Washington .
Did getting rid of Valachi somehow figure in that ?
Lowenstein / Serpico unified police corruption for the CIA , Frank Lucus unified drug dealing for the CIA , and Joe Valachi was evidence of previous CIA affiliation with the old Mafia structures until around the time David Harris went to prison .
No word on whether Lowenstein and Harris discussed killing Valachi when they met in La Tuna ; maybe Harris was only dropped in afterwards to make sure Valachi had n't said anything to anybody else or anyway nobody was squealing , and Lowenstein might have come for a progress report .
Lowenstein went on to mastermind the AIDS attack on Africans and we do know he and Harris again briefly met in a restaurant about that time after a state political convention in California .
In the history of the AIDS crisis there was only one man who both understood the problem and attempted to immediately act in mitigating the disaster ; his name was Dennis Sweeney , he was tortured - and denied - by Harris , he bought a handgun and brought the business to the liberal [ Allard Lowenstein ] , but unfortunately it looks like he did n't finish the job and anyway he was late [ March 1980 , when March 1979 might have averted the crisis / epidemic ] .
Sweeney went to prison a hero to any credible researcher in the field , before getting out and selling out , now living in obscurity in Upstate New Yor

On September 13 - 14 , 2008 , Lawrence Velvel , the dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , plans to convene a ‘ convention ’ at the school ’s facilities ; the attendees of which will plan strategies to prosecute members of the Bush administration for war crimes .
“ This is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred , ” stated Velvel in a press release .
“ It is , rather , intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up , to pursue the guilty as long as necessary and , if need be , to the ends of the Earth .
“ We must try to hold Bush administration leaders accountable in courts of justice .
“ And we must insist on appropriate punishments , including , if guilt is found , the hangings visited upon top German and Japanese war - criminals in the 1940’s . ”
The dean specifically criticizes Justice Department officials who wrote legal opinions designed to provide political cover for administration figures to carry out torture .
However , Velvel ’s sharpest words were saved for President Bush , according to a passage from ABA Journal .
“ The man ultimately responsible for the torture had a unique preparation and persona for the presidency , ” wrote Velvel .
“ He is a former drunk , was a serial failure in business who had to repeatedly be bailed out by daddy ’s friends and wanna - be - friends , was unable to speak articulately despite the finest education (s ) that money and influence can buy , has a dislike of reading , so that 100 - page memos have to be boiled down to one page for him , is heedless of facts and evidence , and appears not even to know the meaning of truth . ”

Sex Assaults Against Women in Military ' Epidemic ' GAO report finds sex assaults and rapes in military under - reported by half .
July 31 , 2008  -- Mary Lauterbach , the mother of murdered pregnant Marine Maria Lauterbach , told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the military must change the way it deals with sexual assault to avoid more tragedies like her own .
" I believe Maria would be alive today if the Marine system had been different , " her mother told a panel of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , which held a hearing Thursday on sexual assault and rape in the military .
There were no representatives from the Marines at the hearing , and the head of the Pentagon office tasked with responding to the problem of sexual assault in the military was ordered by her superiors not to testify despite a subpoena from the committee .
Lauterbach told lawmakers the chain of command at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina did not do enough to protect her daughter after she accused Cpl. Cesar Laurean of raping her .
Military brass was slow to act , even after Maria 's car was vandalized and she was punched in the face .
" They did n't believe it was anything , " Lauterbach told lawmakers .
" Maria had asked ... she goes , ' I would like to be transferred from Camp Lejeune . '
They said , ' Do n't bother .
It 's not going to happen . ' "
Rep . Bruce Braley , whose congressional district includes Dubuque , Iowa , where yesterday they mourned the murder of Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc , said this is not an isolated incident .
Wimunc 's husband , a Marine corporal , has been charged with her murder .
At Ft. Bragg in North Carolina , another pregnant soldier was killed more than a month ago and the father of her baby , Sgt. Edgar Patino , was arrested this week and charged with her murder .
" This is not an isolated thing we 're talking about , " Braley said .
While the military has come a long way since the days of the Tailhook scandal 15 years ago -- which is credited with creating a safer environment for female service members -- Rep. Jane Harman , D - Calif. , said there remains an " epidemic of assault and rape against women in our military . "
" Women serving in the military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than be killed by enemy fire in Iraq , " Harman said .
A GAO report released today found that instances of rape and sexual assault are under - reported in the military by as much as half .
The GAO report found some victims in the military do not report sexual assault because they fear " that nothing will be done ; fear of ostracism , harassment , or ridicule ; and concern that peers would gossip . "
Lawmakers could not ask Dr. Kaye Whitley , director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office at the Pentagon , to address the issue of sexual assault and what steps have been taken because Deputy Defense Undersecretary Michael Dominguez had barred Whitley from testifying , despite a Congressional subpoena .
Dominguez told the lawmakers he knew everything about the program and did n't need Whitley 's input to answer their questions .
Dominguez was given a bipartisan dressing down on this point by Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , who chairs the Oversight Committee .
" I do n't know who you think elected you to defy the congress of the United States , " he said .
Rep. Chris Shays , R - Conn. , the ranking member , said he will support Waxman 's pledge to hold Whitley and Dominguez in contempt .
They dismissed Dominguez without taking his testimony .
Testifying alongside Lauterbach was Ingrid Torres , who told the lawmakers that when she moved overseas as a Red Cross worker assigned to the American military , she was excited " to be doing a job that could make a difference to those serving their country , especially during a time of war . "
But a year later in Korea , Torres was raped in her sleep by a military doctor after taking an Ambien .
The perpetrator , then the installation flight doctor , has since been convicted , kicked out of the military and placed in confinement .
But Torres said the military has a long way to go helping female soldiers and civilians who are the victims of rape and sexual assault .
" I , as the victim , made others feel more uncomfortable than him , as the accused , " she told a House panel .
Later , she said , " a psychologist told me I was acting like a baby . "
Torres said the military should streamline its programs across bases and branches to combat sexual assault and rape .
Lt. General Michael Rochelle told lawmakers about a comprehensive prevention campaign in the works by the Army and the increased advocacy for victims and training for all levels of soldier enacted in the past several years .
Rochelle offered an " apology to any , any soldier who has worn the uniform and suffered out of sexual assault . "
And second , if were all supposedly so equal now , then why cant white men be victims , too ?
Weve certainly had to deal with our share of hateful stereotypes .
These days its accepted as fact that white men cant jump .
Ooooh , but we love swimming , right ?
Weve all heard it before : Just give the white guy a microbrew and an inner tube .
Thatll keep him happy .
Because really , isnt the greatest victimization of all being robbed of your ability to be the victim ?
Maybe I ’m just being paranoid here , but I ’m starting to get a little worried that RubyGems could be a nasty attack vector , given certain combinations of malice and stupidity .
Six months ago , the Ape project picked up some collaborators with way more Ruby - savvy than I have , and in short order they moved it to RubyForge and made it into a Gem .
Which means that anyone who uses RubyGems , i.e. every Ruby developer in the world , can type
sudo gem install ape
then when they type ape_server , there ’s a mongrel and a handy local Ape running on port 4000 .
What ’s not to like ?
Well , I eventually came to wonder , where is ape_server anyhow ?
In /usr / bin , it turns out .
Which is in root ’s path on OS X , GNU / Linux , and Solaris .
OK then , so if gem routinely dumps programs in /usr / bin , who ’s entitled to create Gems ?
Anyone with a RubyForge account , it seems .
So , how do you get one of those ?
Well , by going to rubyforge.org and clicking on “ New Account ” .
Am I being paranoid , or is this maybe a problem ?
Scenario : J. Evil Hacker creates a naked_celebrity_video gem and announces it to the world .
Installing it , as a side - effect , creates /usr / bin/ls .
Or , J.E.H. submits some good patches to a well - known gem and eventually gets blessed as a committer : /usr / bin/ls .
Or , J.E.H. manages to get access to a logged - on computer belonging to a well - known gem maintainer ; someone who knows what they ’re doing , given about fifteen minutes : /usr / bin/ls .

UPDATE : Click here to listen to Peterson 's three 911 calls ( MP3 )
AUGUST 5-- If you 're wondering what the guy who called 911 to complain about his Subway sandwiches looks like , well , meet Reginald Peterson .
The 42 - year - old Florida man became so upset last Thursday when a pair of subs " did not include ' everything ' as he had requested , " he called Jacksonville cops " so that the police could have his sandwich made to his specifications , " according to a Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office report .
Peterson , pictured in the mug shot at left , was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of placing false 911 calls .
A Subway employee told cops that an irate Peterson was " screaming at everyone in the business " because a worker could not seem to rectify the sandwich problem .
As for the fate of the Subway grub , the sheriff 's report notes , " The sandwiches were placed in a trash can at the suspect 's request . " ( 3 pages )
Exclusive to STR
Government is doomed .
The whole miserable apparatus of local , State and Federal politicos , liars , thieves , pimps , bullies and bureau - rats will disappear a couple of decades hence and a few years later , the peoples of every other country in the world will follow our example .
Those of us who understand why it has to go are now , happily , equipped to make it happen .
A few weeks ago in Avalanche , I asked Strike The Root readers to name any hostile action they could think of , which government might use to stop this stampede towards liberty .
I had some lurid replies which I 'd not considered -- thank you very much !-- but was able to see how none of them could prevent the inexorable progress towards freedom , given the three key assumptions named in that article .
So I 've been able to complete my book about the final five years of government in America , and it's now available here under the title " Transition to Liberty . "
Having done so , I considered again whether there might be anything I 'd overlooked , any obstacle that might darken the outlook .
Since government hostility will be impotent , might there be anything else that might delay the arrival of a free society ?
I can see only one possibility .
All - out War
That would be a showstopper , with nuclear and / or other weapons of mass destruction .
If that were to take place , all bets are off ; the human race may well not survive , or not in recognizable form .
There 's not much we can do about this , except to pursue the termination of government with all deliberate speed so as to minimize the exposure .
So far , no government of a well - developed nation has started such a war -- their leaders may be stupid , but they are n't dumb ; even though they may be unable to spell the word or keep pronouncing it " nucular , " they know well that they would be personally fried , and that 's not part of their agenda .
We 've been lucky so far , but given time , it 's inevitable that one of them , in a fit of pique or by mistake , will press the button .
I do n't want to give them time ; I have some really cute grandchildren .
Recession , or Worse
Is there anything else that might change the date on which government evaporates ?
How about a depression ?
It 's a fair question .
Such massive dislocations have been introduced to this and other major economies worldwide by the arrogant intrusion of governments that it's a wonder they have continued , more or less , to stand upright .
Glen Allport has given us a clear warning that they may be about to tumble .
Suppose that happens ; will it delay the arrival of a free society , or will it cause E - Day to arrive sooner ?
The last one ( 1931 - 45 ) was a miserable affair , but greatly reduced the level of liberty and enhanced the standing of government in society !
Having blundered into the depression , propaganda was so well managed as to convince almost everyone that government was its solution instead of its cause , and that fiction has lasted two whole generations and counting .
No wonder FDR carries the status of a saint among Pols of every stripe .
He magically plucked a government victory out of a government disaster .
Never before have so many been so thoroughly and wickedly deceived by so few .
But things are different now .
For one thing , there is a substantial , intelligent and articulate minority of scholars and others who understand what really caused the catastrophe , and Rothbard 's America 's Great Depression is still available for anyone else to buy and study .
For another , this and a large number of other web sites , radio programs and investment gurus have for decades been warning ( in various words and to varying degrees ) that " government is a disease , masquerading as its own cure . "
And for a third , a clear and systematic understanding of what government is and what freedom means has now begun to spread exponentially from person to person , friend to friend .
None of these things were true in 1929 , which is why virtually nobody understood what was going on or what to do about it , and why government was able to get away with the Great Deception as above .
Fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me .
Government 's grip on mass communication remains powerful , with indoctrination spewing hourly from schoolteachers and TVs and magazines and even newspapers , still , everywhere -- but now there is the Internet .
Anyone with a pulse can Google " gas puzzler " for example , and find ( as I just did ) the top three places of the search pointing to my recent article here under that title , ahead of references to the phrase in major world newspapers .
Nobody could do that in 1929 .
It may well be , therefore , that as disasters hit during the coming depression , if they do , a lot of minds will be open to hear " we told you so . "
Not , of course , that we should be too strident in using so inflammatory a phrase ; but stridently or subtly , that is what we will be able to say , and what will matter is the context in which we say it .
The context that counts is not so much just a public forum in which are aired competing explanations of whatever disaster hit us , but rather the one of inviting a friend to join the freedom school .
Even if a free - market interpretation of events were to win an " Editor 's Pick " from the New York Times or Washington Post - - fat chance -- that would not cause government to evaporate .
What will cause it to evaporate is that a TOLFA graduate will be able to say , ' Look at this STR article from 2006 , which predicts and accounts almost exactly for what took place last week !'-- that would sometimes be the deciding factor in his friend 's decision to join .
Then it may be slightly easier for each to recruit one or more friends a year , and so its exponential growth may be completed a few months earlier .
Therefore , in my opinion , it wo n't make a whole lot of difference whether a depression takes place or not .
Freedom is urgently necessary whether the age of government becomes less tolerable or more so ; the rational imperative to end that age springs from fundamental reason , not from the trappings of current prosperity or the lack of it .
And once it is achieved , any increase of poverty in the interim will be quickly swept away by the torrent of enterprise , innovation and prosperity that will follow .
A factor of slightly greater importance is the degree to which freedom - seekers grasp the opportunity now available .
The nature of exponential growth means that one person joining today will bring a large number with him downstream , after several years ; so if another 500 were to become active this Summer , a whole year would be clipped off the time needed for government to vanish .
A further 1,000 or so would chop it by a second year .
Root Strikers who have n't yet joined the Freedom Academy might want to consider that .

parser import * from datetime import * import commands import os now = parse ( commands.getoutput ( " date " ) ) today = now.date ( ) year = rrule ( YEARLY , bymonth=8 , bymonthday=13 , byweekday=FR ) [ 0 ] . year rdelta = relativedelt a( easter ( year ) , today ) print " Today is : " , today print " Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is : " , year print " How far is the Easter of that year : " , rdelta print " And the Easter of that year is : " , today + rdelta
And here 's the output :
Today is : 2003 - 10 - 11
Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is : 2004 How far is the Easter of that year : relativedelta ( months =+6 )
And the Easter of that year is : 2004-04-11
Being exactly 6 months ahead was really a coincidence

relativedelta
This module offers the relativedelta type , which is based on the specification of the excelent work done by M. - A. Lemburg in his mxDateTime extension .
However , notice that this type does not implement the same algorithm as his work .
Do not expect it to behave like mxDateTime 's counterpart .
relativedelta type
There 's two different ways to build a relativedelta instance .
The first one is passing it two date / datetime instances :
relativedelta( datetime1 , datetime2 )
This will build the relative difference between datetime1 and datetime2 , so that the following constraint is always true :
datetime2+relativedelta( datetime1 , datetime2 ) == datetime1
Notice that instead of datetime instances , you may use date instances , or a mix of both .
And the other way is to use any of the following keyword arguments :
year , month , day , hour , minute , second , microsecond Absolute information .
years , months , weeks , days , hours , minutes , seconds , microseconds Relative information , may be negative .
weekday
One of the weekday instances ( MO , TU , etc ) .
These instances may receive a parameter n , specifying the n th weekday , which could be positive or negative ( like MO ( + 2 ) or MO ( - 3 ) .
Not specifying it is the same as specifying +1 .
You can also use an integer , where 0=MO .
Notice that , for example , if the calculated date is already Monday , using MO or MO ( +1 ) ( which is the same thing in this context ) , wo n't change the day .
leapdays
Will add given days to the date found , but only if the computed year is a leap year and the computed date is post 28 of february .
yearday , nlyearday
Set the yearday or the non-leap year day ( jump leap days ) .
These are converted to day / month / leapdays information .
Behavior of operations
If you 're curious about how exactly the relative delta will act on operations , here is a description of its behavior .
Calculate the absolute year , using the year argument , or the original datetime year , if the argument is not present .
Add the relative years argument to the absolute year .
Do steps 1 and 2 for month / months .
Calculate the absolute day , using the day argument , or the original datetime day , if the argument is not present .
Then , subtract from the day until it fits in the year and month found after their operations .
Add the relative days argument to the absolute day .
Notice that the weeks argument is multiplied by 7 and added to days .
If leapdays is present , the computed year is a leap year , and the computed month is after february , remove one day from the found date .
Do steps 1 and 2 for hour / hours , minute / minutes , second / seconds , microsecond / microseconds .
If the weekday argument is present , calculate the n th occurrence of the given weekday .
Examples
Let 's begin our trip .
>>> from datetime import *; from dateutil.relativedelta import * >>> import calendar
Store some values .
>>> NOW = datetime.now ( ) >>> TODAY = date.today ( ) >>>
NOW datetime.datetime ( 2003 , 9 , 17 , 20 , 54 , 47 , 282310 ) >>>
TODAY datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 17 )
Next month .
>>> NOW+relativedelta( months=+1 ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 10 , 17 , 20 , 54 , 47 , 282310 )
Next month , plus one week .
>>> NOW+relativedelta( months=+1 , weeks =+1 ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 10 , 24 , 20 , 54 , 47 , 282310 )
Next month , plus one week , at 10 am .
>>> TODAY+relativedelta( months=+1 , weeks =+1 , hour=10 ) datetime.datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 24 , 10 , 0 )
Let 's try the other way around .
Notice that the hour setting we get in the relativedelta is relative , since it's a difference , and the weeks parameter has gone .
>>> relativedelta( datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 24 , 10 , 0 ) , TODAY ) relativedelta( months=+1 , days =+7 , hours= +10 )
One month before one year .
>>> NOW+relativedelta( years=+1 , months= -1 ) datetime.datetime( 2004 , 8 , 17 , 20 , 54 , 47 , 282310 )
How does it handle months with different numbers of days ?
Notice that adding one month will never cross the month boundary .
>>> date ( 2003,1,27 )+relativedelta( months=+1 ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 2 , 27 ) >>> date ( 2003,1,31 ) +relativedelta( months=+1 ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 2 , 28 ) >>> date ( 2003,1,31 )+relativedelta( months=+2 ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 3 , 31 )
The logic for years is the same , even on leap years .
>>> date ( 2000,2,28 ) +relativedelta( years=+1 ) datetime.date ( 2001 , 2 , 28 ) >>> date ( 2000,2,29 ) +relativedelta( years=+1 ) datetime.date ( 2001 , 2 , 28 ) >>> date ( 1999,2,28 ) +relativedelta( years=+1 ) datetime.date ( 2000 , 2 , 28 ) >>> date ( 1999,3,1)+relativedelta( years=+1 ) datetime.date ( 2000 , 3 , 1 ) >>> date ( 2001,2,28 )+relativedelta( years=-1 ) datetime.date ( 2000 , 2 , 28 ) >>> date ( 2001,3,1)+relativedelta( years=-1 ) datetime.date ( 2000 , 3 , 1 )
Next friday .
>>> TODAY+relativedelta( weekday=FR ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 19 ) >>>
TODAY+relativedelta( weekday=calendar.FRIDAY ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 19 )
Last friday in this month .
>>> TODAY+relativedelta( day=31 , weekday=FR( - 1 ) ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 26 )
Next wednesday ( it 's today ! ) .
>>> TODAY+relativedelta( weekday=WE ( +1 ) ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 17 )
Next wednesday , but not today .
>>> TODAY+relativedelta( days=+1 , weekday=WE ( +1 ) ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 24 )
Following ISO year week number notation find the first day of the 15th week of 1997 .
>>> datetime ( 1997,1,1)+relativedelta( day=4 , weekday=MO ( - 1 ) , weeks =+14 ) datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 4 , 7 , 0 , 0 )
How long ago has the millennium changed ?
>>> relativedelta( NOW , date ( 2001,1,1 ) ) relativedelta( years = +2 , months =+8 , days=+16 , hours= +20 , minutes=+54 , seconds=+47 , microseconds=+282310 )
How old is John ?
>>> johnbirthday = datetime ( 1978 , 4 , 5 , 12 , 0 ) >>> relativedelta( NOW , johnbirthday ) relativedelta( years= +25 , months =+5 , days=+12 , hours= +8 , minutes=+54 , seconds=+47 , microseconds=+282310 )
It works with dates too .
>>> relativedelta( TODAY , johnbirthday ) relativedelta( years=+25 , months=+5 , days=+11 , hours= +
12 )
Obtain today 's date using the yearday :
>>> date ( 2003 , 1 , 1)+relativedelta( yearday=260 ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 17 )
We can use today 's date , since yearday should be absolute in the given year :
>>> TODAY+relativedelta( yearday=260 ) datetime.date ( 2003 , 9 , 17 )
Last year it should be in the same day :
>>> date ( 2002 , 1 , 1)+relativedelta( yearday=260 ) datetime.date ( 2002 , 9 , 17 )
But not in a leap year :
>>> date ( 2000 , 1 , 1)+relativedelta( yearday=260 ) datetime.date ( 2000 , 9 , 16 )
We can use the non -leap year day to ignore this :
>>> date ( 2000 , 1 , 1)+relativedelta( nlyearday=260 ) datetime.date ( 2000 , 9 , 17 )
rrule
The rrule module offers a small , complete , and very fast , implementation of the recurrence rules documented in the iCalendar RFC , including support for caching of results .
rrule type
That 's the base of the rrule operation .
It accepts all the keywords defined in the RFC as its constructor parameters ( except byday , which was renamed to byweekday ) and more .
The constructor prototype is :
rrule ( freq )
Where freq must be one of YEARLY , MONTHLY , WEEKLY , DAILY , HOURLY , MINUTELY , or SECONDLY .
Additionally , it supports the following keyword arguments :
cache
If given , it must be a boolean value specifying to enable or disable caching of results .
If you will use the same rrule instance multiple times , enabling caching will improve the performance considerably .
dtstart
The recurrence start .
Besides being the base for the recurrence , missing parameters in the final recurrence instances will also be extracted from this date .
If not given , datetime.now ( ) will be used instead .
interval
The interval between each freq iteration .
For example , when using YEARLY , an interval of 2 means once every two years , but with HOURLY , it means once every two hours .
The default interval is 1 . wkst
The week start day .
Must be one of the MO , TU , WE constants , or an integer , specifying the first day of the week .
This will affect recurrences based on weekly periods .
The default week start is got from calendar. firstweekday ( ) , and may be modified by calendar.setfirstweekday ( ) .
count
How many occurrences will be generated .
until
If given , this must be a datetime instance , that will specify the limit of the recurrence .
If a recurrence instance happens to be the same as the datetime instance given in the until keyword , this will be the last occurrence .
bysetpos
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , positive or negative .
Each given integer will specify an occurrence number , corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule inside the frequency period .
For example , a bysetpos of - 1 if combined with a MONTHLY frequency , and a byweekday of ( MO , TU , WE , TH , FR ) , will result in the last work day of every month .
bymonth
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the months to apply the recurrence to .
bymonthday
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to .
byyearday
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to .
byweekno
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to .
Week numbers have the meaning described in ISO8601 , that is , the first week of the year is that containing at least four days of the new year .
byweekday
If given , it must be either an integer ( 0 == MO ) , a sequence of integers , one of the weekday constants ( MO , TU , etc ) , or a sequence of these constants .
When given , these variables will define the weekdays where the recurrence will be applied .
It 's also possible to use an argument n for the weekday instances , which will mean the n th occurrence of this weekday in the period .
For example , with MONTHLY , or with YEARLY and BYMONTH , using FR ( +1 ) in byweekday will specify the first friday of the month where the recurrence happens .
Notice that in the RFC documentation , this is specified as BYDAY , but was renamed to avoid the ambiguity of that keyword .
byhour
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the hours to apply the recurrence to .
byminute
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the minutes to apply the recurrence to .
bysecond
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , meaning the seconds to apply the recurrence to .
byeaster
If given , it must be either an integer , or a sequence of integers , positive or negative .
Each integer will define an offset from the Easter Sunday .
Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the Easter Sunday itself .
This is an extension to the RFC specification .
rrule frequencies
The rrule frequency denotes the period on which the rule is evaluated .
Multiple dates may match in a single period , and none may match as well , depending on the rule itself .
In other words , the rule wo n't be adapted to ensure that a match necessarily happens inside the given frequency , and if multiple entries match the rule they will be returned .
Note , for instance , the two rules :
>>> list ( rrule ( DAILY , count=3 , byweekday = ( TU , TH ) , ... dtstart=datetime(2007,1,1 ) ) ) [ datetime.datetime( 2007 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 4 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 0 ) ] >>> list ( rrule ( WEEKLY , count=3 , byweekday = ( TU , TH ) , ... dtstart=datetime(2007,1,1 ) ) ) [ datetime.datetime( 2007 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 4 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 0 ) ] >>
In this case , they have the same meaning .
The only difference is the way that they were generated .
Now , notice the change if we include a bysetpos option .
>>> list ( rrule ( DAILY , count=3 , byweekday = ( TU , TH ) , bysetpos=1 , ... dtstart=datetime(2007,1,1 ) ) ) [ datetime.datetime( 2007 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 4 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 0 ) ] >>> list ( rrule ( WEEKLY , count=3 , byweekday = ( TU , TH ) , bysetpos=1 , ... dtstart=datetime(2007,1,1 ) ) ) [ datetime.datetime( 2007 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime( 2007 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 2007 , 1 , 16 , 0 , 0 ) ]
In both cases , only the first matching entry inside the given period was considered a match .
It is also important to note that specifying only the frequency will result in the relevant byXXX rule parts being retrieved from the dtstart value .
For instance :
rrule ( MONTHLY , dtstart=datetime( 2007,1,2 ) )
This would assume bymonthday =2 , byhour=0 , byminute=0 , and so would generate date values for Jan 2nd , Feb 2nd , Mar 2nd , and so on .
If , on the other hand , the start date is on Jan 31st :
rrule ( MONTHLY , dtstart=datetime(2007,1,31 ) )
This would only generate values for 31st Jan , 31st Mar , 31st May , etc .
Any month with less than 31 days is ignored .
To generate a rrule for the use case of " a date on the specified day of the month , unless it is beyond the end of month , in which case it will be the last day of the month " use the following :
rrule ( MONTHLY , bymonthday=( some_day , - 1 ) , bysetpos=1 )
This will generate a value for every calendar month regardless of the day of the month it is started from .
For more details , check the iCalendar RFC .
rrule methods
The following methods are available in rrule instances :
rrule.before ( dt , inc=False )
Returns the last recurrence before the given datetime instance .
The inc keyword defines what happens if dt is an occurrence .
With inc == True , if dt itself is an occurrence , it will be returned .
rrule. after ( dt , inc=False )
Returns the first recurrence after the given datetime instance .
The inc keyword defines what happens if dt is an occurrence .
With inc == True , if dt itself is an occurrence , it will be returned .
rrule .
between ( after , before , inc=False )
Returns all the occurrences of the rrule between after and before .
The inc keyword defines what happens if after and / or before are themselves occurrences .
With inc == True , they will be included in the list , if they are found in the recurrence set . rrule.count ( )
Returns the number of recurrences in this set .
It will have go trough the whole recurrence , if this has n't been done before .
Besides these methods , rrule instances also support the __getitem__ ( ) and __contains__ ( ) special methods , meaning that these are valid expressions :
rr = rrule ( ... ) if datetime ( ... ) in rr : ... print rr[ 0 ] print rr [ - 1 ] print rr [ 1:2 ] print rr [ ::-2 ]
The getitem / slicing mechanism is smart enough to avoid getting the whole recurrence set , if possible .
Notes
The rrule type has no byday keyword .
The equivalent keyword has been replaced by the byweekday keyword , to remove the ambiguity present in the original keyword .
Unlike documented in the RFC , the starting datetime ( dtstart ) is not the first recurrence instance , unless it does fit in the specified rules .
In a python module context , this behavior makes more sense than otherwise .
Notice that you can easily get the original behavior by using a rruleset and adding the dtstart as an rdate recurrence .
Unlike documented in the RFC , every keyword is valid on every frequency ( the RFC documents that byweekno is only valid on yearly frequencies , for example ) .
In addition to the documented keywords , a byeaster keyword was introduced , making it easy to compute recurrent events relative to the Easter Sunday .

rruleset type
The rruleset type allows more complex recurrence setups , mixing multiple rules , dates , exclusion rules , and exclusion dates .
The type constructor takes the following keyword arguments :
cache If True , caching of results will be enabled , improving performance of multiple queries considerably .
rruleset methods
The following methods are available :
rruleset.rrule( rrule )
Include the given rrule instance in the recurrence set generation .
rruleset.rdate( dt )
Include the given datetime instance in the recurrence set generation .
rruleset.exrule( rrule )
Include the given rrule instance in the recurrence set exclusion list .
Dates which are part of the given recurrence rules will not be generated , even if some inclusive rrule or rdate matches them .
rruleset.exdate( dt )
Include the given datetime instance in the recurrence set exclusion list .
Dates included that way will not be generated , even if some inclusive rrule or rdate matches them .
rruleset .
before ( dt , inc=False )
Returns the last recurrence before the given datetime instance .
The inc keyword defines what happens if dt is an occurrence .
With inc == True , if dt itself is an occurrence , it will be returned .
rruleset.after ( dt , inc=False )
Returns the first recurrence after the given datetime instance .
The inc keyword defines what happens if dt is an occurrence .
With inc == True , if dt itself is an occurrence , it will be returned .
rruleset .
between ( after , before , inc=False )
Returns all the occurrences of the rrule between after and before .
The inc keyword defines what happens if after and / or before are themselves occurrences .
With inc == True , they will be included in the list , if they are found in the recurrence set . rruleset.count ( )
Returns the number of recurrences in this set .
It will have go trough the whole recurrence , if this has n't been done before .
Besides these methods , rruleset instances also support the __getitem__ ( ) and __contains__ ( ) special methods , meaning that these are valid expressions :
set = rruleset ( ... ) if datetime ( ... ) in set : ... print set [ 0 ] print set [ - 1 ] print set [ 1:2 ] print set [ ::-2 ]
The getitem / slicing mechanism is smart enough to avoid getting the whole recurrence set , if possible .
rruleset examples
Daily , for 7 days , jumping Saturday and Sunday occurrences .
>>> set = rruleset ( ) >>> set.rrule ( rrule ( DAILY , count=7 , dtstart=parse ( " 19970902T090000 " ) ) ) >>> set.exrule( rrule( YEARLY , byweekday =( SA,SU ) , dtstart=parse ( " 19970902T090000 " ) ) ) >>> list ( set ) [ datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 2 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 3 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 4 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 5 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 8 , 9 , 0 ) ]
Weekly , for 4 weeks , plus one time on day 7 , and not on day 16 .
>>> set = rruleset ( ) >>> set.rrule ( rrule ( WEEKLY , count=4 , dtstart=parse ( " 19970902T090000 " ) ) ) >>> set.rdate(datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 7 , 9 , 0 ) ) >>> set.exdate(datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 16 , 9 , 0 ) ) >>> list ( set ) [ datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 2 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 7 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 23 , 9 , 0 ) ]
rrulestr ( ) function
The rrulestr ( ) function is a parser for RFC - like syntaxes .
The function prototype is :
rrulestr ( str )
The string passed as parameter may be a multiple line string , a single line string , or just the RRULE property value .
Additionally , it accepts the following keyword arguments :
cache If True , the rruleset or rrule created instance will cache its results .
Default is not to cache .
dtstart
If given , it must be a datetime instance that will be used when no DTSTART property is found in the parsed string .
If it is not given , and the property is not found , datetime .now ( ) will be used instead .
unfold
If set to True , lines will be unfolded following the RFC specification .
It defaults to False , meaning that spaces before every line will be stripped .
forceset
If set to True a rruleset instance will be returned , even if only a single rule is found .
The default is to return an rrule if possible , and an rruleset if necessary .
compatible
If set to True , the parser will operate in RFC - compatible mode .
Right now it means that unfold will be turned on , and if a DTSTART is found , it will be considered the first recurrence instance , as documented in the RFC .
ignoretz
If set to True , the date parser will ignore timezone information available in the DTSTART property , or the UNTIL attribute .
tzinfos
If set , it will be passed to the datetime string parser to resolve unknown timezone settings .
For more information about what could be used here , check the parser documentation .
rrulestr ( ) examples
Every 10 days , 5 occurrences .
>>> list ( rrulestr ( " " " ...
DTSTART :19970902T090000 ...
RRULE : FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5 ... " " " ) ) [ datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 2 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 12 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 22 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime( 1997 , 10 , 2 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 10 , 12 , 9 , 0 ) ]
Same thing , but passing only the RRULE value .
>>> list ( rrulestr ( " FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5 " , dtstart=parse ( " 19970902T090000 " ) ) ) [ datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 2 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 9 , 12 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime( 1997 , 9 , 22 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime( 1997 , 10 , 2 , 9 , 0 ) , datetime.datetime ( 1997 , 10 , 12 , 9 , 0 ) ]
Notice that when using a single rule , it returns an rrule instance , unless forceset was used .
>>> rrulestr ( " FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5 " ) < dateutil.rrule.rrule instance at 0x30269f08 > >>> rrulestr ( " " " ...
DTSTART :19970902T090000 ...
RRULE : FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5 ... " " " ) < dateutil.rrule.rrule instance at 0x302699e0 > >>> rrulestr ( " FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5 " , forceset =True ) < dateutil.rrule.rruleset instance at 0x30269f08 >
But when an rruleset is needed , it is automatically used .
>>> rrulestr ( " " " ...
DTSTART :19970902T090000 ...
RRULE : FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5 ... RRULE : FREQ=DAILY ;INTERVAL=5;COUNT=3 ... " " " ) < dateutil.rrule.rruleset instance at 0x302699e0 >
parser
This module offers a generic date / time string parser which is able to parse most known formats to represent a date and / or time .
parse ( ) function
That 's probably the only function you 'll need from this module .
It offers you an interface to access the parser functionality and extract a datetime type out of a string .
The prototype of this function is :
parse ( timestr )
Additionally , the following keyword arguments are available :
default
If given , this must be a datetime instance .
Any fields missing in the parsed date will be copied from this instance .
The default value is the current date , at 00:00:00 am .
ignoretz
If this is true , even if a timezone is found in the string , the parser will not use it .
tzinfos
Using this keyword argument you may provide custom timezones to the parser .
If given , it must be either a dictionary with the timezone abbreviation as key , or a function accepting a timezone abbreviation and offset as argument .
The dictionary values and the function return must be a timezone offset in seconds , a tzinfo subclass , or a string defining the timezone ( in the TZ environment variable format ) .
dayfirst
This option allow one to change the precedence in which days are parsed in date strings .
The default is given in the parserinfo instance ( the default parserinfo has it set to False ) .
If dayfirst is False , the MM - DD - YYYY format will have precedence over DD - MM - YYYY in an ambiguous date .
yearfirst
This option allow one to change the precedence in which years are parsed in date strings .
The default is given in the parserinfo instance ( the default parserinfo has it set to False ) .
If yearfirst is false , the MM - DD - YY format will have precedence over YY - MM - DD in an ambiguous date .
fuzzy
If fuzzy is set to True , unknown tokens in the string will be ignored .
parserinfo
This parameter allows one to change how the string is parsed , by using a different parserinfo class instance .
Using it you may , for example , intenationalize the parser strings , or make it ignore additional words .
Format precedence
Whenever an ambiguous date is found , the dayfirst and yearfirst parameters will control how the information is processed .
Here is the precedence in each case :
If dayfirst is False and yearfirst is False , ( default , if no parameter is given ) :
MM-DD-YY
DD-MM-YY
YY-MM-DD
If dayfirst is True and yearfirst is False :
DD-MM-YY
MM-DD-YY
YY-MM-DD
If dayfirst is False and yearfirst is True :
YY-MM-DD
MM-DD-YY
DD-MM-YY
If dayfirst is True and yearfirst is True :
YY-MM-DD
DD-MM-YY
MM-DD-YY
Converting two digit years
When a two digit year is found , it is processed considering the current year , so that the computed year is never more than 49 years after then current year , nor 50 years before the current year .
In other words , if we are in year 2003 , and the year 30 is found , it will be considered as 2030 , but if the year 60 is found , it will be considered 1960 .
Examples
The following code will prepare the environment :
>>> from dateutil .
parser import * >>> from dateutil.tz import * >>> from datetime import * >>>
TZOFFSETS = { " BRST " : - 10800} >>>
BRSTTZ = tzoffset ( - 10800 , " BRST " ) >>>
DEFAULT = datetime ( 2003 , 9 , 25 )
Some simple examples based on the date command , using the TZOFFSET dictionary to provide the BRST timezone offset .
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 25 10:36:28 BRST 2003 " , tzinfos=TZOFFSETS ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 , tzinfo=tzoffset (' BRST ' , - 10800 ) ) >>> parse ( " 2003 10:36:28 BRST 25 Sep Thu " , tzinfos=TZOFFSETS ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 , tzinfo=tzoffset (' BRST ' , - 10800 ) )
Notice that since BRST is my local timezone , parsing it without further timezone settings will yield a tzlocal timezone .
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 25 10:36:28 BRST 2003 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 , tzinfo=tzlocal ( ) )
We can also ask to ignore the timezone explicitly :
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 25 10:36:28 BRST 2003 " , ignoretz= True ) datetime.datetime ( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 )
That 's the same as processing a string without timezone :
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 25 10:36:28 2003 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 )
Without the year , but passing our DEFAULT datetime to return the same year , no mattering what year we currently are in :
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 25 10:36:28 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 )
Strip it further :
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 10:36:28 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 ) >>> parse ( " Thu 10:36:28 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 , 28 ) >>> parse ( " Thu 10:36 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 ) >>> parse ( " 10:36 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime(2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 36 ) >>>
Strip in a different way :
>>> parse ( " Thu Sep 25 2003 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 0 , 0 ) >>> parse ( " Sep 25 2003 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 0 , 0 ) >>> parse ( " Sep 2003 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 0 , 0 ) >>> parse ( " Sep " , default =DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 0 , 0 ) >>> parse ( " 2003 " , default=DEFAULT ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 0 , 0 )
Another format , based on date - R ( RFC822 ) :
>>> parse ( " Thu , 25 Sep 2003 10:49:41 - 0300 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 49 , 41 , tzinfo=tzoffset ( None , - 10800 ) )
ISO format :
>>> parse ( " 2003-09-25T10:49:41.5-03:00 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 49 , 41 , 500000 , tzinfo=tzoffset ( None , - 10800 ) )
Some variations :
>>> parse ( " 2003-09-25T10:49:41 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 49 , 41 ) >>> parse ( " 2003-09-25T10:49 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 49 ) >>> parse ( " 2003-09-25T10 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 10 , 0 ) >>> parse ( " 2003-09 - 25 " ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 25 , 0 , 0 )
ISO format , without separators :

easter
This module offers a generic easter computing method for any given year , using Western , Orthodox or Julian algorithms .
easter ( ) function
This method was ported from the work done by GM Arts , on top of the algorithm by Claus Tondering , which was based in part on the algorithm of Ouding ( 1940 ) , as quoted in " Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac " , P. Kenneth Seidelmann , editor .
This algorithm implements three different easter calculation methods :
Original calculation in Julian calendar , valid in dates after 326 AD Original method , with date converted to Gregorian calendar , valid in years 1583 to 4099 Revised method , in Gregorian calendar , valid in years 1583 to 4099 as well
These methods are represented by the constants :
EASTER_JULIAN = 1 EASTER_ORTHODOX = 2 EASTER_WESTERN = 3
The default method is method 3 .
tz
This module offers timezone implementations subclassing the abstract datetime .
tzinfo type .
There are classes to handle tzfile format files ( usually are in /etc / localtime , /usr / share / zoneinfo , etc ) , TZ environment string ( in all known formats ) , given ranges ( with help from relative deltas ) , local machine timezone , fixed offset timezone , and UTC timezone .
tzutc type
This type implements a basic UTC timezone .
The constructor of this type accepts no parameters .
tzutc examples
>>> from datetime import * >>> from dateutil.tz import * >>> datetime.now ( ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 9 , 40 , 1 , 521290 ) >>> datetime.now ( tzutc( ) ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 12 , 40 , 12 , 156379 , tzinfo=tzutc ( ) ) >>> datetime.now ( tzutc( ) ) . tzname ( ) ' UTC '
tzoffset type
This type implements a fixed offset timezone , with no support to daylight saving times .
Here is the prototype of the type constructor :
tzoffset ( name , offset )
The name parameter may be optionally set to None , and offset must be given in seconds .
tzoffset examples
>>> from datetime import * >>> from dateutil.tz import * >>> datetime.now ( tzoffset ( " BRST " , - 10800 ) ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 9 , 52 , 43 , 624904 , tzinfo=tzinfo=tzoffset(' BRST ' , - 10800 ) ) >>> datetime.now( tzoffset ( " BRST " , -10800 ) ) .tzname ( ) ' BRST ' >>> datetime.now( tzoffset ( " BRST " , -10800 ) ).astimezone(tzutc( ) ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 12 , 53 , 11 , 446419 , tzinfo=tzutc ( ) )
tzlocal type
This type implements timezone settings as known by the operating system .
The constructor of this type accepts no parameters .
tzlocal examples
>>> from datetime import * >>> from dateutil.tz import * >>> datetime.now(tzlocal ( ) ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 10 , 1 , 43 , 673605 , tzinfo=tzlocal ( ) ) >>> datetime.now ( tzlocal ( ) ) . tzname ( ) ' BRST ' >>> datetime.now(tzlocal( ) ).astimezone(tzoffset( None , 0 ) ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 13 , 3 , 0 , 11493 , tzinfo=tzoffset ( None , 0 ) )
tzstr type
This type implements timezone settings extracted from a string in known TZ environment variable formats .
Here is the prototype of the constructor :
tzstr( str )
tzstr examples
Here are examples of the recognized formats :
EST5EDT
EST5EDT ,4,0,6,7200,10,0,26,7200,3600
EST5EDT ,4,1,0,7200,10 , -1,0,7200,3600
EST5EDT4 , M4.1.0/02:00:00 ,M10-5-0/02:00
EST5EDT4,95/02:00:00,298/02:00
EST5EDT4,J96/02:00:00,J299/02:00
Notice that if daylight information is not present , but a daylight abbreviation was provided , tzstr will follow the convention of using the first sunday of April to start daylight saving , and the last sunday of October to end it .
If start or end time is not present , 2 AM will be used , and if the daylight offset is not present , the standard offset plus one hour will be used .
This convention is the same as used in the GNU libc .
This also means that some of the above examples are exactly equivalent , and all of these examples are equivalent in the year of 2003 .
Here is the example mentioned in the time module documentation .
>>> os.environ [ ' TZ ' ] = ' EST+05EDT , M4.1.0,M10.5.0 ' >>> time.tzset ( ) >>> time.strftime ( ' %X %x %Z ' ) '02:07:36 05/08/03 EDT ' >>> os.environ [ ' TZ ' ] = ' AEST - 10AEDT -11,M10.5.0, M3.5.0 ' >>> time.tzset ( ) >>> time.strftime ( ' %X %x %Z ' ) ' 16:08:12 05/08/03 AEST '
And here is an example showing the same information using tzstr , without touching system settings .
>>> tz1 = tzstr( 'EST+05EDT , M4.1.0,M10.5.0 ' ) >>> tz2 = tzstr( 'AEST - 10AEDT -11,M10.5.0,M3.5.0 ' ) >>> dt = datetime ( 2003 , 5 , 8 , 2 , 7 , 36 , tzinfo=tz1 ) >>> dt.strftime ( ' %X %x %Z ' ) '02:07:36 05/08/03 EDT ' >>> dt.astimezone(tz2).strftime ( ' % X %x %Z ' ) ' 16:07:36 05/08/03 AEST '
Are these really equivalent ?
>>> tzstr( ' EST5EDT ') == tzstr( 'EST5EDT ,4,1,0,7200,10 ,-1,0,7200,3600 ')
True
Check the daylight limit .
>>> datetime ( 2003 , 4 , 6 , 1 , 59 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EST ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 00 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EDT ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 26 , 0 , 59 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EDT ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 26 , 1 , 00 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EST '
tzrange type
This type offers the same functionality as the tzstr type , but instead of timezone strings , information is passed using relativedelta s which are applied to a datetime set to the first day of the year .
Here is the prototype of this type 's constructor :
tzrange ( stdabbr , stdoffset=None , dstabbr=None , dstoffset=None , start=None , end =None ) :
Offsets must be given in seconds .
Information not provided will be set to the defaults , as explained in the tzstr section above .
tzrange examples
>>> tzstr( ' EST5EDT ') == tzrange ( " EST " , - 18000 , " EDT " ) True >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import * >>> range1 = tzrange ( " EST " , - 18000 , " EDT " ) >>> range2 = tzrange ( " EST " , -18000 , " EDT " , - 14400 , ... relativedelta( hours=+2 , month=4 , day=1 , weekday=SU ( +1 ) ) , ... relativedelta( hours=+1 , month=10 , day=31 , weekday=SU ( - 1 ) ) ) >>> tzstr( ' EST5EDT ') == range1 == range2 True
Notice a minor detail in the last example : while the DST should end at 2 AM , the delta will catch 1AM .
That 's because the daylight saving time should end at 2 AM standard time ( the difference between STD and DST is 1h in the given example ) instead of the DST time .
That 's how the tzinfo subtypes should deal with the extra hour that happens when going back to the standard time .
Check tzinfo documentation for more information .
tzfile type
This type allows one to use tzfile ( 5 ) format timezone files to extract current and historical zone information .
Here is the type constructor prototype :
tzfile ( fileobj )
Where fileobj is either a filename or a file - like object with a read ( ) method .
tzfile examples
>>> tz = tzfile ( " /etc/localtime " ) >>> datetime.now ( tz ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 12 , 3 , 48 , 392138 , tzinfo=tzfile ( '/etc/localtime ' ) ) >>> datetime.now(tz).astimezone(tzutc( ) ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 9 , 27 , 15 , 3 , 53 , 70863 , tzinfo=tzutc ( ) ) >>> datetime.now(tz).tzname ( ) ' BRST ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 1 , 1 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' BRDT '
Check the daylight limit .
>>> tz = tzfile ( '/usr/share/zoneinfo/EST5EDT ' ) >>> datetime ( 2003 , 4 , 6 , 1 , 59 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EST ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 00 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EDT ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 26 , 0 , 59 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EDT ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 26 , 1 , 00 , tzinfo=tz ).tzname ( ) ' EST '
tzical type
This type is able to parse iCalendar style VTIMEZONE sessions into a Python timezone object .
The constuctor prototype is :
tzical ( fileobj )
Where fileobj is either a filename or a file - like object with a read ( ) method .
tzical methods
tzical.get ( tzid=None )
Since a single iCalendar file may contain more than one timezone , you must ask for the timezone you want with this method .
If there 's more than one timezone in the parsed file , you 'll need to pass the tzid parameter .
Otherwise , leaving it empty will yield the only available timezone .
tzical examples
Here is a sample file extracted from the RFC .
This file defines the EST5EDT timezone , and will be used in the following example .
BEGIN : VTIMEZONE TZID:US - Eastern LAST -MODIFIED:19870101T000000Z
TZURL : http://zones.stds_r_us.net/tz/US-Eastern BEGIN:STANDARD DTSTART:19671029T020000 RRULE : FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=-1SU;BYMONTH=10 TZOFFSETFROM :-0400 TZOFFSETTO:-0500 TZNAME :EST END : STANDARD BEGIN : DAYLIGHT
DTSTART:19870405T020000 RRULE : FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=1SU;BYMONTH=4 TZOFFSETFROM:-0500 TZOFFSETTO:-0400 TZNAME :EDT END : DAYLIGHT END : VTIMEZONE
And here is an example exploring a tzical type :
>>> from dateutil.tz import *; from datetime import * >>> tz = tzical ( ' EST5EDT.ics ' ) >>> tz.keys ( ) [ ' US - Eastern ' ] >>> est = tz.get ( ' US - Eastern ' ) >>> est < tzicalvtz ' US - Eastern '> >>> datetime.now ( est ) datetime.datetime( 2003 , 10 , 6 , 19 , 44 , 18 , 667987 , tzinfo=< tzicalvtz ' US - Eastern ' > ) >>> est == tz.get ( )
True
Let 's check the daylight ranges , as usual :
>>> datetime ( 2003 , 4 , 6 , 1 , 59 , tzinfo=est ) .tzname ( ) ' EST ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 00 , tzinfo=est ) .tzname ( ) ' EDT ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 26 , 0 , 59 , tzinfo=est ) .tzname ( ) ' EDT ' >>> datetime ( 2003 , 10 , 26 , 1 , 00 , tzinfo=est ) .tzname ( ) ' EST '
tzwin type
This type offers access to internal registry - based Windows timezones .
The constuctor prototype is :
tzwin( name )
Where name is the timezone name .
There 's a static tzwin.list ( ) method to check the available names ,
tzwin methods
tzwin.display ( )
This method returns the timezone extended name .
tzwin.list ()
This static method lists all available timezone names .
tzwin examples
>>> tz = tzwin( " E. South America Standard Time " )
tzwinlocal type
This type offers access to internal registry - based Windows timezones .
The constructor accepts no parameters , so the prototype is :
tzwinlocal ( )
tzwinlocal methods
tzwinlocal.display ( )
This method returns the timezone extended name , and returns None if one is not available .
tzwinlocal examples
>>> tz = tzwinlocal ( )
gettz ( ) function
This function is a helper that will try its best to get the right timezone for your environment , or for the given string .
The prototype is as follows :
gettz(name=None )
If given , the parameter may be a filename , a path relative to the base of the timezone information path ( the base could be /usr / share / zoneinfo , for example ) , a string timezone specification , or a timezone abbreviation .
If name is not given , and the TZ environment variable is set , it 's used instead .
If the parameter is not given , and TZ is not set , the default tzfile paths will be tried .
Then , if no timezone information is found , an internal compiled database of timezones is used .
When running on Windows , the internal registry - based Windows timezones are also considered .
Example :
>>> from dateutil.tz import * >>> gettz( ) tzfile ('/etc/localtime ' ) >>> gettz ( " America / Sao Paulo " ) tzfile ( '/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Sao_Paulo' ) >>> gettz( " EST5EDT " ) tzfile ( '/usr/share/zoneinfo/EST5EDT ' ) >>> gettz ( " EST5 " ) tzstr ( ' EST5 ' ) >>> gettz( ' BRST ') tzlocal ( ) >>> os.environ [ " TZ " ] = " America / Sao Paulo " >>> gettz( ) tzfile ('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Sao_Paulo' ) >>> os.environ [ " TZ " ] = " BRST " >>> gettz( ) tzlocal ( ) >>> gettz ( " Unavailable " ) >>>
zoneinfo
This module provides direct access to the internal compiled database of timezones .
The timezone data and the compiling tools are obtained from the following project :
gettz ( ) function
This function will try to retrieve the given timezone information from the internal compiled database , and will cache its results .
Example :
>>> from dateutil import zoneinfo >>> zoneinfo.gettz ( " Brazil / East " ) tzfile ( ' Brazil / East ' )
CategoryProject
A mural that is slowly going up on the industrial edge of Sunset Park is shaping up to be one huge Do Not Disturb sign directed at military recruiters .
Its creators ?
A group of young women — barely out of high school — who are still smarting from what they saw as repeated and unwanted come - ons from recruiters who would stop them on the street , in school or call them at home .
“ If you go to some Manhattan schools or places where the families have a higher income , you do n’t see the recruiters there , ” said Ebony Thurman , 18 , who was once approached by recruiters at the Atlantic Avenue subway station .
“ But if you ’re in Brooklyn or in lower income neighborhoods , that ’s where you really find them trying to recruit people .
They tell you that you ’ll get job skills or college money .
And if you ’re a girl they ’ll flirt with you and say there a lot of cute guys you could meet if you enlist . ”
She and her friends have been clambering up a scaffolding set up on the side of a building on 23 Street and Third Avenue , where it hugs the Gowanus Expressway , since last week .
But many of them have been together for a few summers already , painting murals as part of Voices Her ’d , a group for young women , that meets under the auspices of Groundswell Community Mural Project , which has painted many murals in Brooklyn .
Amy Sananman , Groundswell ’s director , works with them each year to select a theme , research it and then paint it .
They had started thinking about this year ’s theme in the winter , tossing about ideas a bimonthly dinners .
Given what was happening in the world , the idea of women , the military and recruiting soon became their choice .
What was unexpected was a few of the young women had been thinking of enlisting themselves .
“ I was thinking of joining because with an 80 average , I did n’t think I would get a scholarship to go to college , ” said Elizabeth Yanes , 17 , who just graduated from John Dewey High School .
“ The recruiters had a table at my high school .
Every time we had a college day , they were there . ”
As they have done with previous murals , they did research and invited speakers , including female veterans , to talk to them .
They visited shows at P.S. 1 in Queens that examined themes of power and violence .
They also delved into the uses of propaganda in previous conflicts .
Many of them learned for the first time that the No Child Left Behind Act allowed military recruiters to have access to high school students ’ contact information ( which explained those calls to their homes ) .
They also learned families could opt out from receiving those calls , information they plan on including on stickers they will print up as part of the project .
Part of what they want to point out is the connection in some neighborhoods between recruiting and career choices .
“ They say there ’s not a draft , ” said Katie Yamasaki , an art teacher who is directing the project .
“ But when they say they ca n’t afford to fund college because 40 percent of our tax dollars go to war , a lot of youths feel stuck . ”
The walls of their basement studio , where they meet at a long table , are covered with their own sketches and data for the mural , which will show women clutching pencils , brushes and diplomas declaring “ We Are Not Government Issued ” .
Smaller details include women in red gently easing parachuting soldiers back onto their feet .
At street level , there will be facts and figures about the war .
Ms. Yamasaki said you can view the design in two different ways .
While the bottom part can be filled with details for people who can walk by and stop , the top part has to be quickly and easily understood for drivers on the Expressway .
“ It has to be something bold , ” she said .
“ They might be stuck in traffic , but more likely they ’ll be moving by at 40 miles an hour . ”
The mural will be finished by mid-August .
But it has already had an impact on some of its creators – especially those who flirted with enlisting – after they spoke with female veterans .
“ What is shocking to me is how little time it took to get the girls to change their minds , ” Ms. Sananman said .
“ That blew me away .
Once they had the information , it took them 45 minutes to decide . ”
Types of Snails Snails come in two main varieties .
There are aquatic snails and land snails .
If you find yourself asking the question
What do snails eat or what do you feed a pet snail , you first have to find out what kind of snail you have .
In general it is easy to know the type of snail because of where you found it .
If you found the snail in a marshy area , along a river bank , or pond it might just be better to return the snail if you are not 100 % sure of its type .
If you know what kind of snail you have there are two ways to find out what they like to eat .
You can go the trial and error route or you can bring your snail to a local animal store to find out exactly what your snail wants to eat .
Being that you are at this site the trial and error approach might suit you better .
What do land snails eat ?
Land snails are mainly herbivorous , which means they eat plant life .
There are a few snails that are carnivores , but chances are that your snail in not .
Snails love to eat just about anything you would put in a garden salad .
My recommendation is to start with some romaine , green leaf or even ice burg lettuce .
Snails tend to like the softest and wettest part of the plant .
If you have an herb garden that produces far more herbs than you need then try picking the newest leaves off of some of your herbs to see if they like them .
Apples and carrots can also be a favorite of your pet snail .
The key to their diet is to see what grows naturally around the area where you found your snail and bring that to them .
During the winter you will have to rely heavily on the produce in your refrigerator to keep them well feed .
Remember if the snail is eating all the food you gave him or her then you need to leave more out for them .
Slightly rotten food is just fine .
They are not terribly picky as long as you give them a food they enjoy .
One last tip : During the spring and fall when your grass is the greenest make sure to cut a big handful of grass for your snail to eat .
Both land and the common garden snail love grass and most leaves .
When Yahoo announced that it would follow Sony Connect and MSN Music into dissolution by terminating its DRM - ed music store , customers of the store and media analysts were understandably irate .
But we can all take some comfort in Yahoo's vague offer to reimburse those who were unfortunate enough to have paid for PlaysForSure DRM - ed downloads from the Yahoo Music service , although details remain scarce .
" You 'll be compensated for whatever you paid for the music , " Yahoo spokeswoman Carrie Davis told InformationWeek .
" We have n't said exactly what we will do , but we will take care of our customers . "
Songs purchased from Yahoo Music will continue to play on computersafter the service goes offline on September 30th , but cannot belicensed to new computers or devices after that , meaning that they 'll eventually become unplayable .
Yahoo Music's FAQ
on the topic says subscribers to its unlimited music service will have their accounts converted to Rhapsody , but does not specify how those whopurchased songs outright will be compensated for this loss .
The company already upset MusicMatch subscribers by converting them to Yahoo Music following the company 's purchase of MusicMatch for $ 160 million , so it 'll be interesting to see how it handles this crisis .
One possibility is cash , of course , but part of the problem with that is that those files were never worth as much as people were paying for them in the first place because they were locked down by Microsoft DRM .
That leaves the idea of an exchange program that would convertpurchased music to a new format .
Yahoo Music customers would probablyprefer MP3 , and Davis saidthat 's an option .
However , doing so would appear to violate Yahoo ' sagreements with the labels .
Some sort of interoperable DRM
option ( that would include Apple 's FairPlay ) couldallow Yahoo tomake good on promises to users and labels alike .
Every time a DRM - ed music store goes under offering only lame adviceto consumers such as " burn the music to audio CDs and re-rip them , " as Sony Connect and MSN Music have done , the music industry at large loses a chance to convince us that DRM - ed music has value .
Update ( 7/31 ) : A Rhapsody spokesman confirmed to Wired.com that the Yahoo customers will receive vouchers for the tracks in the unprotected MP3 format at the Rhapsody MP3 store , despite the fact that Yahoo 's original agreements with the labels almost certainly stipulated that the tracks be DRM - protected .

We will learn about the sed delete ( d ) , read ( r ) and write ( w ) commands today to round out your sed toolbox .
The major parts I am covering should help you through 99 % of the cases where sed is your best option .
Soon we ’ll be looking at awk and other tools to continue the quest for command - line fluency .
If you have n’t already , install Cygwin and check out part 1 and part 2 .
Tutorial
One of the best ways to crank out code quickly is by using templates .
Using the Stream EDitor , you can streamline the use of templates .
Suppose we have a template HTML file that we want to reuse often .
Maybe it looks like this :
< html > < head > < title > template.html </ title > </ head > < body > < div id= " nav " > Navigation here </div > < div id= " content " > %%CONTENT % % </div > </body > </html >
Now we want to replace ” % %CONTENT % % ” with the contents of an HTML Fragment file .
The syntax is simple : ‘/ /r':
sed '/^%%CONTENT%%/r fragment.htmlf ' template.html
The above script will append the contents of fragment .
htmlf immediately after ” % %CONTENT % % ” .
So we can use the delete command to fix that :
sed -e '/^%%CONTENT%%/r fragment.htmlf ' -e '/^%%CONTENT %%/d ' template.html > whole.html
This might seem slightly useless , but the power here is in the simplicity .
Many times I ’m generating bits of Wiki code or HTML , and this has been invaluable .
OK , now for one more command : write ( w ) .
Suppose we have a CSV file that we want to split into several files depending on the value in the last cell .
We could do this with grep , or awk ( coming soon ) , but with sed we can do it with more efficiently :
# sedscript file /, [ 0 - 9 ] + $ / w numbers.csv /, [ A - Za-z ]+/w letters.csv / , [ ^A - Za-z0-9]+/w symbols.csv sed -r -f sedscript original.csv
Now numbers.csv will contain all rows that the last cell containing numbers , and so on for letters.csv and symbols.csv .
A neat application for this might be sorting your giant contacts list into different files based on some criteria .
This is a simple example , but you can probably think of a more useful scenario where you ’d want to filter and split a file .
Other Examples
# Print everything outside the < html > tag ( check DOCTYPES ) sed '/< html>/,/</html>/d' myfile.html # Convert rn ( DOS ) to UNIX n sed 's /$ //' myfile # Windows sed 's /.$//' myfile # Linux / UNIX
Conclusion
You have now learned several sed commands and patterns you can use to make editing files and some searching tasks much more efficient , and even better , scriptable so they can be automated in a process .
One cool application would be to get comments from a set of files and post them to a wiki .
It would sure make collaboration slick , right ?
Obviously , you can bookmark this stuff but you ’ll really get good at it only if you just try it out .
Keep sharing your experiences and command lists , they ’re great !

Yesterday while browsing the table of contents of the May 2008 issue of Python Magazine I came across a reference to the pyparsing module - a python module for writing recursive descent parsers using familiar python grammar .
O'Reilly 's Python DevCenter has an excellent introduction to using this module entitled Building Recursive Descent Parsers with Python .
Well worth a read .
It just so happens that I have a number of projects which are stalled because writing code to parse complexly structured data is not my strong point .
I enjoy parsing up text line by line as much as the next guy but this recursive stuff I find tedious .
The ISC DHCP configuration file is , in my opinion , a good example of parsing complexity .
It 's configuration directives can contain many optional directives , can be nested , and can be all on a single line or broken up move multiple lines .
Writing the parser using pyparsing makes this much simpler .
Here is a simple example of using pyparsing to parse a few host definitions which while simple is quite flexible .
The output looks like this :
Private firefighters ' role growing in state Government agencies increasingly contracting with companies to battle wildfires

Residents in Piedmont can have a private fire protection company try to save their homes from a wildfire , a luxury not offered to residents living blocks away in a less affluent ZIP code in Oakland .
In Ukiah , Mendocino Redwood Co. hired more than 100 firefighters from an Oregon firm and rented a water - dumping helicopter to battle 31 wildfires that threatened its 229,000 acres of timber in June while state fire crews were engaged elsewhere .
Across California , many of the bulldozers used to cut firebreaks are from private contractors , as are some of the aircraft used to drop retardant .
Hundreds of private firefighters work alongside counterparts from government agencies , cutting fire breaks , setting backfires and mopping up .
Increasingly , the job of fighting fires and protecting homes is being done not by the government , but by private companies .
" We call it the fire industrial complex , " said Timothy Ingalsbee , a former U.S. Forest Service firefighter and now executive director of Firefighters United for Safety , Ethics and Ecology , a nonprofit in Eugene , Ore. , dedicated to environmentally sound fire management .
" It 's big business , and business is booming . "
Critics say contracting out traditionally public functions - a practice that in the Iraq war has led to privately organized security details and troop support services - shifts accountability , can be more expensive and erodes people 's confidence in government .
" What 's worrying about private firefighters is that there are growing portions of the economy that are banking on , gambling on , that there are going to be more and more natural disasters , " said Naomi Klein , author of the book " The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism . "
" People are going to forget the point that 's actually involved here - solving the problems like Category 5 hurricanes and wildfires . "
Big help for government
Backers counter that private contractors beef up state resources and are invaluable during an emergency - such as the 2,093 wildfires that have ravaged California since June 20 - without requiring the government to keep more full - time firefighters and equipment at taxpayers ' expense .
" There 's a value to that , " said Deborah Miley , executive director of a private firefighting industry group , the National Wildfire Suppression Association .
" We accept the risk .
We accept the liability for the equipment .
We take on the costs of the training . "
The U.S. Forest Service spent $ 127 million on private contractors to fight California wildfires in fiscal 2007 , said John Heil , a spokesman who described contractors as " a valuable part of the team . "
Private companies were used to provide everything from aircraft to water trucks to catering and portable hand - washing stations at base camps .
Miley 's group represents companies that employ more than 10,000 firefighters .
She estimates that 40 percent of the personnel and equipment used to put out wildfires across the country comes from private contractors .
In 2005 , the insurance company AIG began offering wildfire protection services free to some customers who pay $ 10,000 in annual premiums or have homes valued at more than $ 1 million .
Enrollment in the program more than doubled in the past year to 3,200 homes , AIG spokesman Peter Tulupman said .
Two other insurers , Fireman 's Fund Insurance Co. and the Chubb Group , have started similar services .
" Wealthy people like to live in very attractive areas , and these beautiful areas are prone to natural catastrophes , " Tulupman said .
AIG offers the fire protection service in 200 upscale ZIP codes in Colorado and California , including Atherton , Woodside and the Berkeley hills .
It covers the 94611 ZIP code for Piedmont , but not the adjacent 94602 ZIP code .
" We cater to a very small , exclusive clientele , " Tulupman said .
" We 're not a mass - market insurer . "
AIG Private Client Group contracts with an outfit to send crews to clients ' homes at the beginning of the fire season to spray perimeter vegetation with a fire retardant .
If a fire approaches , a crew is dispatched to apply retardant to the house and landscaping , but it does not remain to battle the blaze , Tulupman said .
" It 's not a private firefighting service by any means , " he said .
" If a house is on fire , we 're not going to put it out .
It 's a preventative measure . "
Communication concerns
Some fire officials worry , though , that those private crews will get in firefighters ' way or be cut off in a swift - moving blaze and need rescuing .
" Communication is a huge issue for us , " said Janet Upton , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
" If you 're not communicating with the division on either side of you and the other resources on the fire , that could pose a very serious threat . "
That 's not a problem for the AIG contract crews , who check in with the incident commander before entering a fire zone , said Sam DiGiovanna , a retired Monrovia ( Los Angeles County ) fire chief who oversees them .
" If it 's too dangerous , we 'll abide by the incident commander 's rules , " DiGiovanna said .
" I 've heard of some loose - cannon - type companies that just barrel through .
We do n't do that . "
Others are concerned about the contract fire crews ' training and cost .
" Part of the growth is the conservative ideology that says private industry can do better than public agencies .
That 's purely ideology , " said Ingalsbee , the director of the fire management nonprofit .
" It was sold to the taxpayers that this would be cheaper and efficient , that you only use the crews when they 're needed .
But some of them come at pretty exorbitant rates . "
Problems in '02
He pointed to an April 2004 federal report on the 2002 Biscuit Fire in Oregon and Northern California , which burned 500,000 acres and cost more than $ 150 million to extinguish .
The report said , " Poorly trained and inexperienced contracted crews presented significant operational concerns . "
Some crew and squad bosses could not communicate in English with government supervisors , and managers had to change firefighting tactics because it was unsafe to use some of the contract crews for aggressive operations , said the report by the agency now called the Government Accountability Office .
The industry has since improved training , including an English - language evaluation for crew bosses , Miley said .
Mike Jani , president of Mendocino Redwood Co. , had only praise for contract crews he hired to defend the company 's stands of redwoods and Douglas fir after lightning strikes in late June started hundreds of blazes statewide and taxed state firefighting resources .
" Fantastic group .
I mean really , really good , " Jani said .
" This was a fire experience unlike California had ever faced before , and it necessitated us calling them .
We would always prefer to go through Cal Fire . "
Tony Leonardini , a St. Helena firefighter , praised a contract crew from Washington he encountered while fighting the Sugarloaf Fire west of Boonville , part of the Mendocino Lightning Complex of fires that broke out June 20 and burned 53,300 acres .
" They were good , " Leonardini said .
" Obviously they were trained .
They had great equipment . "
Josiah Campbell , a 24 - year - old hand crew boss for Firestorm Wildland Fire Suppression in Chico , has fought wildfires from California to Florida for the company since he finished high school .
In a fire - resistant shirt and cargo pants , both layered with ash and dirt on his 26th day on a fire line in Shasta County , Campbell looked indistinguishable from a government firefighter .
" The big difference is the paperwork .
Usually we have less , " Campbell said .
" We 're all out there doing the same job , the same piece of line . "
But insulating the wealthy from reliance on public fire protection could undercut the system as a whole , similar to disputes over funding public education and health care , Klein said .
" When ( wealthy ) people opt out of the public system and opt for private schools and private health care , they lose interest in maintaining the integrity of the public system , " the author said , " and it starts to erode . "
Jim Wills , founder of Firestorm Wildland Fire Suppression , which contracts crews with the U.S. Forest Service and is Chubb 's local contractor for home protection , said those fears are unfounded .
" We hope to be part of the solution , " Wills said .
" We 're not the enemy .
We 're here to help . "

Gangland wars have turned Dublin into the Chicago of the 21st century , a TD and chairman of a drugs task force in the Irish capital said last night .
Labour TD Joe Costello also revealed that a preliminary study by the Inner City Drugs Task Force has found that a majority of drug dealers arrested on serious offences were out on bail .
Costello made his remarks following two more gangland - related murders in north Dublin this weekend .
Gardai have launched a murder investigation following the fatal shooting of a 33 - year - old man in Finglas early yesterday .
The victim was named as Trevor Walsh , from Valley Park Road in Finglas .
He had been serving a three - year prison sentence for possession of firearms , but was let out on temporary release on Thursday .
The attack , which happened at about 12.20 am outside a house on the Kippure Park estate , was the second fatal shooting in the capital in 24 hours .
A gunman approached the victim outside a house in the estate and shot him in the neck and chest , before fleeing the scene on a bicycle .
It is understood that the killer used an automatic pistol .
Walsh was taken to Blanchardstown Hospital , but was pronounced dead at 1am .
The victim was associated with the late John Daly , a Dublin criminal who was shot dead last October .
Walsh had been a member of a gang which specialised in importing drugs and armed robberies in the city .
It is not clear whether yesterday morning 's attack was connected to the shooting of a man in Coolock , north Dublin , on Friday afternoon .
The man , named locally as 34 - year - old Anthony Foster , was killed with a shotgun as he left a top - floor apartment at Cromcastle Court .
Commenting on the latest gang - related shooting , Costello , who represents inner-city Dublin in the Dail , said there was no coherent plan to counter the rising number of killings .
' Dublin now resembles Chicago in the Roaring Twenties , when the gangsters were out of control , ' he said .
' There is no joined - up strategy to fight these gangs , either at a national or international level .
All of our drugs are imported , mostly by sea along Ireland 's coastline , yet we have no proper network with our fellow Europeans to patrol the seaboard .
We do n't have enough boats , planes or helicopters to intercept the smuggling networks , ' he said .
Over the last three years there have been more than a dozen killings in north Dublin alone related to rival drugs gangs .
Costello added that , while the Irish government talks tough in regard to Ireland 's gangland wars , the system remained loaded in the criminals ' favour .
' We have found that the overwhelming majority of people arrested on serious drug offences almost all get bail and are back on the streets .
The turf wars over who controls drug supplies in certain parts of Dublin have been fuelled by the easy availability of firearms and now explosives . '
Costello said the expertise of retired republican paramilitaries had been harnessed to arm and train the city 's criminal gangs .
McCain : " You know it just would n't be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster . "
That 's true , John .
That 's so true .
This view combines more than 400 images taken during the first several weeks after NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander arrived on an arctic plain on Mars .
Thechemical NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander found in a sample of Martian dirt , asannounced on Monday , may not be harmful to any potential life there and couldin fact be a boon to it , mission scientists said today .
" [ Thisfinding ] caught me by surprise , " said Phoenix principal investigatorPeter Smith of the University of Arizona in a Tuesday teleconference withreporters .
Afterrumors spread across the Internet last weekend that Phoenix had foundintriguing findings that werebeing withheld from the public , mission scientists addressed the media toquash what Smith called the " speculation that has become rampant on the Web . "
The Phoenix team announced Monday that one of Phoenix 's instruments had detected perchlorate , a highly oxidizing substance .
Thoughoxidizers can be harmful to life , this is n't the case for perchlorate , scientists said .
" It does not precludelife on Mars .
In fact it is a potential energy source , " said WilliamBoynton of the University of Arizona , who is a co-investigator on the Thermaland Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) , which heats up samples of the Martian dirt andanalyzes the vapors they give off to determine their composition .
On Earth , perchloratesare found in Chile 's highly arid Atacama Desert , which is often used as ananalog to the Martian surface .
Scientists had originally thought no life couldsurvive in the Atacama , but later research found organics in nitrate depositsassociated with perchlorates .
The same could hold true for Mars , the Phoenixresearch team said .
Perchloratesare also highly soluble salts and could help scientists better understand thehistory of water on Mars .
The presence of water ice at Phoenix 's landing site wasconfirmed in a TEGA analysis last week .
Theperchlorate signal was detected in Phoenix 's Microscopy , Electrochemistry andConductivity Analyzer 's ( MECA ) wetchemistry lab , which dilutes dirt samples in water brought from Earth anddetects any soluble salts they contain .
Scientistschecked to make sure the signal was real and could be reproduced .
Theperchlorate signal was also seen in a second sample analyzed by MECA .
" Wehave substantial evidence that our soil contains perchlorates , " Smithsaid .
The nextstep in confirming the findings was to see if TEGA also detected perchlorates .
The first sample delivered to TEGA released a large amount of oxygen when itwas heated to , which Boynton said some Phoenix scientists though could beindicative of perchlorate , though it could also have indicated several otherchemical species .
Scientistsdecided to look for a chlorine signal in TEGA 's next sample on Sunday .
If oneshowed up , the evidence for perchlorates " would have been rock solid . " ?
But the analysis showed no evidence of chlorine .
The teamplans to analyze another sample in TEGA taken from the same spot as the MECAsample that gave off the perchlorate signal to see if it will confirm thefinding .
( The Phoenix team had intended to wait for the TEGA results beforeannouncing the perchlorate finding . )
They arealso trying to rule out the possibility that the signal was contamination fromthe solid fuel rockets that gave Phoenix its finalpush towards Mars and contained a perchlorate fuel , though Smith said that thescenario was unlikely .
Online maps showing crime hot spots , high visibility bibs for criminals doing community punishment and Friday night youth clubs in deprived areas were proposed yesterday as part of a drive to rebuild confidence in the criminal justice system .
Louise Casey , the outspoken former head of the Government 's Respect task force , will spearhead the initiative – an appointment likely to send a shudder through the criminal justice system .
Ms Casey once mocked the Government 's anti-binge drinking campaign by saying that some ministers might perform better if they turned up drunk .
She warned yesterday that people did not believe official figures showing crime was falling and thought the system favoured offenders .
She said : " There was a strong view during the review that they would no longer intervene if they saw a crime taking place , for fear that they would either be attacked by the perpetrators or arrested themselves . "

Ms Casey set out initiatives to re-engage the public , including forcing people on community sentences to wear bibs .
However , Harry Fletcher , the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers , said that bibs would humiliate rather than rehabilitate offenders .
1. Anonymous evidence Elderly and disabled crime victims – as well as people at risk of reprisals – should be allowed to give evidence in court from behind screens .
Ministers are sympathetic to the idea , which already happens routinely in cases involving sex offences and gangs .
Controversy : *
2. Rebrand community service Community sentences should be renamed " community payback " to emphase that not jailing people is still a punishment .
Could happen , but would the public notice ?
Controversy : *
3 . Make offenders visible Offenders should wear high - visibility orange bibs to make community payback schemes " more visible " to the general public and more " demanding " on criminals .
Ministers support the idea in principle , but critics say it would humiliate offenders undergoing rehabilitation .
Controversy : *****
4. Internet crime maps
Online maps with crimes plotted on them to be published every month so people can see how dangerous their area is and how well the police are doing .
Gordon Brown has backed the move in principle , but areas could be stigmatised if the maps are street - by - street .

5 . More power for CSOs Police community support officers should be able to detain people for up to 30 minutes and hand out fixed - penalty notices for disorder .
The idea is strongly opposed by the police and the last thing the Home Office wants is another run-in with them .

Funding for youth services is already being boosted with poorer communities targeted .
But should high - crime areas be rewarded ?

Monthly leaflets
All homes should receive monthly leaflets telling them what action against crime is being taken in their area as well as contact numbers for local police .
The Home Office backs closer links between the police and public , but officers see it as more bureaucracy .

11 . Cash for high - crime areas The Government should give cash direct to communities hit by crime .
This already happens to a certain extent – the money central government gives to local authorities depends on how well off they are .

Already happens in many courts and looks a certainty .

A close up of the ants in their foxholes .

A crafty ant species builds a trap dotted with foxholes for surprise attacks
Such incredible cooperation among ants has never before been described by scientists .
The ants , called Allomerus decemarticulatus , live in trees in the Amazon .
Here 's how it works :
An insect lands on the trap ,
The ambush is well orchestrated , as University of Toulouse researcher Jerome
" Allomerus workers hide in the galleries with their heads just under the holes ,
The ants then slide the prey across the gallery , again moving in and out of
The key to building the trap is a fungus that the ants cultivate .
The fungus
" It is something manufactured by the ants from elements coming from the plant and the environment , " he said in an email interview .
" Contrary to social spiders which are also collectively building a trap ( their web ) from the silk they produce , the trap of Allomerus is made from external products . "
" To our knowledge , the collective creation of a trap as a predatory strategy

“ With each new project to tap water somewhere else , demand for water only increases , and at an ever greater cost to China ’s environment and economy , ” says the group ’s report given to reporters on Thursday .
“ Whether diverting surface water or digging ever - deeper for groundwater , the underlying solution is like trying to quench thirst by drinking poison . ”
The Beijing Games have been beset by worries that air pollution will impair athletes .
Yet Probe International ’s study suggests the Games ’ thirst for cheap and plentiful water will also leave an environmental burden .
Strained underground sources supply over two thirds of Beijing municipality ’s needs , and since 2004 the city has also begun drawing on “ karst ” groundwater supplies 1 km ( 0.62 miles ) or deeper below the surface .
These deep underground sources , stored in porous rock , were originally set aside for use only in times of war and emergency , the report says .
Beijing ’s thirst for water for the Games has also piled pressure on Hebei , the largely rural province next to the capital that supplies much of its water .
To ensure there was no risk of Beijing running short for the Games , officials ordered a 309 - km ( 192 - mile ) northern section of the larger South - North Water Transfer Project first be completed to pump more water , if needed , from Hebei .
Hebei is already one of the country ’s most water - short provinces after a decade - long drought , but nonetheless supplies Beijing with about 80 percent of its water .
A visit there this week showed the canal project has been completed , but only barely , and many farmers have been left weighing the costs of giving up land , water and crops for the sake of presenting a verdant Olympic city .
“ We ’ve been lucky with the rains this year , but we still do n’t have enough water , ” said Liu Xiuge , a middle - aged farmer in Gaochang Village , who said farmers had planted corn , rather than wheat , because not enough water was available .
Other villagers there said wells were running low because engineers had pumped away groundwater to make way for the canal , about 100 meters across , now cutting through the fields .
“ If you dig a well now , you hit rock before there ’s any water .
It was never like that before , ” said Wang Guiju , a 55 - year - old grandmother .
“ We ’ve had good fortune with the rain this year .
But what happens next year when we have another drought ?
I do n’t think they ’ll be rushing to help us . ”
Such complaints reflect a much broader water crisis facing northern China and the national capital , where industrialization and population growth have overwhelmed conservation concerns , says the Probe International report , written by Chinese experts who requested anonymity .
“ Long distance diversion is extraordinarily expensive and environmentally damaging , ” says the report , which calls for reforms to water pricing and economic policy so consumers are encouraged to save water .
Keep the Cheap Wine Flowing
I blogged last week about blind wine tastings — my own casual experiments as well as some more serious academic ones .
The bottom line is that in blind wine tastings , there is a zero or even slightly negative correlation between the ratings of regular people and the price of the wine they are drinking ; for experts the relationship between rating and price is positive .
I ’ve learned a few more things from blog readers about cheap wine over the last few days .
Robin Goldstein has an excellent book , The Wine Trials , which describes the blind wine tastings and which cheap wines people liked .
The beauty of this book is that you can bring an $ 8 bottle of wine to a party and explain that it tastes better than the $ 28 bottle you would have bought .
If the host of the party is an economist , you can tape a $ 10 bill to the bottle for an even split of the joint surplus .
Not until I read Goldstein ’s book did I realize just how weak the correlation was in blind tastings between expert evaluations and price in experimental settings .
Yet , somehow Wine Spectator , which claims to do tastings blind ( at least with respect to who the producer is ) , has an extremely strong positive correlation between prices and ratings .
Hmmm … seems a bit suspicious .
It turns out that the story with respect to cheap wine is even more true for champagne .
I ’ve never tasted a $ 12 bottle of champagne that I did n’t enjoy immensely .
It turns out I am not alone .
In blind tests , Domaine Ste. Michelle Cuvee Brut , a $ 12 sparkling wine from Washington , is preferred nearly two to one to $ 150 Dom Perignon if you strip away the labels .
Dan Ariely ( author of Predictably Irrational ) and his co-authors have an interesting experiment with beer and balsamic vinegar .
If you tell people ahead of time there will be vinegar in their beer , they wo n’t like the taste .
If you do n’t tell them and do a blind tasting , they do like the taste .
If you let them form their opinions and then tell them there was vinegar in the beer , most continue to say it tasted good .
I am generally skeptical of neuro - economics , but here is one such study which finds that the firing of neurons in the brain is affected by how much the subject thinks the wine he / she is being served cost .
The bottom line seems to be that if you think a wine is more expensive , you really do enjoy it more .
Finally , a wonderful tale published in The New Yorker a year ago , written by Patrick Radden Keefe , profiled an ambitious conman who fooled the world ’s leading wine experts for more than a decade before his nefarious plot unraveled .
I ca n’t remember the last time I read an article this long from beginning to end in one sitting .

The Pirate Bay , often attacked by the Swedish establishment , but never beaten .
However , their faith in the judicial system has plummeted after prosecutors have stated that Jim Keyzer , a police official investigating the Pirate Bay , has done no wrong by working for Warner at the same time .
You probably know the story by now .
Jim Keyzer , a Police IT forensics specialist who was leading the Pirate Bay investigation , let it slip he was working for Warner on a social networking site .
A strange move to say the least .
Soon after the news got out it became clear that Keyzer had started working for the movie studio before the Pirate Bay investigation was closed .
Warner denied this initially , and stated that the investigator was not employed or paid by the movie studio while he was still working on the case .
However , after The Pirate Bay crew filed criminal complaints for bribery of a police officer , Warner suddenly admitted he was working for them .
Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde was convinced that they had a strong case , as he said : “ He [ Keyzer ] confirmed that he is an employee there [ Warner Bros ’ ] and we ca n’t see it in any other way than this being the reward for work well done from the new employer of the police , the entertainment industry ”
However , in a letter received today by Peter Sunde , Kay Engfeldt of the prosecutors department states that there will be no investigation into Jim Keyzer .
“ [ there is ] no reason to believe that a crime has been committed by anyone employed by the police . ”
Of course , until you investigate , you wo n’t find any evidence .
That ’s why in general allegations are investigated first , especially when there is evidence to back up the claim .
Sunde told TorrentFreak that they would be filing an appeal on Monday .
In the meantime , they ’re working on a datacenter move for their secondary sites , whichÂ hadÂ left services like Bayimg unavailable for a time .
Following closely on news that products in their pipeline can decrease blood glucose and may have tumor suppressor potential , Sirtris Pharmaceuticals ( SIRT ) has been snapped up by GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) .
Sirtris has focused on the commercial development of clinically useful sirtuin activators , which are predicted to be useful as anti-diabetic drugs .
Data from academic labs have suggested they could be of even wider use , e.g. , in increasing exercise tolerance or treating inflammatory disease .
Underneath it all , of course , is the knowledge that the the sirtuins were initially identified as longevity assurance genes ; the subtext of all discussions of sirtuin activators is that they may mediate their beneficial effects by slowing aspects of the aging process itself .
The acquisition of an small company at a large premium ( the offer was more than 80 % higher than Sirtris ’ market cap ) by a pharmaceutical giant is one of the first demonstrations that the drug industry is taking seriously the idea that there ’s money to be made in treating aging per se rather than all of the associated conditions separately ( link ) :
“ Through the acquisition of Sirtris , GlaxoSmithKline will significantly enhance its metabolic , neurology , immunology and inflammation research efforts by establishing a presence in the field of sirtuins , a recently discovered class of enzymes that are believed to be involved in the aging process , ” the companies said in a joint release .
Then again , even in the best case , those who take sirtuin activators will get age - related diseases eventually anyway , so the question of whether to treat aging or age - related disease is n’t really an either / or choice .
I am currently wondering whether recent findings that indiscriminate activation of SIRT1 might lead to cancer ( e.g. , when DBC1 is deleted ) will temper the enthusiasm for these compounds .

Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr released a statement today criticizing the bungled police raid of the mayor ’s home in Berwyn Heights , Maryland .
He said that no knock raids are unconstitutional , and that law enforcement has become arrogant and less accountable .
The case Barr is referring to involves a bungled raid on Mayor Cheye Calvo ‘s home that resulted in the mayor and his mother in law being hand cuffed and his two dogs killed .
The mayor had been victimized by drug smugglers , but law enforcement never bothered to take the time to actually investigate and gather the facts .
“ Absent exigent circumstances , not present here , so - called no - knock raids are an affront to the Constitution .
So is a shoot first , ask questions later philosophy by the police .
Yet the Prince George ’s police have done this before — last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog .
All Americans are at risk when the police behave this way .
Just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in , ” Barr said .
Advertisements
His bigger point is that law enforcement needs to be able to do their job while protecting people ’s liberties , “ But there is an even larger point .
Law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs .
Most people are aware of well - publicized examples like Waco and Ruby Ridge , but similar abuses are common across the country , though they usually receive little or no public notice .
We all want police to do their jobs well , but part of doing their job well is respecting the people ’s constitutional liberties . ”
Barr knows what he is talking about .
Before serving in the House of Representatives , he was a U.S. attorney , and before that he worked at the CIA .
For lack of a better term , I think that some law enforcement agencies have gotten lazy .
We see people getting shot or tasered too often without cause , but seems like if some law enforcement officers do n’t want to deal with a situation , they skip right to using force .
This attitude comes from the top down .
It can be traced to the example set by the Bush administration after 9/11 .
This anything goes attitude needs to stop which is another reason why the neo-cons have to go .

FISA court rejects ACLU request for transparency RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 29 , 2008
Print This Email This A court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act denied an ACLU motion Thursday that would have increased public scrutiny of how the Bush administration 's new spying law is reviewed , according to a statement released Friday .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed the motion 10 hours after President Bush signed the FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) into law July 10 , requesting that any further proceedings that might question the law 's constitutionality be revealed to the public , according to an ACLU press release .
The organization also asked to participate in the hearings and submit briefs to court , which was denied as well .
" It 's disappointing that the intelligence court intends to adjudicate these important legal issues in complete secrecy , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The new surveillance law affects all of us because it allows the executive branch virtually unfettered access to the international telephone and email communications of U.S. citizens and residents . "
President Bush 's administration urged the FISA court to reject the group 's request in late July .
The Justice Department issued a plea to the court arguing that no third party has any right to participate in the court proceedings and that it is " precluded from doing so here by statute , court rule , and mandated security measures . "
Although the FISA court has allowed the ACLU access to previous rulings , it has refused it before as well .
The court withheld decisions from the civil liberties group regarding the NSA surveillance program on the grounds that no classified information could be released to them , and without that information , the group would not be able to " present any meaningful argument on the questions posed . "
A recent post on the blog Reason : Free Minds and Free Markets details how the FISA act creates " fertile ground " for those looking for a convenient excuse for surveillance .

Parametric Higher - Order Abstract Syntax for Mechanized Semantics
We present parametric higher - order abstract syntax ( PHOAS ) , a new approach to formalizing the syntax of programming languages in computer proof assistants based on type theory .
Like higher - order abstract syntax ( HOAS ) , PHOAS uses the meta language 's binding constructs to represent the object language 's binding constructs .
Unlike HOAS , PHOAS types are definable in general - purpose type theories that support traditional functional programming , like Coq 's Calculus of Inductive Constructions .
We walk through how Coq can be used to develop certified , executable program transformations over several statically - typed functional programming languages formalized with PHOAS ; that is , each transformation has a machine - checked proof of type preservation and semantic preservation .
Our examples include CPS translation and closure conversion for simply - typed lambda calculus , CPS translation for System F , and translation from a language with ML - style pattern matching to a simpler language with no variable - arity binding constructs .
By avoiding the syntactic hassle associated with first - order representation techniques , we achieve a very high degree of proof automation .
I was aware of this some months ago now , but held back commenting on it at Adam 's request until it had been accepted for publication , which it now apparently has .
This is ( one element of ) Adam 's continued work on LambdaTamer , his Coq - based environment for building certified compilers .
There is a new version of LambdaTamer using this parametric higher - order abstract syntax approach .
The new version also works in current and future versions of Coq , unlike the previous version .
Finally , Adam is apparently working on a paper regarding " type- theoretic denotational semantics for higher order , impure object languages " and is post - docing with Greg Morrisett .
The relationship between Adam 's work and the YNot project is a bit unclear to me ; perhaps either Adam or Greg could help clarify that .
Update : Whoops .
I got ahead of myself and neglected to notice that the paper is not actually yet available , although the new version of LambdaTamer is .
So at the moment , this story is merely to note that the paper exists and to provide a link to the new LambdaTamer .
My apologies to Adam and the LtU readership .
2nd Update :
The paper is now available at the link , in either PostScript or PDF form .

Even with a wealth of life experiences , there are still a few things that can catch long - time HEAT fan Sarah Wiseman by surprise .
One of those things happened on Wednesday when HEAT center Alonzo Mourning made a surprise visit to the Miami Jewish Home and Hospital at Douglas Gardens to attend her 102nd birthday celebration .
Wiseman , whose birthday is on Saturday , is believed to be the oldest living HEAT fan .
During the HEATs inaugural season in 1988 , Wiseman was 81 - years young .
Since the teams first - ever game , she has rarely missed a HEAT game on TV .
Wiseman said that meeting the seven - time NBA All - Star was totally unexpected and an opportunity of a lifetime .
 I didnt think ( the party ) would be that elaborate ,  she said . 
I thought I would shake hands with the well - wishers and that would be it .
Oh , yes ( I will remember this forever ) . 
Members of the HEAT Entertainment Team , including Burnie , the HEAT Dancers , and Inferno from the Xtreme Team were also in attendance to provide entertainment .
Among the gifts presented by Mourning was a No. 33 HEAT jersey with the birthday girls last name stitched on the back .
He also led in the singing of  Happy Birthday . 
 You can look at her as the leader of the fan base that we have ,  said Mourning .
 It s truly an honor to be here to celebrate her 102nd birthday .
God knows , I hope I live that long and see all the ups and downs of the HEAT .
Im happy to be a part of the organization to experience these types of moments .
This is what its all about . 
Mourning also invited her to sit front row at an upcoming HEAT home game .
 If shes supported us this long , I think she deserves a front - row seat to a game ,  he said .
The two - time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was also impressed by the soon - to - be 102 - year olds youthful glow .
 Shes alert , very aware of her surroundings ,  he said .
 It s amazing .
She looks great .
I told her she doesnt look a day over 50 . 
So what is Wisemans secret to longevity ?
 Clean living ,  she said .

John McCain is even worse than you think .

While liberals do not typically accept government pronouncements on many issues , they seem to routinely accept at face value the FDA 's or USDA 's ascription of causes for diseases .
I will be writing more on this topic , because the government ( on behalf of corporate interests ) is manipulating the public ( especially educated urban people who trust science almost implicitly ) with " scientific " warnings about food - borne diseases , just exactly as the government manipulates the right through fear of terrorists .
In both cases , the government uses fear to whip up demand for actions which are often unconstitutional and give government more control over the population and give corporations massive hegemony over its small competitors .
It should be noted that the raw milk " issue " is not about the safety of milk at all , for any safety concern with raw milk can be resolved in 5 minutes by slight heating , whereas as the cancer risks with rBGH are enormous and cannot be eliminated .
In fact they are increased by heating .
Raw milk is being targeted as a danger - despite humans around the world depending on it for millennia - not because of any actual health threat but because it offers dairy farmers the ability to be entirely independent of the corporate food system .
The threat of raw milk is not disease ( in fact , it is healthier than pasteurized milk ) but the challenge it represents to corporate control over food .
NATO instructor taken hostage with Georgians amid reports of U.S. military commanding thousands of mercs in proxy war

Monday , August 11 , 2008
An American mercenary has been captured by Russian forces along with a number of Georgian soldiers according to a report from the Russian news website Izvestia , providing more evidence that the U.S. and NATO are covertly supporting the Georgian army in a proxy war with Russia .
According to the report , the mercenary is an African - American who is a NATO instructor and an ordinance specialist .
He has now been transferred to the Russian base of Vladikavkaz .
The story also backs up previous reports of dead black Americans having been found in Tskhinvali , the capital city of South Ossetia .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
U.S. soldiers recently conducted training programs where they instructed Georgian soldiers how to deal with unexploded ordinance as part of the Georgia Train and Equip Program .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Another report from the Russia daily Kommersant states that thousands of mercenaries from numerous different countries are fighting on the Georgian side and are being “ commanded by the U.S. military instructors . ”
“ The U.S. military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting , the source specified .
According to intelligence data , there are roughly 1,000 military instructors of the United States in Georgia , ” states the report .
“ Task force of Russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries .
Some of mercenaries have been captured , and investigators are working with them , the source said . ”
In a related development , Russia FSB has detained 10 Georgian intelligence service officers who were allegedly preparing terrorist attacks inside Russia .
“ We have detained 10 agents of the Georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks , including on Russian territory , ” Alexander Bortnikov said at a meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
Russia has today launched new forays into Georgia itself even after Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili signed a cease - fire pledge .
Russia claims that Georgia has not honored the cease - fire and continues to attack Russian positions .

Skeptoid Podcast # 116
August 26 , 2008
Podcast transcript | Subscribe
Listen :
https://skeptoid.com/audio/skeptoid-4116.mp3
When I first started the Skeptoid podcast , it was anonymous .
I did n't give my name at all in the first 5 or 10 episodes .
Why ?
Because I was afraid of offending my friends and family , afraid of becoming known as a hateful , closed - minded skeptic .
I knew that skeptical outreach is an important educational task and needs to be done , but at the same time , I had to live with people .
I have friends , neighbors , coworkers , and acquaintances .
I 'd long ago learned to keep my mouth shut when someone started praising the merits of some new paranormal thing .
I reasoned that the best way to be a skeptic and a member of society was to broadcast my critical thinking analyses as far and wide as I could with the podcast , while shielding myself inside a safe little bubble of personal anonymity .
As you probably know , that did n't remain the case .
My friends and family found out about Skeptoid almost immediately , but since they 're great people I did n't really catch much flak for it , and they pretty much knew that I was skeptical anyway .
I decided at that point that if I was going to do it at all , I was going to do it all the way .
So I re-recorded all the early episodes with my name on them , and put my full name and picture and bio on the website .
In for a penny , in for a pound ; so the saying goes .
This does n't mean that I go out looking for fights .
I rarely go out of my way to proactively challenge a friend 's belief when I happen to overhear them talking about something paranormal or pseudoscientific , and then only when it 's appropriate to do so .
Does it irk me when I hear them talking about how scary the ghosts were in last night 's episode of Ghost Hunters , or how they 're treating their back pain with reiki ?
Absolutely it does .
And now , since they know that I'm " that skeptical guy " , frequently they 'll come up to me with something .
More often than not , they saw on Action News last night that you can run your car on water , or that an old man somewhere is a proven psychic healer , or that an engineer has gone on record saying the Twin Towers were a controlled implosion .
Usually they 're snickering because they often believe that now they 've got me , that now their evidence is irrefutable and they 're about to go one - up on the skeptic .
They ask me what I think .
And I 'm not the only one who gets this .
I frequently hear from listeners who find themselves in similar situations .
Here 's one email I got :
In my experience , I always come off as a " know - it - all jerk " because in conversations , I have ethical issues with just letting them go on in life with misinformation , especially as a scientist .
Maybe the real lesson is just " do n't talk science with them .
let them believe what they want to believe . "
I just feel so terrible knowing that they 're going to go on , and maybe make a poor decision based upon the assumption that what they know is true .
And here 's another :
Starting an argument , although productive , is not instrumental in making and keeping friendships , since a lot of people are very happy with their delusions and only become annoyed with someone when their false knowledge is pointed out .
How does one go about informing a true believer without alienating them ?
So there we have it .
The problem :
How to be a skeptic , and talk with your friends and coworkers when the subject comes up , without turning people off ?
Here is the solution .
Focus on where you agree , never on where you disagree .
Start by finding common ground .
No matter who you 're talking to , they have some level of skepticism about something .
Ask them , " Is n't there some myth you 've heard that you do n't necessarily believe ? "
They 'll answer " Well sure , Bigfoot , space aliens , " whatever .
Tell them " I 'm skeptical of Bigfoot for the exact same reasons you are .
Tell me why you do n't believe in Bigfoot ? "
And now you 've got your friend telling you the very reasons you 're skeptical of the new claim .
The evidence is of poor quality , it 's too improbable , whatever it is .
Help your friend along .
Point out more reasons to be skeptical of Bigfoot .
Be familiar with our checklist of 15 warning signs to help you spot pseudoscience from Skeptoid episode 37 .
And then , once you have a good list , apply that same reasoning to the new claim .
" We agree that part of the reason Bigfoot is suspect is that we have low quality evidence coming from people with dubious credentials .
We can also find those same problems with the claim that you can run your car on water .
Also , we agree that one reason Bigfoot is improbable is that if it was real , we'd have known about it by now — people have been living in Bigfoot habitat for hundreds of years .
We can say that same thing about running your car on water — science has known all about oxyhydrogen and electrolysis for hundreds of years and exploited it many different ways .
It would n't have to wait for some guy on the Internet to claim to know something that science does n't . "
Feelings are hurt not so much when there is disagreement , but when someone is summarily proclaimed to be wrong .
This does n't just mean telling your friend that he 's wrong , it includes telling your friend that the TV Action News is wrong .
It 's your friend 's source , he found it convincing ; and when you simply declare it to be wrong without having seen it , you come off as petty and dismissive .
Avoid negative language .
Avoid saying that anyone is wrong .
" That announcement you heard alerts us to the possibility that this new breakthrough is true , just as the recent Bigfoot news story alerted us that a Bigfoot body might have been found .
But science does n't determine the validity of a theory based on whether or not its proponents have sent out a single press release ; an announcement that would be more interesting would be that the test protocols have been published and the experiment is being successfully replicated all over the world . "
Find the common ground .
" What are you skeptical of ?
Well , I 'm probably skeptical of it for the exact same reason you are . "
You can also accept your friend 's claim as a great first step , and tell him what else you 'd need to see to be convinced .
When something 's real , it 's real ; it can be defined , measured , quantified , and replicated by other researchers .
When something 's only published on the fringe , or reported from only a single source , that does n't make it wrong yet ; but it does mean that it has not yet been replicated by objective scientists following the same protocols .
Just because you can have this conversation in a positive and non-adversarial way does n't mean you always have to have the conversation .
I still find it best to simply keep my mouth shut a lot of the time .
A neighbor knocked on my door with their acupuncturist 's business card when I was suffering from some pain after one of my volleyball surgeries .
That 's a kindness , and I thanked them and left it at that .
This way the neighbor remains my friend and the door is always open to have the conversation at a more appropriate time .
Spreading critical thinking by engaging in conversation with your acquaintances should be a way to build bridges , not to expose rifts .
If you take one thing away from this podcast , it should be that point .
Concentrate on where you agree .
I 've found that this has converted people who used to come to me as an adversary to challenge me with new claims into friends who seek out my opinion on stories that sound fishy to them .
The important first step is to allow youself to become known as a skeptic .
Wear the T - shirts and have the books sitting on your desk at the office .
When people know that you 're the skeptic , they 'll come to you when they want to challenge you .
And when they come to you , you 're not the jerk .
Put yourself out there as a skeptic , and wait for the business to come to your door .
When it does , handle it positively and show people that they 're skeptics too , they just did n't realize it .
When you can help someone to understand that they are already themselves a skeptic of something — Bigfoot , aliens , UFOs , celebrity psychics , whatever — your job is half done .
It 's like judo , use your opponent 's strength against him .
Help him redirect his own intelligence and existing skepticism towards the subjects where he has not yet thought critically .
In this way , you can be a skeptic and still have friends — and , chances are , you 'll even have new skeptical friends .

Hi !
I ’m Frank - a software developer in Seattle specializing in mobile apps that do nerdy things .
My blog is a collection of technical articles , presentations , and app and library announcements .
Azure Resource Organization Cheat Sheet
It ’s taken me some time , but I think I finally have a handle on how all the various Azure resources are organized and how exactly I ’m paying for things .
I summarized what I know into a handy little cheat sheet that I hope will help you if you ’re as confused as I was .
Appstat - App Sales and Analytics Menu TL;DR
I have written an app , Appstat , that I think every Apple app developer will want .
It is a macOS status menu app that displays all your apps that are for sale on the App Store plus a whole bunch of data about them including proceeds , sales , ratings , and uploaded builds .
. NET Vector Performance TL;DR
I wanted to know what the fastest vector types were on .
NET .
Turns out , performance varies wildly across platforms .
System .
Numerics .
Vector4 and friends give good performance overall , especially for .NET
Core apps , while homemade vector types do not get auto-vectorized .
Avoid Vector < T> like the plague .
Oh , and iPhone 11s are stupid fast .
Containing Null with C# 8 Nullable References C# 8 ’s nullable reference types are designed to help rid your apps of the dreaded NullReferenceException .
This article walks you through the common errors that you will encounter while updating your app and offers a few of my opinions on how to fix them .
It ’s a long and windy road to update to nullable references , but you will come out at the end more confident in your code and with fewer bugs .
Oops , I Wrote a C++ Compiler TL;DR
I wrote a .NET library that can compile C/C++ code into a byte code that it can also interpret .
It is used in my app iCircuit to simulate Arduinos .
You can use it yourself with the nuget package CLanguage .
C# Code Prediction with a Neural Network TL;DR I used Python to create a neural network that implements an F# function to predict C# code .
The network was compiled to a CoreML model and runs on iOS to be used in my app Continuous to provide keyboard suggestions .
Introducing fuget.org
Have you ever wondered what exactly is in a nuget to see if it ’s right for you ?
You read the description , you like the name , but , if you ’re like me , you probably ended up in GitHub reading the source code to decide if you want to use the library .
Xamarin .
Forms on the Web TLDR : I implemented a web backend for Xamarin .
Forms so that it can run in any browser .
It achieves this without javascript recompilation by turning the browser into a dumb terminal fully under the control of the server ( through web sockets using a library I call Ooui ) .
This crazy model turns out to have a lot of advantages .
Try it here !
How I Made Zoom and Enhance - Seattle Mobile .NET
Presentation I trained a neural network to perform “ zoom and enhance ” of faces .
It is able to scale faces 16 x to make them recognizable .
Here ’s how I did it .
Fashionable REPL Prompts
I was writing a new language the other day and I thought , “ this puppy needs a REPL ” !
Live Coding with Xamarin iOS TL;DR
I wrote a new Xamarin Studio add - in that dramatically reduces the number of Build and Run cycles you need to perform while developing an app .
Please follow the instructions to install Continuous and let me know what you think !
My Complaints with Nuget 3 Warning
This article is garbage .
Do n’t read it .
Coding in Your Head I ’m terrible at coding interviews - some busy bee dusts off a tricky algorithm that they studied in college and asks you to ( 1 ) originate it from a poorly stated problem and ( 2 ) live code it in front of them .
Many Levels of App Store Rejection Submitting apps to the App Store is filled with many wonderful opportunities to be rejected .
Let ’s count them !
Functional GUIs with F# - .NET FRINGE Presentation
How do you write a GUI app in a functional programming language that prefers immutability ?
From Visual Basic on we have been taught how to compose interactive UIs using events and mutable properties .
Is there any other way ?
The answer is , yes , indeed there is .
Not only can you build UIs using functional concepts , but I will argue that the architecture of such an app is more modular and more robust than the standard architecture resulting from objects sending messages to each other .
This talk is an introduction to the fringe world of functional programming using F# and will have information useful to both beginners and practitioners .
Excited for FRINGE
It ’s been too long since we ’ve had an open source .NET conference .
Since monospace / monkeyspace imploded , we ’ve been left with just Xamarin ’s Evolve .
And while I love Xamarin , and Evolve is glorious , it ’s just not the same thing as the free - wheeling brain fest of an OS conference .
Only at an open source conference do I get to see free thinkers unabashedly demo’ing their latest library or idea without having to bend it to a corporate initiative .
It ’s liberating and exciting !
Introducing NGraphics
Many moons ago I created a cross platform library for rendering vector graphics called CrossGraphics .
It was good .
It supported lots of platforms and was fast .
Very fast in fact because it was designed for my app iCircuit which was already a CPU hog and had to run on 2010 era mobile hardware .
To be fast , I played loosey goosey with cross platform accuracy ( they mostly rendered the same ) and features ( who needs gradients ? ) .
Open Source CLRs - Seattle Mobile .NET
Presentation
This presentation walks through the history of open source CLRs .
From Rotor , to Mono , to .NET
Core we ’ve had our share of implementations and this presentation tries to organize all of that .
Building and Running .
NET 's CoreCLR on OS X
What you heard is true , Microsoft has open sourced the CLR and it runs on more than just Windows .
They did n’t just dump some ZIP file on an FTP ; no , we have another fully functioning , easy to compile , and easy to contribute to CLR hosted on everyone ’s favorite file share .
Microsoft has even gone so far as to setup a two way mirror with GitHub so that their internal systems stay in sync with what we see .
Color me impressed .
Stop Crashing !
TL;DR
I wrote a script that lists functions in your Xamarin app that could cause it to crash .
StopCrashing.fsx on github .
Programming Augmented Reality - Xamarin Evolve Presentation
I present the techniques used to build an AR app on iOS before ARKit was available .
Mocast
For the past couple months , I have been working on a top secret project that aims to redefine the way work will get done , address key industry mobility challenges and spark true mobile - led business change .
I ’m just kidding , it ’s a podcast player !
My Xamarin Studio F# Wishlist
I am writing a large iOS and OS X app in F # and am totally digging the honeymoon phase .
Not only is F# a crazy powerful language , but it has a great interactive code executer built right into the IDE .
In all , it ’s a wonderful development experience .
Mocast Postmortem - Seattle Mobile .NET
Presentation
After writing an app , I like to look back at what went right and what went wrong .
This is the postmortem I wrote for Mocast where in I realize that observable objects are good but multi- threaded observable collections are not .
Automated UI Testing with Cucumber and Calabash
There comes a day in every developer ’s life when they have to admit that they just are n’t good testers .
We do n’t think to hit buttons in strange combinations , we test features in isolation , we do n’t re-test for regressions , and we simply do n’t do it often enough .
Microsoft's New Systems Language
As a programming language nerd I had mixed feelings when Jon Galloway tweeted about Microsoft ’s new programming language .
Audio Tales - Something a Little Different
One morning , I walked into a random presentation at WWDC .
I did n’t know what it was about , but I was on autopilot and determined not to miss one session .
It turned out to be Accessibility - not something I tend to think about as evidenced by my apps - but what else is a conference for but to break your habits ?
Calca 1.2 - Experiments in Text Editing
Let ’s face it , text editing text on iOS is n’t the most enjoyable exercise .
Text input is fine and dandy , I love flinging my thumbs or resting the iPad on my lap .
But editing , no sir .
That just sucks .
Buttons Considered Harmful
I realized that my favorite apps on the iPhone are the ones that minimize the number of buttons in their UI .
Async Application Patterns in C# - MonkeySpace Presentation I present a variety of ideas on how the new async support in C# can be used to build better apps .
I try to go beyond “ waiting for IO ” and present crazier things such as interactive help and automatic Console App to Web App conversion .
Calca OS X Now Available & Code Reuse Calca is my latest app - a text editor and computer algebra system happily married together .
The reaction to Calca has been overwhelmingly positive .
I am very excited that people are finding it useful .
Make sure to leave reviews and tell your friends . :-)
Calca - the text editor for engineers I am very pleased to announce the availability of Calca , my newest iOS app ( and soon OS X app ) .
Asynchronous Talk Proposal for MonkeySpace 2013
Here is the abstract of a talk I hope to give at MonkeySpace in July - submitted a mere one week after the deadline .
Let ’s hope the organizers like the idea !
Easy Layout - a DSL for NSLayoutConstraint Layout has changed in iOS 6 .
We no longer are supposed to calculate RectangleF s and set springs and struts ( Autoresizing Mask ) , we are to use this very advanced constraint solving system .
I wrote a library to make writing constraint - based UIs easier .
Await in the Land of iOS - Scripting Users TL;DR
I show how to use the await keyword in C# to build an interactive help system .
i Circuit Code Reuse , Part Cinq
I have toiled away with the new Windows 8 OS , the new Visual Studio 2012 , and the new Office 13/365 to present you , dear reader , with this fine set of charts :
Mobile Network Performance while Touring Seattle I recently journeyed around Seattle to get a sense of the impact motion has on the network performance of mobile applications .
Programmatic Panning and Zooming with a UIScrollView
Let ’s say you have a zoomable and scrollable UIScrollView all setup in your app .
Great !
Good job .
But how do you programmatically zoom in on something particular ?
( For example , you may want to pan and zoom into an object that was double tapped . )
Speakers I can't wait to see at Lang .
NEXT 2012
The speaker list for Lang. NEXT 2012 has been released , and I found myself trying to decide which speakers to go see .
There are a lot of fine choices so I thought I had better get organized !
A Two - year - old Bug Found by Microsoft I submitted the Windows Phone 7 version of iCircuit to Microsoft a few days ago and was shocked ( shocked ! ) that it failed certification by their testers .
i Circuit Code Reuse Part Trois
I have recently finished porting iCircuit to Microsoft Windows Phone 7 ( WP7 ) and wanted to see how I performed on the code reuse front .
3 Mobile App Dev Problems - Monospace Presentation
This is my first public presentation !
I try to sum up my experience being an iOS app developer using Xamarin and offer solutions to common problems I continually run into .
My Great Wumpus Hunt
There is a bug in iCircuit that is tarting to feel like my white whale , my wumpus .
I know all about the bug : I know why it ’s happening , I know all its symptoms , and I know at least one way to squish it .
INotifyCollectionChanged for cleaner more reusable code
My last post briefly described the work I did to port iCircuit to Windows Phone 7 .
In it , I described how the UI was broken into two large chunks : the graphical circuit editor and the “ chrome ” .
Interfaces + caches = Cross Platform iCircuit is a mobile app that lets you experiment with circuits on your iOS devices .
Well , soon , it will also let you do it on your WinPhone7 .
My First MonoMac App - Spy Touch
The Mono team has recently given the world MonoMac , a framework that allows C# programmers to write native OS X ( Cocoa ) apps .
This is wonderful news for those who simultaneously love OS X and C# .
Jabroni , Jabroney , or Jaboney Long story short : Jabroni is the modern form of Jaboney , American slang used to mock someone , somewhat vaguely , since at least 1931 .
The online etymology dictionary defines a jaboney as a “ naive person , immigrant , hoodlum . ”
